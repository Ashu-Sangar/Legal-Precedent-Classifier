{"id": "1734078", "contents": "OPINION\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAfter a joint trial, appellants Robert Gartner and Randy Pfaff were convicted by a jury of murder of the second degree and aggravated assault. Post-verdict motions were denied and sentences covering both offenses were imposed. These appeals followed. We affirm appellant Pfaff\u2019s convictions for both murder and aggravated assault. We reverse appellant Gartner\u2019s conviction for murder and affirm his conviction for aggravated assault. Because we are unable to determine what part of the sentence imposed on appellant Gartner was for the conviction on aggravated assault, we remand for re-sentencing on that conviction.\nThe murder convictions will be considered in Part I of this opinion, the common claims of Gartner and Pfaff relating to the assault convictions in Part II, and additional claims made by Gartner relating to the assault conviction in Part III.\nThe trial court\u2019s opinion on post-verdict motions summarized the facts:\n\u201cAround 9:15 P.M. on December 1, 1973, a verbal confrontation took place between a group of teen-age blacks and two young white teen-agers and their dates at a public park in Meadville, known as Diamond Park. The black youths had arrived at the scene in a car operated by Otis Mack and its passengers were Marlon Matthews (the deceased victim) and Clifford McClure. The two white youths, D\u00e9lo and Perrine, sent their girl friends to a telephone to call additional help to the scene. The call was placed to the clubhouse of a local motorcycle club known as \u2018The Scorpions\u2019 and in short order Robert Gartner, Randy Pfaff and Larry Steele arrived in a car at the scene. The car was parked and as Gartner, Pfaff and Steele arrived, the confrontation had come to an end and the group of blacks was leaving in their car. Some words were exchanged between the three new arrivals and the departing blacks, and there was testimony that the departing car narrowly missed Gartner as he was standing near the edge of a street.\n\u201cAs the confrontation broke up, the departing remarks by both groups, while somewhat conflicting, clearly indicated that the whites were going to \u2018the (Scorpion) Clubhouse\u2019 and if the blacks wanted to continue the confrontation they could find the whites at the clubhouse. One witness testified that someone in the blacks\u2019 car said, \u2018We\u2019ll be there,\u2019 and Delo responded with, \u2018I\u2019ll bet you $20.00 you won\u2019t.\u2019\n\u201cIn short order, Delo, Perrine and their two dates went to the Scorpion Clubhouse (about two to three miles from Diamond Park) and were followed by Gartner, Pfaff, Steele, Dalton Smith and Dominic Mottillo.\n\u201cDalton Smith had been a late arrival at Diamond Park and attempted to ascertain what the trouble was about. He was told by Perrine that the blacks had been harassing them and following their car and were going to meet them at the clubhouse. Shortly, Gartner, Pfaff and Steele produced rifles from somewhere and set them in the corner of the clubhouse. The group sat around drinking beer for awhile. A short time later Gartner, Pfaff and Steele took their rifles and went outside the clubhouse. Gartner, armed with a loaded rifle, proceeded a short distance north of the clubhouse near some bushes where he had a clear view of the public highway and the driveway leading into the front of the clubhouse. The area was well lighted by an external building light and a street light. Pfaff, also armed with a rifle, proceeded to a location further from the highway and to the rear of the clubhouse and stationed himself on the hood of an abandoned car. The jury could easily have concluded that Gartner was to stand guard in the event of a \u2018frontal\u2019 attack or approach by the blacks and Pfaff was to guard against an attack from the \u2018rear.\u2019 The testimony is unclear as to where Steele was at the time of the shooting but he definitely left the clubhouse armed with a rifle at about the same time Gartner and Pfaff left.\n\u201cMeanwhile, while the whites had proceeded to the clubhouse, Mack, Matthews and McClure had proceeded to a local teen-age center, stayed about forty minutes and then went to a local tavern owned by the parents of their friend, Richard Stinson. There, after some delay, they picked up Richard Stinson, Albert Stinson, Odell Wynn and Robert Wofford.\n\u201cAfter some time spent at the tavern talking, having a soft drink and getting everyone into the car, Mack proceeded to drive back through the city of Meadville and then proceeded south toward the Scorpion Clubhouse. The testimony of the blacks was confusing as to the exact reason they were going to the clubhouse but the jury could have easily concluded that it was to continue in some way the verbal argument and name calling that started in the park.\n\u201cThe \u2018confrontation\u2019 at the Diamond Park ended about 9:30 P.M. and the testimony indicates that Mack and his black companions later arrived back at the Scorpion Clubhouse between 11:05 and 11:30 P.M.\n\u201cWhen Mack arrived, he pulled the front end of his car into the dirt driveway of the clubhouse and the undercarriage apparently \u2018hit bottom\u2019 and caused a loud thump. Someone from the clubhouse yelled, \u2018Hey, get out of here,\u2019 and Mack then backed the car out of the driveway and north on the paved road in preparation to proceed on south past the clubhouse. None of the blacks got out of the car and as the car was momentarily stopped on the paved road in preparation to proceed on south, Gartner fired a round from his position beside the road. Gartner was using a 7 mm bolt action Spanish rifle. As the car started to move south on the road, Gartner fired a second round. The first round was fired from a distance of about sixty-eight feet and the second from one hundred and forty-seven feet. The first round hit the undercarriage of the car, passed through three metal parts of the undercarriage, hit the frame and disintegrated. The second round was higher and hit the rear window molding, shattered the rear window and lodged in the head of a passenger, Marlon Matthews. Matthews died the next day. Two others were also injured by the second round, apparently from flying glass, bits of metal or small separate fragments of the second bullet that killed Matthews.\n\u201cAs the car sped down the road, Gartner, Pfaff and Steele came back to the clubhouse and in answer to inquiries as to who fired the shots, Gartner said he had. He told Dalton Smith he fired the shots but had a hard time seeing the front sights on his gun. Smith said someone asked Gartner if he hit the car and Gartner said no, he was too drunk and couldn\u2019t see the front sights.\n\u201cSoon Pfaff produced two blankets, the three guns were wrapped in the two blankets and Smith agreed to \u2018keep\u2019 the guns for them. Smith hid them in a cemetery but later surrendered them to the police and testified as a Commonwealth witness.\n\u201cThe Commonwealth\u2019s theory was that Gartner was the perpetrator of the crime but that Pfaff was equally guilty as an accomplice.\u201d\nI\nA.\nAppellant Gartner contends that he must be granted a new trial on the charge of murder because the trial court refused a request that the jury be instructed on involuntary manslaughter. We agree.\nThe trial court defined involuntary manslaughter in its charge, but instructed the jurors that they could not return a verdict of guilty to involuntary manslaughter because \u201cyou may not find a person guilty of a crime for which he is not charged under the circumstances in this case.\u201d This instruction was erroneous. In every prosecution for criminal homicide brought pursuant to the Crimes Code, a defendant upon request is entitled to a jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter. Commonwealth v. Smith, 474 Pa. 559, 379 A.2d 96 (1977); Commonwealth v. Garcia, 474 Pa. 449, 378 A.2d 1199 (1977) (plurality opinion). The rationale of this rule is that under the Crimes Code, involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder and thus is a permissible verdict when murder is charged. The court erred in its instruction because when an offense is a permissible verdict, the defendant is entitled to have the jury informed of its authority to return such a verdict. Commonwealth v. Covil, 474 Pa. 375 n. 6, 378 A.2d 841 n. 6 (1977) (voluntary manslaughter). Because the trial court instructed the jury that it could not return a verdict which under the Crimes Code it had the right to return, judgment of sentence on the conviction of murder of the second degree must be reversed and a new trial granted appellant Gartner.\nB.\nAppellant Pfaff, however, has not raised on this appeal the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter. The issue therefore is not before us on his appeal. We therefore must consider his contention that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. In Commonwealth v. Jones, 457 Pa. 563, 319 A.2d 142 (1974) (plurality opinion), this Court held that a defendant tried for murder is entitled upon request to an instruction informing the jury of its power to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter. Jones was decided on May 2, 1974; appellant Pfaff\u2019s trial began on February 13, 1974. Three members of this Court would apply Jones to all cases on direct appeal, including appellant Pfaff\u2019s. Commonwealth v. Cain, 471 Pa. 140, 171, 369 A.2d 1234, 1250 (1977) (Opinion in Support of Reversal of Roberts, J., joined by O\u2019Brien and Manderino, JJ.). Three members would apply Jones only to cases in which trial began after Jones was decided. Commonwealth v. Cain, supra, 471 Pa. at 145, 369 A.2d at 1236 (Opinion in Support of Affirmance of Eagen, J., joined by Jones, C. J., and Pomeroy, J.). The Court being equally divided, appellant Pfaff\u2019s conviction for murder of the second degree is affirmed.\nII\nOur disposition of the murder convictions rests upon grounds which do not affect the validity of the aggravated assault convictions. See Commonwealth v. Palmer, 467 Pa. 476, 482 n. 5, 359 A.2d 375, 378 n. 5 (1976). Therefore, we must consider appellants\u2019 contentions which do relate to those convictions. Appellants join in urging three assignments of error by the trial court: (1) refusal to declare a mistrial after an in-court outburst by the mother of the decedent, (2) denial of certain requests for disclosure of evidence known to the Commonwealth, and (3) allowing certain \u25a0 allegedly prejudicial evidence tags to be sent out with the jury. We find these contentions without merit.\nThe decedent\u2019s mother, Mrs. Hearn, was the Commonwealth\u2019s first witness. After completing her testimony, she took a seat in the front row of seats assigned to spectators. The trial court found that during the trial she exhibited \u201coccasional tears and eye drying\u201d and received \u201creassuring pats on the back and inaudible whispers from husband and friends.\u201d The trial court described the following events leading to the request for a mistrial:\n\u201cOn the fourth day of trial during the testimony of the ballistics expert, the hat Marlon Matthews was wearing when shot in the head (with bullet hole therein) was introduced into evidence and Mrs. Hearn emitted an audible sound and started to sob. The Court immediately suspended trial, ordered the jury promptly removed from the courtroom and had Mrs. Hearn, who was visibly shaken and sobbing, taken from the courtroom by her husband and friends. She collapsed outside the courtroom, beyond the sight of the jury, and was taken to the hospital by ambulance.\n\u201cThe jury box in the courthouse is so situated that when jurors are directing their attention to the witness stand, the bench and counsel tables, their backs are toward the audience and the seat occupied by Mrs. Hearn. While we believe that at least some of the jurors were aware of Mrs. Hearn\u2019s sobbing, most of the jurors were out of the courtroom as she was led sobbing out the door.\u201d\nAfter the recess, the trial court strongly instructed the jury that it must not allow itself to be influenced by sympathy for the family of the decedent. In light of the minimal exposure of the jury to the display of emotion and the trial court\u2019s vigorous corrective action, we cannot say that it was error to refuse appellants\u2019 motion for a mistrial on the basis of this incident. Cf. Commonwealth v. Martinolich, 456 Pa. 136, 148-50, 154, 157, 318 A.2d 680, 687-88, 690, 692 (1974).\nAppellants make two claims relating to failure of the Commonwealth to disclose information in its possession. First, they contend that the Commonwealth failed to comply with their timely requests for production of statements taken from its witnesses before trial, which appellants sought for use in cross-examination of those witnesses. Second, they assert that the trial court erred in failing to compel the Commonwealth to furnish the entire police investigatory file on the case for an in camera examination by the court to assure that all exculpatory material contained in the file was made available to appellants. We conclude that neither contention affords a basis for relief.\nThe Commonwealth called Otis Mack, Clifford McClure, and Odell Wynn as witnesses to the events leading to the death of Marlon Matthews. After each testified, appellants\u2019 counsel requested for use in cross-examination copies of any pre-trial statements which had been taken from those witnesses. The Commonwealth responded that no such statements had been reduced to writing, but that Trooper Bey, the officer who had interviewed the witnesses, would testify later in the trial, at which time appellants\u2019 counsel could question him regarding the witnesses\u2019 oral statements. On the evening before the last day of trial, appellants\u2019 counsel interviewed Trooper Bey at some length and Bey informed them of the existence of notes he made of his interviews with the witnesses. The notes revealed certain discrepancies between the witnesses\u2019 testimony at trial and their interviews with Bey, principally regarding the time of the incident at Diamond Park.\nWhere the Commonwealth has in its possession pretrial statements of its witnesses which have been reduced to writing and relate to the witnesses\u2019 testimony, it must, if requested, furnish copies of those statements to the defense at the close of each witness\u2019s direct examination. Commonwealth v. Smith, 417 Pa. 321, 208 A.2d 219 (1965) (written statement); Commonwealth v. Kontos, 442 Pa. 343, 276 A.2d 830 (1971) (same); Commonwealth v. Morris, 444 Pa. 364, 281 A.2d 851 (1971) (police officer\u2019s verbatim notes); Commonwealth v. Kubacki, 208 Pa.Super. 523, 224 A.2d 80 (1966) (transcript of tape-recorded interview); Commonwealth v. Swierczewski, 215 Pa.Super. 130, 257 A.2d 336 (1969) (portions of police officer\u2019s report made from statements of other officers sought for use in cross-examination of the officers with respect to search and arrest of defendants must be disclosed); accord, Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957) (same rule established for federal proceedings).\nAt trial, the Commonwealth apparently believed that Trooper Bey\u2019s notes of the witnesses\u2019 oral statements did not fall within the Smith rule. We need not decide whether this belief was mistaken, for appellants were in no way prejudiced by the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to produce the notes when first requested. The notes were supplied to appellants\u2019 counsel before the end of trial. Appellants, if they desired, were able to present to the jury any discrepancies between the notes and the earlier witness trial testimony during their cross-examination of Trooper Bey. Moreover, the record reveals that appellants were free to recall Mack, McClure and Wynn for further cross-examination based on the information disclosed in the notes, but chose not to do so. Appellants\u2019 claim that they were prejudiced by the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to produce the notes when first requested, in these circumstances, is specious.\nAppellants claim the court erred in denying their request that it conduct an in camera inspection of the police investigatory file. Before cross-examination of the final witness for the Commonwealth, appellants moved for disclosure of all exculpatory material in the possession of the Commonwealth as required by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The prosecutor responded that all such exculpatory material had already been furnished. Appellants then moved that the entire investigatory file be produced for inspection by the court. This motion was denied.\nA defendant is entitled to a court inspection of the Commonwealth\u2019s investigatory files only when there exists at least some reason to believe the inspection would lead to the discovery of evidence helpful to the defense. See Commonwealth v. Royster, 472 Pa. 581, 372 A.2d 1194 (1977) (plurality opinion). Here, appellants made no showing that the court\u2019s inspection would reveal evidence helpful to the defense. The court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 request was proper. See United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 106, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2399, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).\nThe last objection urged by both appellants is that they were prejudiced by exhibits bearing police evidence tags marked \u201cMatthews Murder Case\u201d which were permitted to be taken out with the jury. No objection was interposed when the exhibits were introduced, but appellants did object to allowing these tags to go out with the jury. Although it would have been better practice to delete these words from the tags before the exhibits were admitted, the jury had already seen the tags when the exhibits were introduced and they were surely well aware that the case involved a charge of murder. Consequently, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to alter the evidence tags when the jury retired to deliberate.\nIll\nAppellant Gartner claims that the trial was tainted by prejudicial pre-trial publicity, that opinion testimony was admitted without establishment of the witness\u2019s qualifications as an expert, that the jury was erroneously instructed in several particulars, and that the trial court coerced the jury to return a verdict. We find no merit in these contentions.\nSeveral of these claims have been waived. Appellant never sought any relief from the trial court to minimize or eliminate any prejudicial effect from pre-trial publicity. Indeed, appellant opposed the change of venue sought by his co-defendant Pfaff. Similarly, when the Commonwealth began to develop the expert\u2019s credentials, Pfaff offered to stipulate to his expertise. The Commonwealth then proceeded to examine the witness without further effort to establish his qualifications as an expert. Appellant Gartner failed to object at trial to this examination, raising the issue for the first time on post-verdict motions. Consequently, these claims may not be raised on appeal. Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 457 Pa. 554, 559 n. 5, 327 A.2d 632, 635 n. 5 (1974); Commonwealth v. Agie, 449 Pa. 187, 296 A.2d 741 (1972).\nAppellant presents three claims of error in the court\u2019s charge: (1) refusal to charge that intoxication could negate the mental state required for aggravated assault, (2) failure to charge specifically that prior inconsistent statements by the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses might be considered to impeach the credibility of those witnesses, and (3) failure properly to instruct the jury on reasonable doubt. Appellant did not object at trial to the failure to charge on intoxication. Rule 1119(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, \u201cNo portions of the charge nor omissions therefrom may be assigned as error, unless specific objections are made thereto before the jury retires to deliberate.\u201d Consequently, this assignment of error may not be considered on appeal. Commonwealth v. Clair, supra; Commonwealth v. Johnson, supra.\nAppellant next argues that the trial court failed to charge the jury specifically that prior inconsistent statements of the witnesses might be considered to impeach their credibility. However, the court did charge as follows:\n\u201c[Y]ou are the sole judges of the credibility of witnesses. . [W]e have found no better way to get to the truth than to take twelve people . . . and put them in the calm atmosphere of a courtroom and listen to witnesses testify . . . and then apply their knowledge of human nature and human beings to determine whether that witness is telling the truth, is telling a falsehood or perhaps a little of either. .\nSo it is for you to consider these things:\n\u201c. . . Statements made at a prior time.\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nWe believe that the jury would clearly understand from this charge that prior inconsistent statements might be considered to impeach the credibility of the witnesses. Reading the charges as a whole, as we must, Commonwealth v. Rodgers, 459 Pa. 129, 327 A.2d 118 (1974), we find no error in the court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s requested point.\nThe last of appellant\u2019s contentions relating to the jury instructions concerns the charge on what constitutes a reasonable doubt. The pertinent portion of the charge was:\n\u201cNow although the Commonwealth has this heavy burden of proving that the defendant is guilty, this does not mean that the Commonwealth must prove its case beyond all doubt and to a mathematical certainty or must the Commonwealth demonstrate the complete impossibility of innocence. A reasonable doubt is one that would arise and cause a reasonably careful and sensitive person such as yourself to hesitate before acting upon a matter of importance in your own affairs.\u201d\nAppellant contends that the last sentence should have referred to \u201ca matter of the highest importance.\u201d However, we have specifically approved charges in virtually the exact words used by the trial court here. E. g., Commonwealth v. Young, 456 Pa. 102, 317 A.2d 258 (1974); Commonwealth v. Donough, 377 Pa. 46, 51, 103 A.2d 694, 697 (1954).\nAppellant\u2019s final contention is that the court improperly exerted pressure on the jury to reach a verdict. Jury selection began on Monday, February 11, 1974. The jury was sworn on February 13 and heard evidence on that day and the two succeeding days. The jurors were not sequestered during trial and were free during the weekend of February 16-17. On February 18, the jury heard closing argument and retired to deliberate at 2:55 P.M. At 5:15 P.M., the jury returned to receive additional instructions they had requested. At this time the jurors were informed that the tipstaffs would arrange to take them to dinner whenever they wished. At-12:20 A.M., on February 19, the trial court recalled the jury to the courtroom and addressed them:\n\u201cWell, members of the jury, I don\u2019t know how you stand and I don\u2019t want to know how you stand. But let me say that you should not be upset or angry at yourself or at each other because you have not promptly reached a verdict. You are, of course, not the first jury that has taken a length of time to reach a decision, so don\u2019t let that bother you.\n\u201cLet me say a few other things to you; that if you don\u2019t reach a decision in this case, the case will have to be tried over again at the next Term of Court. And this, of course, would entail inconvenience for the Commonwealth and the defendants, some modest added expense to the County. But more important than that, I have no reason to believe that if we spent another two or two and a half days picking another twelve people that we would find twelve that were any better or any better able to hear the testimony and analyze it and reach a verdict than the twelve we have right now.\u201d\nThe court then urged the jury, along the lines recommended by the ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Trial by Jury \u00a7 5.4(a) (Approved Draft, 1968), to attempt to reach a verdict and addressed the problem created by the lateness of the hour:\n\u201cMr. Foreman, I\u2019m going to ask that this jury continue deliberations, but I\u2019ll give you and the jurors the option. We do have some reasonably comfortable cots and sheets and blankets and pillows up there. And while it\u2019s not like the Hilton Hotel, still we can set up some cots in one section for the ladies and in the three jury rooms for the men or however the tipstaff wishes to conveniently arrange it so that you can get some rest if you so desire. And you have the Court\u2019s permission, Mr. Foreman, with the consent of the other jurors, to cease your deliberations at any time that you desire and rest and bed down in the best comfort we can give you under our limited circumstances here for the night, and have a breakfast in the morning as guests of the County and start your deliberations at whatever time you find convenient in the morning.\n\u201cNow to emphasize again, I leave that entirely to your discretion as to whether you wish to continue your deliberations this evening or whether you wish to break off your deliberations, remaining together, however, and if telephone calls are necessary to your homes, the tipstaffs will take care of that for you to send any messages you need. If you need to talk personally with some member of the family, you may do so, but of course, we must have a tipstaff with you and the caution is that you may not tell them anything about the case or how you stand or anything. But if there are personal messages that must be conveyed and instructions given as to what has to be done in your absence, we will permit you to make those calls in the presence of a tipstaff.\u201d\nThe foreman of the jury indicated that the jurors would prefer to continue deliberating and the jury again retired to deliberate at 12:30 A.M. At 2:55 A.M., the jury returned with its verdict.\nAppellant contends that the court\u2019s instructions, combined with the failure to secure adequate hotel or motel facilities for the jury were coercive, especially in light of the jurors\u2019 lack of sleepwear, toiletries, and fresh clothing. We find no basis for concluding that the verdict was a product of coercion.\nThe court could properly draw the jurors\u2019 attention to their duty to \u201cconsult with one another and to deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement, if it can be done without violence to individual judgment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 5.4(a)(ii); see note 9 supra. In this context, it was not reversible error to refer briefly to the inconvenience of a retrial which would be necessitated by failure to obtain a verdict.\nAlthough the facilities available overnight to the jurors were not luxurious, it appears they were adequate, especially in view of the unexpected length of the deliberations. The court offered the jurors the opportunity to suspend their deliberations in order to rest for the night, but they apparently preferred to attempt a speedy resolution of the case.\nWe conclude that this situation falls within the rule that \u201c \u2018[t]he length of the deliberation of a jury is wisely left to the sound discretion of the trial Judge, and we reverse only if we find . . . abuse of discretion, or that the verdict was the product of coercion or of an overworked and fatigued jury.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Ford, 451 Pa. 81, 85, 301 A.2d 856, 858 (1973), quoting Commonwealth v. Campbell, 445 Pa. 488, 495-96, 284 A.2d 798, 801 (1971); Commonwealth v. Clark, 404 Pa. 143, 146, 170 A.2d 847, 848 (1961). We cannot make such a finding here.\nJudgment of sentence of appellant Gartner for murder of the second degree reversed and a new trial granted. Judgment of sentence of appellant Gartner for aggravated assault vacated and remanded for resentencing.\nJudgments of sentence of appellant Pfaff for murder of the second degree and aggravated assault affirmed.\nJONES, former C. J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nNIX, J., filed a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nEAGEN, C. J., would also affirm the judgment of sentence imposed on Gartner\u2019s murder conviction.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(b) (1974).\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2702(a)(4) (1974).\n. Gartner was sentenced to imprisonment for five to twelve years and Pfaff was sentenced to imprisonment for thirty months to six years. In addition, each was sentenced to pay the costs of prosecution and to make restitution to the family of the deceased and to the other victims for one-half of the hospital, medical and funeral expenses incurred as a result of the crime.\n. This Court has jurisdiction over the appeals from the murder convictions pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1977). Because the Commonwealth has not objected to consideration of the appeals from the aggravated assault convictions by this Court,, our jurisdiction over those appeals is perfected. Id. \u00a7 503(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.503(a); Pa.R.A.P. 741(a).\n. \u201cNeither Gartner nor Pfaff testified and the defense presented no evidence.\u201d [footnote in original renumbered]\n. Appellant Gartner raises other objections to the instructions on murder. He contends (1) that the examples given by the court of the various types of criminal homicide were prejudicial and (2) that the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury as requested on voluntary manslaughter. In view of our disposition of the murder conviction, we need not pass on these assignments of error.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq. (1973). Section 2501 of 18 Pa.C.S.A. provides:\n\u201c(a) Offense defined. \u2014 A person is guilty of criminal homicide if he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of another human being.\n(b) Classification. \u2014 Criminal homicide shall be classified as murder, voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter.\u201d\n. Mack and McClure both testified that the Diamond Park incident had occurred shortly after 9:00 P.M., whereas their statements to Trooper Bey had indicated that it occurred at about 4:30 P.M.\n. In Pfaff s brief, it is argued that \u201cDuring trial it was discovered that the deceased might have been using marijuana, that one or two of the witnesses had been threatened, that several of the prosecution witnesses had been less than candid about their activities the night of the killing, and many more might have been discovered had counsel been permitted to see the police report.\u201d We fail to see any connection between the possibility that the decedent might have smoked marijuana and the likelihood that the file might contain undisclosed exculpatory evidence. Nor, in light of the fact that only a few persons, all of them known to appellants, had knowledge of the events surrounding the killing, do we find that some of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses had been threatened indicates any likelihood that the investigatory file would contain exculpatory evidence. All that remains is counsel\u2019s bald speculation that such might be the case.\n. That section reads:\n\u201cLength of deliberations; deadlocked jury.\n(a) Before the jury retires for deliberation, the court may give an instruction which informs the jury:\n(i) that in order to return a verdict, each juror must agree thereto;\n(ii) that jurors have a duty to consult with one another and to deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement, if it can be done without violence to individual judgment;\n(iii) that each juror must decide the case for himself, but only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with his fellow jurors;\n(iv) that in the course of deliberation, a juror should not hesitate to reexamine his own views and change his opinion if convinced it is erroneous; and\n(v) that no juror should surrender his honest conviction as to the weight or effect of the evidence solely because of the opinion of his fellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.\u201d\nThis Court has specifically approved the guidelines set out in this section in Commonwealth v. Spencer, 442 Pa. 328, 337, 275 A.2d 299, 304 (1971), and Commonwealth v. Lambert, 450 Pa. 130, 133, 299 A.2d 240, 241 (1973), for use in cases involving deadlocked juries. As we said in Lambert:\n\u201cThe appellant\u2019s contention that the charge given in the instant case had the same coercive impact as the now discredited Allen charge, see Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896), is meritless. Whereas the Allen charge specifically directed minority jurors to listen with deference to the majority position, the charge set out in Section 5.4(a) of the Minimum Standards and given in this case charges that all jurors \u2018have a duty to consult with one another . . .\n450 Pa. at 133, 299 A.2d at 241-42."}
