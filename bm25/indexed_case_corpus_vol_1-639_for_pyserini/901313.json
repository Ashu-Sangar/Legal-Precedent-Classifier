{"id": "901313", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nThis appeal by the plaintiffs was argued with No. 345, January term, 1897, between the same parties, in which the defendants were appellants. In that case an opinion has just been filed affirming the decree.\nWe are not convinced that there is anything in either of the appellants\u2019 specifications of error in this case that require either a reversal or modification of the decree; nor do we think there is anything in either of the questions involved that requires discussion.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellants\u2019 costs."}
