{"id": "1216490", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis is a suit in trespass for damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff while a passenger on defendant\u2019s railroad. The case was tried, the jury disagreed, and the learned court below refused to enter judgment for defendant upon the whole record. This appeal followed.\nWe are convinced that it was necessary to submit the case to the jury, and that therefore it was proper to refuse defendant\u2019s motion.\nOrder affirmed."}
