{"id": "1216488", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThe plaintiff appeals from a decree dismissing its bill for an accounting. It is a corporation organized under the Federal Farm Credit Act of 1933, engaged in lending money to farmers on chattel mortgage security. Defendant is engaged in the wholesale fruit and produce business in Philadelphia under license from the federal Department of Agriculture. Beginning May 10, 1939, and on various dates until September 26,1939, the plaintiff loaned money to Bose Valley Fruit Farms, Incorporated, a Pennsylvania corporation, owning and operating a fruit farm at Trout Bun, Lycoming County, Pa. As security, the borrower delivered to the plaintiff a chattel mortgage of \u201c. . . all crops, annual or perennial, including fruit crops, growing or to be grown, either already planted or to be planted, and/or maturing within one year from date on . . certain described land and also certain livestock and equipment. The mortgage was recorded in the proper office in LycomingCounty May 22, 1939. On various dates between September 11, 1939, and November 30, 1939, the borrower paid the loan of May 10, 1939. All the loans matured November 15, 1939. The borrower defaulted on all except the first, whereupon judgment against it was entered in Lycoming County March 29, 1940, and damages assessed at $11,229.71. After the mortgage was given, the mortgagor made various shipments to defendant of apples grown on the farm, to be sold by him as commission broker; defendant, after selling them,deducted the usual commissions payable in such circumstances and remitted the proceeds to Rose Valley Farms.\nThe theory of the bill seems to be that defendant, having constructive notice by the record of the mortgage, was guilty of conversion; that as he was possessed of complete information concerning the proceeds received for the apples and as plaintiff was not advised thereof, plaintiff was entitled to an accounting and payment. Defendant answered that he disposed of the apples as a commission broker and accounted to'Rose Valley Fruit Farms, Incorporated, for the net proceeds. After trial on the merits, the learned chancellor found that as early as June 12, 1939, the plaintiff knew of defendant\u2019s transactions with Rose Valley and \u201c. ; . tacitly agreed and consented thereto . . .\u201d and not only made no objection but, as the crop was perishable, desired the apples sold. Plaintiff made no demand on defendant until February 3, 1940. Thereafter, defendant, pursuant to the demand, accounted to the plaintiff for the balance subsequently accruing. Other findings were; \u201cThe plaintiff at all times knew, acquiesced in and consented to the sale of said apples by Rose Valley through the defendant.\u201d \u201cThe defendant throughout acted as commission broker for Rose Valley in entire good faith, and has fully accounted to it for all moneys received by him from the sale of said apples, except such as were received after being notified of plaintiff\u2019s claim thereto, and after the mortgagor had disappeared without repaying plaintiff\u2019s loan, which latter receipts were remitted by the defendant directly to the plaintiff.\u201d Defendant had no actual knowledge of the existence of plaintiff\u2019s chattel mortgage.\nThe Act providing for such mortgages was approved March 2, 1933, P. L. 6, and amended April 18, 1935, P. L. 38, and July 24, 1941, P. L. 439, 21 PS Supp. 931-35. The first question is whether, in such circumstances, defendant broker is within its terms. Section 1 provides \u201cSuch mortgage shall be a lien against the chattels and crops thereby conveyed, and shall be good and available in law against any subsequent purchasers or execution creditors upon the recording thereof . . .\u201d The learned chancellor was of opinion that by specifying subsequent purchasers and execution creditors the legislature intended to exclude all others; that, accordingly, the commission broker was not within its terms, and supported his conclusion by reference to cases of other jurisdictions construing similar statutes to the same general effect.\nTo the conclusion that a commission broker is neither a purchaser .nor an execution creditor as those words are used in the statute, the appellant replies by referring to cases stating that a broker, making a sale on behalf of and accounting to the chattel mortgagor, acts as the mortgagor\u2019s agent, and thereby becomes liable to the mortgagee. The difficulty with that argument, as applied to this record, is that the facts found take the case out of the application of the principle relied on. As has appeared, plaintiff waived its rights and assented to the course of business pursued. As early as June 12, 1939, the plaintiff was advised of sales. The bill avers that five loans were made after June 12, 1939, the date of plaintiff\u2019s knowledge. The testimony supports the finding of waiver.\nThere is a suggestion in appellant\u2019s argument that in any view it is entitled to an accounting even though nothing should be found owing; that the bill is \u00e1 \u201cfirst step in impressing a lien upon the proceeds.\u201d No facts have been shown to justify such a decree. By the waiver he lost the lien on the apples as well as the claim on the proceeds paid to the mortgagor. Plaintiff alleges no error in the accounting for the net proceeds paid to it after receiving its notice of February 3,1940.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.\nSee Karns v.
