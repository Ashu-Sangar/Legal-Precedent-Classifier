See In re Bruno, 627 Pa. 505, 101 A.3d 635, 686 (2014) (\u201c[t]he constitutional powers of the Supreme Court and the [Court of Judicial Discipline], and the legal predicates for their respective actions, are distinct and may comfortably operate separately\u201d).\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a dissenting statement.\nJustice STEVENS dissents, as he would not vacate the February 1,2013 order."}
