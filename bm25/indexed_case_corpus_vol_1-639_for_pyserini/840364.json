{"id": "840364", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Paxson,\nThis was an appeal from the decree of the court below refusing to continue a preliminary injunction, and in dissolving the same.\nWe will not, under our rule, discuss the merits. It is sufficient to say that under the circumstances we think it was er ror to dissolve the injunction. It should stand until final hearing.\nThe decree is reversed at the costs of the appellee, and it is ordered that the injunction be reinstated until final hearing."}
