{"id": "1738267", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nThis appeal is from an order of the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, denying relief on a Post Conviction Hearing Act petition filed by appellant, Joseph Frank Mitchell.\nAppellant was convicted by a jury of murder of the first degree for the 1966 slaying of Doris Shenk. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. On direct appeal, we affirmed the judgment of sentence. Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 445 Pa. 461, 285 A.2d 93 (1971).\nIn June of 1975, appellant filed a pro se Post Conviction Hearing Act petition. Counsel was appointed, and in November, 1975, an amended petition was filed. Following a March, 1976 hearing, the court below denied appellant\u2019s petition in June, 1976. This appeal followed.\nAppellant first claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel for a number of reasons. In Com. ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604-05, 235 A.2d 349, 352 (1967), we stated:\n\u201c . . . our inquiry ceases and counsel\u2019s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests. The test is not whether other alternatives were more reasonable, employing a hindsight evaluation of the record. Although weigh the alternatives we must, the balance tips in favor of a finding of effective assistance as soon as it is determined that trial counsel\u2019s decisions had any reasonable basis.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\nWe have also held that counsel is not ineffective for failing to raise baseless or frivolous issues. Commonwealth v. Rice, 456 Pa. 90, 318 A.2d 705 (1974). With this standard in mind, we will discuss appellant\u2019s claims concerning his trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness.\nAppellant first claims that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to file a suppression motion related to his confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest. We do not agree.\nThe facts as found at the suppression hearing are as follows. The victim\u2019s nude body was discovered in a vacant house on East Boston Street on October 15, 1966. Police suspected that the victim may also have been sexually assaulted. During their investigation, the police found out that the victim had been seen alive on Thursday evening, October 13, with appellant and four other people. After interviewing some of these witnesses, police discovered that the victim was last seen drinking wine with appellant and Thomas Burns, walking in the direction of East Boston Street. Police were sent out at approximately 10:00 p. m. on October 15 to ask both appellant and Burns to go to the police station for questioning.\nDetective James Melley was sent to find appellant while other officers picked up Thomas Burns for questioning. In a statement given between 11:20 p. m. and midnight, Bums told police he had left appellant and the victim alone in the house where the victim\u2019s body was discovered. Detective Melley, however, was not informed of Burns\u2019 statement before picking up appellant. After going to the home of appellant\u2019s parents, Melley learned that appellant was visiting friends in Aston, Pennsylvania, approximately one hour from Philadelphia. Melley and two other officers drove to Aston, where they met the Aston Township police chief, who went with the Philadelphia officers to the house where appellant was visiting. The officers arrived shortly before midnight. Appellant was asked to return to Philadelphia to discuss his drinking with Ms. Shenk. Appellant was neither informed of his constitutional rights nor told that police wanted to question him about a homicide. Appellant was not told that he was under arrest. He arrived at the Police Administration Building at approximately 1:00 a. m. on October 16. After .being placed in an interrogation room and advised of his constitutional rights, appellant gave an inculpatory statement within fifteen minutes of the commencement of questioning.\nAppellant argues that he was arrested and that his arrest was illegal since it was made without probable cause. Further, appellant argues that his confession was a \u201cfruit of the illegal arrest.\u201d Appellant thus believes that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to advance this theory in his motion to suppress the confession. We disagree, because we believe that if appellant was arrested, the arrest was based on probable cause, thus negating appellant\u2019s fruit of the poisonous tree argument.\nIn Commonwealth v. Dickerson, 468 Pa. 599, 364 A.2d 677, 680-81 (1976), we stated:\n\u201cProbable cause has been defined as those facts and circumstances available at the time of the arrest which would justify a reasonably prudent man in the belief that a crime has been committed and that the individual arrested was the probable perpetrator. . . . The test is not one of certainties but rather one of probabilities dealing with the considerations of everyday life. It is not equivalent to the \u2018proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 standard applied at trial. . . . Necessarily the test for probable cause is the same whether or not a warrant is present, since an arresting officer must be aware of information sufficient for the issuance of a warrant at the moment he makes an arrest.\u201d (Citations omitted.) (Emphasis added.)\nAt the time Detective Melley was sent to find appellant, he or his superior officer knew that a thorough police investigation had revealed that the victim was last seen alive with appellant and Burns. The trio was last seen drinking wine walking towards East Boston Street. The victim\u2019s body was discovered in a vacant house on East Boston Street with alcohol in her blood. The police further suspected that the victim had been sexually assaulted. As probable cause requires only probabilities and not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, we believe Detective Melley could have effectuated a valid warrantless arrest in Aston. Since we find a legal arrest, appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness of counsel claim is without merit.\nAppellant next claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to attempt to have his confession suppressed as the product of illegally seized evidence. We disagree.\nThe facts are as follows. While Detective Melley went to pick up appellant and return with him to Philadelphia, another set of detectives obtained a search warrant for appellant\u2019s residence. During the search officers seized a pair of appellant\u2019s undershorts. Appellant claims that during his interrogation, he was confronted with these shorts and confessed for this reason.\nTestimony was given by a Commonwealth witness, however, that appellant was never confronted with the shorts seized at his residence; rather, appellant\u2019s confession was based on a desire to clear his conscience. Appellant\u2019s claim is thus based on his credibility. In light of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence to the contrary, and this court\u2019s scope of review, it was reasonable to not pursue appellant\u2019s theory at the suppression hearing. Trial counsel was not ineffective on this theory.\nAppellant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to attempt to suppress a pair of undershorts. Appellant claims that the shorts were those seized during the illegal search of his residence and thus suppressible. The record indicates, however, that these shorts were never introduced into evidence. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue a frivolous issue. Commonwealth v. Rice, supra.\nAppellant raises numerous other issues concerning effectiveness of trial counsel. These points were not raised in the counseled amended Post Conviction Hearing Act petition. Appellant raised these specific issues for the first time in his brief which was submitted after the post conviction hearing. We believe these claims are waived, because appellant, by waiting until after the hearing, denied the Commonwealth an opportunity to defend against assertions raised at such a late date. We thus refuse to consider anything not raised in a counseled petition. See Pa.R. Crim.P. 1506(4).\nAppellant finally contends that he is entitled to retroactive application of our decision in Commonwealth v. Rose, 457 Pa. 380, 321 A.2d 880 (1974), where we held it was error to charge the jury that a defendant had to prove certain defenses by a preponderance of the evidence. Appellant\u2019s claim, however, is meritless. In its charge to the jury, the court stated:\n\u201cNow, the defendant comes before you, as you have heard it said before, which is true, presumed to be innocent of the crimes with which he is charged. The fact that he has been indicted for these crimes is no evidence of his guilt. This means that the law doesn\u2019t place upon him, the defendant, the burden of proving that he is innocent of the crimes with which he has been charged or for which he is standing trial. On the contrary, the law places on the Commonwealth the burden of proving that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nAppellant raised two defenses at trial \u2014 his own intoxication and the bad reputation of the victim. When discussing these defenses, the trial court never placed any burden of proof on appellant. The court\u2019s charge thus complied with Rose, even though appellant\u2019s trial predated that decision by six years.\nOrder affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nNIX, J., dissents.\n. As in appellant\u2019s direct appeal, we need not decide whether appellant was arrested at the Aston residence, because that question is irrelevant to the disposition of this appeal.\n. See Commonwealth v. Rush, 459 Pa. 23, 326 A.2d 340 (1974); Commonwealth v. Lassiter, 457 Pa. 582, 321 A.2d 902 (1974).\n. In Commonwealth v. Riggins, 451 Pa. 519, 522, 304 A.2d 473, 474 (1973), we stated our scope of review in determining the correctness of a suppression court\u2019s order:\n\u201c \u2018Our task on review, . . . [of a suppression hearing] is to consider only \u201cthe evidence of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and so much of the evidence for the defense as, fairly read in the context of the record as a whole, remains uncontradicted.\u201d Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. [568] supra at 604 [, 81 S.Ct. 1860 at 1880, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037].\u2019 Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, 429 Pa. 141, 149-50, 239 A.2d 426, 430 (1968).\u201d\nSee also Commonwealth v. Kichline, 468 Pa. 265, 280, 361 A.2d 282, 290 (1976).\n. At the time of appellant\u2019s trial, the bad reputation of a victim plus consent on her part was a defense to statutory rape."}
