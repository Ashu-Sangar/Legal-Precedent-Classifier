{"id": "1740523", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nAppellant, after waiving a jury trial, was tried in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, and was found guilty of murder in the third degree and possession of an instrument of crime. Post-verdict motions were heard and denied and appellant was sentenced. In appealing the trial court\u2019s judgment of murder in the third degree, appellant seeks a new trial.\nAppellant raises two issues in this appeal: 1) that the trial court erred in not disregarding the testimony of two of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses who, appellant claims, were incapable of accurately observing the crime in question; and 2) that the trial court erred in not requiring the Commonwealth to introduce appellant\u2019s confession at trial. Appellant\u2019s first contention is without merit and appellant\u2019s second contention has been waived because the issue was not raised at trial.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed."}
