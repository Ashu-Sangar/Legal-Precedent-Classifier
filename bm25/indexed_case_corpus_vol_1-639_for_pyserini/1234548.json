{"id": "1234548", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nMargaret Mary Thomas was injured when she slipped on a banana peel on a sidewalk in front of defendants\u2019 property. The accident occurred on December 8, 1947, and on March 5, 1948, the middle finger of her left hand was amputated, allegedly as a result of the fall. The jury returned a verdict for defendants and plaintiffs have appealed from the order of the court below denying their motion for a new trial.\nThree questions were raised in this appeal, two of which are concerned with the issue of damages. In view of the verdict that defendants- were not negligent, these two questions are irrelevant and need not be considered here-. Plaintiffs\u2019 last- contention is that the trial judge failed to define legal cause in Ms charge to the jury. This is refuted by an examination of the record. In at least three places in his charge, the trial judge correctly and properly discussed causation in terms that the jury could readily understand. Anything further that he might have said would not have assisted the jury in its determination of the case.\nOn the record in this case, the jury\u2019s verdict was justified. There being no error of law in the trial of the case, the motion for a new trial was properly denied.\nOrder affirmed."}
