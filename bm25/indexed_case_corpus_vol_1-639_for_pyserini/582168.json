{"id": "582168", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Eobeets,\nThe prosecution of Phillip Pope for violation of the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act raises the narrow questions (1) whether the unlicensed carrying in Philadelphia of a rifle with a 22-inch barrel constitutes a violation of the Act, and (2) if it does, whether appellee was properly indicted for this offense. The trial court construed section 4628(e.2) of the Uniform Firearms Act as proscribing only the carrying of rifles with barrels measuring less than 15 inches, and sustained Pope\u2019s demurrer. On appeal, an equally-divided Superior Court affirmed. This Court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal. We now reverse.\nI.\nThe statute under which appellee was indicted, a 1968 amendment to the 1939 Uniform Firearms Act, provides: \u201cNo person shall carry a firearm, rifle or shotgun at any time upon the public streets or upon any public property in a city of the first class . . . .\u201d The prosecution\u2019s evidence shows that appellee was openly carrying a rifle with a 22-inch barrel on the public streets of Philadelphia, a city of the first class.\nIn the 1939 Uniform Firearms Act, the General Assembly declared criminal the concealed carrying of \u201cfirearms.\u201d A \u201cfirearm\u201d is statutorily defined as \u201cany pistol or revolver with a barrel less than twelve inches, any shotgun with a barrel less than twenty-four inches, or any rifle with a barrel less than fifteen inches. The carrying of a firearm \u201cin any vehicle or concealed on or about [one\u2019s] person, except in [one\u2019s] place of abode or fixed place of business, without a license therefor\u201d is prohibited.\nIn 1968, the General Assembly created two new crimes involving the carrying of weapons. It proscribed both the open and concealed carrying of all firearms, rifles, or shotguns during \u201can emergency proclaimed by a municipal or state governmental executive\u201d anywhere in the Commonwealth or \u201cat any time upon the public streets or upon any public property in a city of the first class.\u201d It was for this latter crime that appellee was prosecuted.\nThe trial court correctly recognized that the open carrying of certain weapons was prohibited in Philadelphia. However, it read the 1968 amendment as affecting only the requirement that the weapon be concealed. In its view, the 1968 amendment did not change the type of weapon the carrying of which is prohibited. Bather the court construed the Act as proscribing the open carrying of only \u201cfirearms,\u201d as defined in the 1939 Act, and attached no significance to the words \u201crifle\u201d and \u201cshotgun\u201d in the 1968 amendment.\nWe disagree. Our reading of the statute convinces us that the General Assembly altered more than the requirement of concealment in two situations. The express language of the statute shows that the 1968 amendment made criminal, in two particular instances, the carrying of not only all firearms (as that word is statutorily defined) but also all other rifles and shotguns. If the Legislature intended to proscribe overt carrying of only \u201cfirearms,\u201d it would not have also included the words \u201crifle\u201d and \u201cshotgun\u201d in the 1968 amendment. As evidenced by its explicit language, the clear intendment of the 1968 amendment is that in described circumstances the carrying of any firearm, any shotgun, or any rifle, constitutes a criminal act.\nPhillip Pope concedes that he was carrying a \u201crifle\u201d upon the streets of Philadelphia, a city of the first class. Thus his conduct was squarely in violation of the Act.\nA court may not alter, under the guise of \u201cconstruction,\u201d the express language and intent of the Legislature. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Rieck Investment Corp., 419 Pa. 52, 213 A.2d 277 (1965); Calvert Dis tillers Corp. v. Board of Finance & Revenue, 376 Pa. 476, 103 A.2d 668 (1954); Commonwealth v. One 1939 Cadillac Sedan, 158 Pa. Superior Ct. 392, 45 A.2d 406 (1946). While it is true that penal statutes must be strictly construed, 1 Pa.S. \u00a7 1928(b)(1) (Special Pamphlet 1973), the principle of strict construction does not permit a court to delete a clear and specific crime from the criminal code. A statute must be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions, making the entire statute effective and certain. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1921(a), 1922(2); see Lynch v. Owen J. Roberts School District, 430 Pa. 461, 244 A.2d 1 (1968); Whitemarsh Township Authority v. Elwert, 413 Pa. 329, 196 A.2d 843 (1964); Sherwood v. Elgart, 383 Pa. 110, 117 A.2d 899 (1955).\nThe trial court\u2019s reading of the statute is too narrow and impermissibly renders the words \u201crifle\u201d and \u201cshotgun\u201d in the 1968 amendment superfluous, discounting them to the point of extinction. Its holding that the unlicensed carrying of a rifle with a 22-inch barrel is not a crime conflicts with the express language of the statute and is error.\nII.\nHaving determined that appellee\u2019s conduct falls within the statutory prohibition, we must now address Ms asserted alternate ground for relief. Specifically, it must be determined whether the indictment charges the offense the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence establishes. We believe it does.\nThe indictment returned by the grand jury charges: \u201cThat . . . Phillip Pope did unlawfully carry a firearm, to wit, a rifle, without a license therefor as required by law . . . .\u201d\nAppellee argues in the alternative that the indictment accuses him of carrying a \u201cfirearm,\u201d i.e., a rifle with a barrel less than 1-5 inches. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence shows that appellee was carrying a rifle with a 22-inch barrel, which he contends is not a \u201cfirearm.\u201d Therefore, in appellee\u2019s view, a fatal variance between the indictment (\u201cfirearm\u201d) and the proof (\u201crifle\u201d) is created. We believe, however, that the indictment charges appellee with carrying a rifle, and that there is no variance.\nAt an earlier stage of legal development, indictments were strictly and technically construed, and the slightest imprecision in wording was often considered incurable error. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gillespie, 7 S. & R. 469 (Pa. 1822); Commonwealth v. VanSickle, 4 Clark 104 (Pa. N.P. 1845); Commonwealth v. Haines, 4 Clark 17 (Pa. N.P. 1824); Commonwealth v. Garver, 16 Phila. 468 (Pa. Quar. Sess. Phila. 1883); but see Commonwealth v. Wentz, 1 Ashmead 269 (Pa. Quar. Sess. Phila. 1831). Today, however, such arguments are unpersuasive. See Commonwealth v. Hudson, 455 Pa. 117, 314 A.2d 231 (1974); Commonwealth v. Lee, 454 Pa. 526, 312 A.2d 391 (1973).\nIndictments must be read in a common-sense manner, and are not to be construed in an overly technical sense. United States v. Pleasant, 469 F.2d 1121, 1125 (8th Cir. 1972); see Commonwealth v. Buford, 179 Pa. Superior Ct. 312, 116 A.2d 759 (1955). Only an unreasonably strained reading of this indictment that ig\u00f1ores the words \u201cto wit, a rifle\u201d arguably can sustain the assertion that Phillip Pope was not charged with carrying a rifle.\nHere, the indictment notifies appellee that he is charged specifically with carrying \u201ca firearm, to wit, a rifle.\u201d The common-sense meaning of these words is that appellee is accused of illegally carrying a weapon\u2014 a rifle. The Commonwealth\u2019s proof is entirely consistent with this reading of the express language of the indictment.\nMoreover, this Court does not view the alleged variance as material or prejudicial to appellee. It is well settled that a purported variance will not be deemed fatal unless it could mislead the defendant at trial, involves an element of surprise prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s efforts to prepare his defense, precludes the defendant from anticipating the prosecution\u2019s proof, or impairs a substantial right.\nHere, appellee was adequately notified that he was indicted for the criminal act of carrying a weapon, a rifle. The record reveals that his defense was clearly directed to this conduct, not to some different offense committed at a different time or place. Appellee was not misled by the indictment. Nothing in the record substantiates a claim of prejudice. Consequently appellee\u2019s alternate ground for relief must also be rejected.\nThe orders of the Superior Court and of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia are reversed, and the record remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nAct of July 30, 1968, P.L. 690, \u00a7 1, 18 P.S. \u00a7 4628(e.2) (Supp. 1973) (now 18 Pa.S. \u00a7 6108 (1973)), amending the Uniform Firearms Act, Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, \u00a7 628, as amended, 18 P.S. \u00a7 4628 (1963) (now 18 Pa.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6101-19 (1973)).\nJudge Jacobs filed an Opinion in Support of Affirmance in which Judges Hoffman and Spaulding joined.

Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 84 S. Ct. 1697 (1964). In Bouie, the Supreme Court held: \u201cWhen a[n] ... unforeseeable state-court construction of a criminal status is applied retroactively to subject a person to criminal liability for past conduct, the effect is to deprive him of due process of law in the sense of fair warning that his contemplated conduct constitutes a crime. . . .\u201d Id. at 354-55, 84 S. Ct. at 1703 (emphasis added).\nWhere, as here, the statutory construction is based solely on the explicit language of the statute, it cannot successfully be argued that the result is \u201cunforeseeable.\u201d Appellee\u2019s argument must fail.\nSee, e.g., Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 55 S. Ct. 629 (1935).\nSee, e.g., United States v. Ragen, 314 U.S. 513, 62 S. Ct. 374 (1942).\nSee, e.g., Marvin v.
