{"id": "163699", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice SAYLOR.\nIn this appeal, we review questions concerning the scope of the vehicle liability exception to the statutory immunity available to local governmental agencies, as well as the breadth of the immunity available under the Emergency Medical Services Act.\nFor purposes of the summary judgment determinations in question, the relevant factual circumstances, recited in the manner most favorable to the non-moving parties, the estate of Mr. George E. Regester, III, and family members (the \u201cRegesters\u201d), are as follows. Shortly after 7 p.m. on September 8, 1996, Mr. Regester suffered cardiac arrest. While administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation and restoring Mr. Regester\u2019s pulse, his family: telephoned the local emergency services number; requested an ambulance; indicated a correct street address for the Regester family\u2019s home of 4 Raintree Lane, Kennett Township (an unimproved but designated street on the subdivision plan for the Regesters\u2019 neighborhood); and provided accurate driving directions. The emergency services operator radioed both the Longwood Fire Company, Inc. (\u201cLongwood\u201d), which provides volunteer fire protection services as well as ambulance service in the Regester family\u2019s geographical area, and the Southern Chester County Medical Center (\u201cSCCMC\u201d), a hospital that maintains a mobile critical care unit within Chester County\u2019s emergency services system. The' operator also relayed the provided driving directions, which, if followed, should have resulted in the affordance of emergency treatment to Mr. Regester within three to four minutes, since Longwood was located within two miles of the Regester family home. Nevertheless, both sets of emergency medical services (\u201cEMS\u201d) personnel responded to information from Longwood\u2019s station that there was a Rain-tree Lane located near Pennsylvania\u2019s southeastern border; therefore, they were delayed in their arrival. Just before 7:30 p.m., Mr. Regester vomited, blocking his airway, and his condition deteriorated rapidly. Although EMS personnel reached the scene within the next few minutes, they were unable to revive him.\nSubsequently, the Regesters commenced a wrongful death and survival action against Longwood, SCCMC, and others. In their complaint, the Regesters alleged, inter alia, that the emergency services dispatchers and providers negligently failed to familiarize themselves with the geographic area which they served, resulting in the unavailability of prompt and essential medical attention to Mr. Regester. In its answer, Longwood asserted that it was immune from liability pursuant to the provisions of the Judicial Code affording, in favor of local agencies, governmental immunity from claims for damages from injuries to persons and property. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8541-8542. SCCMC contended that, pursuant to the immunity provisions reposited in Section ll(j)(2) of the Emergency Medical Services Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 6931(j)(2), it could not be held liable absent proof of gross or willful negligence, which the Regesters failed to either plead or put into factual controversy. At the conclusion of discovery, Longwood and SCCMC moved for summary judgment based upon their respective claims of immunity. In response, the Regesters contested Longwood\u2019s claim to local agency status and further argued that their own claims against Longwood were not barred by the immunity statute as they fell within an express, statutory exception afforded as to negligent act? connected with vehicle operation. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(a)(2), (b)(1). Concerning SCCMC\u2019s motion, the Regesters contended that the limitation upon liability provision in Section ll(j)(2) of the EMSA, by its terms, extends only to individual emergency medical services personnel but does not protect organizations such as SCCMC.\nSubsequently, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of both defendants. First, citing to Guinn v. Alburtis Fire Co., 531 Pa. 500, 502 n. 2, 614 A.2d 218, 219 n. 2 (1992) (explaining that \u201ca volunteer fire company created pursuant to relevant law and legally recognized as the official fire company for a political subdivision is a local agency\u201d), the court deemed Longwood a local agency entitled to assert governmental immunity. Additionally, the trial court reasoned that, since Longwood\u2019s ambulance was not actually driven in a negligent manner and no causal relationship existed between its physical operation and the harm to Mr. Regester, the vehicle liability exception to the general rule of immunity in favor of local agencies was inapplicable. Concerning SCCMC, the trial court cited D'Amico v. VFW Post 191 Volunteer Ambulance Ass\u2019n, 8 Pa. D. & C.4th 113 (C.P. Washington 1990), aff'd mem., 413 Pa.Super. 660, 596 A.2d 256 (1991), for the proposition that, under Section 11(j)(2) of the EMSA, immunity from civil liability for negligence extends to organizations whose personnel provide emergency medical services.\nThe Regesters appealed, and the Commonwealth Court affirmed in part and reversed in part. See Regester v. Long-wood Ambulance Co., Inc., 751 A.2d 694, 703 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2000). Regarding the claims against Longwood, the court agreed preliminarily with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Longwood was a local agency entitled to assert governmental immunity, see id. at 699-701, and also rejected the Regesters\u2019 attempt to invoke the vehicle liability exception. Concerning the latter, the court initially cited Mickle v. City of Phila., 550 Pa. 539, 707 A.2d 1124 (1998)(holding that a city\u2019s alleged negligent maintenance and repair of a van constituted acts within the vehicle liability exception), in crediting the Regesters\u2019 argument that the vehicle liability exception encompasses a broader range of conduct than solely negligent driving. See Regester, 751 A.2d at 702 (citing Mickle, 550 Pa. at 543, 707 A.2d at 1126). It emphasized, nonetheless, that exceptions to governmental immunity are to be narrowly construed, see Regester, 751 A.2d at 703 (citing Love v. City of Phila., 518 Pa. 370, 374, 543 A.2d 531, 532 (1988)), and relied upon its own prior decisions to hold that there was an insufficient connection between the asserted negligence and the operation of Longwood\u2019s ambulance to satisfy the requirements of the vehicle liability exception. See Regester, 751 A.2d at 702-03 (citing Keesey v. Longwood Volunteer Fire Co., 144 Pa. Cmwlth. 466, 472-73, 601 A.2d 921, 924 (1992)(holding that a dispatcher\u2019s failure to relay a supervisor\u2019s order to decelerate to the driver of a fire truck did not constitute operation for purposes of the vehicle liability exception); Tyree v. City of Pittsburgh, 669 A.2d 487, 491 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995)(holding that a municipality is immune from suit on a claim of negligence by a police officer in terms of his decision to chase a violator); Hawks by Hawks v. Livermore, 157 Pa.Cmwlth. 243, 247-48, 629 A.2d 270, 272 (1993)(same)).\nWith respect to the Regesters\u2019 claim against SCCMC, however, the Commonwealth Court held that the grant of summary judgment must be reversed. See Regester, 751 A.2d at 699. While acknowledging SCCMC\u2019s argument that the immunity afforded under the EMSA reflects the nature of the services provided and the public interest in maintaining an effective and efficient emergency medical system, the court deemed such policy arguments irrelevant in light of the plain language of the enactment. See id. at 698. In reviewing the statutory terms, the court observed that the EMSA affords immunity in favor of a \u201cfirst responder, emergency medical technician or EMT-paramedic or health professional,\u201d and that such operative terms are defined in the enactment in terms of individuals (i.e., natural persons) with enumerated, specialized training. See id. at 698 (citing 35 P.S. \u00a7 6931(j)(2)). Further, the Commonwealth Court emphasized that the General Assembly was well aware of the involvement of institutions and organizations in the provision of emergency medical care, particularly as it had included common forms of medical services organizations among defined terms of the EMSA. See id. at 698. Thus, the court determined that the immunity provisions unambiguously operated in favor of individual actors but not their institutional, organizational, or corporate principals. See id. at 698-99. The Commonwealth Court also questioned the reasoning of D\u2019Amico (which was invoked by the trial court), noting that, although DAmico was affirmed by the Superior Court in an unpublished opinion, such order lacked the binding effect of precedent. See id. at 699 n. 2. Finally, the court acknowledged Farago v. Sacred Heart Gen. Hosp., 522 Pa. 410, 562 A.2d 300 (1989), in which this Court interpreted the immunity provisions of the Mental Health Procedures Act, 50 P.S. \u00a7 7114, to extend immunity to hospitals in addition to their personnel. See Regester, 751 A.2d at 699 n. 2. However, the Commonwealth Court distinguished Farago on the ground that, unlike the EMSA, the Mental Health Procedures Act affords immunity in favor of certain \u201cpersons\u201d without any associated, statutory definition. See Regester, 751 A.2d at 699 n. 2. With regard to Farago\u2019s broader policy discussion, see, e.g., Farago, 522 Pa. at 416-17, 562 A.2d at 303 (reasoning that \u201c[t]o allow an individual to claim immunity under this provision but in turn to preclude [his] employer the same benefit of the immunity would indeed undermine the stated purpose of the limited immunity conferred under the Act\u201d), the Commonwealth Court characterized such discussion as dicta and deemed it deficient on the ground that it fails to expressly consider the precept that \u201ca \u2018principal may not raise immunity of agent as a defense to claim based on respondeat superior.\u2019 \u201d Regester, 751 A.2d at 699 n. 2 (quoting Wicks v. Milzoco Builders, 481 Pa. 554, 557 n. 2, 393 A.2d 300, 301 n. 2 (1978)(citing Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 217)).\nAppeal was allowed on a limited basis to address the application of the vehicle liability exception to governmental immunity, as well as the scope of the limitation on liability provision in the EMSA as it pertains to corporate and institutional principals.\nPresently, the Regesters advocate a general rule to the effect that all negligent decision making of government actors occurring within the course of the operation of a vehicle constitutes negligent operation of a vehicle under Section 8542. The Regesters derive such rule from: this Court\u2019s decisions in Jones v. Chieffo, 549 Pa. 46, 49-52, 700 A.2d 417, 419-20 (1997)(plurality opinion)(indicating that certain decision making by a police officer in connection with a high-speed chase could constitute negligence), and Mickle, 550 Pa. at 589, 707 A.2d at 1124; the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion in Aiken v. Borough of Blawnox, 747 A.2d 1282 (Pa.Cmwlth.), allocatur denied, 564 Pa. 714, 764 A.2d 1072 (2000); and the reasoning provided by Madame Justice Newman in her dissenting statement in Warrick v. Pro Cor Ambulance, Inc., 559 Pa. 44, 46-49, 739 A.2d 127, 127-29 (1999)(Newman, J., dissenting). According to the Regesters, there is no justifiable difference between a negligent decision to drive while a vehicle was in a poor state of repair {Mickle), or a police officer\u2019s decision to engage in a high-speed chase {Aiken), and Longwood\u2019s decision to ignore driving directions and travel to a wrong location in an emergency vehicle. Longwood, on the other hand, emphasizes the rule requiring a narrow interpretation of immunity exceptions. Further, it argues that the good-faith route selection decisions of the EMS personnel were unrelated to both the actual physical operation of the ambulance and the harm alleged. In this regard, Longwood cites extensively to White, 553 Pa. at 220-21, 718 A.2d at 781 (holding that a bus driver\u2019s alleged negligence in signaling an alighted student to cross the street was outside the vehicle liability exception), and the per curiam order in Warrick, 559 Pa. at 44, 739 A.2d at 127, which was expressly based upon White.\nI. Governmental Immunity\nAs noted, the vehicle liability exception to governmental immunity is interpreted narrowly in keeping with the General Assembly\u2019s intention to insulate local agencies from tort claims. See Love, 518 Pa. at 374, 543 A.2d at 532. Consistent with such interpretation, the term \u201coperation,\u201d as used within the exception, has been strictly construed as meaning the placement of a vehicle in motion. See id. at 375, 543 A.2d at 533 (explaining that \u201cmerely preparing to operate a vehicle, or acts taken at the cessation of operating a vehicle!,] are not the same as actually operating that vehicle\u201d (emphasis in original)). Love continues to embody the prevailing interpretation, as, contrary to the Regesters\u2019 argument, neither of this Court\u2019s decisions in Jones v. Chieffo or Mickle overruled it.\nCertainly various decisions of this Court and of the Commonwealth Court establish that the vehicle liability exception encompasses more than merely negligent driving. There is no controlling authority, however, for the proposition advanced by the Regesters that any and all decisions made during the physical operation of a vehicle implicate the exception. Indeed, in maintaining a narrow interpretation of the vehicle liability exception to comport with the legislative purposes involved, this Court has declined to sanction its extension to conduct more closely associated with the panoply of public functions served by governmental vehicles than with the physical operation of the vehicle itself. For example, in White, the Court concluded that a school bus driver\u2019s action of attempting to supervise a student\u2019s crossing the street after he had alighted, which was expressly within the range of the driver\u2019s official responsibilities, did not constitute operation for purposes of the vehicle exception. See White, 553 Pa. at 220-21, 718 A.2d at 781 (\u201cWhile it may well be that a school district that transports students assumes an obligation to make reasonable efforts to see those students safely to their destinations, it does not necessarily follow that breach of that duty exposes the school district.to liability in tort.\u201d). In Warrick, the Court applied this holding in the context of a SEPTA bus driver\u2019s actions in discharging a minor passenger at an incorrect location and positioning the vehicle to block the child\u2019s view of oncoming traffic. See Warrick, 559 Pa. at 44, 739 A.2d at 127.\nAs in the present case, the Commonwealth Court has also generally followed the direction that was set by the General Assembly in circumscribing local agency liability. Here, while properly acknowledging that there is some range of negligence associated with the physical operation of a vehicle beyond actual driving that will implicate the vehicle liability exception, the Commonwealth Court correctly concluded that the form of negligence alleged by the Regesters does not qualify. To the contrary, such allegations of negligence on the part of Long-wood and its agents in failing to maintain adequate familiarity with the emergency service area and follow provided directions is more closely associated with the public service .involved (ambulance service) than it is with the physical operation of the vehicle as such. While we acknowledge that the Regesters\u2019 more expansive interpretation is not an unreasonable one, it is not a narrow one, and therefore, it is not in keeping with the Legislature\u2019s salient intent as reflected, inter alia, in Love, White, and Warrick.\nAccordingly, we hold that the conduct of Longwood here in issue does not implicate the vehicle liability exception.\nII. The EMSA\nTurning to the scope of the limitations on liability embodied in Section ll(j)(2) of the EMSA, SCCMC first attempts a plain meaning argument, indicating that the terms of the statute itself expressly cover hospitals. SCCMC then essentially advances the reasoning of the D\u2019Amico court, to the effect that the Farago reasoning as applied in the context of the immunity provisions of the Mental Health Procedures Act, 50 P.S. \u00a7 7114(a), should apply equally to those of the EMSA. See D\u2019Amico, 8 Pa. D. & C.4th at 114-15. Since emergency services providers can only act through their agents, SCCMC emphasizes, immunity must extend to institutional entities to accomplish the EMSA\u2019s fundamental purpose of removing disincentives to the provision of continuous, high-quality emergency medical care services. See generally 35 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6922. SCCMC also draws an analogy to Mamalis v. Atlas Van Lines, Inc., 522 Pa. 214, 560 A.2d 1380 (1989), in which this Court held that a release executed between a plaintiff and an agent terminates the derivative claim against the principal. See id. at 221, 560 A.2d at 1383.\nSCCMC\u2019s plain meaning argument is meritless. The position is premised upon the assertion that the heading affixed to Section 11 of the EMSA, 35 P.S. \u00a7 6931, incorporates 'the defined term \u201cproviders of emergency medical services,\u201d which, by express statutory definition, includes facilities and life support services. See 35 P.S. \u00a7 6923. The flaw in the argument is that Section ll\u2019s heading in fact does not include the legislatively defined term alluded to by SCCMC, but rather, refers to \u201cEmergency medical services personnel.\u201d The term \u201cpersonnel\u201d (as opposed to \u201cproviders\u201d) plainly signifies the statute\u2019s general applicability to individuals or natural persons. Accordingly, to the extent that the heading is relevant, it supports the Regesters\u2019 position as opposed to SCCMC\u2019s.\nAs the Commonwealth Court held, the operative provisions of Section 11 also do not convey an intention for immunity to extend to institutional, corporate, and organizational entities. Indeed, Section 11(j)(2) is unambiguous in its limitation of immunity coverage to emergency medical technicians, EMT-paramedics, healthcare professionals, and certain supervised students, 35 P.S. \u00a7 6931(j)(2). Each of these categories connotes individuals both pursuant to the applicable statutory definition provided in Section 3 of the EMSA, 35 P.S. \u00a7 6923, and in common parlance, such that hospitals simply are not included within the scope of Section ll(j)(2). See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b) (\u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d). It is also significant to note that the General Assembly did expressly include institutes, organizations, and facilities within other specific immunity terms of Section 11. See 35 P.S. \u00a7 6931(a)(2), (j)(3) (extending immunity relating to educational practice by duly enrolled students under proper supervision to \u201cparticipating institutes, organizations and facilities\u201d). See generally Popowsky v. Pennsylvania Pub. Utility, 550 Pa. 449, 462, 706 A.2d 1197, 1203 (1997) (explaining that, where the General Assembly includes specific language in one section of a statute, but omits it from another, such language should not be implied where excluded).\nThe Commonwealth Court was also correct in terms of the manner in which it distinguished Farago, since the Mental Health Procedures Act at issue in that case lacks a separate definitional section and confers immunity in terms of \u201cpersons,\u201d which fairly may be construed more broadly than the designations contained in Section ll(j). See Farago, 522 Pa. at 415-16, 562 A.2d at 302-03 (citing the broad statutory definition of \u201cperson\u201d set forth in Section 1991 of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1991). Additionally, in light of the express language employed by the General Assembly in Section 11(j)(2), we agree with the Regesters that the broader policy assessment from Farago is not controlling. While we acknowledge the importance of the EMSA\u2019s public purposes, there is no principle of statutory construction suggesting that courts should infer that the Legislature intended to invoke any and all available means to accomplish its purposes. Particularly in the arena of statutory immunities, the Legislature is also cognizant of the strong, competing interests involved, which include the remedial purposes upon which Pennsylvania\u2019s tort liability system is premised. In light of such interests, we do not view it as unlikely that the Legislature might attempt to implement the EMSA\u2019s salutary purposes according to constraints reflected on the face of the words that it has chosen.\nFinally, we agree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that the Wicks line of cases, embodying the Restatement position that the fact of an agent\u2019s immunity from civil liability does not, in and of itself, confer immunity upon the principal, see Wicks, 481 Pa. at 557 n. 2, 393 A.2d at 301 n. 2 (citing Restatement (Second) Agency \u00a7 217), is more apt in the present circumstances than Mamalis, 522 Pa. at 221, 560 A.2d at 1383, which did not involve express statutory immunity, but rather, certain consequences of the consummation of a consensual, civil release.\nWe hold, therefore, that Section ll(j)(2) evinces an intent on the part of the Legislature to confer immunity upon enumerated emergency medical services personnel but not upon their corporate, institutional, or organizational principals.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nFormer Chief Justice FLAHERTY did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJustice NEWMAN files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which Justice NIGRO joins.\n. Section 8541 of the Judicial Code expresses the general precept that:\nExcept as otherwise provided in this subchapter, no local agency shall be liable for any damages on account of any injury to a person or property caused by an act of a local agency or an employee thereof or any other person.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8541.\n. Act of July 3, 1985, P.L. 164, No. 45 (codified at 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6921-6938) (the \"EMSA\u201d).\n. Section 1 l(j)(2) of the EMSA provides:\nNo first responder, emergency medical technician or EMT-paramedic or health professional who in good faith attempts to render or facilitate emergency medical care authorized by this act shall be liable for civil damages as a result of any acts or omissions, unless guilty of gross or willful negligence. This provision shall apply to students enrolled in approved courses of instruction and supervised pursuant to rules and regulations.\n35 P.S. \u00a7 6931(j)(2). The Regesters sought leave to amend their complaint to include an allegation of gross negligence on the part of SCCMC; however, such motion'was denied contemporaneous with the trial court\u2019s summary judgment determinations. Given our resolution, below, concerning SCCMC\u2019s entitlement to invoke the EMSA\u2019s immunity provision, it is unnecessary to review the correctness of the trial court\u2019s reasoning in this regard.\n. The exceptions to governmental immunity are set forth in Section 8542 of the Judicial Code and expose a local agency to liability in instances of injury claims where: 1) damages would otherwise be recoverable under common law or statute; 2) the injury was caused by a negligent act of the local agency or an employee acting within the scope of his office or official duties; and 3) the negligent act falls within an enumerated category to include:\n(1) Vehicle liability. \u2014 The operation of any motor vehicle in the possession or control of the local agency, provided that the local agency shall not be liable to any plaintiff that claims liability under this subsection if the plaintiff was, during tire course of the alleged negligence, in flight or fleeing apprehension or resisting arrest by a police officer or knowingly aided a group, one or more of whose members were in flight or fleeing apprehension or resisting arrest by a police officer. As used in this paragraph, \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d means any vehicle which is self-propelled and any attachment thereto, including vehicles operated by rail, through water or in the air.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(a), (b)(1). See generally White v. School Dist. of Phila., 553 Pa. 214, 217, 718 A.2d 778, 779 (1998).\n. The Regesters also sought review concerning whether the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that Longwood is a local agency entitled to assert governmental immunity in the first instance. Appeal \u25a0 was not allowed, however, concerning such question.\n. As the holdings at issue embody purely legal conclusions, the applicable review focuses upon whether, in granting summary judgment, the court committed an error of law, see Murphy v. Duquesne Univ. of the Holy Ghost, 565 Pa. 571, 590, 777 A.2d 418, 429 (2001), and our standard of review is plenary, see id. (citing Phillips v. A-Best Products Co., 542 Pa. 124, 130, 665 A.2d 1167, 1170 (1995)).\n. In Jones v. Chieffo, a majority of Justices rejected the principle previously established in Dickens v. Horner, 531 Pa. 127, 611 A.2d 693 (1992), that negligent and criminal acts of third parties constituted superseding causes, which, pursuant to Section 8541 of the Judicial Code, foreclosed liability as against a political subdivision based upon certain decisions of police officers in connection with high-speed pursuit. See Jones v. Chieffo, 549 Pa. at 50-52, 700 A.2d at 419-20; see also id. at 52-53, 700 A.2d at 420-21 (Cappy, J., concurring). Love, however, was not predicated upon superseding cause under Section 8541, but rather, on the asserted negligence (failure to provide adequate assistance to an alighting passenger), falling within the general conferral of governmental immunity and outside the vehicle liability exception under Section 8542. See Love, 518 Pa. at 373-75, 543 A.2d at 532-33. Mickle reflects the Court\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \"with respect to\u201d in Section 8542(a)(2) as it is used to establish an essential connection between the negligent act at issue and vehicle operation. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(a)(2). In reliance upon this associative language, the Court held that a decision to drive a vehicle in a poor state of repair, which was alleged to have directly impacted upon the physical operation of the vehicle, met the requirements of the vehicle liability exception. See Mickle, 550 Pa. at 543, 707 A.2d at 1126. As opposed to overruling Love, Mickle cited affirmatively to the decision and gave effect to its interpretation of vehicle operation. See id.\n. Certainly the Regesters' position is, as they note, akin to Justice Newman\u2019s position in her dissenting statement in Warrick; however, the Regesters fail to accord sufficient weight to the fact that such position was a minority one.\n. Headings, of course, are accorded limited weight in statutory construction. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1924.\n. Pennsylvania\u2019s EMSA is distinguishable in this regard from similar legislative schemes enacted elsewhere in which hospitals, life support agencies, and other corporate and institutional entities are expressly included within the scope of the immunity provisions. See, e.g., Ga. Code. Ann \u00a7\u00a7 31-11-2, 31-11-8; Mich. Comp Laws Ann. \u00a7 333.20965."}
