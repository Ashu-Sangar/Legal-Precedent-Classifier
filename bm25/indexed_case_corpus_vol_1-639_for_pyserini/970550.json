{"id": "970550", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThere is nothing in the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that would have warranted the jury in rendering a verdict in his favor, and hence there was no error in entering the judgment of nonsuit, and refusing to take it off. Without some evidence, tending to prove that the injury complained of resulted from the defendant company\u2019s negligence, the plaintiff had no right to ask that his case should be submitted to the jury.\nJudgment affirmed."}
