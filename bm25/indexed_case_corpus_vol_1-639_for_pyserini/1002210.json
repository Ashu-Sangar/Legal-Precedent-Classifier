{"id": "1002210", "contents": "The opinion was delivered June 1st 1866.\nPer Curiam.\nThe 12th section of the Act of 25th March 1864, Pamph. L. 90, does not cover the case of the nineteen veterans credited to Petersburg on the 19th of August 1864. The law made their claim for bounties contingent on the payment of bounties to volunteers in the same district.\nNone ever having been authorized, levied or paid to volunteers, the provision for veterans never took effect. The decree of the court below is therefore affirmed."}
