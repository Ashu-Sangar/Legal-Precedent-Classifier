{"id": "1296765", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Chief Justice Jones,\nThe plaintiffs, residents of Scott Township, a second class township of Columbia County, are the owners of various realty abutting three certain roadways located in an area of residential building development in the township. Between 1956 and 1958 the promoters of the development, on their own initiative, constructed the roads above referred to, first applying a shale and, later, a crushed stone base. Attempts were made to persuade the supervisors of the township to accept a dedication of the roadways which the supervisors refused to do, insisting that the roadways must first conform to certain standards of construction as set forth in a township ordinance and that plans showing compliance with these standards must be submitted for approval as provided by Section 1140.1 of The Second Class Township Code of May 1, 1933, P. L. 103, as amended, 53 PS \u00a766140.1. Negotiations looking to the township\u2019s acceptance of the roads were entered into between the plaintiffs and the supervisors but no agreement was reached.\nThe plaintiffs, having been unable to persuade the supervisors to accept voluntarily a dedication of the three roadways, adopted an alternative course. They caused the roadways to be laid out and opened as public roads of Scott Township by following the legal procedure prescribed by \u00a71101 of The Second Class Township Code, as amended, 53 PS \u00a766101. Pursuing the prescribed procedure, the plaintiffs petitioned the supervisors to lay out and open the roads and, when the petition was not acted upon by the supervisors within the statutorily prescribed sixty day period, the plaintiffs presented it to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Columbia County which, on December 8, 1958, appointed a board of view. According to their report the viewers concluded that the three roads were necessary for public highways and laid them out and declared them opened as such. This report was confirmed absolutely by the Court of Quarter Sessions on June 26, 1959. Sixteen days earlier, the title owner conveyed by deed to Scott Township the entire area within the limits of the three roadways, whereby the township was relieved of liability for damages for the taking of private property for public use as a result of the proceedings in the Court of Quarter Sessions.\nThe supervisors not having thereafter accepted the roads in question as township highways, the plaintiffs instituted this action in mandamus to compel them to repair, improve and maintain the three roadways. The court entered judgment for the defendant supervisors and the plaintiffs have appealed.\nSection 516 of The Second Class Township Code, as amended, 53 PS \u00a765516, provides that .\u201cThe township supervisors, or the supervisors acting as superintendents or roadmasters, shall (a) Have the general care and superintendence of the improvement of the roads .. . in the township ... (b) Cause such roads to be kept in repair and reasonably free from all obstructions, and give the necessary directions therefor.\u201d The duty to repair and maintain public roads may be enforced by mandamus: Commonwealth v. Ball, 277 Pa. 301, 121 Atl. 191 (1923) ; St. David\u2019s Church v. Sayen, 244 Pa. 300, 90 Atl. 638 (1914); Borough of Uniontown v. Commonwealth ex rel. Veech, 34 Pa. 293 (1859); Winters v. Koontz, 60 Pa. Superior Ct. 134 (1915).\nIn their answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the supervisors do not deny that they have failed to repair and maintain the specified roadways but insist that the roads are not a part of the Scott Township road system notwithstanding the determination by the Court of Quarter Sessions of Columbia County. It is the supervisors\u2019 contention that the plaintiffs had no right to petition the court of quarter sessions but should have complied with the conditions laid down by the supervisors as prerequisite to their accepting a dedication of the roadways.\nWe find no merit in this contention. Merely because the plaintiffs unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the supervisors to accept voluntarily a dedication of the three roadways in no way precluded them from pursuing the procedure prescribed by \u00a71101 of The Second Class Township Code, as amended. The plaintiffs have duly proceeded in accordance with the provisions of this section and, as a consequence, the three roadways have been judicially made a part of the Scott Township road system. The defendant supervisors are,therefore, bound by the statutory duty to keep the roadways \u201cin repair and reasonably free from all obstructions . . .\u201d, wherein they have unquestionably failed.\nJudgment reversed and record remanded with directions that an appropriate writ of mandamus issue in conformity with this opinion.\nMr. Justice Belt, dissents."}
