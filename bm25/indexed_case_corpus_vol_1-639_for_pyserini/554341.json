{"id": "554341", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nA delivery is essentially necessary to give effect to a deed. The signing and sealing thereof are insufficient to bind the grantor, or to pass title to the vendee therein named. In the present case, no question of presumptive or conditional delivery, either to the vendee or to any person for her, arises.\nIt is conclusively shown that, although the deed was signed and acknowledged, yet in fact it remained in the possession of the person who signed it until her death. Neither the grantee named, nor the persons for whose benefit it professed to be made, gave any consideration therefor, nor were any of them present when it was signed or acknowledged, and they had no knowledge of its existence during the life of the maker. In law it was not a deed.\nDecree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
