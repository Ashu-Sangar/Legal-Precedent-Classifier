This was not a condemnation proceeding, but an ordinary action of trespass for injury to the plaintiff\u2019s close. The plaintiff was entitled to recover any actual damages he suffered by reason of the trespass of the defendant, and he complained of the destruction of his vegetables and his fences. Any advantage to the lot by reason of the fill is not a proper subject of consideration.\nJudgment affirmed."}
