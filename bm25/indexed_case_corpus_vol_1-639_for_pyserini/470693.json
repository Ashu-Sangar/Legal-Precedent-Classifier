{"id": "470693", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nDefendant appeals from judgment on a verdict for plaintiff in his suit to recover for personal injury. The verdict establishes that the injury resulted from defendant\u2019s negligence. The defendant contends that the learned court erred in not instructing the jury to find for the defendant and that this court should now reverse and enter judgment in defendant\u2019s favor. As the suffificiency of the evidence to support the verdict is not challenged, we come at once to the legal contention.\nDefendant is engaged in manufacturing steel and steel products. John H. Brooks and Sons, a partnership, is engaged, inter alia, in the excavation of land. Defendant awarded to Brooks a contract \u201cto furnish all necessary labor, material and equipment required to excavate for cooling pits at our Steel Mill, all in accordance with verbal instructions given you by our representative.\u201d The dimensions of the pit were: depth 7 feet, width 10 feet and length 100 feet. In excavating, Brooks used a truck crane with a boom; the site of the pit Avas in an area over part of which defendant worked a traveling crane. After the excavation had been in process about half a day, defendant\u2019s OArerhead crane negligently came in contact with the boom operated by Brooks, the contractor, and seriously injured plaintiff, who Avas employed by Brooks in the excavation.\nDefendant contends that it is liable for workmen\u2019s compensation as though plaintiff were one of its employes, and is therefore not liable in a common law action for negligence; that while plaintiff\u2019s immediate employer, Brooks, is liable for workmen\u2019s compensation, the defendant is also liable, as a statutory employer under sections 203 (77 PS 52) and 302 (b) (77 PS \u00bf62) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, as amended.\nSection 203 (77 PS 52) provides that \u201cAn employer who permits the entry upon premises occupied by him or under his control of a laborer or an assistant hired by an employe or contractor, for the performance upon such premises of a part of the employer\u2019s regular business entrusted to such employe or contractor, shall be liable to such laborer or assistant in the same manner and to the same extent as to his own employe.\u201d\nSection 302 (b) (77 PS.\u00bf62) provides that \u201c. ... an employer who permits the entry, upon premises occupied by him or under his control, of a laborer or an assistant hired by an employe or contractor, for the performance upon such premises of a part of the employer\u2019s regular business entrusted to that employe or contractor, shall be conclusively presumed to have agreed to pay to such laborer or assistant compensation in accordance with the provisions of article three, unless the employer shall post in a conspicuous place,\u201d etc.\nSection 105 (77 PS 25) provides that \u201cThe term \u2018contractor\u2019 as used in article two, section two hundred and three, and article three, section three hundred and two (b), shall not include a contractor engaged in an independent business, other than that of supplying laborers or assistants, in which he serves persons other than the employer in whose service the accident occurs, but shall include a sub-contractor to whom a principal contractor has sub-let any part of the work which such principal contractor has undertaken.\u201d\nThe excavation necessary to create the cooling pit was not \u201cpart of the [defendant\u2019s] regular business\u201d as those words are used in the statute. Defendant\u2019s regular business was the manufacture of steel and steel products. Brooks was an independent contractor employed to do part of the work required in the construction for defendant of a plant facility to be used in defendant\u2019s manufacturing business; section 105 excluded such a contractor from the meaning of the term contractor as used in sections 203 and 302.
