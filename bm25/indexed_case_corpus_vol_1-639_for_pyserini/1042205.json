{"id": "1042205", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThese two cases were disposed of together below, under agreement of counsel, and were so argued here. A final decree dismissing the bill in each case was filed June 6, 1916, more than six months before these appeals were taken, and they are, therefore, quashed, without prejudice to any right of the appellant in proceedings at law."}
