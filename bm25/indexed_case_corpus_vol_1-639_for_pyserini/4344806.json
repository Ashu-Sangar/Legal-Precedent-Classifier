{"id": "4344806", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice TODD.\nIn these consolidated appeals, we consider whether the manifestation of an occupational disease outside of the 300-week period prescribed by Section 301(c)(2) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cWCA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d), 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2), removes the claim from the purview of the Act, such that the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 481, does not apply. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that claims for occupational disease which manifests outside of the 300-week period prescribed by the Act do not fall within the purview of the Act, and, therefore, that the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) does not apply to preclude an employee from filing a common law claim against an employer. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Superi- or Court.\nJohn Tooey worked for Ferro Engineering (\u201cFerro\u201d), a division of Oglebay-Norton Co. (\u201cOglebay\u201d), as an industrial salesman of asbestos products from 1964 until 1982, during which time he was exposed to asbestos dust. In December 2007, Tooey developed mesothelioma and died less than one year later. Spurgeon Landis worked for Alloy Rods, Inc. (\u201cAlloy\u201d), predecessor in interest to Chemetron Corp. (\u201cChe metro n\u201d), and ESAB Group, Inc. (\u201cESAB\u201d), from 1946 until 1992. He, too, was exposed to asbestos throughout his employment, and, in July 2007, was diagnosed with mesothelioma.\nIn 2008, Tooey, Landis, and their spouses (hereinafter \u201cAppellants\u201d) filed separate tort actions against multiple defendants, including their respective employers (collectively, \u201cEmployers\u201d). Employers filed motions for summary judgment, alleging Appellants\u2019 causes of action were barred by the exclusivity provision of Section 808(a) of the Act. Appellants responded that the Act, the federal and state constitutions, and precedent from this Court, permit a tort action against an employer where, as here, a disease falls outside the jurisdiction, scope, and coverage of the Act. The trial court agreed \u25a0with Appellants, and denied Employers\u2019 motions for summary judgment.\nEmployers filed an interlocutory appeal with the Superior Court, which reversed in an unpublished memorandum decision. In so doing, the court concluded it was bound by its recent decisions in Ranalli v. Rohm & Haas Co., 983 A.2d 732 (Pa.Super.2009), and Sedlacek v. A.O. Smith Corp., 990 A.2d 801 (Pa.Super.2010). In Ranalli, the Superior Court determined that the fact that the plaintiffs injuries, which resulted from his exposure to vinyl chloride and manifested more than 300 weeks after his last employment, were not compensable under the Act did not render the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) inapplicable. The Superior Court reasoned that application of Section 303(a) \u201cdoes not deny access to the courts, rather it limits recovery as contemplated by the legislative scheme.\u201d Ranalli, 983 A.2d at 735. Similarly, in Sedlacek, the Superior Court observed that both the WCA and the Occupational Disease Act (\u201cODA\u201d), 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1201 et seq., contain provisions which purport to limit compensation for disability or death resulting from occupational disease to injuries that occur within a defined period from the date of last employment, and the court determined that such provisions do not violate the federal Due Process or Equal Protection Clause, or the Remedies Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nAlthough the Superior Court in the instant case acknowledged Appellants\u2019 position that Ranalli and Sedlacek \u201cimproperly expanded the application of the exclusivity provision,\u201d the court concluded it lacked authority to overrule its prior decisions. Tooey v. AK Steel, 1540-42 WDA 2009, unpublished memorandum at 7, 11 A.3d 1046 (Pa.Super. filed Aug. 31, 2010). Appellants filed a petition for allowance of appeal with this Court, and we granted review to determine (1) whether, under the plain language of Section 301(c)(2), the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d excludes an occupational disease that first manifests more than 300 weeks after the last occupational exposure to the hazards of such disease, such that the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) does not apply; (2) whether Section 301(c)(2), in conjunction with the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a), results in an unconstitutional denial of reasonable compensation under Pa. Const. Art. Ill, \u00a7 18; and (3) whether the substitution of an exclusive statutory remedy for a common law remedy for an occupational disease which is \u201cinvariably noncompensable\u201d under the statutory remedy violates the Open Court and Remedies Clause of Pa. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 2 and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Tooey v. AK Steel Corp., 610 Pa. 405, 20 A.3d 1184 (2011) (order).\nAs it is this Court\u2019s policy to resolve claims on non-constitutional grounds when it is possible to do so, see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Long, 592 Pa. 42, 50, 922 A.2d 892, 897 (2007), we first consider Appellants\u2019 argument that, because their injuries are excluded from the definition of injury set forth in Section 301(c)(2), their claims do not fall within the parameters of the Act, and, therefore, the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) of the Act does not preclude them from pursuing common law claims against Employers. As this issue raises a question of law, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Dechert LLP v. Commonwealth, 606 Pa. 334, 340, 998 A.2d 575, 579 (2010).\nThe WCA was designed \u201cto compensate claimants for earnings loss occasioned by work-related injuries.\u201d City of Erie v. W.C.A.B. (Annunziata), 575 Pa. 594, 601, 838 A.2d 598, 602 (2003). The Act seeks \u201cto provide recompense commensurate with the damage from accidental injury, as a fair exchange for relinquishing every other right of action against the employer.\u201d Id. Indeed, Section 303(a) of the Act specifies that \u201cliability of an employer under the act shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability to such employes.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a). We have further explained that \u201c[t]he goal of the workers\u2019 compensation legislative scheme is to relieve the employee \u2018from the economic consequences of his injury and make [those consequences] a part of the cost of operation of the business, to be paid ultimately by the consuming public.\u2019 \u201d Annunziata, 575 Pa. at 601, 838 A.2d at 602 (quoting Rudy v. McCloskey Corp., 348 Pa. 401, 35 A.2d 250, 253 (1944)).\nRelevant to the case sub judice, Section 301(c)(2) of the Act provides, in pertinent part:\nThe terms \u201cinjury,\u201d \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d and \u201cinjury arising in the course of his employment,\u201d as used in this act, shall include ... occupational disease as defined in section 108 of this act [i.e., 77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1]: Provided, That whenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, it shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment in an occupation or industry to which he was exposed to hazards of such disease: And provided further, That if the employe\u2019s compensable disability has occurred within such period, his subsequent death as a result of the disease shall likewise be compensable.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2) (emphasis added).\nAppellants argue that, under the plain language of Section 301(c)(2), an occupational disease which first manifests more than 300 weeks after the last occupational exposure to the hazards of the disease does not fall within the definition of injury set forth in Section 301(c)(2); that the Act, therefore, does not apply to employees seeking compensation for such diseases; and, accordingly, that the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) does not preclude an employee from seeking recovery for such disease through a common law action against an employer. Appellants contend their interpretation of the statutory language is supported by general rules of grammar, and, to the extent the statute may be deemed ambiguous, that their interpretation is consistent with the humanitarian purposes of the Act, as well as precedent from this Court.\nEmployers, conversely, assert that Section 303(a), by its express language, \u201cunequivocally precludes current or former employees from making civil claims for damages against their employers for work-related injuries,\u201d including occupational disease claims. See, e.g., ESAB/Chemetron Brief at 9-10. Employers, like Appellants, argue their interpretation is supported by recognized principles of grammar, the underlying purpose of the Act, and this Court\u2019s prior decisions interpreting the Act. Additionally, Employers emphasize the distinction between compensability and coverage under the Act, and they contend that Section 301(c)(2) is a valid statute of repose that serves as a temporal limitation on recovery, rather than a jurisdictional limitation of the Act.\nIt is well settled that \u201c[t]he object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a). Further, \u201c[i]n giving effect to the words of the legislature, we should not interpret statutory words in isolation, but must read them with reference to the context in which they appear.\u201d Giant Eagle, Inc. v. W.C.A.B. (Givner), 614 Pa. 606, 39 A.3d 287, 290 (Pa.2012) (citation omitted). When construing statutory language, \u201c[wjords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1903. Furthermore, when reviewing issues concerning the Act, we are mindful that the Act is remedial in nature and its purpose is to benefit the workers of this Commonwealth. Thus, the Act is to be liberally construed to effectuate its humanitarian objectives, and borderline interpretations are to be construed in the injured party\u2019s favor. Sporio v. W.C.A.B. (Songer Const.), 553 Pa. 44, 49, 717 A.2d 525, 528 (1998).\nTurning to the pertinent language of Section 301(c)(2)\u2014 \u201cwhenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, it shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment in an occupation or industry to which he was exposed to hazards of such disease\u201d \u2014 Appellants contend that the word \u201cit\u201d in the phrase \u201cit shall apply,\u201d refers to \u201cthis act\u201d and not to \u201cthe basis for compensation.\u201d Thus, they read Section 301(c)(2) as follows: \u201cwhenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, this act shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment.\u201d\nIn support of their argument, they rely on \u201can elementary rule of grammar, [that] a pronoun may substitute for or refer to an immediately preceding noun.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Brief at 16 (citing The Chicago Manual of Style, \u00a7 5.34 (15th ed. 2003)). They further assert that, while a legislative act is frequently said to \u201capply,\u201d the phrase \u201cbasis for compensation\u201d is not ordinarily used in the same manner.\nEmployers, on the other hand, argue that the term \u201cit\u201d in the phrase \u201cit shall apply only to disability or death,\u201d refers to the term \u201ccompensation,\u201d an interpretation they contend is supported by the rules of grammar concerning restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses. Specifically, Employers assert:\nA restrictive clause is a clause that is essential to the meaning of a sentence, including the identification of nouns or pronouns in the sentence. It is not set off by commas.\nBy contrast, nonrestrictive clauses, which contain nonessential and mere explanatory information, are set apart from the rest of the sentence by a pair of commas. Nonrestrictive clauses \u201cdo not restrict the meaning of the word or words they relate to ...; they could be removed from the sentence without changing the [sentence\u2019s] basic meaning.\u201d The pair of commas around a nonrestrictive clause act exactly like a pair of parentheses.\nBrief for ESAB/Chemetron, at 20 (citations omitted). Applying these grammatical rules to Section 301(c)(2), Employers argue that the phrase \u201cfor disability or death under this act,\u201d is nonrestrictive, such that the word \u201cit\u201d clearly refers to the word \u201ccompensation,\u201d and not \u201cact.\u201d Id. at 21. Thus, Employers read Section 301(c)(2) as follows: \u201cwhenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, compensation shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment.\u201d\nUpon review, we find Appellants\u2019 interpretation of the language of Section 301(c)(2) to be the most reasonable one. Although both Appellants and Employers make grammatical arguments based on punctuation placement, the common and approved usage of the terms in Section 301(c)(2) clearly support Appellants\u2019 interpretation of the statute. While an act generally is described as applying or not applying in certain situations, the term \u201ccompensation\u201d is not invoked in the same manner. Indeed, our research reveals no published decision in which any Pennsylvania court has utilized the verb \u201capply\u201d to describe the term \u201ccompensation.\u201d Similarly, there are no Pennsylvania statutes which invoke the terms \u201capply\u201d and \u201ccompensation\u201d in this manner. Thus, we conclude that the term \u201cit\u201d applies not to \u201ccompensation,\u201d but to the term \u201cact,\u201d as contained in (1) the phrase \u201cfor disability or death under this act\u201d immediately preceding \u201cit\u201d; and/or (2) the phrase \u201cas used in this act\u201d in the preamble to Section 301(c)(2). Accordingly, we construe Section 301(c)(2) as follows: \u201cwhenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, [the act] shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment.\u201d\nAssuming, for purposes of argument, that Employers\u2019 interpretation of Section 301(c)(2) also is reasonable, such that there exists an ambiguity, see Giant Eagle, 39 A.3d at 294 (where there are at least two reasonable interpretations of statutory text, there exists an ambiguity), we turn, as the parties do in the alternative, to further principles of statutory construction. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(c). In determining the intent of the legislature with regard to Section 301(c)(2), we are guided primarily by consideration of the occasion and necessity for the statute; the object to be attained; and the consequences of the proposed interpretations.\nThis Court has recognized that the Act \u201csubstitutes a quick and inexpensive scheme to provide compensation for work-related injuries in place of the common law process where the employee must sue the appropriate parties for damages. Employers pay benefits at a set rate and they are immune from common-law liability.\u201d Sporio, 553 Pa. at 53, 717 A.2d at 530 (citation omitted); see also Markle v. W.C.A.B. (Caterpillar Tractor Co.), 541 Pa. 148,153, 661 A.2d 1355,1357 (1995) (\u201cWorker\u2019s Compensation can best be understood as a replacement of common law tort actions between employees and employers as a means for obtaining compensation for injuries.\u201d).\nWith regard to the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a), this Court, in Alston v. St. Paul Ins. Cas., explained that Section 303(a):\nreflects the historical quid pro quo between an employer and employee whereby the employer assumes liability without fault for a work-related injury, but is relieved of the possibility of a larger damage verdict in a common law action. The employee benefits from the expeditious payment of compensation, but forgoes recovery of some elements of damages.\n531 Pa. 261, 267, 612 A.2d 421, 424 (1992). We have repeatedly stressed, however, that the Act is \u201cremedial in nature and intended to benefit the worker, and, therefore, the Act must be liberally construed to effectuate its humanitarian objectives.\u201d Giant Eagle, 39 A.3d at 290; see also Lancaster Gen. Hosp. v. WCAB (Weber-Brown), 616 Pa. 333, 47 A.3d 831, 839 (2012).\nIn the case sub judice, Appellants contend that, as a result of the 300-week time provision contained in Section 301(c)(2), in cases involving latent, asbestos-related mesothelioma, \u201cthe quid pro quo contemplated by the Act cannot be effectuated. The employee does not benefit from \u2018expeditious payment of compensation,\u2019 and in fact has no reasonable opportunity to obtain compensation at all.\u201d Appellants Brief at 19. Thus, according to Appellants, \u201c[i]t would violate the spirit of the Act to ... grant the employer full immunity based on the illusion that the employer bears \u2018no-fault\u2019 liability for the worker\u2019s non-compensable occupational injury.\u201d Id.\nIn support of their position, Appellants rely on this Court\u2019s prior decisions in Lord Corp. v. Pollard, 548 Pa. 124, 695 A.2d 767 (1997), Boniecke v. McGraw-Edison Co., 485 Pa. 163, 401 A.2d 345 (1979), and Greer v. U.S. Steel Corp., 475 Pa. 448, 380 A.2d 1221 (1977). In Lord Corp., the plaintiff filed a wrongful death action on behalf of her deceased husband, alleging he died as a result of complications from malignant nodular lymphoma caused by his exposure to toxic and deadly chemicals during his employment with Lord Corp.\u2019s chemical products division. Lord Corp. filed preliminary objections to the complaint, alleging that the claim was barred by the exclusivity provisions of the WCA and the ODA. The trial court granted the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed, reasoning \u201cthe trial court\u2019s order granting a demurrer was premature because there had been no determination of compensability and this question could not be resolved from the pleadings.\u201d 548 Pa. at 127, 695 A.2d at 768.\nOn further appeal to this Court, an equally divided Court determined that an employee\u2019s common law action is not barred by the exclusivity provision of either the WCA or the ODA until there has been a final determination that the injury or disease in question is cognizable under either Act. The Opinion in Support of Affirmance provided, in relevant part:\nThis Court has previously examined the question of whether an employee\u2019s common law action is barred under circumstances similar to those presented here. In Boniecke v. McGraw-Edison Co., 485 Pa. 163, 401 A.2d 345 (1979), an employee commenced an action in trespass against his employer after being denied relief under the ODA. The employer then filed a motion for summary judgment, contending, as Lord does in the present case, that the ODA and WCA bar all common law actions by an employee against his employer for occupational diseases. This Court rejected the employer\u2019s argument, holding that the employee\u2019s claims were not barred because although the employee had been denied relief under the ODA, there had been no adjudication of the employee\u2019s rights under the WCA, and \u201cthere [was] nothing in the record, aside from [the employer\u2019s] mere allegations, which would indicate that [the employee was] entitled to relief under the Acts.\u201d Boniecke, 485 Pa. at 167, 401 A.2d at 347.\nWe reached a similar conclusion in Greer [v. U.S. Steel Corp., 475 Pa. 448, 380 A.2d 1221 (1977)], wherein an employee sought common law recovery for a disease allegedly contracted in the course of employment due to the negligence of the employer. The employer\u2019s answer to the complaint claimed, in part, that the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy was under the ODA. In rejecting the employer\u2019s claim, we reasoned that:\n[i]n the pleadings we have no assertion by either side as to whether the existence of [the applicable conditions of the ODA] can or cannot be demonstrated nor have we had any argument by counsel as to who has the burden of proof on the issue. In any event, the uncertainty of this factual question makes it inappropriate for the grant of judgment on the pleadings.\nGreer, 475 Pa. at 453, 380 A.2d at 1223.\nIn accordance with our decisions in Boniecke and Greer, we would hold that an employee\u2019s common law action is not barred by the exclusivity provisions of either the WCA or the ODA until there has been a final determination that the injury or disease in question is cognizable under either Act. See Boniecke; Greer. Thus, in the present case, if it is determined that decedent\u2019s nodular lymphoma is compensable, then Pollard\u2019s common law action is barred. Conversely, if the facts do not warrant such a finding, her common law cause of action may be maintained.\nLord Corp., 548 Pa. at 128-29, 695 A.2d at 769 (Opinion in Support of Affirmance) (footnote omitted). According to Appellants, this Court\u2019s decisions in Lord Corp., Boniecke, and Greer support the conclusion that, because their claims are not compensable under the Act, the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) does not bar their common law claims against Employers.\nEmployers, however, insist that the workers\u2019 compensation system was not intended to provide, in every case, either compensation for a workplace injury or an opportunity to seek redress at common law. Employers contend there is a difference between coverage and compensability under the Act, and they further suggest that individuals who contract mesothelioma or other latent asbestos-related diseases are not completely without a remedy at common law, as such individuals still may seek compensation from non-employer defendants. Employers additionally maintain that Section 301(c)(2) is a statute of repose which serves as a legitimate temporal limitation on recovery, as opposed to a jurisdictional limitation of the Act.\nIn support of their argument that the Act\u2019s remedies are exclusive, even where compensation is unavailable, Employers cite, inter alia, this Court\u2019s decision in Kline v. Arden H. Vemer Co., 503 Pa. 251, 469 A.2d 158 (1983). In Kline, the plaintiff, a painter, was injured when he fell from a ladder. He applied for, and received, workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the month he was disabled. Subsequently, the plaintiff sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits for impotency resulting from his fall. When he was denied benefits, the plaintiff filed suit against his employer, alleging negligent conduct by another employee as the cause of his injury. Summary judgment was granted in favor of the employer, and, on appeal, this Court held the Act was the exclusive avenue of compensation. We explained:\nTo change, alter or abolish a remedy lies within the wisdom and power of the legislature and in some instances, the courts. Access to a tribunal is not denied when the tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain either the claim or the remedy. Time and circumstances require new remedies to adjust to new and unforeseen losses and conditions. To do so, facets of the society often require new immunities or larger responsibility, as the legislature may determine. The workmen\u2019s compensation law has deprived some of rights in exchange for surer benefits, immunized some, to make possible resources to benefit many, who where [sic] heretofore without possible or practical remedies.\nId. at 255, 469 A.2d at 160.\nEmployers additionally assert that this Court \u201crecognized the crucial distinction between \u2018coverage\u2019 and \u2018compensation\u2019 under the WCA in Moffett v. Harbison-Walker Refractories Co., 339 Pa. 112,14 A.2d 111 (1940).\u201d Brief for Oglebay at 29; see also Brief of ESAB/Chemetron at 25. In Moffett, a partially-disabled employee sought relief at common law for work-related silicosis because the WCA and the ODA provided relief only for total disability. In holding the WCA provided the exclusive avenue of compensation, this Court stated:\nthe original act, providing for accidental injuries, allowed no compensation until after a definite period, provided no compensation to nonresident dependents, and allowed nothing for disfigurement. That was the legislative policy and was well understood when the supplement of 1937 was passed. In harmony with that policy, the legislature, in providing for compensation for silicosis, made other exceptions: section 5(a) provided it \u2018shall be paid only when it is shown that the employe has had an aggregate employment of at least two years in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, during a period of eight years next preceding the date of disability, in an occupation having a silica or asbestos hazard.\u2019 It is inconceivable that the legislature intended, for example, that a person recently come into the state, and becoming totally disabled, within two years, should have the right to sue in tort and that after two years he should be subject only to the compensation statute. We think in each case the employe\u2019s contract resulted from the statute and in each case was the same; he gave up his right to sue in tort for the absolute certainty provided by the Act of receiving the compensation on bringing himself within its compensatory clauses. By coming under the Act, plaintiff surrendered his right, in the words of the Act \u2018to any method of determination thereof, other than as provided, in article three.\u2019\n339 Pa. at 115-16,14 A.2d at 113.\nUpon review, it is evident that this Court\u2019s decisions in Lord, Greer, and Boniecke support Appellants\u2019 construction of the Act. See Sporio, supra. Moreover, we find neither Kline, nor Moffett, compels the conclusion for which Employers advocate. With respect to Employers\u2019 reliance on Moffett, we note that Moffett was decided prior to 1974, when participation in the workers\u2019 compensation system was elective, and employees could opt out of a system which might deprive them of compensation for an entire category of injuries. See supra note 4. Employees no longer have that option, and are required to participate in a system that likely will deny them the opportunity to seek compensation from their employer for any late-manifesting work-related injuries.\nFurthermore, in Kline, this Court recognized that \u201cthe injury suffered was clearly within the scope of the Act and the appellant was fully compensated under the Act.\u201d 503 Pa. at 255, 469 A.2d at 160. Unlike the plaintiff in Kline, Appellants herein did not and, indeed, could not seek any compensation under the Act, given the fact that their injuries did not manifest until nearly 780 weeks (in the case of Mr. Landis), and 1300 weeks (in the case of Mr. Tooey), after their employment-based exposure to asbestos. Indeed, the average latency period for mesothelioma is 30 to 50 years. See Daley v. AW. Chesterton, Inc., 614 Pa. 335, 37 A.3d 1175, 1188 (2012). Even mesothelioma that manifests at the lower end of this average will not occur for decades following an employee\u2019s exposure to asbestos. Thus, Section 301(c)(2)\u2019s 300-week time window operates as a de facto exclusion of coverage under the Act for essentially all mesothelioma claims.\nRecently, in Bowman, supra, this Court again considered the historical development of the Act. In Bowman, we addressed the issue of whether a third-party workers\u2019 compensation release signed by an employee as a condition of her employment was void against public policy to the extent the language of the release conflicted with the language of Section 204(a) of the Act. We determined that the release was enforceable and not against public policy, as Section 204(a) prohibits agreements to waive workers\u2019 compensation claims only against the employer, not third parties. In reaching our conclusion, we observed:\nThe Act, as originally conceived, established a dual system of recovery for injured employees against their employers\u2014 principally through the Article III schedule, but, barring that, through an action at law under Article II.\nArticle II remains in the Act, although modified considerably. Section 204(a) now contains a series of provisions pertaining only to offsets enjoyed by the employer to be applied to specific compensation benefits an employer is obligated to pay under \u00a7\u00a7 108 or 306 of the Act. In addition, \u00a7 305(d) explicitly provides an action at law pursuant to Article II continues to be available to any employee whose employer is either uninsured or not an approved self-insurer. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 501(d) (\u201cWhen any employer fails to secure the payment of compensation under this act as provided in sections 305 and 305.2, the injured employee or his dependents may proceed either under this act or in a suit for damages at law as provided by article II.\u201d).\nBowman, 65 A.3d at 908 (footnote omitted). We noted that the Act, in providing for a dual system of recovery, \u201cmade it a violation of public policy for an employer to avoid both recovery tracks.\u201d Id. Were this Court to interpret Section 301(c)(2) as Employers suggest, and hold that Appellants are precluded from seeking damages at common law for their injuries, notwithstanding their inability to seek compensation under the Act, we would enable exactly what this Court in Bowman recognized the Act was intended to prohibit \u2014 an employer\u2019s avoidance of liability through both recovery tracks.\nIndeed, the consequences of Employers\u2019 proposed interpretation of the Act to prohibit an employee from filing an action at common law, despite the fact that employee has no opportunity to seek redress under the Act, leaves the employee with no remedy against his or her employer, a consequence that clearly contravenes the Act\u2019s intended purpose of benefitting the injured worker. It is inconceivable that the legislature, in enacting a statute specifically designed to benefit employees, intended to leave a certain class of employees who have suffered the most serious of work-related injuries without any redress under the Act or at common law.\nThe dissent suggests that allowing employees to seek damages at common law when they cannot proceed under the Act \u201cwould expose employers to potentially unlimited liability for occupational diseases, an exposure that could undermine the compromise of interests\u201d between the employers and employees manifest in the Act. Dissenting Opinion at 93, 81 A.3d at 871. The dissent fails to acknowledge, however, as we have repeatedly emphasized, that the Act is \u201cremedial in nature and intended to benefit the worker, and, therefore, the Act must be liberally construed to effectuate its humanitarian objectives.\u201d Giant Eagle, 39 A.3d at 290; see also Lancaster Gen. Hosp., 47 A.3d at 839. Thus, close interpretations should be resolved in favor of the employee.\nFurthermore, we recognize that Section 301(c)(2), which requires that an occupational disease-based disability manifest within 300 weeks of an employee\u2019s last exposure to the hazards of the disease, \u201cwas intended to prevent stale claims, and prevent speculation over whether a disease is work-related years after an exposure occurred.\u201d Sporio, 553 Pa. at 50, 717 A.2d at 528 (citation omitted). However, allowing an employee to seek recovery for occupational disease-based injuries at common law when the disease does not manifest within 300 weeks of the last employment-based exposure does not, in and of itself, malign this objective. Employers, like any other entity not covered by the Act, will be subject to traditional tort liability requiring a showing by the plaintiff of, inter alia, negligence on the part of the employer, and employers will retain all of their common law defenses. Plaintiffs, in turn, will bear the higher burden of proof in terms of causation and liability. As a result, contrary to the dissent\u2019s claim, employers are not exposed to \u201cpotentially unlimited liability.\u201d Dissenting Opinion at 87, 81 A.3d at 871.\nThus, consideration of the relevant factors set forth in 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(c), particularly the remedial purpose of the Act and the consequences of both Employers\u2019 and Appellants\u2019 proposed interpretations, indicates the legislature did not intend the Act to apply to claims for disability or death resulting from occupational disease which manifests more than 300 weeks after the last occupational exposure.\nFor the above reasons, we conclude the Act does not apply to Appellants\u2019 claims. As a result, we hold that the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) does not preclude Appellants from seeking compensation for their injuries via a common law action against Employers, and, therefore, we reverse the Superior Court\u2019s decision reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of Employers\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\nReversed. Case remanded to Superior Court for remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\nFormer Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices EAKIN, BAER and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736 (as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1 \u2014 1041.1; 2501-2626).\n. Section 303(a) of the Act provides:\nThe liability of an employer under this act shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability to such employes, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin or anyone otherwise entitled to damages in any action at law or otherwise on account of any injury or death as defined in section 301(c)(1) and (2) or occupational disease as defined in section 108.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a) (footnotes omitted). Pursuant to Section 108 of the Act, the term \"occupational disease\" includes, inter alia, \"[ajsbestosis and cancer resulting from direct contact with, handling of, or exposure to the dust of asbestos in any occupation involving such contact, handling or exposure.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1 (Z).\n. Employers, in arguing that the word \"it\" refers to the word \"compensation,\u201d and not \u201cact,\" ignore the possibility that the word \"it\u201d might refer to the word \"act,\" as contained in the preamble, which states: \"The terms \u2018injury,\u2019 \u2018personal injury,\u2019 and 'injury arising in the course of his employment,\u2019 as used in this act, shall include ... occupational disease as defined in section 108 of this act.\u201d\n. Notably, the Act did not always provide the exclusive remedy for workplace injuries. Prior to 1974, participation in the Workers\u2019 Compensation system was elective, although there existed a rebuttable presumption that the employer and its employees accepted the compensation scheme. See, e.g., Bowman v. Sunoco, Inc., 65 A.3d 901, 907-08 (Pa.2013); see also McKinney Mfg. Corp. v. W.C.A.B., 9 Pa.Cmwlth. 79, 305 A.2d 59, 61 (1973) (interpreting prior version of Act and noting \"[ojften forgotten or overlooked is the fundamental premise that when the employer and the employee accept the provisions of the Act[,] their relations become contractual and the employee receives the right to compensation under the statute.\u201d); Fonner v. Shandon, Inc., 555 Pa. 370, 375, 724 A.2d 903, 905 (1999) (observing that 1974 amendments made it mandatory for employers and employees to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation scheme).\n. The dissent, challenging our de facto exclusion conclusion, is correct in noting that the latency period is measured from the first exposure, whereas the 300-week time period is measured from the last exposure, and that, as a result, some mesothelioma claims could theoretically be covered by the Act for persons \"who have had a long occupational history of exposure.\u201d Dissenting Opinion at 96 n.12, 81 A.3d at 873 n.12. However, we question the size of such a group, as, essentially, such persons would have to have had asbestos exposure at the beginning, and continuously up and towards the end (less 300 weeks), of a 30 to 50 year period of employment.\n. As this Court recognized in Daley v. A.W. Chesterton, Inc., 614 Pa. 335, 37 A.3d 1175 (Pa.2012), mesothelioma is an extremely rare disease, even among persons exposed to asbestos, and only between 1000 and 2000 cases of mesothelioma are diagnosed in the United States each year. 37 A.3d at 1188-89.\n. In light of our holding, we need not address Appellants\u2019 constitutional claims."}
