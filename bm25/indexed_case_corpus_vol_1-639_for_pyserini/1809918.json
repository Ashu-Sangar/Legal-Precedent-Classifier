{"id": "1809918", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nThe petition for allowance of appeal is granted, the order of Superior Court, 362 Pa.Super. 522, 524 A.2d 1362, is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, with instructions to dismiss the case. The Insurance Commissioner\u2019s suspension order of May 29, 1979, and the Commonwealth Court\u2019s dissolution and liquidation order of April 21, 1982, precluded the institution or further prosecution of actions against Safeguard Mutual Insurance Company. Common Pleas Court was therefore without jurisdiction to entertain this matter."}
