{"id": "1722062", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nThis appeal arises from a final decree in equity which set aside a sheriff\u2019s sale in Allegheny County.\nThe facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. In 1967 the Luskeys (appellees) of Slippery Rock, Lawrence County, were the record owners of two vacant parcels of land located in the Fifth Ward in the City of Pittsburgh. Subsequent to 1967, appellees sold the property and took back a bond and mortgage for the purchase price of the two parcels. The purchaser of the property defaulted on the mortgage and appellees foreclosed on the property and purchased the property at a sheriff\u2019s sale on May 15, 1970. The sheriff\u2019s deed to appellees was recorded on May 28,1970.\nSubsequent to the above sheriff\u2019s sale, a civil suit was filed against appellees by Albert B. Starr and, after hearing in which appellees participated, a judgment in the amount of $2,317.74 was entered against appellees on November 3, 1972. The judgment was not paid, and on April 4, 1973, Albert B. Starr assigned the judgment to appellant, Steffron, Inc. (Steffron). On April 10, 1973, Steffron, without notice to appellees, caused a writ of execution to issue against the property in the Fifth Ward in the City of Pittsburgh, and, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 3129, the sheriff posted handbills, advertised and sold the property at sheriff\u2019s sale. On May 3, 1973, Steffron bought the property for $1,701.27, which amount comprised costs, taxes and liened water charges. The property had been valued at $52,000 previous to the sale. Steffron recorded its sheriff\u2019s deed on November 30, 1973.\nOn November 13, 1973 the Luskeys entered into a sales agreement with appellee W. Anthony Dunn to sell him one of the parcels sold at the sheriff\u2019s sale. The Luskeys then learned of the sheriff\u2019s sale and brought an action to set aside the sale, and W. Anthony Dunn was permitted to intervene and adopt the Luskeys\u2019 complaint.\nThe complaint alleged, inter alia, that the sale to Steffron should be set aside because the Luskeys received no personal notice of the proposed sheriff\u2019s sale on May 3, 1973, at which time the property was bought by Steffron. The chancellor, after hearing argument on Steffron\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings granted the Luskeys relief, holding that the sheriff\u2019s sale to Steffron was invalid for lack of personal notice to the Luskeys.\nOn April 17, 1975, this court, in Luskey v. Steffron No. 1, 461 Pa. 305, 336 A.2d 298 (1975), declared Pa.R. C.P. 3129 violative of the due process clause of the United States Constitution in failing to provide personal notice to the owner of real estate that was the subject of a sheriff\u2019s sale. On May 9, 1975, this court granted reargument in the instant case for the purpose of determining the effective date of Luskey No. 1.\nPrior to Luskey No. 1, this court and federal courts have found that notice by publication was adequate notice and comported with due process. See Endicott Co. v. Encyclopedia Press, 266 U.S. 285, 45 S.Ct. 61, 69 L.Ed. 288 (1924). Municipalities and purchasers have relied on such prior decisions and it would be manifestly unjust to negate clear titles to real estate purchased in good faith at sheriff\u2019s sales, based on prior notice provisions, given such reliances.\nHowever, as of April 17, 1975, the date of Luskey No. 1, notice was given to municipalities, courts and the legal profession that notice by publication in sheriff\u2019s sales was no longer constitutional. Therefore, we are of the opinion that Luskey No. 1 is applicable to all sheriff\u2019s sales initiated after April 17, 1975. See Swarb v. Lennox, 314 F.Supp. 1091 (E.D.Pa.1970) and Gt. Northern Ry. v. Sunburst Co., 287 U.S. 358, 53 S.Ct. 145, 77 L.Ed. 360 (1932). See also 84 Yale L.J. 1505 (1975).\nDecree affirmed. Each party to bear own costs.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which\nMANDERINO, J., joined.\n. On November 6, 1975, this court amended Pa.R.C.P. 3129 to conform with the mandate of Luskey No. 1. See Comment to Pa.R.C.P. 3129."}
