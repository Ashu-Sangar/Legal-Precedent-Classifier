{"id": "1100742", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 10th day of November, 2004, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is hereby GRANTED, the order of the Superior Court is VACATED, and this case REMANDED. As petitioners\u2019 challenge was confined to the application of this statute, and not its facial constitutionality, the Attorney General did not need to be notified. See Kepple v. Fairman Drilling Co., 532 Pa. 304, 615 A.2d 1298 (1992). This case is therefore remanded for the Superior Court to review the merits of this issue. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice SAYLOR files a Dissenting Statement."}
