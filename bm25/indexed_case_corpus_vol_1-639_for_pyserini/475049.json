{"id": "475049", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThe principal question on this appeal is whether the \u201cChildren and grand Children\u201d specified in the will of John H. Fahey, deceased, take per stirpes or. per capita. The controversy arises out of a suit for partition in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County. The matter was here once before on an appeal from an order entered in a contemporaneous declaratory judgment proceeding instituted in the same court for the purpose of having the respective interests of the various beneficiaries of the decedent\u2019s estate determined ancillary to the partition suit already pending\u201d. Such a course, we held to be improper. It disregarded the procedure statutorily prescribed for partition in the Orphans\u2019 Court: see Fahey Estate, 356 Pa. 535, 52 A. 2d 580.\nThe question is now before us on its merits, the learned court below having entered a definitive decree in the partition proceeding determining the extent of the interests of the testator\u2019s widow (who elected to take against the will) and the devisees of his realty in remainder, viz., the testator\u2019s \u201cChildren and grand Children\u201d. The court held that the grandchildren meant by the testator embraced only such as were children of the testator\u2019s deceased son and daughter and that they and the testator\u2019s children take per stirpes and not per capita. This appeal is by the guardian and trustee ad litem of excluded grandchildren in esse or in posse, being the children (living or unborn) of the testator\u2019s surviving son and daughters.\nThe will was executed in February 1936 and was duly probated after the testator\u2019s death in April 1945. It is holographic and, as such wills frequently are, it is in-artistically drawn. One of its more serious faults lies in its punctuation. In several places, the testator used periods to set off merely dependent or appositive clauses, thus leaving breaks in the context which can be properly resolved only by ascertaining and enforcing the true testamentary intent. Of course, in this, as in all other cases of will construction; the intention-of the testator is to prevail so far as it is disclosed by the language of his will: Prime\u2019s Petition, 335 Pa. 218, 222, 6 A. 2d 530; Scott\u2019s Estate, 313 Pa. 155, 157, 169 A. 73.\nThe portions of the will requiring construction read as follows:\n\u201c3\u2014All the rest Residue and-remainder-of-my estate Real Personal- and Mixed-tvhere so-ev.\u00e9r situate,1\u00a1Of which' I may-Die Siezed or Possessed or-to-which'I may-be' Entitled at the time of my Desease;' I give devise and be- \u25a0 qa\u00e9ath to my beloved Wife Margaret Silvey Fahey; -for \u00e1nd During her Natural life, intrust for-iny Children and grandchildren\n4\u2014I do hereby male Constitute and appoint,'my son, Edward Y.

Fahey:\u201d\n' ' It is an oft-repeated: rule of construction that;-i\u00e1 interpreting a testator\u2019s intent, his will-should be-\u2019read5 in the light of the circumstances attending him -when he made it, such as the condition of his -family, the natural objects of his bounty and the amount and character of hiS property: Mayer\u2019s Estate, 289 Pa.- 407, 410, 137 A:-627; Frisbie\u2019s Estate, 266 Pa. 574, 578,109 A. 668 ; Hermann\u2019s Estate, 220 Pa. 52, \u201958-59; '69 A. 285;' And, while the'words-employed'in :a will\u2018necessarily constitute-the gauge of the'testator\u2019s intent (Lndwick\u2019s Estate, 269. Pa. 3651, 371,112 A. 543);a construction that would'lead to a highly improbable result is to-be avoided, if at all possible-; \u00e1nd a meaning conformable to the testator\u2019s plausible intent should be ascribed to his words if \u00e1gr\u00e9eable to reason: Riegel-v. Oliver, 352 Pa; 244, 247, 42 A..2d 602.\nThe appellant - raises \u25a0 a: preliminary- question. :as,; to what ..beneficial, estate,: if: any, the .testator\u2019s \u00a1widow took. Inasmuch as she .has since elected to; take . against - the \u2022will,-.the question -of het interest under.'the Will may seem academic, but it is-of incidental .importance in: \u25a0determining the decedent\u2019s testamentary scheme as a whole and the extent-of the interests of the beneficiaries thereunder. The appellant contends that, the devise -and' bequest.\u00a1to \u25a0 Mrs.:Fahey of. the residuary - estate \u201cfor1,and' During: her \u2022Natural life; in trust fOr.\u00bbmy'.Children:and grand: Children\u201d Constituted her a trustee for. the children and grandchildren without any \u00a1personal interest whatsoever in the testator\u2019s residuary estate.- Obviously, such a ConstrUc.ti\u00f3n Would\u2019require a'finding1 that, the testator intended by his Will to disinherit his -wife of .a lifetime, with whom \u25a0he had lived,-and, until-his death at the age of eighty-seven, he continued to live,- in-amity. The, latter fact,is not without - significance, , considering \u25a0 the ambulatory character of the will-wherein-the.,testator described \u00a1his spouse as his \u201cbeloved Wife\u201d.. -Beyond question, ;ghe was a-primary object of Ms bounty. In such Circumstances, is it conceivable .that the testator hot only intended not to provide for-his aged, wife \u2014 eighty-four years old-at the tiin\u00e9. of her: husbandts death \u2014 but, also, .to burden, her with'-the-trusteeship:Of an estate embracing,-:inter, alia, twenty-two pieces of-real estate?- What: sensible purpose could:the testator have:\u00a1possibly.thought;he would sub-serve by. placing his property in trust for his- children and grandchildren \u2022 merely for the prospectively \u25a0 brief term of his wife\u2019s short expectancy? Parenthetically, he appointed his surviving son and daughters as the executors- of; his will; - And,- what individual- uses would the trust\u2019be designed to serve? -The answer\u2019is that the; decedent\u2019s plain testamentary intent was to-devise and-be-q.ueath his.-residuary estate .to his \u201cbeloved Wife\u201d-, for her-own use and conservation for life \u00a1with, remainder to Ms children and grandchildren.- Such was the interpretation placed upon the will by the learned court below wbicb properly did not attach any controlling importance to the testator\u2019s use of the term \u201cin trust\u201d. In Groner v. Groner, 105 Pa. Superior Ct. 302, 305, 161 A. 493, President Judge TrexLer, in construing a provision of a will (strikingly similar in material part to the present)- said, \u2014\u201cWe feel that the words \u2018in trust\u2019 have.no legal significance. It is-plain that the testator desired to create a life estate in his wife.\u201d As much can well be said here. And, in Wilbur Trust Company v. Knadler, 322 Pa. 17, 20, 185 A. 319, Mr. Justice Drew, speaking for this Court, said that \u201c. . . the words \u2018trust,\u2019 \u2018trustee,\u2019 and other like descriptive terms are not in themselves sufficient to indicate a trust if in fact the trust is not complete in all its parts: [citing cases]\u201d. See also Tunnell's Estate, 325 Pa. 554, 556, 190 A. 906. Here, the will was peculiarly silent as to the management and administration of a trust res or the.distribution of income therefrom.\nThe appellant\u2019s principal complaint is with the lower court\u2019s conclusion that, under the will of the testator, his children and grandchildren take per stirpes, the latter being limited to the children of his deceased son and daughter,- both of whom had died prior to the execution of the will. No other inference can reasonably be drawn from the will. After appointing by name, his surviving son and daughters executors of his will, he therein expressly \u201ccharge [d] them to be Just & true one to the other and to their nephews and Nieces, the children of my Daughter Hilda Fahey Charles and my Son John S. Fahey\u201d. If the testator had meant by \u201cgrand Children\u201d more than the children of his deceased son and daughter, is it not -reasonable to suppose that he would have used some all-inclusive phrase such as \u201call of my grandchildren\u201d, and would he not, moreover, have charged his surviving son and daughters to be \u201cJust & true\u201d to \u201call\u201d of their nephews and nieces, and not merely to such as were the children of the deceased Hilda and John? If the will were interpreted to mean that, in addition to the children of the deceased son and daughter, the word \u201cgrand Children\u201d was meant to include, as well, the children of the testator\u2019s surviving son and daughters, the result would run directly counter to the well-established rules of construction applicable to the interpretation of wills of doubtful or ambiguous meaning. Thus, under the appellant\u2019s contention, if adopted, more remote kin would be elevated to the status of those nearest of kin; distribution would not be made by classes (children of the testator\u2019s surviving son and daughters would share equally with their parents); and the scheme of the intestate law would be ignored: see Wood Estate, 154 Pa. Superior Ct. 628,632,36 A. 2d 835.\nStill further confirmation of the correctness of the construction adopted by the learned court below is to be had. It is hardly open to dispute that, as between the testator\u2019s surviving son and daughters and his six grandchildren (being the children of his deceased son and daughter), distribution would be made per stirpes: Miller\u2019s Estate (No. 2), 26 Pa. Superior Ct. 453, 455, 457; cf. also Harris\u2019s Estate, 74 Pa. 452, 453; and Minter\u2019s Appeal, 40 Pa. 111, 115. As was said in Mayhew\u2019s Estate, 307 Pa. 84, 91, 160 A. 724,\u2014\u201cApart from anything else, the justice of a per stirpes distribution cannot be denied.\u201d Yet, if the sons and daughters of the testator\u2019s surviving son and daughters were included in the group of grandchildren referred to by the testator, obviously a per stirpes distribution would not be possible: cf. Mayhew\u2019s Estate, supra, at pp. 91-92. The children of the surviving son and daughters, not taking by representation, would necessarily have to share per capita with their living parents. And, of course, in such circumstances, consistency would require that the children of the testator\u2019s deceased son and daughter also share per capita, thus defeating a just per stirpes distribution among the testator\u2019s \u201cChildren and grand Children\u201d. The rule that \u201c. . . in the absence of a contrary intention, children do not take concurrently with their parents but the division is per stirpes\u201d (see Mayhew\u2019s Estate, supra, at p. 91) refutes the appellant\u2019s suggestion that the testator meant to include among the participating \u201cgrand. Children\u201d under his .will the children of his own surviving children.. The will does not call for any such strained interpretation.\nDecree affirmed; costs to be borne by the estate."}
