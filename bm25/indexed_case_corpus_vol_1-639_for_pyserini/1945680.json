{"id": "1945680", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Eagen,\nThe appellant, William Fogan, following a nonjury trial was found guilty of: (1) voluntary manslaughter; (2) aggravated assault and battery; and, (3) carrying a firearm without a license. After arrest of the judgments or a new trial was denied, he was sentenced on conviction No. 2, supra, to serve imprisonment for a term of eleven and one-half to twenty-three and one-half months. On convictions No. 1 and No. 3, supra, he was ordered to serve terms of probation aggregating ten years. *3 From the probation order imposed on the manslaughter conviction, an appeal was filed in this Court. Appeals from the judgment of sentence imposed on the assault and battery conviction and the order of probation imposed on the firearm conviction were filed in the Superior Court and subsequently certified here. The three appeals were consolidated for argument and will be disposed of in this one opinion.\nThe only question for decision is whether or not Fogan\u2019s right to constitutional due process was violated at trial by the admission of evidence, over objection, of an oral and written statement given by Fogan to the police during custodial interrogation.\nConsidering only the testimony of the Commonwealth witnesses, and that portion of the evidence offered by the defense which remained uncontradicted, these pertinent facts emerge from the record.\nOn June 18, 1969, about ten p.m., a gang war broke out on a public street in Philadelphia between the \u201c16th and Wallace Streeters\u201d [Wallace Street] of which Fogan was a member and the \u201cMoroccans.\u201d While members of the latter group were pursuing members of the former, one Alfred Jones was fatally shot and Tryee Wesley was wounded in the right arm. Both of these young men were members of the Wallace Street gang.\nThe police upon learning of the incident immediately undertook to round up all known members of the two gangs for questioning. Fogan and six other members of the Wallace Street gang were picked up about one city block from where the killing occurred and transferred in a police vehicle to the 9th Street Police Headquarters, where they were placed in a cell. About one and a half hours later they were transferred in a police van to the Police Administration Building for questioning.\nFogan was first questioned beginning at 2:30 a.m. on June 19th for about one hour. The questions were of a general nature primarily aimed at ascertaining if Fogan knew anything about the homicide. (Since the Moroccans were the aggressors in the fight and the victims were members of the rival Wallace Street gang, the police at this time were of the impression that the Moroccans did the shooting.) In response to this questioning, Fogan said nothing incriminating. He was not warned of his constitutional rights before or during this questioning. When it was concluded, Fogan was detained in a small sub-interrogation room for several hours, but was not questioned. During this period he was fed but not provided with sleeping facilities.\nAt about 9 a.m., while questioning the wounded Tryee Wesley, the police learned Fogan fired the shot which felled Jones, his fellow gang member, so additional questioning of Fogan began about 10 a.m. Before this questioning commenced, Fogan was informed the police had been informed he did the shooting. He was also fully advised of his constitutional rights including his right to remain silent and his right to have a lawyer present during the questioning to assist him without charge. Fogan then responsively indicated he understood his rights and was willing to answer questions without a lawyer being present; however, he did ask if any of his family \u201cwere out there\u201d and was informed they were not. Immediately thereafter he admitted mistakenly shooting two of his own gang members while intending to hit the onrushing Moroccans. His version of the incident, given in response to the officer\u2019s questions, was then recorded in the form of a formal typewritten statement which when completed he read and signed. Following this Fogan read the contents of the statement into a tape recorder.\nFogan was born on February 2, 1952, and at the time involved was seventeen years of age. He left school in the tenth grade and, according to the school records, had a verbal I.Q. of 84. In September 1968, he had suffered a gunshot wound in one eye resulting in the loss of sight in that organ. At the time herein involved, Fogan\u2019s father was dead and his mother was in the hospital.\nIn support of the position that Fogan\u2019s incriminating statements should have been excluded as evidence at trial, it is first argued this evidence was the fruit of an illegal arrest. Despite the Commonwealth\u2019s protestations to the contrary, the record leads to no other conclusion but that, an arrest was effected, and that it was illegal because probable cause was lacking. At the time Fogan was taken into custody, the only possible grounds for probable cause was the fact that he was a known member of one of the gangs involved in the street fight. However, at this time the police had no information that he personally or the others arrested with him were among those who participated in the fight.\nNot only was the arrest illegal, but we specifically condemn this type of \u201cdragnet arrest\u201d and particularly where it results in hours of involuntary confinement. Such a practice can only lead to the illegal and unjust detention of innocent persons and raise serious doubts in the minds of all good citizens as to whether or not the police live within the law they are charged with upholding. The Commonwealth\u2019s position that Fogan\u2019s police custody (before he confessed) was not an \u201carrest\u201d, but merely the act of detaining and interviewing possible material witnesses is belied by tbe facts and rejected by every pertinent legal decision. See Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721, 89 S. Ct. 1394 (1969) ; Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966); and Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, 411 Pa. 56, 190 A. 2d 304 (1963).\nHowever, accepting the illegality of Fogan\u2019s detention in the first instance, this did not render the challenged evidence inadmissible because, under the circumstances, the incriminating statements involved were not the exploitation of the initial illegality, but were obtained by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint. The issue is identical with that presented in Commonwealth v. Marabel, 445 Pa. 435, 283 A. 2d 285 (1971), and is controlled by that decision. See also Commonwealth v. Bartlett, 446 Pa. 392, 288 A. 2d 796 (1972); Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 445 Pa. 461, 285 A. 2d 93 (1971); and Commonwealth v. Frazier, 443 Pa. 178, 279 A. 2d 33 (1971).\nLikewise, and for the same reason, the failure of the police to warn Fogan of his constitutional rights before the initial questioning did not invalidate as trial evidence his subsequent self-incriminations. Before he incriminated himself, he had full knowledge of his rights. There was absolutely no information obtained during the initial questioning which in any way influenced his self-incriminations seven and one-half hours later. His incriminating statements were influenced by a distinctly different circumstance\u2014the finger of guilt pointed at him by his fellow gang member, Wesley.\nFinally, it is argued the evidence under discussion should have been excluded because the Commonwealth failed in its burden to establish Fogan effectively waived his constitutional rights before incriminating himself. It is urged the totality of the circumstances, age, intelligent quotient, long detention, lack of sleep, absence of counsel or friend preclude, as a matter of law, any finding of a knowing and an intelligent waiver.\nIt is unquestionably correct that the burden of proving a knowing and intelligent waiver of rights during police questioning is upon the Commonwealth by the preponderance of the evidence. Cf. Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, supra. It is also true that where the person involved is of tender years, the attending circumstances must be scrutinized with special care before an intelligent and knowing waiver is declared. Cf. Commonwealth v. Moses, 446 Pa. 350, 287 A. 2d 131 (1971). However, after a studious and thoughtful reading and re-reading of the record, we are not persuaded the trial court committed an error of law in finding Fogan was fully aware of his rights and knowingly and intelligently waived them. We might note that aside from the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence Fogan\u2019s own testimony fortifies the conclusion he had the capacity to and did understand his rights.\nWe realize that well-intending individuals earnestly urge the courts to rule, as a matter of law, that an individual of tender years may never effectively waive his right not to speak when questioned by the police unless he is counseled at the time by an attorney or some friendly adult. With all due deference, we reject this position when the individual questioned has attained the age of seventeen years. As we stated in Commonwealth v. Moses, supra, the more realistic approach in determining if a knowing and intelligent waiver was effected in such an instance is to weigh the totality of the circumstances including the age, maturity and intelligence of the person involved. Our study also indicates this \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d rule is followed in every jurisdiction with rare exception.\nJudgment and orders affirmed.\nThe former Mr. Chief Justice Bell and the former Mr. Justice Barbieri took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMr. Justice Pomeroy concurs in the result.\nSiuce Fogan had been incarcerated for some months while awaiting trial, he was released on probation on the day sentence was imposed.\nAn order placing one convicted of crime on probation is an appealable order. Commonwealth v. Vivian, 426 Pa. 192, 231 A. 2d 301 (1967).\nA pretrial motion to suppress this evidence bad previously been denied after an evidentiary bearing.\nAs to our scope of review, see Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, 429 Pa. 141, 239 A. 2d 426 (1968).\nIt was admitted by Fogan at the suppression hearing (Fogan did not testify at trial) that he was advised of his rights."}
