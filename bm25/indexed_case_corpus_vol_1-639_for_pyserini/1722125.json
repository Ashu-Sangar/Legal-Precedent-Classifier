{"id": "1722125", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nThis appeal arises from a guilty plea by appellant, Robert Lee Montgomery, to a general charge of murder in connection with the deaths of Dorothy Knepp and Donald Snyder. On August 13, 1973, appellant was adjudged guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment. This appeal followed.\nThe facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. On January 22, 1972, Dorothy Knepp and Donald Snyder were shot and killed at the Windmill Tavern, Clearfield County, by appellant, Robert Lee Montgomery.\nOn January 15, 1973, appellant pled guilty to each of the two counts of murder generally. The trial judge, after a \u201cguilty plea colloquy\u201d heard the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The hearing was continued until February 5, 1973, at which time the testimony was concluded, but the court did not render an adjudication of guilt or impose sentence.\nOn March 6, 1973, appellant wrote to the trial judge requesting a hearing be held so that he could withdraw his guilty plea. Appellant stated the shooting was an \u201caccident,\u201d and he mistakenly believed he could still raise that defense on appeal even though he pled guilty to a general charge of murder. Appellant also requested a jury trial. On March 12, 1973, the court below, without a hearing or prior notification to defense counsel or the district attorney, denied appellant\u2019s requests.\nOn August 13, 1973, appellant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment at a state correctional institution for the murders of Dorothy Knepp and Donald Snyder.\nWe are of the opinion that the case should be remanded for a counseled evidentiary hearing to consider appellant\u2019s request to withdraw his guilty plea. Appellant\u2019s letter of March 6, 1973 lists three possible reasons, if sustained by the evidence, which may be grounds to allow withdrawal:\n1. Appellant did not understand that portion of the colloquy concerning defenses.\n2. Appellant requested a trial by jury.\n3. Appellant incorrectly assumed that defenses could be raised on appeal.\nWe believe appellant should have an opportunity to make a complete factual and legal presentation to the trial court. In addition, the Commonwealth should be allowed to present any evidence that \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d would occur if the appellant is allowed to withdraw his plea. See Commonwealth v. Morales, 452 Pa. 53, 305 A.2d 11 (1973) and Commonwealth v. Santos, 450 Pa. 492, 301 A.2d 829 (1973), and Commonwealth v. Starr, 450 Pa. 485, 489, 301 A.2d 592, 594.\nIn these circumstances, proper procedure under Pa.R. Crim.P. 320 requires an evidentiary hearing be conducted to give both appellant and the Commonwealth an opportunity to present both factual and legal issues to the trial court.\nThe record in the above matter is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Clearfield County for an evidentiary hearing to consider the request of Robert Lee Montgomery to withdraw his guilty plea prior to sentencing."}
