{"id": "12278717", "contents": "OPINION\nJUSTICE WECHT\nSection 306(a.2) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act allows employers to demand that a claimant undergo an impairment-rating evaluation (IRE), during which a physician must determine the \u201cdegree of impairment\u201d that is due to the claimant\u2019s compensable injury. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1). In order to make this assessment, the Act requires physicians to apply the methodology set forth in \u201cthe most recent edition\u201d of the American Medical Association (AMA) Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment. Id. In these consolidated appeals, we consider whether this mandate violates the constitutional requirement that all legislative power \u201cbe vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\u201d PA. Const, art. II, \u00a7 1. We hold that it does.\nIn 2007, Mary Ann Protz sustained a work-related knee injury. Shortly thereafter, her employer, Derry Area School District (Derry), voluntarily began paying temporary total disability benefits. In October 2011, Protz underwent an IRE at Derry\u2019s request. The IRE physician evaluated Protz and assigned to her a 10% impairment rating based upon the Sixth Edition of the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (the Guides ). Because Protz\u2019s impairment rating was less than 50%, Derry filed a modification petition seeking to convert Protz\u2019s disability status from total to partial\u2014the effect of which would be to limit the duration that Protz could receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(2) (providing that a claimant with \u201ca threshold impairment rating that is equal to or greater than fifty per centum\u201d is presumed to be totally disabled); 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(7) (limiting partial disability payments to five hundred weeks). After holding a hearing on Derry\u2019s modification petition, a Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge (WCJ) ruled that Protz\u2019s whole-body impairment was less than 50%, and accordingly granted the petition.\nProtz appealed to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, arguing that the General Assembly unconstitutionally delegated to the AMA the authority to establish criteria for evaluating permanent impairment. See PA. Const, art. II, \u00a7 1 (\u201c[T]he legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly, whieh shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\u201d). The Board rejected Protz\u2019s constitutional argument and affirmed the WCJ\u2019s decision.\nProtz appealed to the Commonwealth Court, where she again argued that Section 306(a.2) of the Act violates Article II, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Commonwealth Court, sitting en banc, reversed the Board\u2019s decision. The en banc panel agreed with Protz that Section 306(a.2)\u2019s requirement that physicians use \u201cthe most recent edition\u201d of the Guides violates Article II, Section 1. Writing for the four-judge majority, Senior Judge Dan Pellegrini recited the basic principle that the General Assembly alone has the power to make laws, and it cannot constitutionally delegate that power to any other branch of government or to any other body. Protz v. W.C.A.B. (Derry Area Sch. Dist.), 124 A.3d 406, 412 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015).\nThe court acknowledged that, despite this seemingly broad prohibition, \u201cthe General Assembly may delegate authority and discretion in connection with the execution and administration of a law to an independent agency or an executive branch agency where the General Assembly first establishes primary standards and imposes upon others the duty to carry out the declared legislative policy in accordance with the general provisions of the enabling legislation.\u201d Id. at 413 (citing Blackwell v. Commonwealth, State Ethics Commission, 523 Pa. 347, 567 A.2d 630, 637 (1989)). The court explained that, when the legislature chooses to so delegate, two critical limitations apply: first, \u201cthe basic policy choices must be made by the [legislature;\u201d and second, \u201cthe legislation must contain adequate standards which will guide and restrain the exercise of the delegated administrative functions.\u201d Id. (citing Gilligan v. Pa. Horse Racing Commission, 492 Pa. 92, 422 A.2d 487, 489 (1980)).\nApplying this test, the Commonwealth Court concluded that \u201cthe Act is wholly devoid of any articulations of public policy governing the AMA,\u201d and that the Act lacks \u201cadequate standards to guide and restrain the AMA\u2019s exercise\u201d of its delegated power to create a methodology for grading impairment. Id. at 415. Instead, the court remarked, the General Assembly bestowed upon the AMA \u201ccarte blanche authority to implement [the AMA\u2019s] own policies and standards,\u201d which are then automatically adopted, sight unseen. Id. at 416.\nThe court went on to explain that, even if the General Assembly had included \u201cadequate standards\u201d to \u201cguide and restrain\u201d the AMA\u2019s exercise of delegated authority, Section 306(a.2) still would be unconstitutional because the AMA is a private organization. Along these lines, the court noted that:\nUnlike governmental agencies which are supposed to act disinterestedly and only for the public good, that presumption cannot be made with regard to private entities. There is no accountability to the public, either directly through the rulemaking process providing for public input and comment or indirectly through the appointment and confirmation power and the power of the purse. More simply, the keystone behind the prohibition against unlawful delegation is that the General Assembly, not private bodies, enacts laws which the government agencies implement in accordance with the standard given to them in the enactment.\nId.\nRather than striking all of Section 306(a.2), or undertaking a severability analysis, the Commonwealth Court declared the law unconstitutional only \u201cinsofar as it proactively approved versions of the AMA Guides beyond the Fourth Edition without review.\u201d Id. Consistent with that narrow remedy, the court remanded the instant matter to the WCJ with instructions to apply the Fourth Edition of the Guides, the version in existence when the General Assembly enacted Section 306(a.2) in 1996.\nJudges Anne Covey and Robert Simpson each authored dissenting opinions. In Judge Simpson\u2019s view, Section 306(a.2) withstands constitutional scrutiny in light of the fact that \u201cthe General Assembly delegated initial impairment ratings to an independent, Pennsylvania-licensed, board-certified, clinically-active physician,\u201d not to the AMA itself. Id. at 417 (Simpson, J., dissenting). Judge Simpson also maintained that, because it would be impractical to expect the legislature to establish and constantly revise a set of standards for evaluating physical impairment, \u201cthe General Assembly may rely on the medical expertise of the AMA, a well-recognized independent authority, in expressing current, best-practice medical knowledge.\u201d Id. at 420. Finally, Judge Simpson observed that \u201cother states have adopted and judicially upheld similar workers\u2019 compensation provisions requiring the use of the most recent edition of the AMA Guides in evaluating impairment in workers\u2019 compensation cases.\u201d Id. at 419 (citing Madrid v. St. Joseph Hosp., 122 N.M. 524, 928 P.2d 250 (1996) (rejecting a non-delegation challenge involving the New Mexico legislature\u2019s adoption of \u201cthe most recent edition\u201d of the Guides)). Judge Covey joined Judge Simpson\u2019s dissent and authored a separate dissent addressing the majority\u2019s alternative holding that all delegations to private entities are unconstitutional.\nBoth parties filed petitions for allowance of appeal with this Court, which we granted. Derry takes issue with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that the General Assembly\u2019s prospective adoption of \u201cthe most recent edition\u201d of the Guides violates Article II, Section 1, whereas Protz argues that the Commonwealth Court, after finding Section 306(a.2) to be unconstitutional, erred in remanding her case to the WCJ for application of the Fourth Edition of the Guides.\nWe begin with the non-delegation issue, as to which our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review plenary. City of Phila. v. Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 5 (Breary), 604 Pa. 267, 985 A.2d 1259, 1269 n.18 (2009). Because the parties\u2019 arguments largely reflect the views expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions below, we need not recite them at length. In short, Derry argues that the General Assembly is free to adopt current and future standards that are published by \u201ca well-recognized independent authority.\u201d Brief for Derry at 28 (quoting Protz, 124 A.3d at 420 (Simpson, J., dissenting)). Protz, on the other hand, maintains that Section 306(a.2) violates the non-delegation doctrine embodied in our Constitution because it gives the AMA unfettered discretion over Pennsylvania\u2019s impairment-rating methodology. See Brief for Protz at 16.\nArticle II, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution states that \u201c[t]he legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\u201d Pa. Const, art. II, \u00a7 1. That is why, when the General Assembly empowers some other branch or body to act, our jurisprudence requires \u201cthat the basic policy choices involved in \u2018legislative power\u2019 actually be made by the [(legislature as constitutionally mandated.\u201d Tosto v. Pa. Nursing Home Loan Agency, 460 Pa. 1, 331 A.2d 198, 202 (1975). This constraint serves two purposes. First, it ensures that duly authorized and politically responsible officials make all of the necessary policy decisions, as is their mandate per the electorate. Wm. Penn Parking Garage, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 464 Pa. 168, 346 A.2d 269, 291 (1975) (plurality opinion). And second, it seeks to protect against the arbitrary exercise of unnecessary and uncontrolled discretionary power. Id.\nAt the heart of the non-delegation doctrine, which we have described as a \u201cnatural corollary\u201d to the text of Article II, Section 1, is the tenet that the General Assembly cannot delegate \u201cto any other branch of government or to any other body or authority\u201d the power to make law. Blackwell, 567 A.2d at 636; State Bd. of Chiropractic Exam\u2019rs v. Life Fellowship of Pa., 441 Pa. 293, 272 A.2d 478, 480 (1971). Or, as John Locke put it, legislative power consists of the power \u201cto make laws, and not to make legislators.\u201d John Locke, Second Treatise of Government 87 (R. Cox ed.1982). Indeed, the rule is essential to the American tripartite system of representative government. The framers of the Constitution believed that the integrity of the legislative function was vital to the preservation of liberty. See Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Ass\u2019n of Am. Railroads, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1225, 1237, 191 L.Ed.2d 153 (2015) (Alito, J., concurring) (\u201cThe principle that Congress cannot delegate away its vested power exists to protect liberty.\u201d); see also The Federalist No. 47, at 301 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (\u201cThe accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands ... may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\u201d).\nAlthough our Constitution generally forbids the delegation of \u201clegislative power,\u201d it nonetheless permits the General Assembly, in some instances, to assign the authority and discretion to execute or administer a law. Blackwell, 567 A.2d at 637. When the General Assembly does so, the Constitution imposes two fundamental limitations. First, as mentioned, the General Assembly must make \u201cthe basic policy choices,\u201d and second, the legislation must include \u201cadequate standards which will guide and restrain the exercise of the delegated administrative functions.\u201d Pennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion Fund, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 583 Pa. 275, 877 A.2d 383, 418 (2005); State Bd. of Chiropractic Exam\u2019rs, 272 A.2d at 481 (quoting Chartiers Valley Joint Sch. v. Cty. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of Allegheny Cty., 418 Pa. 520, 211 A.2d 487, 492-93 (1965)). This means, to borrow Chief Justice Taft\u2019s oft-quoted expression, that the law must contain some \u201cintelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.\u201d J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409, 48 S.Ct. 348, 72 L.Ed. 624 (1928).\nIn many non-delegation cases, this Court also has stressed the importance of procedural mechanisms that serve to limit or prevent the arbitrary and capricious exercise of delegated power. Tosto, 331 A.2d at 203; see W. Phila. Achievement Charter Elementary Sch. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 635 Pa. 127, 132 A.3d 957, 966 (2016). In Tosto, for example, the statute at issue required that the administrative agency establish neutral operating procedures, develop standardized documents, and give the public notice of proposed agency rules and regulations before promulgating them. In upholding the law, we described these elements as \u201cimportant safeguard[s] against the arbitrariness of ad hoc decision making.\u201d Tosto, 331 A.2d at 204.\nSimilarly, in William Penn, we upheld a tax enabling statute that delegated to the judiciary the power to assess whether certain local taxes were \u201cexcessive or unreasonable.\u201d Wm. Penn Parking Garage, Inc., 346 A.2d at 291. There, a plurality of this Court found it significant that the General Assembly had assigned this task to the courts, rather than to an administrative body, because the very structure of the judiciary serves to protect against the arbitrariness of ad hoc decision making. In this regard, we emphasized that a trial court operating under the statute \u201cmust explain the grounds of its decision in a reasoned opinion which will serve as a precedent to guide decisions in future cases,\u201d and that \u201ctrial courts are subject to careful review by appellate courts to [ejnsure the general consistency of their actions with one another and to confine them within their proper sphere.\u201d Id. at 291-92.\nThis Court\u2019s most recent non-delegation decision involved a provision in the Public School Code, see 24 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-[ XXX-XX-XXXX ], that gave a five-member School Reform Commission (comprised mostly of individuals appointed by the Governor) sweeping powers to improve the finances of distressed school districts. Among other things, the law delegated to the School Reform Commission the authority to suspend regulations of the State Board of Education and to suspend provisions of the Public School Code. W. Phila. Achievement Charter Elementary Sch., 132 A.3d at 959. The General Assembly placed only minor restrictions upon the Commission\u2019s authority. First, the General Assembly put a few provisions of the Public School Code beyond the reach of the Commission\u2019s suspension power, most of which related to local school-board elections. Second, the General Assembly required that the Commission submit annually a report to the Governor and the Education Committees of both the House and the Senate detailing the progress made in fiscal and academic performance. Finally, individual members of the Commission, as public employees, could be removed by the Governor for \u201cmalfeasance or misfeasance.\u201d Id. at 971 (Baer, J., dissenting). This Court held that the law violated the non-delegation doctrine because it did not include concrete measures to channel the Commission\u2019s discretion to wield its suspension power, nor did it include safeguards to protect against arbitrary, ad hoc decision making, such as a requirement that the Commission hold hearings, allow for public notice and comment, or explain the grounds for its suspensions in a reasoned opinion subject to judicial review.\nBy any objective measure, the authority delegated to the AMA in Section 306(a.2) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is even more broad and unbridled than that of the School Reform Commission in West Philadelphia Achievement Charter Elementary School. The General Assembly did not favor any particular policies relative to the Guides\u2019 methodology for grading impairments, nor did it prescribe any standards to guide and restrain the AMA\u2019s discretion to create such a methodology. Without any parameters cabining its authority, the AMA would be free to: (1) concoct a formula that yields impairment ratings which are so inflated that virtually every claimant would be deemed to be at least 50% impaired; or (2) draft a version of the Guides guaranteed to yield impartment ratings so miniscule that almost no one who undergoes an IRE clears the 50% threshold; or (3) do anything in between those two extremes. The AMA could add new chapters to the Guides, or it could remove existing ones. It could even create distinct criteria to be applied only to claimants of a particular race, gender, or nationality.\nConsider also that the AMA could revise the Guides once every ten years or once every ten weeks. If the AMA chooses to publish new editions infrequently, Pennsylvania law may fail to account for recent medical advances. By contrast, excessive revisions would likely pose severe administrative headaches, inasmuch as the Guides automatically have the force and effect of law once published. As these hypotheticals illustrate, the General Assembly gave the AMA de facto, unfettered control over a formula that ultimately will determine whether a claimant\u2019s partial-disability benefits will cease after 500 weeks.\nEqually problematic, the General Assembly did not include in Section 806(a.2) any of the procedural mechanisms that this Court has considered essential to protect against \u201cadministrative arbitrariness and caprice.\u201d Tosto, 331 A.2d at 203. The General Assembly did not, for example, require that the AMA hold hearings, accept public comments, or explain the grounds for its methodology in a reasoned opinion, which then could be subject to judicial review. Further, the AMA physicians who author the Guides are, of course, not public employees who may be subject to discipline or removal.\nEchoing Judge Simpson\u2019s dissent, Derry argues that the General Assembly restrained the AMA\u2019s authority by mandating that that all IREs be performed by a Pennsylvania-licensed, clinically active physician. See Brief for Derry at 27. We fail to see how this does anything to prevent the AMA from acting arbitrarily. Again, Section 306(a.2) provides that \u201c[t]he degree of impairment shall be determined based upon an evaluation by a physician ... pursuant to the most recent edition of the [AMA] \u2018Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.\u2019 \u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1). Thus, the evaluating physician, who is constrained by law to follow the Guides, has no power to limit the AMA\u2019s delegated authority.\nWe also find unavailing Derry\u2019s suggestion that the General Assembly\u2019s prospective adoption of future editions of the Guides constitutes a \u201cpolicy decision\u201d to use the \u201cthe most up-to-date medical knowledge when making impairment assessments.\u201d Brief for Derry at 29, 33 (arguing that that the General Assembly made the \u201cpolicy decision\u201d to \u201capply the most up-to-date standards reflecting the most current medical thinking\u201d). As an initial matter, we question Derry\u2019s portrayal of the Guides as merely a collection of medical knowledge. See Ellen Smith Pryor, Flawed Promises: A Critical Evaluation of the American Medical Association\u2019s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 103 HARV. L. REY. 964 (1990) (stating that the Guides, \u201clike any impairment rating scheme, [rest] in large part on important and difficult normative judgments\u201d). More importantly, Derry\u2019s contention distills to a tautology: that the non-delegation doctrine, which exists to prevent the General Assembly from delegating its lawmaking authority, is not violated whenever the General Assembly \u201cdecides\u201d to delegate its lawmaking authority. Because this reasoning would render the non-delegation doctrine a nullity, we must reject it.\nThis case involves one additional wrinkle not present in West Philadelphia Achievement Charter Elementary School or in Tosto. Here, unlike in those cases, the General Assembly delegated authority to a private entity, not to a government agency or body. Conceptually, this fact poses unique concerns that are absent when the General Assembly, for instance, vests an executive-branch agency with the discretion to administer the law. One such concern is that private entities are isolated from the political process, and, as a result, are shielded from political accountability. Because of this, it is perhaps unsurprising that our precedents have long expressed hostility toward delegations of governmental authority to private actors. Hetherington v. McHale, 458 Pa. 479, 329 A.2d 250, 254 (1974) (holding that the Constitution \u201cprohibits delegation to private groups of the power to make governmental appointments\u201d); Olin Mathieson Chem. Corp. v. White Cross Stores, Inc., No. 6, 414 Pa. 95, 199 A.2d 266, 267-68 (1964) (holding that the General Assembly may delegate regulatory power to \u201cresponsible governmental agencies,\u201d but not to private persons). Venerable opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States have done so as well. See e.g., Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 311, 56 S.Ct. 855, 80 L.Ed. 1160 (1936) (\u201cThis is legislative delegation in its most obnoxious form; for it is not even delegation to an official or an official body, presumptively disinterested, but to private persons whose interests may be and often are adverse to the interests of others in the same business.\u201d); A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 553, 55 S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570 (1935) (remarking that the National Industrial Recovery Act, which conferred upon private parties the authority to promulgate rules of \u201cfair competition,\u201d represented \u201cdelegation running riot\u201d) (Cardozo, J., concurring).\nThat said, our precedents to date have not unequivocally supported the Commonwealth Court\u2019s view that the General Assembly cannot, under any set of circumstances, delegate authority to a private person or entity. See Protz, 124 A.3d at 416. Notably, this Court occasionally has suggested in non-delegation cases that the traditional constitutional requirements (ie., \u201cpolicy choices\u201d and \u201cadequate standards\u201d) are necessary whenever the General Assembly delegates its authority \u201cto any other branch of government or to any other body or authority.\u201d Blackwell, 567 A.2d at 636 (emphasis added). For example, this Court has held unconstitutional a law that required all chiropractors seeking to renew their licenses to attend either a two-day conference held by the Pennsylvania Chiropractic Society (a private organization), or another \u201cequivalent educational conference.\u201d State Bd. of Chiropractic Exam\u2019rs, 272 A.2d at 479. In striking down that statute on non-delegation grounds, we recited the general rule that the General Assembly must provide adequate standards to guide and restrain the exercise of delegated administrative functions. Id. at 481 (quoting Chartiers Valley Joint Sch., 211 A.2d at 492-93). Put another way, we held that the statute in State Board of Chiropractic Examiners was unconstitutional because it delegated unchecked and unrestrained authority over chiropractic continuing education, not because the Chiropractic Society was a private organization. Id. at 481.\nAlthough we highlight this tension in our jurisprudence, we need not resolve it today. As we have explained, Section 306(a.2) could not withstand constitutional scrutiny even if the AMA were a governmental body. See supra, at 657-60, 161 A.3d at 834-36 (comparing the facts of this case to those in West Philadelphia Achievement Charter Elementary School, 132 A.3d 957). We merely caution that our holding today should not be read as an endorsement or rejection of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s view that the delegation of authority to a private actor is per se unconstitutional. Nor do we foreclose the distinct possibility that a more exacting form of judicial scrutiny is warranted when the General Assembly vests private actors with regulatory or administrative powers.\nHaving determined that the General Assembly unconstitutionally delegated lawmaking authority to the AMA, we now must consider whether the Commonwealth Court erred in remanding this case to the WCJ with instructions to apply the Fourth Edition of the Guides. Although the Commonwealth Court\u2019s rationale in this regard is not entirely clear, it appears that the court\u2019s holding was based upon the fact that the General Assembly, when it enacted Section 306(a.2) in 1996, could have incorporated by reference the Fourth Edition of the Guides.\nAccording to Protz, the Commonwealth Court should have struck down Section 306(a.2) in its entirety. Protz notes that \u201cthe plain language of Section 306(a.2) contains no mention of the Fourth Edition of the AMA Guides; rather [it] simply mandates usage of the \u2018most recent edition.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Protz at 18. Thus, Protz concludes, \u201cthe Commonwealth Court essentially redrafted Section 306(a.2) in a manner that would, in the court\u2019s view, pass constitutional muster.\u201d Id. By contrast, Derry argues that the Commonwealth Court did not err in remanding to the WCJ with instructions to apply the Fourth Edition of the Guides, Derry underscores that the Commonwealth Court \u201cbelieved that the primary flaw in the statute was not that it invoked [the Guides], but that there was no policy review or guidance for determining whether the most \u2018recent\u2019 edition should be applied.\u201d Brief for Derry at 44. Thus, Derry believes that the Fourth Edition of the Guides should govern IREs moving forward.\nAt the outset, it is important to clarify that the non-delegation doctrine does not prevent the General Assembly from adopting as its own a particular set of standards which already are in existence at the time of adoption. However, for the reasons we have explained, the non-delegation doctrine prohibits the General Assembly from incorporating, sight unseen, subsequent modifications to such standards without also providing adequate criteria to guide and restrain the exercise of the delegated authority. Pennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion Fund, Inc., 877 A.2d at 418.\nIn matters of statutory interpretation, the General Assembly has instructed us to assume that it \u201cdoes not intend to violate the Constitution of the United States or of this Commonwealth.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(3), This means that, if a statute is reasonably susceptible of two constructions, one that would render it of doubtful constitutionality and one that would not, we must adopt the latter. See Bricklayers of W. Pa. Combined Funds, Inc. v. Scott\u2019s Dev. Co., 625 Pa. 26, 90 A.3d 682, 692 (2014) (\u201c[C]ourts give statutes a constitutional interpretation if that is reasonably possible.\u201d).\nAs a reminder, the relevant portion of Section 306(a.2) provides as follows:\nThe degree of impairment shall be determined based upon an evaluation by a physician who is licensed in this Commonwealth, who is certified by an American Board of Medical Specialties approved board or its osteopathic equivalent and who is active in clinical practice for at least twenty hours per week, chosen by agreement of the parties, or as designated by the department, pursuant to the most recent edition of the American Medical Association \u201cGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.\u201d\n77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1) (emphasis added).\nDoubtless, most would understand this language to mean that the IRE physician must use the edition of the Guides that is the most recent at the time of the examination. See Stanish v. W.C.A.B. (James J. Anderson Const. Co.), 11 A.3d 569, 576 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2010) (holding that the \u201cmost recent edition\u201d of the Guides is the most recent version in force at the time of the IRE). But, if the above language reasonably can be understood to mean that physicians should use the edition of the Guides that was the most recent edition when the General Assembly enacted Section S06(a.2) (i.e., the Fourth Edition), we should adopt that construction instead. Bricklayers of W. Pa., supra.\nUltimately, however, we cannot accept that such a reading is a reasonable one. It beggars belief that the General Assembly would have used the words \u201cmost recent edition\u201d when it really meant \u201cFourth Edition.\u201d Even more telling is that the General Assembly, in other sections of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, explicitly stated that the Fourth Edition of the Guides should govern. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 513(8)(i)-(iii) (providing that the \u201cImpairment Guides\u201d should be used to calculate the percentage of hearing impairment); 77 P.S. \u00a7 25.5 (defining the term \u201cImpairment Guides\u201d to mean \u201cthe American Medical Association\u2019s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fourth Edition\u201d). This is important because we generally assume that, \u201cwhere a section of a statute contains a given provision, the omission of such a provision from a similar section\u201d signifies a different legislative intent. Fletcher v. Pa. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, 603 Pa. 452, 985 A.2d 678, 684 (2009). The upshot of this is that we must construe the \u201cmost recent edition\u201d requirement to mean the most recent edition in force at the time of the IRE, a state of affairs that, for the reasons we have stated, violates the non-delegation doctrine.\nHaving concluded that the requirement that IRE physicians use the most recent version of the Guides is unconstitutional, we must decide whether it can be severed from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The Act contains a severability provision, 77 P.S. \u00a7 1022, and, as a rule, the individual provisions of all statutes presumptively are severa-ble. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925. Nevertheless, we will decline to sever when, after the void provisions are excised, the remainder of the statute is incapable of execution in accordance with the General Assembly\u2019s intent. See Stilp v. Commonwealth, 588 Pa. 539, 905 A.2d 918, 972 (2006).\nConsistent with our holding, we must, at minimum, strike from Section 306(a.2) the unconstitutional \u201cmost recent edition\u201d requirement. As demonstrated below, such references are pervasive.\n(1) When an employe has received total disability compensation pursuant to clause (a) for a period of one hundred four weeks, unless otherwise agreed to, the employe shall be required to submit to a medical examination which shall be requested by the insurer within sixty days upon the expiration of the one hundred four weeks to determine the degree of impairment due to the compensable injury, if any. The degree of impairment shall be determined based upon an evaluation by a physician who is licensed in this Commonwealth, who is certified by an American Board of Medical Specialties approved board or its osteopathic equivalent and who is active in clinical practice for at least twenty hours per week, chosen by agreement of the parties, or as designated by the department,.. pursuant\u2014to\u2014the \u25a0 most recent edition of the American-Medical Association \u201cGuides to-the-Evaluation of Permanent-I-mpairment.-\u2019-\n(2) If such determination results in an impairment rating that meets a threshold impairment rating that is equal to or greater than fifty per centum impairment under the- most recent-edition of the-Ame-rican-Medical-Association \u201cGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,\u201d the employe shall be presumed to be totally disabled and shall continue to receive total disability compensation benefits under clause (a). If such determination results in an impairment rating less than fifty per centum impairment under the most recent-edition of the-American Medical Association \u201cGuides to the Evaluation of-Permanent Impairment,\u201d the employe shall then receive partial disability benefits under clause (b): Provided, however, That no reduction shall be made until sixty days\u2019 notice of modification is given.\n*1? \u215c \u215c \u215c\u215e\n(4) An employe may appeal the change to partial disability at any time during the five hundred-week period of partial disability; Provided, That there is a determination that the employe meets the threshold impairment rating that is equal to or greater than fifty per centum impairment under the most-recent edition-of-the American Medical-Association \u201c\u25a0Guides to the Evaluation of-Permanent Impairment.\u201d\n(5) Total disability shall continue until it is adjudicated or agreed under clause (b) that total disability has ceased or the employe\u2019s condition improves to an impairment rating that is less than fifty per centum of the degree of impairment defined under the-most-recent edition-of-the American Medical Association \u201cGuides-to-the-Evaluation-of-Permanent Impairment.\u201d\n\u215c \u215c \u215c \u215c\n(7) In no event shall the total number of weeks of partial disability exceed five hundred weeks for any injury or recurrence thereof, regardless of the changes in status in disability that may occur. In no event shall the total number of weeks of total disability exceed one hundred four weeks for any employe who does not meet a threshold impairment rating that is equal to or greater than fifty per centum impairment under the-most recent-edition of the -American Medical Association \u201cGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment\u201d for any injury or recurrence thereof.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2 (footnotes omitted).\nAlthough the prevalence of the offending language, of course, does not by itself preclude severance, excising only this language would render the remainder of Section 306(a.2) incomprehensible. As the above provisions make clear, the Guides are what provide critical context to the statute\u2019s otherwise hollow phrases, such as \u201cthe degree of impairment.\u201d Id. Without the aid of the Guides (or some other similar methodology), what could it possibly mean, for example, to say that a person has \u201ca threshold impairment rating that is equal to or greater than fifty per centum impairment\u201d? Id.\nWe view Section 306(a.2) as a paradigmatic example of a law containing valid provisions that are inseparable from void provisions. Consequently, we must strike Section 306(a.2), in its entirety, from the Act. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925 (\u201c[Provisions of every statute shall be severable ... unless the court finds that the valid provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision or application, that it cannot be presumed the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one.\u201d).\nThe Pennsylvania Constitution prevents the General Assembly from passing off to another branch or body de facto control over matters of policy. As we have explained, this is exactly what the General Assembly did in Section 306(a.2). Because we must enforce Article II, Section 1 without consideration of the exigencies that arise or \u201chow trying our economic or social conditions become,\u201d we affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding that Section 306(a.2) violates the non-delegation doctrine. Holgate Bros. Co. v. Bashore, 331 Pa. 255, 200 A. 672, 675 (1938). Unlike the Commonwealth Court, however, we hold that Section 306(a.2) is unconstitutional in its entirety.\nOrder affirmed in part and reversed in part.\nJustices Todd, Donohue, Dougherty and Mundy join the opinion.\nChief Justice Saylor files a concurring opinion.\nJustice Baer files a dissenting opinion.\n. When Section 306(a.2) was enacted in 1996, the Fourth Edition of the Guides was the \"most recent edition.\u201d Since then, the Guides have undergone two major revisions, the Fifth Edition (in 2001) and the Sixth Edition (in 2008).\n. If an employer requests an IRE within sixty days of the claimant\u2019s receipt of 104 weeks of total-disability benefits, and the IRE yields an impairment rating of less than 50%, the IRE is self-executing, meaning that the claimant\u2019s disability status can be modified from total to partial without the involvement of a Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge. 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1)\u2014(2). Because Derry requested the instant IRE well beyond that timeframe, Derry could not automatically modify Protz\u2019s disability status. See Gardner v. W.C.A.B. (Genesis Health Ventures), 585 Pa. 366, 888 A.2d 758 (2005).\n. It is not even clear that the General Assembly, within the bounds of the Constitution, could meaningfully \"guide\u201d the AMA's discretion over the Guides\u2019 methodology. See Agency for Intl. Dev. v. Alliance for Open Soc\u2019y Intl., Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 133 S.Ct. 2321, 186 L.Ed.2d 398 (2013) (holding that the First Amendment prevents the government from forcing a private organization to profess publicly a viewpoint not held by the organization); Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int'l Union, Local 1000, 567 U.S. 298, 309, 132 S.Ct. 2277, 2288, 183 L.Ed.2d 281 (2012) (\"The government may not ... compel the endorsement of ideas that it approves.\u201d); Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 641, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994) (\"At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence.\u201d). Furthermore, because the use of the Guides is not unique to Pennsylvania law (or even to workers\u2019 compensation law generally), it is doubtful that the AMA would take marching orders from any one state legislature. See Am. Med. Ass'n, Guides To the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 20 (6th ed. 2008) (\"In the United States, 44 states, 2 commonwealths, and federal employee compensation systems (in about 90 + % of US jurisdictions) either mandate or recommend using the Guides to measure impairment in workers\u2019 compensation claims.\u201d).\n. To be clear, we have no reason to suspect that the AMA has exercised its authority in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner. Cf. Amicus Brief for The Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania & The American Insurance Association at 17 (arguing that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion below portrays the AMA as \"some shady, untrustworthy enterprise\u201d and \"reflects a surprising hostility towards the medical profession\u201d). Our Constitution restricts the General Assembly\u2019s ability to delegate legislative authority regardless of the manner in which the recipient wields it. That the AMA has opted to use its powers for good, so to speak, is no antidote.\n. To the contrary, the AMA's revision process has been denounced for its lack of transparency. In a 2004 article, a group of physicians who authored a chapter of the Fifth Edition of the Guides offered the following critique.\nThe paucity of research on the AMA system is striking, given the fact that evaluations based on it determine the allocation of billions of dollars in medical and wage replacement payments. In the absence of scientific data, the AMA system relies almost exclusively on the opinions of panels of medical consultants. Unfortunately, no details have been published about how the expert panels were selected or the processes they followed to reach decisions about impairment. Moreover, since several different groups of experts contributed to the AMA Guides'll there are significant inconsistencies throughout the text.\nThe combination of inadequate validation research and ambiguity regarding the expert panels makes it difficult for us or any other observers to determine which elements of the AMA system are well substantiated, and which ones need significant revision,\nJames P. Robinson, Dennis C. Turk & John D, Loeser, Pain, Impairment, and Disability in the AMA Guides, 32 J. L. Med. & Ethics 315-16 (2004) (footnote omitted).\n. With regard to the federal non-delegation doctrine, at least one United States Supreme Court Justice rejected the notion that the legislature can delegate authority to entities that are not accountable to the public.\nIf rulemaking can be entirely unrelated to the exercise of judicial or executive powers, I foresee all manner of \"expert\u201d bodies, insulated from the political process, to which Congress will delegate various portions of its lawmaking responsibility. How tempting to create an expert Medical Commission (mostly M.D.\u2019s, with perhaps a few Ph.D.'s in moral philosophy) to dispose of such thorny, \"no-win\u201d political issues as the withholding of life-support systems in federally funded hospitals, or the use of fetal tissue for research. This is an undemocratic precedent that we set\u2014not because of the scope of the delegated power, but because its recipient is not one of the three Branches of Government.\nMistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 422, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting).\nAlthough we do not know for certain why the General Assembly delegated to the AMA the task of creating and revising impairment-rating standards, it is not difficult to imagine that it simply viewed the never-ending task of adopting new impairment-rating standards as the type of \u201cno-win\u201d political issue (in the nonpartisan sense) that Justice Scalia described. See David B. Torrey & Andrew E. Greenberg, West\u2019s PA. Prac., Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 6:51.70 (suggesting that the General Assembly sought to avoid \u201cthe thorny political issue of partial disability determination every time the AMA issued a new guidebook\u201d)."}
