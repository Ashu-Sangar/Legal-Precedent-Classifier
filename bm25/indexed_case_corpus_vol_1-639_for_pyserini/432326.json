{"id": "432326", "contents": "The opinion of tbe court was delivered, January 3d 1871, by\nWilliams, J.\n\u2014 By a devise of tbe reversion the rent with its incidents passes to tbe devisee, and consequently tbe appellee became entitled to tbe rent of tbe demised premises, devised to ber for life, which fell due after ber husband\u2019s death, and she might have distrained for it as incident to the reversion. It is true, that at common law distress for rent was allowed only during a subsisting tenancy, but tbe remedy by distress was extended by tbe Statute 8 Anne, cb. 14, wbicb provided that if a tenant retained possession of tbe estate after tbe expiration of bis tenancy, the landlord, if bis interest continued, might distrain within six months for tbe rent due and unpaid. The right of distress was further enlarged by our Act of tbe 21st March 1772, wbicb declares that \u201c it shall and may be lawful for any person or persons having any rents in arrear, or due upon any lease for life or lives, or for one or more years, or at will, ended or determined, to distrain for such arrears, after the determination of the said respective leases, in the same manner as they might have done if such lease or leases had not been ended or determined \u2014 provided, that such distress be made during the continuance of such lessor\u2019s title or interest.\u201d There can be no doubt of the appellee\u2019s right, under the provisions of this act, to distrain the goods of the tenant on the demised premises, at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale, for the arrears of rent which accrued under the original lease, after her husband\u2019s death, notwithstanding the expiration of the term and the subsisting tenancy under the new lease. And, therefore, she was entitled, under the Act of 1836, to payment out of the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale. The landlord\u2019s right to be paid out of the proceeds of sale, as ruled in Moss\u2019s Appeal, 11 Casey 162, depends on his power to distrain on the goods sold; and a landlord having power to distrain, after the determination of the term, is entitled to payment out of the proceeds of a sheriff\u2019s sale of goods found on the premises, under an execution against the lessee. His right to distrain, after the termination of the term, is without limitation as to time; the statute gives him this right whenever the rent is in arrear, and he retains the title. It follows that the court below was clearly,right in decreeing the payment of the arrears of rent in controversy out of the proceeds of sale for distribution.\nDecree affirmed at the costs of the appellant."}
