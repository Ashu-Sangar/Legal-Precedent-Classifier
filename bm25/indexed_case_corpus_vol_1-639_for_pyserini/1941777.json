{"id": "1941777", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nOn January 8, 1968, William English, defendant, appellee, was tried for murder of Roosevelt English (no relation to defendant), which took place on May 31, 1967. After four days of trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were filed and argued. On May 6, 1969, defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was granted and the Commonwealth has taken the present appeal.\nFrom the evidence produced at trial, it is apparent that as the defendant and the deceased (hereafter referred to as Roosevelt) emerged from a tavern they were arguing about a $10 debt which Roosevelt owed the defendant. The defendant hit Roosevelt in the face with his fist and knocked him doivn Avith such force that he struck his head on the pavement. While Roosevelt was unconscious, defendant went through his pockets and removed Roosevelt\u2019s wallet, which was empty. Eight days after being struck by defendant, Roosevelt died. The cause of death was cranial-cerebral injuries resulting from Roosevelt being punched, knocked down and strildng his head on the pavement.\nThroughout the trial, the Commonwealth maintained that the death occurred during the commission of a felony, i.e., attempted robbery, and therefore the killing was a felony murder and consequently murder in the first degree. Defendant contended and attempted to establish that there was no robbery, because he was merely making an effort to collect the flO which Roosevelt owed him.\nDefendant requested the trial Judge to charge the jury that in order to find a felony murder the jury must first find that the defendant intended to rob Roosevelt and that the homicide occurred while defendant was perpetrating a robbery. At various places throughout the charge, the trial Judge did instruct the jury in accord with defendant\u2019s requested point for charge, but the Court went on to say: \u201cEven if the defendant believed that the decedent owed him money, if he tried to take the money by force or violence, it would still be robbery.\u201d Although defendant took no specific exception to this portion of the charge, and indeed no general exception to the charge, it effectively negated defendant\u2019s only defense, and if incorrect it would constitute basic and fundamental error. See Commonwealth v. Jennings, 442 Pa. 18, 24, 25, 274 A. 2d 767. It is this portion of the charge which the trial Judge considered to be error, and this was his sole reason for granting defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.\nThe law is well settled that the grant or denial of a motion for a new trial will not be reversed by this Court, unless the lower Court\u2019s Order was a clear abuse of discretion or an error of law which controlled the grant or denial of the new trial. Commonwealth v. Hartman, 383 Pa. 461, 119 A. 2d 211. See also Commonwealth v. Green, 358 Pa. 192, 56 A. 2d 95.\nIn these days when crime is rampant and disobedience and defiance of Law and Order are so widespread, it would be folly to permit a person who has an adequate remedy at law to take the law into his own hands and attempt to recover his property or his property claims by force or violence or by any other violation of the law. No matter how worthy a defendant\u2019s or any person\u2019s objective may be, Law and Order must be preserved. To allow a creditor to resort to violence or force to recover a debt would be an unwarranted Procrustean stretch of a creditor\u2019s legal rights.\nWe expressly hold that a \u201cclaim of right\u201d does not entitle a creditor to resort to violence or to justify a forcible robbery of his debtor in order to collect-his debts, nor can it create a defense to a felony, such as robbery, or to murder or manslaughter.\nIt is clear that the grant of a new trial was based upon an error of law, and it therefore must be reversed.\nOrder reversed, and case remanded with direction to enter an appropriate sentence.\nCommonwealth v. White, 133 Pa. 182, 19 Atl. 350, has to be construed in the light of the facts in that case. If it attempted to lay down a definition of robbery which is applicable to the facts in the instant case, it is overruled."}
