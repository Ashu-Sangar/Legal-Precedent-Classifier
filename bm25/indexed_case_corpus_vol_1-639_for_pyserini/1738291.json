{"id": "1738291", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nAppellant, Betty Jackson, was convicted of murder of the third degree and criminal conspiracy in a nonjury trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. She filed \u201cboiler plate\u201d post-verdict motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment. The motion in arrest of judgment was granted as to degree of guilt only, and the murder conviction was reduced to voluntary manslaughter. Appellant was sentenced to one and one-half to five years in prison for voluntary manslaughter and five years on probation for conspiracy, the sentences to run consecutively. She appeals from the judgment of sentence imposed on the voluntary manslaughter conviction.\nAppellant raises allegations of error concerning the admissibility of her confession:\n1. Her confession was a product of unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment;\n2. Her confession was involuntary because:\na. An illegal arrest tainted her confession.\nb. Miranda warnings were not given.\nc. There was unnecessary delay in arraignment.\nNone of the above issues is properly preserved for appellate review because of the failure to comply with this court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975). Appellant filed \u201cboiler plate\u201d post-verdict motions in September, 1975, eight months after the decision in Blair, supra. Therefore, because of the lack of specificity required, appellant cannot challenge the admissibility of her confession.\nAppellant\u2019s final argument deals with the propriety of the trial court\u2019s reducing the \u201cdegree of guilt\u201d from murder of the third degree to voluntary manslaughter. This issue is, likewise, not properly preserved for appellate review. Appellant never objected to the diminished degree-of-guilt finding either at the sentencing or subsequent thereto.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed."}
