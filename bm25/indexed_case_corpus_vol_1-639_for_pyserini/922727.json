{"id": "922727", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe conclusion arrived at by the learned judge of the court below was fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s contention and justly resulted in a dismissal of the bill. A sufficient condemnation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim appears in Leaming et al. v. Wise et al., 73 Pa. 173, and in Avondale Marble Co. v. Wiggins, 12 Pa. Superior Ct. 577.\nJudgment affirmed."}
