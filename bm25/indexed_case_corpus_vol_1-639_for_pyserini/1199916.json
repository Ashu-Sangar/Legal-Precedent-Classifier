{"id": "1199916", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from the order of the court below discharging a rule to show cause why the trust created by the will of Michael Uch should not be terminated as being in violation of the rule against perpetuities.\nThe will provided for life estates to testator\u2019s widow and two daughters, with remainders over. Petitioners, testator\u2019s daughters, contend that the remainders created by the will violate the rule against perpetuities. Even if this be conceded, it would have no effect upon the prior limitations which are admittedly valid: McCreary\u2019s Trust Est., 328 Pa. 513, 196 A. 25; Quigley\u2019s Est., 329 Pa. 281, 198 A. 85; Wanamaker\u2019s Est., 335 Pa. 241, 6 A. 2d 852. Under such circumstances, \u201cthere is no occasion for presently deciding whether or not such invalidity exists; such decision must wait until the necessity for it arises\u201d: Quigley\u2019s Est., supra, 294.\nThe appeal is dismissed. Costs to be paid out of the estate."}
