{"id": "1749599", "contents": "OPINION\nPOMEROY, Justice.\nRichard Alexander was shot to death and O\u2019Dell Watson wounded by gunfire in a fracas which took place in Pittsburgh on April 4, 1975. Appellant Charles Francis Terrell was arrested as the culprit and was charged, inter alia, with murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter in connection with the death of Alexander. After a jury had been selected but prior to the presentation of evidence, the Commonwealth moved to nolle prosequi the involuntary manslaughter count, and the motion was granted over appellant\u2019s objection. The jury found Terrell guilty of voluntary manslaughter and several other charges, and acquitted him of aggravated assault. Post-trial motions were filed and denied, and judgments of sentence entered.\nThese appeals followed.\nThe sole question presented in this case is whether the trial court erred in refusing appellant\u2019s timely request for an instruction on involuntary manslaughter. We answer in the affirmative.\nIt is now settled law in this Commonwealth that in prosecutions for criminal homicide under the Crimes Code a defendant has the right upon request to an instruction on involuntary manslaughter at least when there is evidence that would rationally sustain such a verdict. Commonwealth v. Polimeni, 474 Pa. 430, 378 A.2d 1189 (1977) (opinion announcing the judgment of the Court); Commonwealth v. Ford, 474 Pa. 480, 378 A.2d 1215 (1977) (opinion announcing the judgment of the Court). See also Commonwealth v. Dussinger, 478 Pa. 182,194, 386 A.2d 500, 506 (1978) (plurality opinion); Commonwealth v. Gartner, 475 Pa. 512, 521, 381 A.2d 114 (1977) (plurality opinion); Commonwealth v. Garcia, 474 Pa. 449, 378 A.2d 1199 (1977) (plurality opinion). Resolution of this question thus turns on whether the evidence presented to the jury would have justified a verdict of involuntary manslaughter; the absence of an indictment for involuntary manslaughter is not, by itself, controlling. Commonwealth v. Ford, supra, 474 Pa. at 485, 378 A.2d at 1218.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, as accurately summarized in the opinion of the trial judge denying post-trial motions, was clearly sufficient to warrant the jury\u2019s verdict. E. g., Commonwealth v. Kramer, 474 Pa. 341, 345, 378 A.2d 824 (1977); Commonwealth v. Hoffman, 439 Pa. 348, 356-59, 266 A.2d 726 (1970). But in assessing the question of whether an involuntary manslaughter instruction should have been given, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant. Commonwealth v. Polimeni, supra, 474 Pa. at 443, 378 A.2d at 1196; Commonwealth v. Moore, 463 Pa. 317, 321-22, 344 A.2d 850, 852 (1975). The following is a fair summary of a portion of appellant\u2019s testimony:\nTerrell and Alexander, who were friends, were playing cards at another person\u2019s apartment when appellant accused Alexander of cheating. Alexander thereupon scooped up the money on the table and left the apartment. A short time later in the early evening Terrell, who was unarmed, left the apartment and found Alexander inside a jitney station. Terrell asked to talk with Alexander, and at the latter\u2019s suggestion they both went outside. An argument ensued. Alexander then pulled a gun from his jacket pocket. Appellant knew that Alexander carried a knife but did not know him to carry a gun. Appellant explained his subsequent conduct as follows:\n\u201cA Well, I thought he was pulling his knife out, and when I seen the gun, I don\u2019t know, I went berserk, I guess. I grabbed it. Somehow, I got it. I don\u2019t even know how I got it, and I shot him.\nQ And you are saying he pulled the gun out?\nA And I snatched it, yes, I did.\nQ And then what happened?\nA I shot him.\nQ Do you recall that?\nA Yes.\nQ And how many times did you shoot him?\nA Just the once, sir.\nQ And then what happened?\nA This O\u2019Dell Watson jumped me.\nQ O\u2019Dell Watson?\nA Jumped me then and I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t realize what he was doing to me.\nQ Go ahead.\nA I didn\u2019t know him and I didn\u2019t even know what he was trying to do.\nQ Were you afraid of him?\nA I was scared of the whole thing. When I first seen the gun, I was so scared. I didn\u2019t know what to do. That\u2019s why I grabbed it.\u201d\n4c 4c $ \u2021 4c $\n\u201cQ Now during the argument and altercation with Mr. Alexander, did you have any intention of killing him?\nA Of course not.\nQ Did you have any intention to do serious bodily harm to him?\nA No, sir. If I did, I wouldn\u2019t ask him to come outside. I would have went in there and did it when I was in there.\u201d\nAfter Watson was shot, appellant dropped the gun and left the scene.\nWe think that Commonwealth v. Polimeni, supra, is controlling in the circumstances of this case. Here, as in Polimeni, the jury could have found from the foregoing testimony that although appellant had no intention to kill or do serious bodily harm to Alexander, his conduct was nonetheless criminally reckless in that he consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death or serious bodily injury might result to Alexander after he \u201csnatched\u201d the gun. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 302(b)(3), 2504(a). We recognize, as the trial court pointed out, that this theory of the case was shaken by appellant\u2019s testimony on cross-examination, and particularly by his admissions that he knew that the gun was pointed at Alexander. But the testimony contained conflicting versions, as the portions of the testimony set forth in the margin illustrate, and the resolution of these versions was for the jury. See Commonwealth v. Polimeni, supra, 474 Pa. at 443-46, 378 A.2d at 1196-98.\nAs noted above, the question whether an involuntary manslaughter instruction should have been given is the only issue raised in this case. Our conclusion that the instruction should have been given does not, however, affect the jury\u2019s verdicts on the lesser charges, and no questions are presented concerning the sufficiency of the evidence or any asserted trial errors in connection with the convictions for those offenses. Accordingly, the judgments of sentence relating to all the convictions save the one for voluntary manslaughter must be affirmed.\nThe judgments of sentence at No. 3 March Term, 1977, are affirmed. The judgment of sentence at No. 140 March Term, 1976, for voluntary manslaughter, is reversed and a new trial is granted.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which O\u2019BRIEN, J., joins.\nNIX, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a concurring opinion.\n. In connection with the same episode, Terrell was also charged with aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person, carrying a firearm without a license and the commission of a crime of violence while armed with a firearm.\n. Concurrent sentences were imposed with respect to the convictions for voluntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment; a consecutive sentence was imposed on the conviction for carrying a firearm without a license, and sentence on the conviction for committing a crime of violence while armed with a firearm was suspended.\n. A direct appeal from the voluntary manslaughter conviction was filed in this Court pursuant to Section 202(1) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. II, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1978), since superseded by Section 722(1) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722(1) (effective June 28, 1978). Appeals from the remaining convictions were filed in the Superior Court and certified here.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2501-2504, as amended (1973 & Supp.1978).\n. See also Commonwealth v. Smith, 474 Pa. 559, 379 A.2d 96 (1977), in which the majority of a 5-member Court held that an involuntary manslaughter charge must always be given at the defendant\u2019s request regardless of the evidence (Mr. Chief Justice Eagen and Mr. Justice Nix dissented; former Chief Justice Jones and the present writer did not participate).\n. \u201c[A]t approximately 7:00 P.M. on April 4, 1975, Richard Alexander was shot and killed in front of a jitney station in the City of Pittsburgh. Subsequent to the shooting, O\u2019Dell Watson was shot in the head and seriously injured. Upon arriving at the scene, the police were informed that Charles Francis Terrell, defendant herein, was the assailant.\n\u201cO\u2019Dell Watson testified he had been inside the jitney station when he was informed there was an argument outside. Proceeding outside, Watson observed the defendant and the decedent standing face to face, three (3) to five (5) feet apart, arguing. Watson testified that after some argument defendant \u2018just brought his hand out of his pocket and fired,n hitting the deceased in the head[ \u201cWatson believed the defendant was going to shoot him also. He grabbed the gun barrel, and a struggle between Watson and the defendant followed. After a short struggle, defendant freed his hand and Watson realized he was about to be shot. T knew he was getting ready to shoot. So I started trying to move, trying to make him miss me\u2019. Defendant pulled the trigger, the bullet striking Mr. Watson in the head. Mr. Watson lost the sight of one eye as a result of the wound inflicted by the defendant. Other eyewitnesses corroborated Watson\u2019s testimony.\u201d\n. The following testimony by appellant on cross-examination is relevant:\n\u201cQ He was standing there, your friend, and you pointed a gun at him?\nA I didn\u2019t point no gun at him. He pointed it at me.\nQ And you took it from\u2014\nA I snatched it, yes, sir.\nQ And you put it in your hand?\nA Yes, sir.\nQ And you turned it toward him?\nA Yes, sir.\nQ And you pulled the trigger?\nA Yes, sir.\nQ You think it was a cap pistol?\nA I was scared. I don\u2019t know what it was, sir.\nQ Well, you had\u2014\nA I know it was a gun.\nQ You had the gun and he had nothing, according to your testimony, is that right?\nA When I snatched it off of him, that\u2019s right.\nQ You had the gun. He had nothing?\nA I don\u2019t know whether he had anything else or not, sir.\nQ Did you see anything else in his hand?\nA No, sir. I always know he carried a knife, though.\nQ You didn\u2019t see a knife?\nA No, I didn\u2019t.\nQ And you had a gun pointed at your best friend\u2019s chest?\nA Yes.\nQ And you pulled the trigger?\nA Well, with hindsight, I guess I could have ran, if I could run.\nQ But, instead, you stood there and pulled the trigger?\nA Yes, I did.\nQ And now you are telling us you didn\u2019t intend to kill him, you didn\u2019t intend to hurt him?\nA No, I didn\u2019t.\nQ What was your intention?\nA I intended to hurt him, to keep him from hurting me. I was just scared, that\u2019s all.\nQ Are you telling us you intentionally pulled the trigger?\nA I guess I did, sir. I was just scared. 1 don\u2019t realize \u2014 I didn\u2019t even realize what was happening. If I had intentionally pulled the trigger, I would tell you, sir. But I really don\u2019t know what happened. I was just scared and I guess I shot him; that\u2019s all I did because he had to be shot. I didn\u2019t realize it; that\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t realize what was happening. I was just scared, sir.\nQ You knew you had the gun in your hand?\nA Yes, sir, I remember grabbing the gun, sir.\nQ And you know enough about guns that if you pull a trigger and it is loaded the gun is going to go off, is that right?\nA Yes, sir. I didn\u2019t look at the gun to see what it was.\nQ You knew it was a gun?\nA Yes, sir. That\u2019s all I seen. That thing looked like it was big as a tunnel to me when he pulled it.\nQ And then your friend was on the other end of it and it was pointed at his chest?\nA It was pointed at me when I grabbed it, sir.\u201d\nst*\n\u201cQ And when you had it it was pointed at him?\nA It must have. I shot him.\nQ Are you telling\u2014\nA I didn\u2019t point it at him.\nQ Are you telling us you don\u2019t remember pointing it at him?\nA This happened so fast, I just shot him. I grabbed the gun and shot him. I didn\u2019t stop to think. I was just scared, that\u2019s all I know.\u201d"}
