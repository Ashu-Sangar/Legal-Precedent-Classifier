    <p class="headnotes" id="b395-10" data-blocks='[["BL_395.9",395,[122,2145,1170,277]]]'>2. By the provisions of the Act of February 14th 1866, section 1, Pamph. L. 28, granting the right of appeal to the Supreme Court in cases of preliminary injunctions, the pendency of such apx&gt;eal does not suspend the proceedings in the original suit. Hence, the fact that the appeal has been pending for a long time in the Supreme Court, constitutes no reason for that court to depart from its usual course in passing upon preliminary injunctions, for the case might, in the meantime, have been prosecuted in the lower court to a final decree.</p>

    <p id="b396-14" data-blocks='[["BL_396.19",396,[295,1855,1159,86]]]'>The appellants subsequently presented a petition for a rehearing, and filed the following reasons:—</p>
    <blockquote id="b396-15" data-blocks='[["BL_396.20",396,[294,1939,1159,215]]]'>First. The effect of dismissing the appeal and permitting the preliminary injunction to stand is not to leave things in the condition in which they were originally, but on the contrary suspends the working of a portion of the appellants’ mines for an indefinite period, to their very great loss.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b396-16" data-blocks='[["BL_396.21",396,[293,2152,1160,160]]]'>Second. The plant of the appellants, as shown by the proofs before the court, cost over $300,000, and they are disabled by the in junction from working a portion of their mines, to their manifest loss.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b396-17" data-blocks='[["BL_396.22",396,[292,2320,1160,92]],["BL_397.1",397,[128,403,1172,87]]]'>Third.

    <blockquote id="b397-6" data-blocks='[["BL_397.6",397,[130,489,1168,172]]]'>Fourth. The utmost loss sworn to is in Conville’s case, and as shown by his evidence is not more than $1,500.

    <blockquote id="b397-7" data-blocks='[["BL_397.7",397,[129,654,1171,349]]]'>Fifth. So far from preserving things in their existing condition at the time the injunction was granted, the preliminary injunction arrested the defendants in the pursuit of their usual and ordinary lawful business, when, as shown by complainants’ witnesses, all or nearly all the alleged damage to their property had been already committed. Such damage, moreover, was capable of exact pecuniary estimate. The continuance of this injunction perpetuates this abnormal, irregular, and unjust state of things.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b397-8" data-blocks='[["BL_397.8",397,[130,1002,1167,555]]]'>Sixth. The effect of dismissing this appeal is practically to do away with the Act of Assembly authorizing an appeal from a preliminary or interlocutory injunction. It will moreover be attended by consequences very disastrous to the mining interest? of the Commonwealth. A threat of an injunction will induce coal operators, under the fear of. having their business stopped, to submit to any terms, no matter how severe, their opponents may demand, rather than risk the granting of a preliminary injunction ; since the dismissal of the present appeal will be erected into a precedent for the granting and perpetuation of any preliminary injunction, no matter how improvidently the same may have been allowed, until the final hearing of the cause. This is apparent from the following considerations, viz.:—</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b397-9" data-blocks='[["BL_397.9",397,[127,1558,1167,340]]]'>
      <em>(a.) </em>Whenever the workings of a mine are stopped by a preliminary injunction, the gangways may fall in, the gangway pillars are liable to be crushed, and all the coal left standing is lost unless the workings are reopened, an operation more dangerous and expensive than the original opening of the works, and sometimes involving a cost greater than the value of the coal which can be obtained, because but a small portion of the coal so left can then with safety be taken out.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b397-10" data-blocks='[["BL_397.10",397,[126,1898,1165,173]]]'>(5.) The surface owners are persons of small means, and could not pay the damage caused by such suspension of the workings, even if judgment were obtained against- them, and could not furnish adequate security therefor.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b397-11" data-blocks='[["BL_397.11",397,[127,2070,1165,160]]]'>(c.) The Messrs. JElecksher have already suffered damage by reason of preliminary injunctions, issued at the instance of surface lot'owners, to the extent of over $50,000, in the working of the mines involved in this suit.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b397-12" data-blocks='[["BL_397.12",397,[118,2238,1175,175]]]'>Seventh. The rights of the complainants are founded upon -grants, in each case reserving all the coal under their respective lots, and their rights can not be increased or diminished on a final hearing.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[304,400,1167,297]]]'>
      <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>Eighth.

    <blockquote id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[303,696,1164,87]]]'>Ninth. This cause has been pending in the Supreme Court for more than two years.</blockquote>

The fact that the appeal has been pending in this court for a long time, furnishes no reason why the case shall not go to a final decree. An appeal from a preliminary decree does not prevent nor delay any action leading to a final decree.</p>
    <p id="b398-7" data-blocks='[["BL_398.7",398,[300,1083,1164,211]]]'>The first section of the Act of Mth February 1806, P.
