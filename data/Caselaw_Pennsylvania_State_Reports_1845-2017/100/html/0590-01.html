The law seems to contemplate a retention, by the widow or children, of property belonging to the decedent at his death, and the appraisement of it by the appraisers of decedent’s personalty. But it must be of something owned by decedent at his death: Witmer’s Appeal, 2 Pearson 473. She can demand it in money or notes, if there be such, and then there need be no appraisement; but ill there be no money or notes, and she desires the exemption in personalty, she must claim the specific articles, and demand an appraisement of them, and there is no provision in the Act of Assembly, on which her claim is based, for a demand by her of <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>tbe proceeds of the sale of personal estate sold by the administrators, in the ordinary course of administration. These conclusions are sustained by Witmer’s Appeal, supra; Davis’ Appeal, 10 Casey 256 ; Baskin’s Appeal, 2 Wr. 65 ; Hufman’s Appeal, 31 Sm. 329 ; Seller’s Estate, 1 Norris, 153.

Having declined to retain any of the personalty, having refused an appraisement of it, having claimed her exemption in money, and the evidence being that there was no money on hand belonging to decedent at his death, the auditor is of the opinion that the widow cannot claim, in this distribution, $300 of the proceeds of personalty sold by the administrators in the ordinary course of administration. This conclusion is independent of the alleged ante-nuptial contract.</p>

To prove the existence of the alleged contract, two of decedent’s daughters, claimants in this distribution, and two sons, who were also administrators and claimants, and the husband of a daughter, a claimant, were called, and testified to matters occurring in the life-time. To disprove its existence, Mrs. Hunt, the widow of the intestate, claiming against the alleged contract, was called, and testified to matters occurring in the life-time. On behalf of the children, it was contended that as they were not claiming as creditors, were not seeking to charge the estate with any debt or liability incurred in the life-time, they were within the exception to the proviso to the first section of the act of April 15th 1869, and were competent witnesses to testify to matters occurring in the lifetime. But that the widow was seeking to charge the estate, occupied the position of a creditor of the estate seeking to set aside a contract of the intestate, made in his life-time, and therefore incompetent.</p>

But it was earnestly insisted that the children were not competent. After a careful consideration of all the authorities, your auditor has come to the conclusion that the children and the widow are all alike competent witnesses to testify as to the facts occurring in the life-time of the intestate. . . . Were the widow and children claiming as. creditors, they would all be alike incompetent to testify to matters 'occurring in the intestate’s life-time: Hoopes <em>v. </em>Beale, 9 Norris, 82; Taylor <em>v. </em>Kelly, 30 Sm. 95 ; McBride’s Appeal, 22 Sm. 480; Gyger’s Appeal, 24 Sm. 48. Claiming, as they all do, by devolution on the death of the former owner, they are all within the exception to the proviso of the 1st sec-ion of the act of April 15th 1869, and all alike competent. The evidence adduced to establish the existence of the alleged ante-nuptial contract, consists solely of the acts and declarations of the husband and wife during his life, and of her acts and declarations after his death. The evidence to disprove its existence solely of acts and declarations of the husband during the time the marriage relation existed, and the testimony of the widow in her own behalf before the auditor.</p>

The statement was made in the wife’s presence, in direct response to a similar statement made by her ; and was against his interest at the time it was made, involving as it did a surrender of his right to her personalty if he should survive. The interest of each party during the married life, involved in the existence or non-existence of the alleged agreement, consisted solely of the right to the property of the other which would devolve on the survivor. The declaration of the husband, testified to by Koller as having been made in the wife’s absence, though against his interest, are not evidence against her in this proceeding: Jones <em>v. </em>McKee, 3 Barr 497-500. . . . The declarations of decedent testified to by Joseph Stermer, George H. Stermer, Winfield Flury, Valentine Trout and Charles Metzel, (to whom he declared’ that he had made no marriage contract), are not, in your airditor’s opinion, competent legal evidence for the purpose for which offered.

It is true that the children are claiming here uncTer him, and that in many cases the declaration of a former owner against his interest, respecting the subject matter in dispute between those on whom his rights have devolved by death and others, are evidence against tlie former. But here both parties are claiming by devolution at the death of the former owner, and the declarations, though against the interest of the one party, were in his favor, if he had survived.

The auditor and court ruled that the parties claim by devolution, and, therefore, are competent witnesses under the act of April 15th 1869.</p>

The basis of the objection was the real or pretended contract. That aside, nothing was in the way of <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>the widow taking the third part by operation of law. That established, the children took that third by virtue of the contract. It is admitted that if she were a creditor of the estate, claiming under a contract, that she could not testify in her own behalf, nor could they against her. By the settled construction of the proviso to the first section of the act of 1869, the act does not apply to any civil proceeding when such contract is sought to be enforced. Where one of the parties to a contract is dead, the issue arising thereon between the survivor and the representatives of the deceased is excepted out of the operation of the act.' Hero it is not the widow who claims a contract; she denies it, but the children allege one which defeats her and inures to their benefit. Their right under that contract passed to them from the decedent by law, and he is the assignor within the meaning of the statute. No disguise can conceal the real issue, which involves the simple inquiry and no other, whether Venus and Eupliemia Webb made an ante-nuptial contract that the survivor should take no part of the estate of the deceased. Any action or proceeding for the determination of that issue, is not within the act allowing parties in interest to be witnesses.</p>

To one he remarked, after denying that he had such agreement, that he had children by his former wife, and that if lie dropped off his wife would come in for what the law allowed her; also that if she died first, he would take what the law allowed out of her estate. All these declarations were rejected, for the reason that “ they were manifestly in his own interest if he survived, and not against his interest in any possible event.” The very point in dispute was the making of the alleged contract, averred by one party and denied by the other. Had the point arisen in the lifetime of Venus, his wife could have proven his admissions that there was no such contract, whether such admissions at the time they were made were self-disserving or self-serving. They were offered against those who actually claimed under the contract, no matter what was the form of their claim, and wdiose right to the property or money in dispute hung upon the establishment of it. Clearly one of the alleged parties had the right to prove the other’s admissions that, they had made no such contract or agreement.</p>
