The owners of a certain colliery conducted the blow pipe from their boiler some distance underneath a narrow track, terminating in a wooden box open at one end and buried under the track at a point about tweuty inches below the surface.

Several of these, perceiving steam escaping from a point in the track above the box, stepped aside to escape injury. Plaintiff, however, kept on the track, fell into the hole, and was injured. Defendants requested the court to charge that if steam was issuing from the ground at the place where plaintiff was injured, and ho saw it and went into it, he was, as matter of law, guilty of such contributory negligence as precluded recovery. The court declined so to charge. <em>Held, </em>that this was error, and that the point should have been affirmed.</p>

On arriving at the surface, the plaintiff started to go to the repair shop, and while passing along a narrow pathway, between two parallel railroad tracks, on both of which cars were standing, his feet and logs sank into a hole about two and a half feet deep, containing hot water and steam, whereby he was severely scalded.

An employer is not bound to furnish for his workmen the “ safest” machinery, nor to provide the “ best methods ” for its operation, in order to save himself from responsibility for accidents resulting from its use. If the machinery be of an ordinary character, and such as can, with reasonable care, be used without danger to the employee, it .is all that can be required from the employer; this is the limit of his responsibility, and the sum total of his duty: Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Sentmeyer, 11 Nor. 276. We suppose this part of the learned judge’s charge to have been a mere matter of inadvertence, for elsewhere in that charge his instruction on this branch of the law is unexceptionable. Nor do we exactly see how, under the facts of this case, it could have done the defendants any serious harm. The method of using the blow-off pipe of their boilers was certainly not a strong point of their case. This pipe, used for the blowing off of some six or more boilers, terminated in a wooden box some twenty inches or two feet in the ground, and directly under the path over which the hands from the colliery were constantly passing and repassing to and from the repair shop and prop-yard. That the action of the water and steam, thus confined, must necessarily hollow out and cave in the loose material around and above it was something that did not require the learning of an expert to foresee and predict, and we think it would take a good deal of evidence and a very ingenious argument to convince a jury of average intelligence that such an arrangement was one of even ordinary safety. Were there, therefore, no other error in the case of a more material character, we would hesitate before reversing on account of the one above stated; nevertheless, as the case goes back, it is proper that attention should be called to it in order that it ma}’' not be repeated.</p>

The court should not have approved of an assumption of this kind, for the question of negligence, however obvious, was for the jury and not for the court. But the material error of this case is found in the refusal of the court to affirm, without qualification, the defendant’s second point. If, indeed, ae seems to be the fact from the evidence, steam was issuing from the ground at the place where the plaintiff was scalded, and, with his eyes open, he walked into it, he was certainly negligent as to his own safety, and ought not to have recovered.
