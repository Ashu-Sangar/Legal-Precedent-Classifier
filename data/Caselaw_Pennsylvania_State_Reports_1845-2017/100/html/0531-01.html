The deed had already been prepared by Esquire Jjeas, so as to convey the title to Bomberger, as called for by the agreement with Sherman ; but Mrs. Bomberger objected to this and wanted the conveyance to be made to her, giving as a reason that she was furnishing the greater part of the money to pay for the property. Bomberger, however, would not allow the change to be made, and, after some delay caused by this disagreement, the deed, as Esquire Leas had prepared it, was executed and delivered to Bomberger, who then paid the consideration money with bis wife’s $1,500, and $500 of other money, which he at that time got through Esquire Leas from Henry Rife. Previous to this day, Rife had promised Bomberger a loan of $1,000, on judgment security, and left the money with Leas to be handed over to Bomberger, which Leas did as soon as the deed was executed, taking for Rife therefor a judgment from Bom<a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>berger, and this became the first judgment lien on the land after the conveyance. Before paying Rife’s money' over to Bomberger, Leas knew that a part of the purchase money for the land was furnished by Mrs. Bomberger, and that she on that account asked to have the land conveyed to her, but, when her husband refused to allow this to be done, he (Leas) suggested that if she did not get the deed she ought to have a judgment for her money, or something to show that it was not a gift to her husband. Some days subsequent to the execution and delivery of the deed, Bomberger and his wife came back to the office of Esquire Leas, and Bomberger gave his wife a promissory note for $1,500, which Leas drew up for them.</p>

The auditor has so decided, and I do not see how he could have done otherwise. The wife supplied three-fourths of the purchase money, and wanted the conveyance made to her on that account. This the husband refused to have done, but still used his wife’s money in paying the consideration. At' the very time her money was being used in-this way, she asserted her rights, and demanded to have her separate estate preserved and assured to her, and this she did not secretly, but openly and in the presence of the person whom Rife had intrusted with the duty of securing the loan he had promised the husband. What else was the wife to do ? Must she have quarreled and struggled with her husband, and resorted to physical force to prevent the misappropriation or destruction of her estate 2 The law does not require this. She having furnished the money and demanded that, on that account, the conveyance should be made to her, it was enough; and as he, in the face of this, took the title in his own name, paying three-fourths of the consideration at the time with her money, a trust resulted to her, in the land, to the extent of the purchase money applied out of her separate estate. If a husband purchases land with the separate estate of his wife in his hands and takes the title -in his own name, a trust results to the wife: Perry on Trusts, sec. 127; Kline’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20463" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Wright 463">3 Wright 463</a> ; Raybold <em>v. </em>Raybold, 8 Harris 308 ; Fillman <em>v. </em>Divers, 7 Casey 429; Peiffer <em>v. </em>Lytle, 8 P. F. Smith 386. He will hold the title in trust for his wife, and his giving to her subsequently a judgment for the money ■would not convert his situation of trustee into that of a mere debtor: Fillman <em>v. </em>Divers, supra. In view of what occurred at the Squire’s office, when Bomberger took the conveyance of the legal title in his own name, his giving the note afterwai’d to his wife did not convert her into a mere common creditor of her husband. Notwithstanding this, the trust in her own favor which arose at the inception of the title continued.</p>

There is no evidence at all that the purchaser had notice of the trust. It is a universal rule, that if a man purchase property of a trustee, with notice of the trust, lie shall be charged with the same trust, in respect to the property, as the trustee from whom he purchased. And the opposite proposition is also true, that a purchaser for a valuable consideration without actual or constructive notice of the trust, holds the property discharged of the interest of the <em>cestmi que trust. </em>I am speaking, of course, <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>of the acquisition of the legal title. Nothing is clearer than that a purchaser for a valuable consideration, without notice of a prior equitable right, obtaining the legal estate at the time of his purchase, is entitled to priority in equity as well as at law, according to the well-known maxim, that where equities are equal the law shall prevail: Perry on Trusts, sections 217 and 218. As has been seen, there is no evidence to show that this purchaser had any notice of the trust. The presumption is. that he purchased without notice, and being therefore a purchaser of a legal title without notice of the trust, and for a valuable consideration, he took the land discharged of the trust, and now the <em>cestue que trust </em>must come in on the fund or lose all. In Kline’s Appeal, the Orphans’ Court sale did not discharge the land of the trust, if any resulted to Mrs. Kline, for the very reason that the purchaser had notice of the alleged trust — not only did he have notice of the trust, but asked to have the sale confirmed. There were also a mortgage .lien and a purchase-money judgment against the land. The closing sentence in the opinion delivered by Strong, Justice, is in these words: ‘ Moreover, the purchaser asks to have the sale confirmed, and the mortgagee and judgment creditor have rights superior even to the equity of the appellant, if she has any.’ The land being discharged of the trust by the administrators’ sale, Mrs. Bomberger may come in on the fund. Say the authorities, the <em>cestui que trust, </em>may proceed against the land or the fund derived from the sale of the legal title : 2 Story’s Equity, sec. 1262 ; Perry on Trusts, sec. 128; but as the land is now discharged of the trust her only resource is to the fund derived from the sale.</p>

From the testimony of Sherman and Leas, nothing can be more clear than that Mrs. Bomberger advanced her own money on the purchase from Sherman, and that, under the express arrangement that the deed was to be made to her. Not only was this her previous understanding and settled determination, but at the <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>very time of the delivery of that deed, she insisted upon having it so executed, and never voluntarily agreed to anything else. But what could she do ? Her husband had obtained the possession. of her money; money that had been but the evening before paid over to her by her brother, from her mother’s estate, and thus paid for the express purpose of investing it in this land ; the justice had already drawn the deed in his name, and he, the husband, peremptorily refused to permit it to be altered. Not only so, but he refused, not indeed on her suggestion, but on that of the justice, even to secure her by a judgment note. If this was a loan by Mrs. Bomberger to her husband, it was a forced one ; one to which she never assented, and the note, afterward given to, and accepted by her, could not, by implication, bind, her to that which was, in no sense, her voluntary contract. In all this she was powerless to accomplish her own purpose, and she was compelled to succumb to the will of her husband. Nor was that husband, at this time, if we believe the evidence, at all fit to transact business for himself, much less to direct and control that of his wife. Charles Sherman says: “ The only reason I can give for the deed not being made in her name, was that Joseph Bomberger was a little contrary. I did not consider he was in his right mind ; he had a stroke.”</p>

Mrs. Bomberger’s money is taken and invested in land, the deed to which was to have been made to her, but which, in fact, and without her consent, was made to her husband. We think this case in all its phases is covered by that of Fillman <em>v. </em>Divers, 7 Ca. 429, in which it was said by Mr. Justice Strong, “if it was the wife’s money which paid for the lot, and if, in addition to this, this money was obtained by the husband on condition that the deed should be taken in the wife’s name, as the evidence would seem to show, the law, as it was before 1848, regarded the husband as a trustee for the wife. Nor did the fact of his giving a note for the money, and subsequently a judgment, convert his situation as trustee into that of a mere debtor.’ ’</p>

The sale was of the property as unincumbered, and the money <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>raised by it now stands in its place, and as it can be directly and certainly divided and apportioned among the owners thereof, so must it be divided and apportioned: Thompson’s Ap. 10 Har. 16.</p>
