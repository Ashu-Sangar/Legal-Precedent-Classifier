The grant was not altogether an executed gift, there was executory consideration. The statute or charter could not be enrolled or have the force of law until the tax of $210 was paid. It could have no effect prior to the payment of the enrollment tax: Act of 1845, P. L. 532. From October 25th 1867, till January 21st 1882, the corpora-tors did nothing. For fifteen years there was no organization, either bona fide or mala fide ; no stockholders, no directors, and the charter named no persons to act as directors and officers previous to an election. In strictness the corporation did no act whatever; the corporators paid the enrollment tax to give the statute effect, and acquired the charter.' There was a com<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>píete failure to exercise any corporate power — an absolute non-user of the franchises. Such non-user was equivalent to a surrender. What is a reasonable time within which the corporators should begin the performance of their duties under the charter depends much upon,the particular circumstances, but it is clear that in a case like this it could not be fifteen years, or even five. “A private corporation created by the legislature may lose its franchises by a mis-user or a non-user of them ; and they may be resumed by the government under a judicial judgment, upon a quo warranto to ascertain and enforce the forfeiture. This is the common law of the land, and is a tacit condition annexed to the creation of every such corporation.” Terrett <em>v. </em>Taylor, <a href="/us/13/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="9 Cranch 43" data-case-ids="533628" data-case-paths="/us/13/0043-01">9 Cranch 43</a> (Per Story, J.); Mumma <em>v. </em>The Potomac Co., <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Pet.%20287" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="8 Pet. 287">8 Peters 287</a>.</p>

In January 1874, the constitution took effect, and article 16, section 1, declares that “ All existing charters or grants of special or exclusive privileges, under which a bona fide organization shall not have taken place, and business been commenced in good faith at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall thereafter have no validity.” The purpose of the schedule was to prevent inconvenience arising from changes in the constitution, not to nullify any of its provisions. It cannot be justly said that because the second section of the schedule continues in force all laws not inconsistent with the constitution, that all private laws which are declared of no validity are also in force. That section saves rights and contracts, not charters and grants of special or exclusive privileges. If any charter is a valid, subsisting contract, it is because it is not included in the terms of the first section of the sixteenth article.</p>

It is to no purpose to discuss the power of a constitutional convention, for the constitution is the law adopted by the people themselves. A revocation of a charter by them ought to have like effect as if by their representatives. The defendants claim under a contract with the state. They show payment of the tax or price for its enrollment, and that no part of its consideration was paid or performed for nearly seven years, when the state revoked it. They waited eight years longer without complaint or action. They had invested nothing, and there is no pretense that the revocation was unjust to the corporators, unless they had the right to perpetually hold the charter without performing any of its express and implied duties. They had no such right. A charter under which no corporate action has ever <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>been taken, after a reasonable time lias elasped, can be avoided by the state at common law. A change of remedy which is not prejudicial to the rights of either party to a contract, does not impair it. Where the corporators have entirely failed to exercise any corporate power within the time named in the charter, or if none be named, within a reasonable time, it is immaterial to them whether the forfeiture be declared by a quo warranto or proceeding in the nature thereof, or by legislation. In either case the result follows the legal ncn-user. Then, the commonwealth may, by legislative or constitutional enactment, annul and avoid all charters or grants of special or exclusive privileges, under which an organization shall not have taken place, and business been commenced. ' The constitutional revocation, which took effect in January 1874, applies to no charter which had become a contract and under which a corporation had legal existence; but it repealed all statutes granting special or exclusive privileges, which, at that date, were subject to revocation or appeal.</p>
