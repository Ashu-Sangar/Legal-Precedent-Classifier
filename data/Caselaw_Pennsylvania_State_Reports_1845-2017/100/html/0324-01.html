Understand me. I say the firing of a pistol loaded with a ball cartridge, in a car inhabited with passengers at the time of its discharge, is a flagrant violation of the law, is stamped with illegality, and has nothing whatever to justify it. I repeat, that the fact that the pistol loaded with ball cartridge was discharged in a car whereby one of the passengers might be struck, carries with it, in legal contemplation, implied malice, and if you so find, then the very wording of the Act of Assembly has been proven, namely, an unlawful act under circumstances of implied malice. . . .</p>

If you believe that these people were about passing out of the car and crowded into the aisle when that pistol was discharged, it carries with it implied malice in the law. Do not let us deal in any delicate or sentimental way. The man that does so takes the risk ; he knows there is great danger, not to him, but to any one whose person or limb may be in the direction of the pointed weapon, |i and therefore he stands in no particular favor or relation to a court of justice, when he must have known, in the very nature of things, that great injury would necessarily be done to some of his fellow-passengers the moment he pulled the trigger' if the ball happened to hit a passenger. If such were not the law, every criminally disposed man in the Commonwealth would receive a premium for taking his place in crowded places and indulge in criminal sport. . . . Let it be known that the man who uses a deadly weapon in such places, whilst he challenges the law, takes all the consequences, however dire they may be, immediately resulting from his actions.”</p>

It is there held that, in the trial of misdemeanors as well as felonies, the district attorney has a right, under the supervision of the court, to order jurors to stand aside until the entire panel has been called ; that this practice had its origin in the construction given to the statute 33 Edward I., which is recognized as being in force in this state ; that having thus become established in England, the practice descended to us from that country, whence most of our laws and customs were derived, and has never been altered by legislative enactment or otherwise. The fact that the right, which is conceded to the Commonwealth in capital felonies, has been very seldom asserted in misdemeanors and felonies not capital, is no argument against its existence in the latter classes of cases as well as the former. It has undoubtedly been claimed and recognized by courts of original criminal jurisdiction in some cases, but how frequently we have no means of determining. In the quarter sessions of Philadelphia county it was claimed and sustained in at least two well considered cases: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Mara, 3 Brewster 402, and Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Keenan, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Leg.%20Int.%20416" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="30 Leg.
