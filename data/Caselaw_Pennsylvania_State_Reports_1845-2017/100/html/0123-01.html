A., a business man, accustomed to' financial transactions', called upon B., the president of a bank, and inquired of him whether the hank paid interest on deposits. B. replied, “No, we cannot do that; we will give yon a certificate that will.” A. then gave B. a sum of money and B. gave him an interest-bearing certificate of deposit in the banking house of B. &amp; Oo., of which firm B. was a member. A. then expressed some surprise that the certificate of deposit was not in the bank. B. assured him that it was all the same thing; that B. <em>&amp; </em>Co. owned the bank, and that he could get his money at the bank whenever he wanted it. B. &amp; Co. actually held a majority of the bank stock, and A., being satisfied with B.’s statement, accepted the certificate. The firm of B. &amp; Co. afterwards became insolvent.

At times his balances on deposit were large. In the latter part of 1873 or eai’ly in 1874, he called at the hank and asked the president, William H. Blumer, “whether he would allow me interest on my running account; said he, ‘ No, we cannot do that; we will give you a certificate that will bear six per cent, interest and we can give you your money at any time you want itand he made out a certificate and handed it over to me; I looked at it, and said I: £ What is this ? This is Wm. Ii. Blumer <em>&amp; </em>Co.’ Said he : ‘It is all the same thing. We own the bank ourselves and you will get your money in the First National Bank at any time you want it.’ He called me inside, and showed mo the statement of the First National Bank, to satisfy me they were good — the statement he had pre<a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>sented to the government to show the standing of the bank.

There is, however, a marked distinction between the cases. In those cited there was a positive assertion on the part of the bank officers that the certificates in question were the certificates of the bank, and this assertion was made under circumstances which rendered it at least probable the parties were misled by it. We therefore held there was a question of fraud which ought to have been submitted to the jury.</p>

In the first place he was distinctly told the bank would not pay interest, but that he could have a certificate bearing six per cent, interest. When it was handed him he looked at it and said, ‘ ‘ What is this <em>% </em>This is Wm. IT. Blumer <em>&amp; </em>Co.,” to which the president of the bank replied, <em>“ </em>It is all the same thing ; wo own the bank ourselves, and you will get your money in the Pirst National Bank at any time you want it.” It further appeared that Mr. Blumer showed him the bank statement, and then qualified his remark as to the ownership by saying that his firm owned nearly all the bank. This last statement, while not literally true, was <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>substantially so.

The statement of Blumer that <em>“ </em>it was all the same thing ” could not have misled him, for the reason that it was qualified and explained by the remark that they, the firm of Blumer &amp; Co., owned nearly all the bank. The obvious inference from the remark is, not that the certificate was issued by the hank, hut that it was equally good. It is difficult to see anything in this interview that could have deceived a man of even ordinary intelligence. The plaintiff was a business man, accustomed to.large dealings with the bank, and therefore less liable to he deceived.</p>
