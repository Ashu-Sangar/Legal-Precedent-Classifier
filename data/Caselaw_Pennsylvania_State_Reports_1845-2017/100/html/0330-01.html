Both testified that no contract for sale and purchase of the land was ever made between them, and nothing was proved respecting Edwards’ assent that the deed should be made to his wife. If a good title had been vested in Edwards, it was not divested by Nagle’s conveyance of the legal title to another person. The defendant’s second, third and fourth points, resting upon the assumption that Edwards had surrendered an equitable title and assented to the conveyance made by Nagle, were properly refused.

The plaintiffs seek to recover upon an alleged equitable title against the holder of the legal title. They stand in the place of a vendee under an oral contract, who is out of possession, and the defendant, in place of the vendor in possession. To succeed, they must show a case which, in equity, would entitle them to a decree for specific performance. Where a chancellor under the evidence if true would refuse to decree the specific performance of the alleged contract, the court should instruct the jury that the plaintiff .cannot recover : Taylor <em>v. </em>Henderson, 2 Wr. 60. The claim is a purely equitable one. In a court of equity where the contract alleged in the bill is denied by a sworn answer the complainant is compelled to maintain it by two witnesses, or by what would be equivalent thereto. As long as equitable ejectments may be maintained, and equitable defences set up against legal titles in ejectment, the same rule and measure of justice must * be applied, whether the proceeding be at law or in equity: Sower <em>v. </em>Weaver, 28 P.

The evidence must define the boundaries, indicate the quantity of the land, fix the amount of the consideration, establish that possession was taken in pursuance of the contract, and show such performance or part performance by the vendee as would make rescission inequitable and unjust: Hart <em>v. </em>Carroll, 4 Nor. 508.

Nothing but declarations by one party in the other’s absence. No witness heard the parties make a bargain or acknowledge to each other that there was one. Edwards apparently took possession in the spring of 1870, and proceeded to build a store and a dwelling-house. His possession and improvements were consistent with either a sale of the lot to himself, or a gift of the lot to his wife. Soon after he began to make improvements, Benscoter heard Nagle and another man talking of the lot. The stranger said, “I understand that you sold P. D. a piece of land.” Nagle replied: “ Why, well, yes, partly; I didn’t get much for it.” Stranger: “I understand that you got $75 for it.” Nagle: “Yes, but that ain’t much; I wouldn’t have sold it to anybody else'for that.” Another witness, Weitzell, testifies that Nagle said to him: “When I sold that land to P. D. Edwards, he agreed to dig this cellar, wall it up and move the house and make the cellar as good as where the house now stands.” No other witness heard any declaration as to the terms of the contract.

Neither length of time nor other circumstance exists to relievo the plaintiffs from making the strict proof required by the general rules to take the contract out of the operation of the statute of frauds. Nagle and Edwards both testify that they never made a contract for sale and purchase of the land. At least their testimony is equivalent to the sworn answer of the defendant in an equity suit, denying the contract alleged in the bill. Taking all the testimony as competent and true, a chancellor could not declare that the terms of a contract are shown by full, satisfactory and indubitable proof, by the testimony of two witnesses, or the equivalent of two, and he would refuse a decree for specific performance. But the declarations of Edwards, made in absence of Nagle, clearly were incompetent proof on the part of the plaintiffs, to establish a contract, or payment of the consideration. Before the sheriff’s sale, in a suit by Edwards for the land, he could have shown the extent of his claim and how he claimed, while in possession; but not his own declarations to strangers. lie could not tell strangers that he had a contract with Nagle and what it was, and afterwards prove by them what he had said for the purpose of defeating Nagle’s title. Contracts are not made or proved in that way. Nor can the plaintiffs holding under him, prove such declarations where, as here, there is no evidence of a conspiracy or fraudulent collusion between Nagle and Edwards to cover up or give false color to the title.</p>
    <p id="b353-7" data-blocks='[["BL_353.7",353,[136,1847,1164,470]]]'>The defendant offered to prove by the wife of Frederick Nagle that long before the deed was made to their daughter, Elizabeth Edwards, the property had been given to her as an advancement, which offer was rejected. Had the plaintiffs’ testimony been sufficient to submit, we think this offer would have been admissible. The deed was <em>“ </em>in consideration of love and affection and as an advancement from his estate to the amount, of $600.” It was consistent with a prior parol gift of the land, and if there was such gift, it would be pertinent to consider the fact, especially with reference to the possession of P. D Edwards, husband of Elizabeth Edwards.</p>
