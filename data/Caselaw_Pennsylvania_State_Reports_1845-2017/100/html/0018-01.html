That would have been so if the court had made that rule absolute and we had had a trial of the scire facias on the merits. But the court discharged the rule. That was not a day in court; it was the refusal of a day in court, at that stage. We therefore were entitled to our day on the trial of this ejectment: Wistar <em>v. </em>McManes, 4 P. F. Smith 318; Mevey’s Appeal 4 Barr 80. But the court held that the matter was res adjudicata, and directed a verdict for the plaintiff. The refusal of our rule was an interlocutory order, and an interlocutory order is never res adjudicata. Our property is thus taken from ns without our constitutional right of a jury trial. Our title had previously been adjudicated by this court in our favor, as against the Jifkins, in Sweetzer’s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith 264.

They held the land by a title regular on its face, which to the eye of the world gave full power to execute a valid mortgage on the land. In fact it was conve,yed to them for that purpose: Sweetzer’s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith 264. Relying on a title regular on its face, and without notice of any trust or equity affecting its force and effect, Dodge loaned the money to them and took the mortgage in question. The reference in the offer to the agency of Scranton in the transaction, is too vague and indefinite to affect Dodge with notice of the alleged arrangement between the plaintiff in error and the Jifkins. If, however, it was otherwise as to Dodge, there is no offer to prove that the defendant in error had any notice when she purchased the mortgage and took the assignment thereof. She purchased in good faith and the assignment to her was duly recorded. The assignee of a mortgage takes it discharged of the equities of persons not parties to it, of which he has no notice: Mott <em>v. </em>Clark, 9 Barr 399; Pryor <em>v. </em>Wood, 7 Casey 142.</p>

No payment between them could satisfy the claim of the mortgagee. The further offer was clearly inadmissible to show that, as between the Jifkins and the defendants in error, “there have been such transactions and such evidences of collusion as warrants the deduction or inference that it was paid also to them.” The offer gives no information in regard to what facts are proposed to be proved from which the alleged deduction or inference may be drawn.
