He was bound to present all his claims for credit to them. If he by mistake failed to do so the Act provided a remedy by authorizing the court “ on reasonable cause shown, to refer the report back to the auditors for re-examination and it also allowed an appeal. Whitaker did appeal, but instead of asking for the report to be referred back to the auditors, asked for an issue to a jury and an amendment thereto, whereby the alleged additional credits should be for the first time investigated; and the court, overruling our exception, allowed such amended issue. This virtually nullifies the special procedure provided by the Act, and is in no sense an appeal. If this be permitted, the officer need not appear before the auditors at all; or, if he appear, he may, by intentionally or accidentally withholding a claim, experiment with that tribunal, and long afterwards (in this case more than five years) obtain a more favorable result before a jury, thus putting all the costs upon the county. Tho Act in question is analogous to that of April 15th 1834 (Purd. Dig. 1404) relating to the settlement of the accounts of township officers, under which it has been held that on appeal no claims can be considei’ed that were not submitted to the auditors: Willard <em>v. </em>Parker, <a href="/rawle/1/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Rawle 448" data-case-ids="1819124" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0448-01">1 Rawle 448</a> ; Brown <em>v. </em>White Deer Tp., 3 Casey 109 ; Porter <em>v. </em>School Directors, 6 Harris 144.</p>

But their position is not sound. The right has always been recognized for a defendant before any subordinate tribunal, even though it has exclusive jurisdiction — as before a justice of the peace, or before arbitrators — to permit judgment to go against him by <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>default, and on appeal to put in his defence and try the case de novo on the merits. If this right exists in one who fails to appear, a. fortiori it exists in favor of one who respected the summons but innocently overlooked a portion of his claim. The act of 1842 refers to the prior act of 1832 as to the effect of the auditors’ action and report, and that act authorized the auditors to state the accounts of such officers as might refuse to attend, and gave an appeal generally, without qualification. The right of the county to surcharge the officer, on appeal, if valid claims against him had been overlooked, at the audit is unquestioned, and the correlative right, we contend, exists in favor of the officer. That the result reached was a correct and equitable one W'as formally admitted at the trial, and in such case this court will not reverse by reason of a defect in the form of the issue.</p>

Their jurisdiction was necessarily exclusive, and their decision final and conclusive, except in so far as provision has been made for re-committing their report, or renewing the same on appeal. The first section of the Act of July 16th 1842 (P. L. 391), under which they were appointed, declares <em>“ </em>that the Court of Common Pleas in the county of Luzerne shall, on the application of one hundred taxable inhabitants of the county, appoint one or more suitable person or persons to act as auditor or auditors, whose duty it shall be to re-audit, settle and thoroughly investigate the accounts of the public officers of said county,” and make rejaort thereof. On reasonable cause shown, before the confirmation of the report, the court is authorized to re-commit the same to the auditors for re-examination; and it is further provided that the act shall not apply <em>“ </em>to public officers who have been out of office for a period exceeding seven years.” The second section of the Act, after defining the powers of the auditors and the effect of their report, provides for an appeal by the party aggrieved ; and thereupon the Court of Common Pleas is authorized to direct an issue, as the case may require, for the purpose of determining the facts in dispute. In thus creating a special tribunal, peculiarly adapted to the examination and settlement of official accounts, it was doubtless intended that tho officers named in the Act should appear before the auditors, present their accounts and such claims as they might have against the county, so that everything necessary to a full and <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>fair settlement, might be duly considered and passed upon; and for the purpose of supplying any omission, or correcting any error in the report, it may, as we have seen, be re-committed for re-examination and correction;</p>
    <p id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[160,576,1165,728]]]'>According' to the auditors’report, the indebtedness of defendant to the county was $1,339.70. This amount consisted of two separate items, as to which alone the issue was first framed. Afterwards, in January 1881, about three years and a half after the appeal was taken, the issue was amended by order of court, so as to embrace several items of credit which appear to have been then claimed for the first time by the defendant in error. Whether he was aware of their existence .before, or, if he was, why he did not presént them at the proper time, does not appear. It is very clear, however, that he never presented either of them to the auditors, nor did he ask to have the report re-committed so that they could be considered and passed upon by them. If he could thus avoid submitting to the auditors material items of his claim, he might, with the same propriety, refuse to submit any, and thus practically ignore the authority of the tribunal specially created for the purpose of re-auditing and settling his accounts with the county.</p>
    <p id="b317-7" data-blocks='[["BL_317.7",317,[161,1301,1162,302]]]'>If credits to which defendant was justly entitled were overlooked or omitted by mistake, he shouid have promptly applied to court for an order re-committing the report, so that they could have been considered and passed upon by the auditors. That was his appropriate remedy, if indeed, in view of his laches and unexplained delay of nearly four years, he was entitled to relief in any form.</p>
