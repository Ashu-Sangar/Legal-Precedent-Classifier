Its purpose was to prevent improper combinations from obtaining privileges detrimental tc the public welfare. It was' not to prevent "the legislature from giving to other corporations, which had fulfilled their general purposes, authority to collect and distribute their remaining assets. The latter authority is all the Act of 1869 professes to do. It does not provide for any renewal of the original purposes of such corporations. It gives no authority to require monthly contributions, to assess dues, impose fines, make loans or issue stock. It merely provides a legal remedy to enforce a just and moral obligation. This the legislature may do : Lycoming <em>v. </em>Union, 3 Harris 166. A retrospective Act which merely touches the remedy, by removing a technical impediment is not unconstitutional : Hinckle <em>v. </em>Riffert, 6 Barr 196. Such a statute is valid as between parties and volunteers: Bolton <em>v. </em>Johns, 5 Id. 145. This action is solely between the parties to the mortgage. It is true a deed was given in evidence showing the plaintiff in error had conveyed the land to one Henry Cooper, yet no evidence of the payment of purchase money was shown, other than appeared on the deed. The deed bears date the 19th of April 1861, when the remedy on the mortgage was undoubted. A purchaser took then with full knowledge of the existence and validity of the mortgage. ■ He is no party to the record in this case and if he has a superior right to the property, he is not barred from asserting it by this judgment.</p>
