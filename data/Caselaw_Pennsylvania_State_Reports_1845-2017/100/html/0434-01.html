The evidence produced of marriage, by reputation and cohabitation, was not sufficient. A presumption of marriage by reputation must be established “ by the speech of the people in the neighborhood.” Here the opinion of the people was so divided in its character, that no presumption of marriage can arise from it: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Stump, 3 P.

The marriage was also established by evidence of cohabitation and reputation, the preponderance of testimony being largely in favor of this view. The fact that they were married again in 1876 is not vital; this was done through the influence of J oseph Bowersox, who insisted upon it; and the report that they were not previously married originated with him.</p>

Susannah Bowersox.</p>
    <p id="b453-8" data-blocks='[["BL_453.10",453,[160,1209,1163,546]]]'>Two objections are made to the conclusion of the court: one to finding her to be the widow of the decedent, the other to deciding that she was a proper person to be entrusted with the management of the estate. We have carefully examined the evidence. We think it amply sufficient to justify the court in finding that she had been married to John Bowersox. Not only was there positive evidence of the fact of their marriage : birt they undoubtedly lived together for some twenty years; and the clear weight of evidence shows, as husband and wife during all that time. The apparent desire not to make the marriage generally known, is accounted for by the fact that all right to her former husband’s property terminated when she ceased to be his widow.</p>
    <p id="b453-9" data-blocks='[["BL_453.11",453,[160,1765,1163,557]]]'>The effort to prove her an improper person clearly failed. It is true she is rather illiterate. She cannot write. She cannot read printing unless it be in German. She has not a business education. In this respect she is like a large majority of the widows in the Commonwealth. The Act of Assembly giving the widow a preferred right to administer on the estate of her deceased husband has not made an imperfect or defective education, a legal disqualification. A good mind and sound judgment, a knowledge of the values of property, and of the practical business transactions of life, are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute. All these the appellee has. They will enable her to select competent assistants and able advisers. This will secure an efficient and faithful discharge of the trust.</p>

It is not the mere absence of property liable to seizure on execution. It is the owing of debts in excess of the value of his tangible property. If he owes no debt ho is not insolvent, although he may have no such property. A young mechanic or laborer out of debt, just starting for himself with no property but his knowledge, brawny arm, and energetic will, is not insolvent. Nor is one without visible property, owing no debt, who has acquired a learned profession which he is about to follow. In all these cases each may by industry, labor, and economy, pay his way and contract no debts. Without debts there can be no insolvency. Poverty and insolvency are not synonymous terms.</p>
