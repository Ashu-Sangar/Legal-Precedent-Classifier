They, as well as non-stockholding depositors, are in fact lenders of money to the Association, and whether it makes or loses they are entitled to receive their money with the interest thereon at the rate established by .the charter and by-laws. As depositoi’s they have no right to participate in the management of the Association. That right springs from their relation to the Association as stockholders alone. The two-fold relation of corporator and creditor of the corporation is by no means unknown to the law : Gordon <em>v. </em>Preston, <a href="/watts/1/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts 385" data-case-ids="1838074" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0385-01">1 Watts 385</a>; Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Connor, 5 Harris 136. It is said in the former case<em>, </em>That a corporator may sustain the relation of debtor or creditor in regard to the corporation, and in the latter capacity receive a security, is a proposition that requires not the aid of argument.” The provision in the charter which authorizes stock-holders to deposit money and receive interest thereon, establishes between them and the corporation the relation of debtor and creditor as to such deposits. The conclusions of the learned, auditor, as' to both classes of depositors, are so fully vindicated in his report that nothing further need be said on that subject. The fund should have been distributed pro rata among both classes of depositoi’s.</p>

In marshalling the assets of the insolvent corporation, neither of these classes is entitled to priority over any of the others.</p>
