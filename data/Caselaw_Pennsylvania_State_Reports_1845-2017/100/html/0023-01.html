The payee, Saylor, received the check on the day of its date (October 18th 1877), but did not present it to the drawees for payment until about November 17th 1877, when answer was made that the bank (Bushong &amp; Bro.) had suspended payment, and could not pay it, as they were using all alike.</p>

The settlement showed his credit balance, as of January 1st 1878, to be $3,997.69. Yeich stated, that the Saylor clieck for $1,990 was outstanding, and he desired to have that omitted from his note, which was done, and a note was given him for the remainder of his account. No entry of the Saylor check was, however, made in his bank-book, or in the books of the bank. Yeich testified the reason why he requested the amount of the Saylor check to be deducted was, that he did not wish to make himself liable to Saylor by including it in his note. There was no evidence that the fact of this arrangement was communicated to Saylor.</p>

The defendants maintain that, in order to enable the plaintiff to recover, he must show privity of contract between himself and them, and, as none has been shown, there can be no recovery. It seems settled by the decisions, that when a depositor draws his check on a bank, payable to another, the holder of the check cannot sue in his own name unless he shows an express promise or undertaking of the bank, signifying its intent to assume the obligation, or some act from which the law will impei’atively imply such valid px-omise or uxxdertaking.]</p>

The latter’s bank-book still shows a balance due him, for which he may, at any time, bring suit. The transaction between the bank and Y eich, not communicated to Saylor, created no liability of the bank to Saylor, and he, as the mere payee of the check, had no right of action in his own name against the banker.</p>

A check may be- revoked before presentment by the drawer’s death, or by his order not to honor it, but if not revoked, it is the duty of the bank to pay on demand. For breach of this duty, the drawer has a right of action. If the check has not been revoked, by common usage, the holder expects it will be paid on presentment. lie may suffer a real injury by refusal, for which he may be without redress, as in case of the drawer becoming insolvent before recourse to him could be effectual. It would seem that the holder ought to have a remedy against the bank for a wrongful refusal of payment, arising from an implied promise from the usages of business, or the course of dealing between the parties; and so it was held in some cases prior to Bank <em>v. </em>Millard. If the bank, in violation of its duty, dishonors a check, the holder may be injured quite as much as the drawer, and the bank ought to be answerable to each party injured by breach of the contract. Prior to acceptance, it is said', there is no privity between the holder, and the bank, and, therefore, the holder cannot maintain an action.</p>

Thus, when a check was drawn to C., and B. indorsed C.’s name without authority and received the money, the bank having deducted the check from the drawer’s account and settled with him on that basis, it was held that the conduct of the bank was an acceptance, and that 0. could recover from the bank: Seventh Nat.

When a depositor settles his account with the bank, and leaves the exact amount of an outstanding check expressly for its payment, and the bank tacitly retains the money and settles on that basis, it is liable to the holder on the implied acceptance. All parties to the check would naturally infer from such action that the bank retained the money for use of the holder.</p>

In May 1878, Yeich called on the bank for a note for the amount due, to be determined by the stubs of his checkbook, and a note was given for the balance. In making out the balance Saylor’s check was deducted from the credits, just as the other checks were, except that some interest was allowed for Saylor. Yeich did not want to make himself liable to Saylor by including his check in the note, and directed the check to be left out. These are the facts the jury would likely have found <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>had the testimony been submitted, and they could reasonably have inferred an agreement by the bank to keep the money and pay the check.</p>

In settlement with the drawer, at liis request, they kept of his money the amount of the check for the purpose of its payment. No other purpose was expressed, and no other could be inferred. It matters not that the amount of the check was not formally charged against Yeich and credited to Saylor. Had that been done, it would have evidenced the plaintiff’s right to recover on the count for money had and received, held by the defendants and appropriated by the drawer to the plaintiff’s use, and, therefore under an implied promise to him to pay it on demand: Seventh Nat. Bank <em>v. </em>Cook, <a href="/pa/73/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="73 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1032323" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0483-01">supra.</a> If the facts are proved otherwise than by the books, the result is the same.</p>
