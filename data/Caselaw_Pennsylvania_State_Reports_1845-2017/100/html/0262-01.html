This decision -was, and ought to have been conclusive, as against all and every of Stubbs’ assignees. Estoppels operate as to both parties and privies. The cases cited by appellant do not militate against this doctrine. The doctrine laid down in Guenther’s Appeal and Kline’s Appeal must be interpreted in the light of the peculiar circumstances of those cases. In both cases the questions for decision were the status or relations of legatees <em>qua </em>the particular fund in process of distribution. Here the question is not to settle the rights of legatees <em>inter </em>sese/ it is in effect to try the light of a hostile claimant to the share ox-portion of one of the legatees. It is only another way of determining the.issue raised by the attachment in execution. Now it would be idle to say that a creditor is obliged to re-ti-y the question of a fraudulent assignment, upon every levy which he may be compelled to make upon his debtor’s property. Such is not the law; and it has been distinctly held that the creditor is not thus to be harassed with the duty of repeatedly litigating the same question, as to every individual piece of his debtor’s property : Doty <em>v. </em>Brown, 4 Comstock 71.</p>

Nothing is clearer than that as Hayes was nota party or privy to the former adjudication, he would not have been concluded had that decree been in favor of the validity of the deeds, neither can he take advantage of the decree against its validity. It can make' no difference whether the question is one of law or fact. If of law the court has the undoubted right to overrule it if satisfied that it xvas wrong. If of fact, the tribunal whose province it is to decide such question may undoubtedly receive new evidence, or take a different view of that which was at first presented.

Had the court below proceeded upon the former evidence and made their decree, we could have reviewed and approved or reversed it, according to our view of the law and the facts. The counsel for the appellee produced testimony to show that the deed in question was fraudulent and void, and the report of the auditor in the former case; but the adjudicating judge, on the ground that the report had been confirmed, held that question was res adjudicata, so far as that court was concerned, and without more, awarded to the appellee the amount of his judgment with interest and costs. Exceptions to this adjudication were dismissed and the adjudication confirmed. We think, for the reasons given, the decree was wrong.
