The question has never been decided by this court, but the rulings of the old District Court of Philadelphia, and of the Common Pleas No. 4, ai’e in support of our contention. In Rosenstein <em>v. </em>Feigel, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Phila.%20532" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Phila. 532">6 Phila. 532</a>, Hare, P-. J., says, “ It is difficult to see why a frank and full disclosure of all the. circumstances of a real or supposed wrong to a magistrate, should not follow the same rule (as in the case of an attorney at law) if the magistrate decides, and so informs the complainant-that the circumstances detailed constitute the offence for which the arrest is made;” . . . “it would seem obvious that proceedings instituted under such circumstances should not be held malicious and without probable cause, unless enough is disclosed by the evidence to exclude the natural inference that the prosecutor acted in good faith under the advice of the magistrate.” This decision was .followed by the common pleas in Thomas <em>v. </em>Paynter, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.N.C.%20300" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 W.N.C. 300">1 W. N. C. 300</a>. In this case the defendant offered to prove that he made a full and fair statement of all he knew concerning the alleged larceny, to the justice, and that he then followed his advice in bringing the prosecution. Magistrates are daily required to decide as to what constitutes probable cause, for without that there can be no binding over or commitment. The law makes them the judge of the advisability of a prosecution and of <em>its </em>justice. This being so, how can it reasonably be said that he who consults them and follows their advice shall be legally responsible if mistake be made ? Did the defendant act in good faith ? Unless there be evidence to the contrary the presumption of law is that he did, and there is no testimony in the cause showing that he did not use all due caution.</p>

    <p id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.7",110,[303,483,1165,470]]]'>To maintain an action for malieious prosecution, the plaintiff must prove the prosecution to have been made without probable cause, and that the prosecutor was actuated by malice towards the plaintiff. Malice may be inferred from the want of probable cause; but if there be probable cause, it matters not that the prosecution be malicious. If the act be lawful the motives of the prosecutor will not be inquired into. Whether certain facts constitute probable cause, must be determined by the -court; but, whether such alleged facts exist, is for the jury to find. The law applicable to the case was correctly stated by the learned judge, and we discover no error in the admission of evidence.</p>
    <p id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.8",110,[302,952,1162,302]]]'>The main question arises under the eleventh assignment. The plaintiff in error offered to prove, substantially, that he stated to the justice of the peace, before whom the prosecution was about to be instituted, the facts as he had heard them, and he was advised by the justice that they were sufficient upon which to base a criminal prosecution against the defendant in error. The evidence was rejected.</p>
    <p id="b110-7" data-blocks='[["BL_110.9",110,[296,1249,1165,812]]]'>When a prosecutor fully and fairly submits to his counsel learned in the law all the facts which he knows are capable of proof, and is advised that they are sufficient to sustain a prosecution, and, acting in good faith on that opinion, does institute the prosecution, he is not liable to an action for malicious prosecution, although the opinion be erroneous. Shall the advice of a committing magistrate have the same effect? We think not. Justices of the peace are not required to be learned in the law. In fact, generally through the state they are not. They are not qualified by a course of study to give advice on questions of law. They do not pursue it as a profession. They are not charged with the duty of advising any person to commence a prosecution. They ought not to act as attorney or agent for one in regard to a prosecution he is about to institute before them. Their duties are judicial; they may in the discharge thereof reduce the substance of the complaint to writing-, in the form of an information of the prosecutor, then, they judicially determine whether the facts therein averred, be sufficient to justify the issuing of a warrant.</p>
