A. thereupon issued writs of alias fi. fa. which were levied on the same goods. B.’s wife again claimed them and obtained a rule for an issue to determine her ownership. A. then issued writs of vend. ex. directed against the goods and obtained a rule to set aside the alias fi. fas. on the ground that they had been improvidently and improperly issued. B.’s wife then took a rule to set aside the writs of vend. ex. on the ground that A., by issuing the alias fi. fas., had abandoned the levies under the original fi. fas.

The court awarded an issue under the Sheriff’s Inter-pleader Act, and approved the claimant’s bond. The fi. fas. were returned “Writ stayed by interpleader.” The claimant did not file a nan-, within twenty days from the granting of the issue, as required by Pide of Court M, § 1, which provides: “The declaration in said issue shall be filed'by the claimant within twenty days . . . and a failure to file a declaration as aforesaid shall be deemed an abandonment of the claim.” Subsequently on December 13th 1880, Wiley Brothers issued alias fi. fas. on their judgments and a new levy was made upon the same personal property or a part thereof, and also on other property. The defendant’s wife again made claim to the property, and on December 2Sth 1880, obtained a rule to show cause why an issue should not be granted. Pending this rule, on January 8th 1881, Wiley Bros issued writs of vend, exps., and on January 15th 1881 obtained a rule to show cause why the said writs of alias fi. fa. should not be set aside, on the ground that they had been improvidently and improperly issued. The defendant thereupon took a rule to set aside the writs of vend, exp., on the ground that the plaintiffs, by issuing the alias fi. <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>fas. abandoned the levy under the original fi. fas., which could not be restored by setting aside the alias fi. fas.</p>

The writs of fieri facias, as originally issued, and upon which a levy was made by the sheriff upon the personal property of the defendant below, were returned stayed, by reason of a claim upon said property by Ehmegunda Menge, the wife of the defendant. Whereupon the court below awarded an issue under the interpleader act, and approved the bond filed by the claimant. She failed to file her narr., however, and under the rule of court in force in Lancaster county, such failure amounted to an abandonment of her claim. Subsequently, the plaintiff issued an alias fi. fa. on each writ, and levied upon the same property. The defendant’s wife again made claim to the property, and asked for an issue, which issue ivas properly refused by the court. The plaintiff then issued a writ of venditioni exponas in each case ; whereupon two rules were taken below, viz.: a rule upon the part of the plaintiff to set aside their alias fieri facias, and a rule on the part of the defendant to set aside the writ of venditioni exponas. The court below made the first rule absolute and discharged the latter.</p>

The issue of the alias fi. fa. was an irregularity, but it has done the defendant no harm, and it is well settled that the creditor may follow the property of his debtor, and sell the same upon a vend. ex.: Bain <em>v. </em>Lyle, 18 P.
