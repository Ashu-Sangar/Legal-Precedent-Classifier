It is for alimony awarded by the court to the wife of George, after a verdict and judgment against him, for a divorce a mensa et thoro, in her favor. The attachment issued on a debt of record fixed by judgment and decree. Whether the judgment be for a breach of contract or <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>for a tort, matters not. The testator recognized no such distinction. lie impressed on the fund exemption from all kinds of legal process against the trustee, not only for debts, bnt also for “ all liabilities whatever” of George. Language broader and more comprehensive could not be used. The testator made no distinction between the character of the obligations which might rest on George. He designed to cover all, legal, equitable and moral. If we depart from the clearly expressed will of the testator in this respect, we make a new will instead of enforcing the one he made.</p>
    <p id="b171-6" data-blocks='[["BL_171.6",171,[128,853,1163,547]]]'>The question whether George should justly apply the money after it has reached his hands, to the discharge of this obligation, or in case he refuses so to do, what form of legal proceedings may be instituted against him, does not now arise. We are dealing solely with the case of legal proceedings against the trustee, instituted for the purpose of intercepting his action and defeating the trust stamped on the fund by the donor. As the wife of George has become one of his creditors and seeks to enforce her claim by adverse process against the trustee, the debt as well as the proceedings come within the prohibitory clause of the will. The learned judge therefore erred in entering judgment in favor of the defendant in error on the point of law reserved.</p>
