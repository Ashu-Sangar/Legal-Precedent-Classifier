Judgment was entered on this note January 5th 1872, against both the makers. On September ,15th 1876, the death of James Ward was suggested on the record, and Peter Ward, administrator, was substituted.- On November 27th 1876 judgment of revival was entered against Daniel Sullivan, and Peter Ward, administrator of James Ward, deceased. Subsequently the real estate of James Ward was sold by order of the Orphans’ Court of Luzerne county, and on distribution the sum of $301.25 of the proceeds were paid to the Anthracite Building and Loan Association, upon their said judgment, which was the first lien on the fund.</p>

    <p id="b306-6" data-blocks='[["BL_306.11",306,[317,1082,1169,854]]]'>That a surety who paj's the debt or from whose estate it is paid lias a right in equity to be subrogated to tlie security against his principal — is a doctrine so familiar and well settled as to need no citation of authorities to support it. James Ward, the decedent, was tlie surety of Daniel Sullivan in the judgment of the Anthracite Building and Loan Association. Tlie judgment was revived against the appellant his administrator. His estate was sold by the Orphans’ Court, and $301.25 of the proceeds was applied to-this judgment. Why should not his estate be subrogated to this judgment against Sullivan ? The learned judge in the court below, <em>thought that the </em>case <em>of </em>Blank’s Appeal, <a href="/grant/3/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Grant 192" data-case-ids="229210" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0192-01">3 Grant 192</a>, ruled the question, and decided against allowing tlie subrogation. That case lias no application. It merely decides that an administrator, who pays a debt of an intestate lias no right of subrogation to the original creditor against the estate. The amount in this case was paid out of tlie estate of the intestate, under the legal liability of tlie estate, and not by the administrator, and the subrogation claimed is for the estate which the appellant represents, and not for himself personally.</p>
