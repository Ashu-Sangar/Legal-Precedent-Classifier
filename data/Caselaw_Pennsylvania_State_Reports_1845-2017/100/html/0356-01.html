If we are correct in this it follows that the only liability that can attach to the county, under the case stated, must be for taxes for the non-payment of which the lands were sold by the treasurer, and purchased for the county by the commissioners in the exercise of the discretion vested in them by the act of 1817. At this point the county interposes the Statute of Limitations as a bar to any recovery. The county is responsible to a township where the county treasurer has collected township taxes assessed upon unseated lands and failed to pay them over: Potter county <em>v. </em>Oswayo Township, 11 Wr. 162. And it is also settled that the Statute of Limitations runs in favor of a county for money paid into its treasury to redeem lands which have been sold for the non-payment of taxes: Robinson <em>v. </em>Cameron county, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20Leg.%20Int.%20409" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="34 Leg.

As it is conceded that the several sales by the treasurer to the county, embraced in the case stated, were all’made more than six years before the bringing of suit, we think the Statute of Limitations must prevent a recovery in this case.</p>
