Garner, believing these representations, consented to act as agent, and in pursuance of his duties as such, made similar statements in regard to the company to Humble at the time he took out his policy, adding that he (Garner) believed the company to be good and sound. After ascertaining that these representations were false, Garner collected the policies which he had procured, and sent them back to the company for cancellation.

It is true as a general principle, that if the party relied upon mere opinion, and not upon the false representations made, he cannot set up the falsity of the opinion in order to avoid the contract, and to that extent we affirm, this point.

    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.8",515,[150,624,1159,845]]]'>The evidence referred to in the first assignment of error was offered for the purpose of showing that the representations made by Mr. Price in the preceding January were made by and with the authority of the plaintiff' company, and assented to by it as correct. We think the learned judge was right in admitting it. There was abundant evidence to show that the company was a fraud from its inception, and there was ample evidence to submit to the jury that it deceived its agents as to its financial condition, in order that they in turn might deceive innocent parties who desired to insure their property. In this connection it is proper to say that it matters little what were the powers of the agent who made the fraudulent representations by means of which the defendant was induced to take his policy, nor whether the agent himself believed them to be true. The company having accepted the policy, is affected with any fraud on the part of the person in obtaining it. In other words, it cannot repudiate the fraud and yet retain the benefit of the contract. It takes it cum onere. This is familiar law. See Jones <em>v. </em>The National Building Association, 13 Norris 215, and authorities there cited.</p>
    <p id="b515-6" data-blocks='[["BL_515.9",515,[147,1479,1161,555]]]'>The remaining questions in the case need not be discussed at length. The court could not properly say to the jury, as requested by the plaintiff’s second point, that Garner’s statement that the company had a paid-up capital of $200,000 could not have deceived or injured the defendant. This was not a question of law, but a question of fact, and was properly submitted to the jury. The reason given by the company in support of its position is so remarkable that I insert it here without comment. It is: <em>“ </em>Because the act of 1870, creating a capital stock for this company, provided it should be exclusively invested in real estate, and that the stockholders should have the first lien upon the same ; and hence this real estate was not applicable to the payment of fire losses.”</p>
