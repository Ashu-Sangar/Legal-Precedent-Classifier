It is “ to and for the right and privilege of the grantor and every member of his family or their offspring,” to mark off and use one square perch of ground “ for tlieir own and separate use forever, for the burial of their dead.” The privilege was thus personal to himself and family, lie did not reserve any power to assign and transfer the right and privilege of burial to a stranger to his family.

The church ediliee was used and occupied by each on alternate Sundays, and the burial ground was common to both of them. Each congregation has one trustee who has the care aud supervision of the property; and the church vestry of each consists of seven members. Without authority from either of the trustees, or the assent of either body of the vestry, the defendant in error took possession of a lot in the centre of the grounds, and erected a fence around it. It is true the lot was staked off by one vestryman and an agent of the cliui’ch-yard, but they are not shown to have had any authority so to do. Their action was not only in violation of the trust under which the property was held, but it did not receive the approval of the congregations, church vestry, or trustees. The trustees gave written notice to the defendant in error to remove the fence. He refused or declined •so to do. Afterwards the plaintiffs in error removed it under authority from the trustees, and with the approval of so many of the congregation as were consulted. This removal constitutes the alleged trespass.</p>
