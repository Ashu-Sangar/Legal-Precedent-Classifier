Had the lease been by the year the <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>tenant might be so liable : Diller <em>v. </em>Roberts, 13 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 60 ; Phillips <em>v. </em>Monges, <a href="/whart/4/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="4 Whart. 226" data-case-ids="1835012" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0226-01">4 Whar. 226</a> ; Hemphill <em>v. </em>Flynn, 2 Barr 144.

The purpose is not to make a new lease essentially different; but to continue the former so far as its terms may be applicable. In its very nature the implied renewal of a lease assumes a continuation of its characteristic features. Hence if a landlord elect to treat one holding over as a tenant, he thereby affirms the form of tenancy under which the tenant previously held.
