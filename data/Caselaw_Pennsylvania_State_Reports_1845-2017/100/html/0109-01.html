This is also the effect of the rulings in Sames’ App., 2 Cas. 184; Fickes’s App., 21 P. F. S. 449 and 450; Rudy’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.N.C.%20308" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 W.N.C. 308">9 W. N. C. 308</a> and 311. Although Samuel P. Oswald had not placed his deed from Jacob J. Oswald on record till March 25th 1878, seven days after the revival by agreement between the latter aud Snyder, yet that deed had been fully executed and delivered on the 2d of March 1878, and Samuel P. Oswald, the grantee, had on the same day gone into <em>actual possession </em>of the land conveyed, in which possession he continued and was on the 2d of March 1878, the day of revival. But it is urged on behalf of Snyder that he had no actual notice of the conveyance, and that he could have had .no constructive notice of it from Samuel’s possession of the land, because he (Samuel) had been farming it for years before, and the relations between him and Jacob J. Oswald’s family continued, apparently, the same after the conveyance. I confess there is some force in this objection, but Snyder chose to take all risks. He might have sued out a writ of scire facias against Jacob J. Oswald, instead of entering into an amicable agreement with him, in which case the latter would undoubtedly have informed Snyder explicitly of the transfer. Again, it is urged that there was a verbal agreement, made between Samuel P. Oswald and J acob J. Oswald on the execution of the deed, and as a part of the consideration that the former should pay-all the latter’s debts. But this agreement — granting that there was such a one (of which the evidence is not clear) — would have created no lien on the land of which Snyder could take advantage, however binding it might be on the parties to it.

But the Act of April 16th 1849 alters the practice in this, that the terre-tenant is entitled to notice only where he has put his deed upon record, or has entered into the actual possession of the land bound by the judgment. That Act reads as follows: — “ In all cases when a judgment has been or shall be regularly revived between the original parties, the period of five years, during which the lien of the judgment continues, shall only commence to run in favor of the terre-tenant from the time that he or she has placed their deed on record ; provided, that this Act shall not apply to any cases which have been finally adjudicated, or when the terretenant is in actual possession of the land bound by such judgment, by himself or tenant.” Thus, then, when it appears that <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>the terre-tenant has not complied with the conditions of the statute, the only inquiry is whether the judgment has been “ regularly revived between the original parties,” and no distinction is made between a revival by scire facias, and by the agreement of the parties.</p>
    <p id="b129-6" data-blocks='[["BL_129.6",129,[118,622,1162,598]]]'>In the case in hand, there is no doubt as to the regularity of the revival of the Snyder judgment, and it is an undisputed fact that the deed of Samuel Oswald, the terre-tenant, was not recorded until after the revival of that judgment. There then remains but the single question whether this terre tenant had such possession of the land, at the time of the revival, as would amount to constructive notice to the judgment creditor. But as the possession of the grantor, the judgment debtor, was continued, and as that of the terre-tenant was, at best, but joint with his grantor, and at no time exclusive, it was clearly not of that kind which would affect Snyder with notice. Hence, under the Act of 1849, the case stands as though there had been no terre-tenant, and the acts of the original parties in the revival of the judgment are alone to be regarded.</p>
