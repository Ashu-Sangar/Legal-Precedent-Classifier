Derrick thereupon gave his note for the ten per cent., $516, which was accepted by Weast. Derrick thereupon rented the farm, and his tenant went into possession April 1st 1877. Upon the same day, Weast tendered a deed to Derrick and demanded the instalment of purchase money then payable. Derrick refused to accept the deed unless Weast would accept as part of the purchase money a judgment held bj1. Derrick against a third party. Subsequently, in November 1877, Derrick refused absolutely to comply with the condition of the sale. Weast thereupon, after notice to Derrick, applied for and obtained from the Court of Common Pleas an order of sale under the provisions of • the Act of Feburary 17th 1876: P. L. 1. The terms of this second sale, as fixed in the order of court, were : ten per cent, of the purchase money payable on day of sale, the remainder of the one-half on April 1st 1878, and the balance on April 1st 1879. At the second sale, on January 10th 1878, the ¡property was sold to one Ahl, for $30.25 per acre.</p>

It is a question of good faith. But in a sale under an order of court there can be no question of bad faith. The terms of the second sale were not such as to affect the price. In both sales, the one-lialf of the purchase money was to be paid on April 1st following the sale, and while the remaining one-half was by the first sale to be made in two yearly payments, and in the second sale by one yearly payment, in both the whole money was to be paid by the same day, April 1st, 1879. These terms were more favorable than the law requires, as in strictness the whole purchase money is payable upon the confirmation of the sale: Tomlinson’s Appeal, 9 Norris 224. The default of the defendant made recourse to the court a necessity, and when he received notice that the application would be made, he knew that the terms would be such as would be required by law, and he cannot now escape the results of his own default: Bowser <em>v. </em>Cessna, 12 P. F. S. 148; Singerly v. Swain’s Administrators, 9 Casey 102. This case is not within the principle of Banes v.

    <p id="b528-6" data-blocks='[["BL_528.8",528,[297,676,1158,596]]]'>Each sale was made in the beginning of the year, one in 1877 and the other in 1878, the purchaser to take possession on the first of April following. The first was for $39 per acre, ten per centum to be paid in hand, the balance of one-half on April 1st 1877, one-fourth on April 1st 1878, and one-fourth on April 1st 1879, with interest on the last two payments. This sale was at auction, but not by authority or under control of the court. The second was under an order of the court, for $30.25 per acre, payable, ten per centum at the time of the sale, one-lialf the balance on the April 1st 1878. and the other half in one year thereafter, with interest, the purchaser to pay the taxes for 1878, and to have one-half of the grain in the ground. To note the stipulations of these contracts is the shortest way to show their diversity.</p>
    <p id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.9",528,[297,1273,1154,1054]]]'>This action is for recovery of the difference of price. As the cause was presented, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the difference, or nothing. The second sale was made in good faith, and in such manner that, had its terms been the same or as advantageous as in the first, defendant would be liable for the difference of price between them: Bowser <em>v. </em>Cessna, <a href="/pa/62/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="62 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1017243" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0148-01">62 Pa. St. 148</a>. Sales, public or private, are precisely what the contract of the parties make them, and a sale in pursuance of an order of the court is governed by the prescribed terms, the same as the accepted terms of a sale made without judicial order. When the re-sale is for a less price, upon other terms than the first, the vendor cannot compel the first purchaser to make good the loss. The basis is shifted. To refer such a case to the jury, would introduce an uncertain measure of damages, whereas the only measure is the difference between the price of the first and second sale: Banes <em>v. </em>Gordon, <a href="/pa/9/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Pa. 426" data-case-ids="960741" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0426-01">9 Pa. St. 426</a>. Here, the plaintiff, instead of attempting to enforce payment of the purchase money, proceeded under the statute of 1876 to obtain a judicial order of sale which in itself created conditions and rights of vendor and purchaser materially variant from those in the first contract. The fact that the court prescribed the terms of the second has no bearing upon the question at issue. Those terms were made upon the plaintiff’s motion, but no matter how made, it is essential to his case that the second sale was not loaded with heavier terms than the first.</p>

It is evidence of indebtedness for one <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>of the instalments, but it does not survive the contract. The plaintiff sues for damages he has sold and conveyed the land to another, and, if he fails to establish Lis right to damages, he. shall not chop round and recover purchase money.</p>
