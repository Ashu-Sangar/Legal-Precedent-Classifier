In 1878 Gunson gave permission to one Kelso to land lime at his wharf, and to haul it away along the road in question. Kelso employed the defendant Iiyan to do the hauling, and when the latter went with his team to get the lime, he found the road on Healy’s land obstructed by a fence placed across it. He thereupon proceeded to chop it down with an axe.

It is not necessary, for the purposes of this case, as we regard it, to say that if Gunson had leased this property and set up a wharf on his property, and rented it away, that the parties so leasing the Gunson property or wharf, would have a right to pass over this way. We say to the jury, that whilst Gunson has the right to pass and repass over this road unmolested, he had no right to permit Mr. Kelso to land his lime upon that wharf. The mere permission to land lime on that wharf, does not, without renting, or, without leasing, give the right to use this road for the purpose of hauling that lime away. This covers the proposition, which is submitted upon the part of the defendants, and it is answered in the negative with the exception of the qualification which the court has given to it.</p>

That the plaintiff had no right to put a fence or bars across the right of way, and the defendants -were justified in removing the obstruction, and in doing so were not guilty of trespass. <em>Answer. </em>Healy has no right to set up bars or any obstruction in this road so as to prevent Thomas Gunson from using that road for the uses of his property. We have said that the permission which Gunson has given to Kelso- — the mere naked permission, without remuneration or without a lease of that wharf to land his lime — gave Kelso no right to pass over this road, and Healy getting up a bar to obstruct or prevent Kelso, or his man Eyan, from using that road, so far as it only interfered to prevent Kelso from using that road, he (Healy) was justified in putting up these bars. If it was only for that purpose, we say to you, lie was justified, but if he interfered with Thomas Gunson, he was not justified, and would not have any right to prevent Gunson from using that road.....Eyan came with his team, and coming with it, it is for the jury to say whether John Gunson, Matthew Gunson and Mary Gunson were there for the purpose of supporting Eyan in driving over this road. If they were there for that purpose only, then they stand in no better light than Eyan does himself ; and as Eyan had no right to haul over that road, these persons were equally guilty with him, if it was for the purpose of maintaining and supporting him in his efforts to drive over that road.</p>

    <p id="b62-6" data-blocks='[["BL_62.9",62,[276,875,1161,331]]]'>This proposition fairly presents the controlling question in the case; and, in view of the uncontradicted evidence on which it is based, we are clearly of opinion it should have been affirmed. The right of way is undoubtedly appurtenant to Gunson’s land; its use is not in any manner qualified or restricted, and hence it follows that he and those who, by his permission, use the land for any legitimate purpose have a right to pass and repass over the road.</p>

The change of location thus assented to was long afterwards recognized and ratified by a written agreement between Gunson and Healy, executed in 1864. The learned judge substantially charged, as requested by defendants, that the agreement of 1864, simply changed the location of the road granted by Hunter, and that “ the extent of the right and everything pertaining to it (except location) is to be gathered from the terms of the grant in the Hunter deed.” Recurring to it we find the grant was the free use and privilege of an open road forever. If there was any doubt as to the nature or extent of the grant the well-settled rule would require it to be taken most strongly against the grantor; but there is no ambiguity about it. On the contrary, it is clear and explicit, and instead of restricting or in any way limiting the use, it is declared to be free and an open road forever.
