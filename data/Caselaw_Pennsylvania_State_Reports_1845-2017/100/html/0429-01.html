He moved to quash the writ of certiorari on the ground that there is no jurisdiction in the Supreme Court to review directly the judgment of a justice of the peace without a prior appeal to Ihe Court of Common Pleas. Art. v. § 8, of the old Constitution <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>directed : “ The judges of the Courts of Common Pleas shall, within their respective counties, have the like powers with the judges of the Supreme Court to issue writs of certiorari to the justices of the peace and to cause their proceedings to be brought before them and the like right and justice to be done.” The Constitution of 1874, art. v. § 10, omitting the words “ like powers with the judges of the Supreme Court,” prescribes : “ The judges of the Courts of Common Pleas, within their respective counties, shall have power to issue writs of certiorari to justices of the peace and other inferior courts not of record, and to cause their proceedings to be brought before them, and right and justice to be done.” The omission of the above words negatives by necessary implication the construction that the Supreme Court can now issue writs of certiorari to justices of the peace. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is defined and limited in section 3 of art. v. of the new Constitution, and that section provides: “they shall have appellate jurisdiction by appeal, certiorari or writ of error in all cases as is now or may hereafter be provided by law.” Section 24 of the Act of March 20th 1810 (5 Sm. L. 164), provides that <em>“no </em>writ of certiorari issued by or out of the Supreme Court to any justice of the peace, in any civil suit or action, shall bo available to remove the proceedings had before such justice of the peace.” No good reason has been assigned why proceedings by a purchaser of real estate at sheriff’s sale to recover possession, as well as other “ civil suits or actions,” before justices of the peace, should not be taken first to the Common Pleas and then removed to this court by certiorari or writ of error.

If Bauer had made the affidavit required by the 114th section of the act, it would have been his duty to have entered into recognizance and given security as required by the Act, before he could have demanded that the justice “ shall forbear to give judgment.” But the affidavit was made under the 115th section, which requires the claimant when he shall appear, to make oath ásspecified in the act, and to enter into recognizance.
