J., the following facts appeared : — Elias Rockwell died March 29th 1872, leaving three sons to whom he devised and bequeathed his estate after payment of debts and legacies. He appointed his son Niram Rockwell his executor. The testator left a large personal estate, and also real estate. So far as was known he left no debts. On January 23d 1874, within two years of testator’s death, his children and devisees distributed the personal estate and divided the real estate among themselves, exchanging quit-claim deeds. The executor filed no account and took no refunding bonds.</p>

This tract was not surveyed until some time after Elias Rockwell’s death, when it was found to overrun some 15 acres. The plaintiff thereupon, on March 3d 1875, within three years from the death of Elias Rockwell, brought an action against Niram Rockwell, executor of Elias Rockwell, to recover for said overplus, and recovered an adverse verdict and judgment for $198.75. Pending this suit the executor became insolvent.</p>

Answer. Affirmed. That undoubtedly is the law, but we think that there is a defence in the hands of the heirs to sot up that there is personal estate enough to pay the debts. So the real point in this case is whether there was personal property enough belonging to the estate of Elias Rockwell at the time of his death to pay this and all other debts of the estate. If this is true your judgment should be against Niram Rockwell for the amount of the debt and in favor of the other defendahts.</p>

In Hanna’s Appeal, 7 Casey 57, Lewis, Ch. J'., says: <em>“ </em>Where assets are received by the executor sufficient to cover the expenses of administration, satisfy debts and pay legacies, the real estate is discharged from further liability . . . The real estate charged is liable on a deficiency of assets, but not from the misapplication waste or insolvence of the executor.” Keyzey’s Case, 9 S. &amp; R. 73. Why allow the plaintiff to proceed and revive his judgment against these defendants when he would not be allowed to sell on it? It is not the policy of the law to allow a party to do that from which he cannot hope to derive any benefit or profit. In this case, all he can do is to revive his judgment.

The effect of the Act was to limit a lien already in existence. Prior to the legislation upon this subject, a decedent’s debts were a.n indefinite lien upon his real estate. The Act of 1834 as well as the prior Act of 1797 is an Act of limitation and repose: Kerper <em>v. </em>Hoch, <a href="/watts/1/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Watts 9" data-case-ids="1838073" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0009-01">1 Watts 9</a> ; Duncan <em>v. </em>Clark, 7 Ibid. 217; Trinity Church <em>v. </em>Watson, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20518" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="14 Wright 518">14 Wright 518</a>.

When the heirs and devisees are brought in they may contest the debt, not the lien. Sample <em>v. </em>Barr, supra. It would have been competent to have joined the devisees and terre-tenants in the original suit against the executor, and this practice is sometimes followed. In such case it is too clear for argument they could only to be heard to contest the debt. The rule is in no wise different, where, as here, the better practice is pursued, and the devisees and terre-tenants are brought in by a subsequent proceeding. It was said by Knox J. in Stewart <em>v. </em>Montgomery : “ Whether there was sufficient personal estate to pay the judgment was <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>wholly immaterial in this proceeding. The creditor had the legal right to charge the real estate, by making the devisee a party before the personal estate is finally settled.
