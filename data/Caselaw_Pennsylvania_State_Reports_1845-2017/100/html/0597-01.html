A., after deducting rents and certain charges, was to pay over any balance that might remain to B. A. thereupon oponed a ledger account, in which he entered, on the debit side, certain advances from time to time made by him to B., and also the monthly charges for rent. On the credit side, he entered the sums received from G. and a few other small items. Nothing appeared in the ledger to indicate any appropriation of the payments appearing as credited to B. A. at length distrained upon the goods on the premises for the whole rent in arrear from the beginning of the lease. The day before the sale, B. confessed a large judgment to D. with intent to defraud, hinder and delay A. A fi. fa. was issued on said judgment which "was levied on the goods. Subsequently, said goods were sold under both the distress and ti. fa., and the proceeds were paid into court for <em>distribution, </em>— Held,, that the action of A. in issuing the distress for all the rent from the beginning of the lease constituted an election on his part not to apply any part of the credits on account of said <em>rent, </em>— Held, further, in view of the circumstances, that, had he not made such appropriation, the court would have done so for him, on the ground that the indebtedness outside the lease was least secured, and that the claim as landlord did not come in conflict with that of an honest <em>creditor, </em>— Held,-therefore, that A. was entitled to the whole amount of rent distrained for, from the fund. .</p>

The auditor also held that in cases such as this the law will appropriate the credits to the oldest items in the account.

The confession of said judgment, however fraudulent in intent, being subsequent to the hen acquired by the landlord under the warrant and distress, could in no wise affect that prior lien, and therefore cannot be deemed fraudulent as to the landlord. As between the parties, it was of course valid, and the property having been sold both under the landlord’s warrant and the execution on the judgment, and there being no other creditors claiming the fund, Garrett was clearly entitled to the balance of the fund after the payment of the amount of rent actually due, and the auditor’s distribution should have been confirmed.</p>

This finding was clearly justified by the evidence, and was confirmed by the court. The auditor further found that at the time the distress was made Longenecker was actually indebted to the appellees in the sum of $36,071.96 in excess of all credits. The warrant of distress issued for the sum of $6,028.23. The sum for distribution exclusive of all costs was $5,955.53. An amount of rent exceeding that sum had actually accrued within the year preceding, on the lease. Whether it had been paid depended on the manner of applying Longenecker’s credits. As the appellees had applied them, this sum remained unpaid for rent. By the method of application adopted by the auditor he found that only $2,312.63 remained unpaid as rent, and reported that sum. only for the appellee.
