Does that Act protect the lien of a mortgage from being discharged by a judicial sale under a junior incumbrance, where such mortgage is subsequent in date to a tax claim duly filed and registered in the office of the prothonotary of the county ? We say no — that the object and effect of the Act is to <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>protect a mortgage against a tax, charge or municipal claim, which though accruing after the date of the mortgage was entitled by law to priority. Where the tax is assessed and the claim is filed and registered prior to the mortgage, the mortgagee can protect himself in the first instance by a search in tlieprothonotary’s office, where it is indexed on the judgment index. The contention on the other side is that the Act places mortgages which are prior to all other liens except “ taxes ” on the same plane with mortgages prior to all other liens except “ other mortgages, ground rents, and purchase money due the Commonwealth.” To reach this result, thoy argue that the "words of the Act “ whose lien, though afterwards accruing, has by law priority given it ” relate only to the one immediately antecedent term, “ municipal claims.” We say that those words relate to the immediately antecedent class, “ taxes, charges, assessments and municipal claims.”</p>

    <p id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.6",82,[303,1432,1160,969]]]'>•Prior to 1830, all mortgages were discharged by judicial sales under subsequent incumbrances. By the general Act of that year the lien was preserved of mortgages “ prior to all other liens except other mortgages, ground rents and the purchase money, due to the Commonwealth.” This Act failed to protect mortgages where there was a lien for taxes subsequently assessed but entitled to priority by Act of February 3d 1824, P. L. 192 — of which the Act of 1874, under which the tax lien was filed in this case, is almost a literal transcript. This evil was first remedied in Philadelphia by the special Act of April 11th 1835, P. L. 190, subsequently extended to Allegheny county. But the citizens in other counties were without remedy until the Act of 1867. During all this time no evil existed from cases where the tax was a public registered incumbrance prior to the mortgage, but the trouble was where a subsequently accruing tax by force of law became a prior lien. The only object of the acts giving priority to taxes was payment. The Act of 1867, while not postponing taxes as first liens in the distribution, prevents the divesting of mortgages by retroactive tax liens. The tax in this case was paid out of the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale (except 19 cents), and it is settled law that a lien which so participates is discharged by the sale, and thereby divests all subsequent liens.</p>

Particularly is this so when the relative cannot possibly refer to all, and if it is applied to more than the last we are dependent on voluntary selection. Thus, when the Act says “ other mortgages, ground rents, purchase-money due to the Commonwealth, taxes, charges, assessments, and municipal claims whose lien,” &amp;c., the relative “ whose lien,” &amp;c., cannot sensibly apply to “ other mortgages, or ground rents, or purchase-money due the Commonwealth.” It must apply to “ municipal claims.” It may or may not apply, sensibly, to “ taxes, charges, assessments.” But these are classed in the sentence with the preceding words; there is no “and” between the words “ Commonwealth ” and “ taxes.” Grammatically, therefore, as well as logically and legally, we contend that the manifest purpose of the Act was to enlarge the list of incumbrances which might precede a mortgage without divesting its lien in ease of a judicial sale. It placed “ taxes,” &amp;c., upon the same plane with “ other mortgages,” &amp;c. Otherwise the act would in many cases fail of its alleged object, for in Reading taxes are a lien from date of lev}', viz., on or before June 1st, and the lien is not registered until after the 1st of January following. In the meantime an inspection of the record will not enable a mortgagee to discover the lien, yet, under the construction contended for on the other side, a mortgage given after the lien, <em>i. e., </em>the levy, attaches, and before registration, will be discharged by a sale under a junior incumbrance. Even if the relative clause relates to “ taxes,- charges and assessments, ” as well as to municipal claims, its function is not to specify the circumstances under which a claim may be a prior lien and yet save the lien of a mortgage, but it is to designate and set apart the class of claims that is to have the same effect upon mortgages that ground rents, &amp;c., have had since 1880, without regard to the time such claim accrued, whether before or after the recording of the mortgage.</p>

On the same day a lien was filed against the same premises, by the Reading School District, for school-tax, amounting to $20.19. Each of these liens, as will be noticed, antedates the mortgage.

Subsequently a scire facias was issued upon the mortgage, and the only question raised upon the trial below was, whether the sheriff’s sale discharged the lien of the mortgage, by reason of the prior registered liens for taxes.

This defect in the Act of 1830 was remedied, so far as Philadelphia is concerned, by the act of 11th April 1835, P. L. 190. In other portions of the state where by law priority was given to tax liens, and to which the act of Í835 had not been extended, the same trouble existed, and there was the same insecurity of mortgages.

It was argued with much learning and ability by the counsel for the defendant in error that the proper antecedent of the word “ lien” is “ municipal claims,” and that it is to such claims only that the words “ whose lien though after-wards accruing has by law priority given it,” applies. The effect of this construction, if adopted, would be to lift “ taxes, charges and assessments” out of the operation of the subsequent qualification, and place them upon the same plane with prior “ mortgages, ground rents, and purchase money due to the commonwealth.” The grammatical construction of a statute is one mode of interpretation. But it is not the only mode, and it is not always the true mode. We may assume that the draftsman of an Act understood the rules of grammar, but it is not always safe to do so. The Act of 1867 was evidently passed with reference to preceding Acts in regard to taxes. In many of these Acts the words “taxes, charges, assessments and municipal claims” had been used together, and in connection with the word “lien.” This \vas so in the Philadelphia Act of 16th of April 1845, P. L. 488, of 23d of January 1849, P. L. 686, and the Allegheny Act of 5th April 1844. P. L. 199. Our best judgment is that “ taxes, charges, assessments and municipal claims” in the Act of 1867, were all intended as antecedents of the word “ lien,” and if this makes good law, the grammatical construction is not so important.</p>
