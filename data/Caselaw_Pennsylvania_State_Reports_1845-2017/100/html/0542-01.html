Nerons agreed by parol with Henry Mower to purchase from him a certain lot of ground. The land was clearly designated, the consideration ($180) agreed upon, and the possession delivered to Nerons, who, by the agreement, was to have his own time to pay for the lot, and to give his note for the purchase money upon the delivery of the deed. The deed, however, was never tendered to him, nor was the note demanded or the purchase money paid. Immediately upon talcing possession, Nerons erected a building upon the land, expending $300 of his own money, and contracted a debt to Eberly for material used in said building. In 1871, one year after tlie building was erected, Eberly entered a mechanics’ lien against it, and in 1875, Nerons confessed a judgment to him on a scire facias issued on this mechanics’ lien.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b559-4" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[126,1034,1156,257]]]'>In the same year, the lot was sold by Mower to Lehman, who knew of the contract with Nerons, and upon the execution of a deed to Lehman, he paid the purchase money, $221. In 1876, the lot was sold by the sheriff, under an execution issued on Eberly’s judgment, and Eberly, who was the purchaser at this sale, brought this suit.</p>

He neither paid nor tendered any purchase money, but attorned to Lehman, first paying him rent and then surrendering possession to him.

The improvements in this instance were not of such a character: Dougan <em>v. </em>Blocher, 12 Harris 28 ; Hill <em>v. </em>Meyers, 7 Wr. 170; Ballard <em>v. </em>Ward, 8 Nor. 358. Pugh <em>v. </em>Good, and Jones <em>v. </em>Peterman, cited by plaintiff in error, were overruled, in Moore <em>v. </em>Small, supra. Without part payment of purchase money, there can be no “part performance ” by the vendee, and for this reason no case can be found of a recovery without such part payment.</p>

Where possession has been taken in pursuance of the contract, and there has been such part performance that the purchaser cannot reasonably be compensated in damages, the case is taken out of the statute. Possession and payment of purchase money only are not sufficient, for the vendee may be compensated in damages; but when to possession is added permanent improvements of considerable value which cannot be thus reasonably compensated, the rule is held otherwise. This constitutes such a part performance as to take the case out of the statute: McGibbeny <em>v. </em>Burmaster, 3 P. F. Smith 332.</p>
    <p id="b560-9" data-blocks='[["BL_560.12",560,[271,1893,1170,510]],["BL_561.1",561,[138,415,1168,688]]]'>This action is for a lot which the evidence shows Nerons bought of Mower by a parol contract. He took possession in pursuance of his purchase, and made valuable improvements on the lot. The plaintiff claims as a purchaser at sheriff’s sale on a judgment entered against Nerons after the improvements were made; and the defendant claims by deed from Mower some time thereafter. The controlling question is whether Herons had such an interest in the lot as to be bound by the judgment against him ? The learned judge thought he had not, and ordered a compulsory nonsuit. If we correctly understand the court, this conclusion was based solely on the fact that Nerons had not paid any part of the consideration <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>money to Mower. In the opinion filed, inter alia, it said, <em>“ </em>it may be assumed that the contract for the sale of the land by Mower to Nerons has been fully proved by the testimony of Nerons, the vendee, and the deposition of Mower, the vendor. The land, according to their testimony, -was clearly designated and described, the consideration agreed upon and possession delivered to the vendee. The vendee erected a building on the land, tfte materials for which were furnished by Eberly, who entered a mechanic’s lien against the building, making Nerons alone the defendant therein.” In the continued narative it is stated that the mechanic’s lien was not filed until a year after the building was erected: but the decision does not appear to rest on the ground that the lien was not filed in time. It declares that at no time had Nerons any estate in the land, and therefore the judgment which he confessed on the scire facias on the mechanic’s claim attached to nothing.</p>
    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[137,1102,1167,686]]]'>This view does not give due effect to the equity in Nerons arising from his expenditure, which more than doubled the permanent value of the land: Wack <em>v. </em>Sorber, <a href="/whart/2/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Whart. 387" data-case-ids="1830460" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0387-01">2 Whart. 387</a>. When a party has induced another on the faith of his promise, though verbal, to expend his cash or labor for which he can only be remunerated by the enjoyment of the thing so promised, equity will compel the promisor to give such deed or writing, as will secure the promisee’s perfect enjoyment of the tiling promised: McKellip <em>v. </em>McIlhenny, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20322" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Watts 322">4 Watts 322</a>. In Pennsylvania ejectment is substituted for a bill in equity: Peebles <em>v. </em>Reading, 8 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 484. When brought to enforce specific performance of a purchase it is subject to all tho considerations that would affect a bill for that purpose in the contemplation of a chancellor : Brawdy <em>v. </em>Brawdy, 7 Barr 158. It will lie to enforce execution of articles of agreement on the part of a vendee who has never been in possession : Tyson <em>v. </em>Passmore, 2 Id. 122.</p>

Nerons testifies that when the contract was made, Mower told him to go immediately and take possession, to get his lumber and build his house; that he was not to give any note until he received the deed, and Mower said he had no blank deeds in his possession, but was going to town the next day. He further testifies that he took possession and expended $300 in money on the property. It does not appear <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>that Mower ever tendered a deed to Nerons or demauded payment of the purchase money.</p>

This was <em>more </em>than two years after the erection of the house. He further testifies it was distinctly understood, that this sale was of the lot only, and not of the improvements; that he said to Lehman, he would like to see Eberly paid for the lumber -which he had put in the house, and Lehman replied he would pay him a just price therefor. Thus the evidence of Mower is not only that Lehman bought with full knowledge of Nerons’ equitable interest and of the plaintiff’s claim for lumber, used in the house; but he also knew the intention of Mower was to convey to him the legal title only.</p>

The judgment thereon was confessed, and the deed to Lehman was executed, in 1875. Which was first in time, the record fails to disclose. Nerons was in possession when he confessed the judgment. It then became a lien on all his equitable interest in the lot. He continued in possession. The evidence does not show any act of his intended to affect his equitable title until April 1876. Then he rented the premises of Lehman for one year.</p>
