An agreement by a creditor to take less than his claim, upon condition that all the creditors become parties to it, is not a discharge of the debt, unless all do become parties: Greer <em>v. </em>Shriver, <a href="/pa/53/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="53 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1004733" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0259-01">53 Pa.

It matters not whether the agreement is valid or invalid with respect to the prior signers, or subsequent. The contest is between Laird and Campbell only, and depends entirely upon* the question whether Laird induced Campbell to enter into the agreement by a statement that it should not take effect till signed by all his creditors. It was competent for the parties to make such condition orally, and if they did, Laird lias no defence by virtue of the composition, for he testifies that all did not agree to it, and some were paid ip. full.

The extent of Young’s authority is admitted by his principal, and the declarations were not offered to prove his authority. Naturally, the creditor would inquire respecting other creditors. The agent’s answer was as clearly within the scope of his employment, as the unauthorized warranty of the quality of goods by an agent for their sale. If the principal claims the benefit of the contract, or receives and holds the price, he must perform his part, of the bargain. The rule that “ where one of two innocent <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>persons must suffer by the fault of a third, the loss must fall on him who reposed the confidence,” may have some application ; but if so, not.that urged by the plaintiff in error.

Ev. § 117. If the goods were charged before the contract of sale was complete, the book is not competent evidence. The entry must be made at the delivery of the goods, or immediately after; at or about the time when there is a transmutation of the property from the vendor to the vendee: Parker <em>v. </em>Donaldson, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 9" data-case-ids="1853527" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0009-01">2 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 9</a>. The plaintiff’s open order-book was not evidence. When the order was entered therein no property in any specific goods had passed. The book containing the entries made at or about the time the goods were delivered, was evidence.</p>
