A. brought an action for a breach of a covenant, contained in a contract under seal, to supply to him 250 tons of iron ore, monthly, for three years, from the commencing of certain mining operations. In his declaration he set forth the contract, and further averred that the period for commencing the mining operations was not to be later than a given date, and further that defendant failed to commence said operations before said date, or to furnish any ore to the plaintiff. On the trial, plaintiff put the contract in evidence, and further, offered to prove a parol representation by defendant, at the time of the making of the contract, as to the time when ho would begin mining operations, without which plaintiff would not have entered into the contract. <em>Held </em>that under the averments of the declaration, the offer was inadmissible, and was lightly rejected.</p>

Such an averment, if proved, would have justiñed a reformation of the instrument. What a chancellor would decree to be done, the courts of this state consider as actually done. Covenant then would be the proper action upon the instrument as reformed. The plaintiffs, however, contented themselves with declaring on the instrument as they alleged was agreed, without an averment either of fraud or mistake. This did not meet the exigency of the rule, which requires that the defendant should have, distinct notice of the ground upon which the proposed reformation is asked, that he might come prepared to meet it. “I do not consider,” said Mr. Justice Rogers, in Clark <em>v. </em>Partridge, 2 Barr 15, “this as a mere technical objection. It is a matter of some moment to the defendant, to have his cause tried on the only and true issue.” It was held in that case that fraud must be alleged, not merely facts from which a jury might have inferred fraud. To the same effect is Renshaw <em>v. </em>Gans, 7 Barr 117. Parol evidence is inadmissible to reform a written contract according to the intention of the parties, unless the declaration specially sets forth the fraud as a ground for such reformation. The same rule applies of course to the case of mistake. The distinction is well marked between such cases, and those where the parties subsequently agree to a change of the terms. There, if the agreement is under seal, the effect of the subsequent change by parol, is to make the whole parol — and <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>assumpsit,not covenant, is the proper form of action: Vicary <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/watts/2/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Watts 451" data-case-ids="1840171" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0451-01">2 Watts 451</a>.</p>
