      <em>“ </em>This proceeding is instituted by the attorney-general, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennslyvania, against the defendants, to restrain an alleged encroachment upon one of the highways of the city of Philadelphia.

In March 1881, it was in part or in whole constructed. The city then interposed by injunction to restrain the defendants from maintaining the obstruction which is the subject of the present controversy, and that in order to satisfy the complaint, which was then made against it by a property-holder, the defendants say, ‘ We did reduce said projection at least two feet, and that the bay window now erected is of said reduced dimensions.’ This was some three months before the passage of the general ordinance of June 24th 1851, and at least five months prior to the special license, attempted to be granted by that of September following. The encroachment, as originally created, extended over the footway at least five feet, and, as now constructed, is in excess of the limit prescribed in the ordinance. It is charged in the bill that the window projects over or into the highway three feet six inches, and this is virtually confessed to be so by the evasive statement contained in the answer, that the extension is <em>about </em>three feet. There is no need for uncertainty in the answer of the defendants on this point, and every infer-' ence must be taken most strongly against them, when precise information is withheld which it is in their powrer to give.</p>

In such case no question of the amount of damage is raised, but simply one of the invasion of a right. This is the doctrine announced in the case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>P. &amp; C. R. R.

The encroachment in the case before us does not consist in an obstruction of the ordinary right of passage along or over a street or highway, a highway being defined to be a road given to the public, passing from one public place to another public place. .The right of passing along or over a road has connected with it certain incidents which are essential to the proper enjoyment of it, such as light and air and view. If a highway should be covered over, for instance, by the owners of property fronting on either side of it, so as to shut out the light from above, its enjoyment would not only be greatly interfered with, but it might often be rendered dangerous and practically useless. Projecting windows from an upper story interfere to some extent with the ordinary and proper enjoyment of rights which are free to all, and one who appropriates the space above the footway creates a purpresture by making several to himself that which ought to be common to many. It cannot be successfully maintained that owners of property fronting on a highway have any such right as this, and when there is a purpresture set up, and such purpresture constitutes a nuisance as well, by a wrongful appropriation of a portion of a highway, courts of equity may forbid the continuance of such nuisance and abate the same by injunction.</p>

The fact, however, is not to be forgotten or overlooked that to no small extent this doctrine, as applied in the English courts, and in some of the State courts in our own country, is to be regarded as modified by our own legislation. Our equity jurisdiction is wholly statutory, and rests not on common law principles, except in so far as the legislature have in general terms conferred upon the supreme court and courts of common pleas, the jurisdiction and powers of a court of chancery, in relation to the several matters specifically mentioned in the Act June 16th 1836, and the several acts which follow it on the same subject.

We are also of the opinion that the obstruction is both prejudicial to the interests of the community and the rights of individual property holders in the neighborhood, and that the persons injured would not be adequately compensated by a recovery of damages ; the evil being a continuous one, leading to an endless repetition of suits at law, in which the damages to be recovered would be more than nominal.</p>
