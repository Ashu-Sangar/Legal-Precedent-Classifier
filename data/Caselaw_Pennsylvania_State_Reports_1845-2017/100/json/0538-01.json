        "text": "Mr Justice Paxson\ndelivered the opinion of the Court October 2d 1882.\nThe single question in this case is whether the word \u201c children\u201d in the third clause of Simon Oyster\u2019s wh, is a word of limitation or of purchase. The learned judge below held that under the said clause the testator\u2019s son, Simon Washington Oyster, took an estate tail, which under our statute of 27th April 1855 is enlarged into a fee simple. The operative words of the clause are as follows : \u201c I give and bequeath to my son, Simon Washington Oyster, my farm, in East Pennsboro\u2019, county of Cumberland, . . . for his support and estate, to be and remain bequeathed to his children during their natural life.\u201d\nWithout reviewing the learning upon this subject, it is sufficient to say that the authorities are uniform that \u201c children \u201d is as certainly a word of purchase as \u201c heirs of the body \u201d are words of limitation : Guthrie\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 9 ; Taylor v. Taylor, 13 P. F. S. 481. This is the general rule, and the exceptions which from time to time have been recognized do not impair the rule itself. There are many instances in our state where \u201cchildren\u201d has been held to be a word of limitation, but in all of them such construction was clearly in accord with the intent of the testators as gathered from the four corners of the will, as when \u201cchildren\u201d has been used with \u201cheirs of the body \u201d or \u201c issue \u201d as its synonyms.\nThe ruling of the court below was based mainly- upon the supposed intent of the testator; the learned judge being of opinion that he employed the word \u201cchildren,\u201d '\"not in its usual sense as a word of purchase, but in the more comprehensive sense of a word of limitation, pointing out the course of descent through the entire line of lineal heirs; and that, as there was no limitation over, the presumption is that he intended to dispose of his whole estate.\nThis course of reasoning is not without force, but we think it insufficient to overturn the legal and technical meaning of the testator\u2019s language. The intent of a testator is always important in the construction of a will, where such intent can be gathered from the face of the will with reasonable certainty. But too much care cannot be exercised to avoid setting aside the expressed intention for a supposed intention. In the former instance we have a rule which may be followed with mathematical precision, which lawyers and conveyancers understand, and in regard to which they can safely advise their clients; while in the latter case we are involved in speculation and uncertainty, and the result at last is but a guess, and not always a correct one. Mr. Jarman says in his work on Wills, vol. 3, p. 708 : \u201c Words and limitations may be transposed, supplied or rejected, where warranted by the immediate context or the general scheme of the will; but not merely on a conjectural hypothesis of the testator\u2019s intention, however reasonable, in opposition to the plain and obvious sense of the language of the instrument.\u201d This principle is recognized by Mr. Hawkins and other text-writers, and runs throughout our entire line of cases.\nThe will before us was probably drawn by the testator himself. We have examined it in vain for anything that clearly indicates that he used the word \u201c children \u201d in the third clause as a word of limitation. If such intent does not clearly appear, it does not appear at all for the purposes of this case, as the legal and well-understood meaning of the word \u201c children \u201d cannot be overtm-ned upon mere conjecture. The thi2-d clause of of the will, standing alone, evinces an intent to give his son Simon the far2n, for his support du2-ii2g his life. It is thei2 given to his (Simon\u2019s) child2-en, dmdng their natural life. The gift to the children means S02nething. It was intended to take effect in the future ; the children were to take as purchasers, as a gift from the testatoi\u2019, and by virtue of his own power to dispose of the land. Just what estate the children take under the will, is a question that does not ar\u2019ise in this ease. The2-e is no 2-emainder over on failui\u2019e of child2\u2019en, and, while this is a dhcumstance entitled to some weight, it is not cont2\u2019olling: Hoffner v. Wynkoop, 1 Outerbridge 130. If, upon such failure, the testator intended the farm to revert to his estate, the law would car2\u2019y it there as effectually as would a special dh-ection \u00cd22 his will. He may have relied upoi2 the law for this purpose, or the possibility of Shnon\u2019s dyi22g without children may never have occurred to him.\nThe2,e is nothing in the 2\u2019emainder of the will in conflict with this view. It is true, in a single instance he uses the word \u201c children \u201d as the equivalent of \u201c heirs,\u201d referi-ing to his ow2i child2-en, and his own heirs, in the first and second pa2\u2019agraphs of the will. But nowhere, in speaking of the children of his sons and daughters, does he use the word indiscriminately with heirs of the body or issue, and all of them as meaning an entire line of lineal descent. Haldeman v. Haldeman, 4 Wright 29, relied upon by the defendant in error, was ruled mainly upon the ground that'the words referred to were so used.\nWhile the testator may have intended the word \u201c children \u201d as a word of limitation, such fact does not clearly appear, and it would not be safe for us to assume it.\nWe are of opinion that the word \u201c children\u201d in the third clause of Simon Oyster\u2019s will, is a word of purchase. It follows that Simon'Washington Oyster took but a life estate in the farm, which' is -the subject of this contention.\nThe -judgment is reversed, and it is ordered that judgment be entered in favor of Napoleon K. Oyster, the defendant below, upon the case stated.",

J., Mercur, Gordon, Paxson, Tronkey, Sterrett and Green JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberlcmdcounty : Of July Term 1882, No. 58.\nCase stated, wherein Simon W. Oyster was plaintiff and Napoleon K. Oyster defendant, setting forth as follows:\nSimon Oyster, late of Harrisburg, Dauphin county, Pennsylvania, died, seised in fee of a large amount of real estate, leaving a widow, Margaretta Oyster, and a number of children. By his will, dated June 14th 1865, and duly proven April 6th 1867, he devised, inter alia, as follows, to wit:\n\u201cI give and bequeath to my son, Simon Washington Oyster, my farm, situated in East Pennsboro\u2019, county of Cumberland, State of Pennsylvania, Mansion farm, containing one hundred and twenty-five acres, with all improvements, and twenty acres woodland, east side Blue Mountain, running to its base in said township, &c., in woodland for farm, with three-story brick house on South street, in Harrisburg, No. 4 in my row, and ten shares of Harrisburg bridge stock, and twenty shares of Harrisburg bank stock, for his support and estate to be and remain bequeathed to his children during their natural life.\u201d\nAt the time of the death of Simon Oyster, Simon W. Oyster was a minor and without children. He has since married and has children living.\nOn March 15th 1882, Simon W. Oyster made a contract to convey the farm in East Pennsboro\u2019 township, mentioned in the foregoing devise, \u201c by deed in fee simple and clear of all incumbrances,\u201d to Napoleon K. Oyster, the defendant \u2014 the deed therefor to be \u201c delivered on April 1st 1882, or as soon thereafter as possible.\u201d In consideration of this, N. JK. Oyster bound himself to pay to Simon W. Oyster ten thousand dollars, as follows: five hundred dollars on the agreement, the balance of one half on delivery of deed and possession, and the remainder in two equal annual payments on April 1st 1883 and 1884, with interest on each payment from April 1st 1882, payable annually, and to be secured by judgments. On April 3d 1882, Simon W. Oyster formally tendered a deed in fee simple for said farm to the defendant. The parties to the deed were Simon W. Oyster, the plaintiff, with Bella M., his wife and Margaretta Oyster, widow of Simon Oyster, deceased, who had declared to take under her husband\u2019s will and joined in the deed in order to convey the property clear of her dower. The defendant declined to accept the deed thus tendered, and refused to pay the sum of forty-five hundred dollars then payable under the agreement, and to give the judgments provided for, alleging that under the will of Simon Oyster, deceased, the fee simple in land did not pass to Simon W. Oyster, the plantiff. The agreement and the deed are made parts of this case. Should the Court be of the opinion that Simon W. Oyster took an estate in fee simple in the farm in East Pennsboro\u2019 township under the will of Simon Oyster, deceased, then judgment is to be entered for the sum of forty-five hundred dollars, with interest from April 1st 1882,in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant; but if the Court should be of a contrary opinion, the judgment is not' be entered in favor the defendant against the plaintiff for the sum of five hundred dollars, the amount paid by the defendant on the agreement, with interest from March 15th 1882. The costs sliall follow the judgment and either party shall have the right to take out a writ of error to the Supreme Court without oath or bail.\nThe court entered judgment for the plaintiff on the case stated; whereupon the defendant took this writ of error, assigning for error the entry of said judgment.\n\u00a1S. Ilepburn, Jr., for the plantiff in error.\nJohn Hays, for the defendant in error."
