This codicil, with the will, dated February 11, 1937, and another codicil dated May 9, 1937, was admitted to probate. No question is raised about the probate of the will and the codicil of May 9th.

This subject is adequately dealt with in the opinion of the learned hearing judge and also in the opinion filed by the court in banc in disposing of appellant’s exceptions; we shall therefore only refer briefly to the controlling evidence. The first page begins by the heading “A codicile to my Last Will dated February 11, 1937” and, in the next line, refers to page 2 of the will and its fourth paragraph in which testatrix says she desires to have read as she then states it on the rest of that page. In the fourth paragraph, as was stated above, she had disposed of the residue of her estate and had appointed Sydney Dreifus, Frank D. Behring and the Girard Trust Company, trustees. One of her purposes in making the codicil was to eliminate <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>the Girard Trust Company as one of the trustees and to substitute “the First National Bank, 2nd Street and Girard Aye. Office, of the City of Philadelphia, . . .” In the fourth paragraph of the will, she had provided for the accumulation of the income during the minorities of the grandchildren; this provision was now changed on the first page of this codicil by directing the trustees “to pay over one-half the income therefrom, starting one year from the date of my death, quarterly, unto Frank D. Behring” until the grandchildren become of age. The first thing at the top of the second page is “Continuation of codieile of my Last Will dated February 11, 1937.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The next line begins: “Also, that on page 4 of my Last Will. ...” Both the word “Continuation” and the word “Also” indicate that the second page was not in itself the complete instrument but that something had preceded it and was now in process of completion. The second page then goes on to refer to the 9th paragraph of her will and contains what undoubtedly refers to and connects with what was stated on the first page. This provision is, I nominate, etc., “said Sydney Dreifus, Frank D. Behring and the First National Bank to be the executors of this my Last Will and Testament. ...” This bank was not referred to in the will and appeared for the first time in the first sheet of the codicil with relation to the 4th paragraph of the will appointing trustees. In the 9th paragraph of her will testatrix had named the Girard Trust Company as one of the executors. The words on the second sheet “said Sydney Dreifus, Frank D. Behring and the First National Bank,” therefore, directly refer to the words on the first sheet “the First National Bank, 2nd Street and Girard Ave. Office, of the City of Philadelphia, ...” On the first page she made a change in the trustees and on the second page a change in the executors, and, in addition, joined the executors and trus<a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>tees in the provision that no bond shall be required of them. We must therefore agree with the learned court below in the legal conclusion that the papers are so connected in their internal sense as to constitute a single instrument and therefore entitled to probate,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> unless appellant shall have made good her averment of fraudulent substitution of the first page by Frank D. Behring. We then come to that subject, for it is only on that branch of the case that the demand for a jury trial is for consideration.</p>

If the issue were granted, appellant would have the burden of proving the forgery to the satisfaction of a jury, but before the issue can be granted, the appellant must first satisfy the court below that “the ends of justice call for a verdict against the will, or [that the court] is so uncertain on this point that [it] could conscionably sustain a finding either way. ...” <em>Tetlow’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/269/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="269 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1063497" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0486-01">269 Pa. 486</a>, 494, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.%20758" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="112 A. 758">112 A. 758</a>; see also <em>Brehony v.

Judge Stearns, the hearing judge, put the matter with characteristic clearness: “Doubtless there was ample opportunity for perpetration of fraud by Frank D. Behring, and there may be ground for considerable conjecture and suspicion, but as was said by Henderson, J., in <em>Wanamaker’s Estate, </em>8 D. &amp; C. 569, p. 576: ‘. . . opportunity is not evidence, and conjecture and suspicion do not take the place of testimony.’ ” The close relation in which Behring stood to testatrix is described <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>in the opinion in <em>Rosenthal’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/335/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="335 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="1193070" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0049-01">335 Pa. 49</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20585" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="6 A.2d 585">6 A. 2d 585</a>, supra.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Behring, who was called by the appellant, described the circumstances in which he typed the codicil. He testified that testatrix had her will and read from it parts of the fourth and ninth paragraphs and dictated the modifications as she desired them and as they now appear in the codicil and that he typed them as she read and dictated to him; that he made an original and one carbon copy, which, after she read them, were left with her.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Mr. Fitzpatrick, who witnessed her signature was an employee of the Rosenthal Company and testified that he was invited to her house for dinner, and afterward, at her request, saw her execute the codicil and witnessed her signature; that while <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>there was more than one sheet he did not see enough of the instrument to describe it in greater detail. Witnesses testified to declarations that she wished to change her will and make further provision for Behring.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Appellant also regards the circumstances in which the codicil was found as suspicious; it was not found immediately after death but was located by Behring on September 12th in a letter file in decedent’s house. The will had been found in her safe deposit box in the Girard Trust Company. The carbon copy of the codicil was found in a safe in Mrs. Rosenthal’s bedroom; the combination of this safe was obtained from a memorandum in her writing found in her safe deposit box. The safe was opened by an employee of the Trust Company. Behring testified that he did not know the combination and had never had access to the safe. The appellant suggests that this evidence should not be believed; but, there is no denial of it and it came from a witness called by her; moreover, if the court elected not to believe his testimony, the rejection of it would still not prove that he opened the safe and put the carbon copy of the codicil in. Mere opportunity to commit a fraud, is, of itself, not sufficient to prove that Behring committed a fraud. The proponent called witnesses, experts in the operation of typewriters, who pointed out physical appearances in the papers which amounted to a demonstration that the face copies of the codicil and the carbon copies taken out of the safe were written at the same time on the same machine by the same operator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

It is clear also that proponent was a favorite of testatrix, and while not of her blood, yet a natural object of her solicitude. He had been in close and constant association with testatrix’s husband and herself in the former’s lifetime, and after his death, with testatrix herself. The record contains nothing in our opinion to substantiate anything but that the utmost propriety and regularity existed in this relationship. We have the testimony of at least three credible disinterested witnesses that testatrix, at times suspicious to the execution of the questioned codicil, expressed her intention to further provide for proponent by her will.”</p>
