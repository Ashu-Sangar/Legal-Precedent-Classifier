Rieger, who alleged his appointment as escheator “of certain unclaimed trust funds in the possession of” respondent, which was described as “engaged in the business of acting as a fiduciary in the capacity of Administrator, Executor, Guardian, Agent, Trustee or otherwise.” Petitioner averred that respondent had possessed (1) “uninvested trust funds,” composed of (a) “uninvested balances” held as “Administrator, Executor, Guardian or Trustee under wills of decedents,” and of (b) “uninvested personal trust funds” as trustee under indentures of trust made by individuals, and (2) also had “uninvested corporate trust funds”; that, on deposits of those funds, respondent received interest of which it credited only part to the “various personal trusts or trust estates . . . but did not distribute all such interest and income to the trusts, trust estates or the beneficiaries entitled thereto” with the result that “the said undistributed interest and income earned on the said trust funds accumulated over a period of many years,” and which <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>respondent “did appropriate and convert . . ; to and for its own uses.” He averred that “many trusts and trust estates were terminated and closed and the Trustees discharged [and] . . . that at the times the aforesaid trust companies took and appropriated trust funds therefrom, as hereinbefore related, the rightful or lawful owners thereof could not be ascertained or determined, and that the rightful or lawful owners thereof cannot now be ascertained or determined.”</p>

In September, the Attorney General appeared on behalf of the Commonwealth and moved to dismiss the proceeding on the ground that the escheator’s commission had been revoked. The Act of May 28, 1915, P. L. 616, amended July 7, 1919, P. L. 731, 12 PS section 145, authorizes the Commonwealth to intervene “and to appear, plead, prosecute, defend, or appeal, as other parties litigant.” The learned court below heard argument and dismissed the Attorney General’s motion. The Commonwealth appeals from that action.</p>

As we understand the petition, the property in question is the accumulation of interest paid to respondent on various deposits of trust funds, but which, because respondent “did not distribute all such interest and income to the trusts, trust estates, or the beneficiaries entitled thereto,” it appropriated to its own use; in other words, it received interest on trust deposits and kept part of it. This property is alleged to have been received and misappropriated by respondent in a number of capacities: as administrator, as executor, as agent, and as “trustee or otherwise.” Petitioner does not state how many accounts there were in all or in any of the capacities named; if we may judge from the total sum alleged to have been misappropriated ($829,028.20) there must have been a large number of trust accounts and, therefore, if the averments are true, there must be many creditors or claimants on the funds.</p>

The feudal origin of escheat may be laid aside and an escheat may be defined as the Commonwealth’s seizure of property which has been abandoned or of which the owner has died intestate, leaving no one to take from him. Our statute law on the subject began early.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Intestate Act still contains an escheat provision (section 24)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> based on the Act of September 29, 1787, 2 Sm.

The escheat of trust estates was not provided for by the early legislation and apparently the omission was not cured until the Act of April 17, 1869, P. L. 71, was approved. As it is the predecessor of the present legislation for the escheat of trusts, bailments and deposits, we must refer to its provisions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Section 1 provided for the escheat of “the beneficial interest” of a trust estate; section 2, for the escheat of trust property of beneficiaries “unknown for the space of seven years”; section 3 provided that “Whenever any trustee, bailee or other depositary is or shall be seized or possessed of property, real, personal or mixed, as a fiduciary agent, which property is or shall be without a rightful owner, the same shall escheat ...”</p>

L. 66, which, in <em>Alton’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/220/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="220 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="1005881" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0258-01">220 Pa. 258</a>, 269, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.%20902" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="69 A. 902">69 </a><a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a><a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.%20902" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="69 A. 902">A'. 902</a> (1908) was described as establishing “a complete system of escheats and [repealing] all acts inconsistent therewith.” Section 1 dealt with property left by an intestate; section <em>2, </em>with property deposited in court or with a depository or receiver or other officer of a court; section 3, with trust property. In such cases the Auditor General was authorized to appoint an escheator. In this Act, as in the prior legislation, the legislature dealt with the unknown owner’s property as a separate unit: (a) as the property of an intestate; (b) as the deposited “money, estate, or effects” of “unknown” persons; (c) as trust property of an unknown beneficiary. Subsequent sections conferred jurisdiction and supplied procedure. Provision was made for notice to parties interested and for an adjudication of the account. Section 9 provided for jury trial of disputed “facts touching said escheat.” Section 10 required the court to set forth certain facts in the adjudication such as “the full name of the intestate, if any there be, or of the person who was last seized or possessed of the property in question.” Provision was made for the sale of real estate. Time was allowed for parties, claiming to be interested, and without notice, to traverse the adjudication and, in special contingencies, to have a trial. These provisions are mentioned for the purpose of showing that property left by an intestate or abandoned by an owner was made the subject of a single proceeding. There is nothing to indicate that claimants to properties in two or more estates alleged to be escheatable could be required to become joint parties to a single suit. From the phraseology used, it could never have been contemplated that the issues arising in a number of es-cheat proceedings concerning property of unrelated owners should be tried in a single suit. We have no doubt that it was the legal impossibility of joining different escheat proceedings in one petition, considered with the desirability, in circumstances where there is a single debtor, of trying a number of escheatable claims <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>in a single suit, that led to the change in later legislation which, departing from the requirement of separate trials in the case of each escheated estate, specifically authorized the Attorney General to proceed by bill against one debtor obligated to different creditors.</p>
    <p id="AHY" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[143,618,1155,1084]],["BL_562.1",562,[287,345,1154,1227]]]'>This change came about in the Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> of June 7, 1915, P. L. 878. The statute enlarged the provisions of the Acts of 1869 and of 1889. Section 7 provides for enforcement “by action in the nature of a bill in equity, by the Commonwealth, under the direction of the Attorney General, against the debtor and its creditors. Any number of items may be joined in one action against one debtor, though owed to different creditors.” In that phraseology lies the authority for trying a number of escheats in a single proceeding. It appears to be the first departure from the former requirement that each escheatable estate be dealt with separately. This 7th section was amended by the Act of April 21, 1921, P. L. 223, section 5,27 PS section 282, providing: “Such escheat shall, at the suggestion of the Auditor General, be determined and enforced by an action in the nature of a bill in equity, filed by and in the name of the Attorney General, against the depositary, fiduciary, or debtor, and all of his or its depositors, beneficiaries, or creditors for whom he or it holds unclaimed moneys es<a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>cbeatable under the provisions of this act, in the appropriate court. . . . Any such escheat proceedings may be prosecuted whether the deposits, dividends, moneys, funds, or other property or estate sought to be escheated, shall have been reported to the Auditor General in conformity with the provisions of this act or have not been so reported. Any number of items may be joined in one action against one debtor, though owed to different creditors.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The language is mandatory; the escheat shall be determined by an action in the nature of a bill in equity brought by the Attorney General. This innovation is of controlling significance in disposing of this appeal. The Fiscal Code of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, section 1308, P. L. 404, 72 PS section 1308, transferred escheats from the Auditor General’s to the Revenue Department but retained the requirement of suit by the Attorney General. Section 1302, defining the powers and duties of escheators does not provide for a single proceeding to escheat several funds. Section 1309 gives to the Attorney General the option to exercise any of. the powers, given to escheators, but does not permit escheators to exercise the functions of the Attorney General.</p>

Before the passage of the Act of Parliament which modified it, the rule of the English common law appears to have been, that where a <em>cestui que trust </em>died without heirs, the trust did not escheat to the crown, so that the lands could be recovered in a court of equity by the King; hut the trustee should hold them for his own benefit: <em>Burgess v.
