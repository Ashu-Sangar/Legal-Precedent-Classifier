    <p id="b103-10" data-blocks='[["BL_103.13",103,[137,1271,1153,428]]]'>This appeal is from the opening of a judgment entered, as the learned court below says, on June 8, 1939, on a scire facias to revive and bring in the heirs and personal representatives of Anna V. Giessen, one of the defendants, who died in 1934. The original judgment had been entered January 26, 1932, on a warrant to confess judgment contained in a promissory note dated April 1, 1927. That judgment on its face is valid.</p>

We gather from the opinion filed below that the judgment entered in 1939 was opened to afford opportunity to the defendants to attempt to show that one of the makers of the note, Anna V. Giessen, was a married woman in 1927 and that she had signed as an accommodation maker.</p>
