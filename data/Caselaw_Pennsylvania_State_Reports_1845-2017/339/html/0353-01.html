Defendants filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, which the court below sustained. The parties have stipulated that the case is. to be treated as if the bill had been dismissed upon final hearing, the averments therein being admitted by defendants.</p>

Under date of April 24,1939, such agreements were again entered into, but they differed from previous ones in that, in addition to a first part which provided as theretofore for closed shops, with regulations as to wages, hours of labor, vacations, grievances, arbitration, strikes, lockouts, and other matters concerning employment, they contained a new second part, expressly made severable from the first, dealing with the conditions which should thereafter govern relations between the laundry companies and what are known in the trade as “bob-tails,” in which group plaintiffs are included. The laundry companies send drivers on the streets, each with a specified route, to <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>solicit business, collect wash and return the laundered articles, their compensation being on a commission basis with a guaranteed weekly minimum. But the so-called “bob-tails” are persons who conduct stores or establishments of their own, where patrons may bring articles to be laundered. Most of them employ help in their stores, these employees being members of Laundry Workers’ International Union, Local No. 10, which, like defendant union, is a member of the American Federation of Labor. The “bob-tails” themselves operate trucks for the solicitation of business and the collection and delivery of laundry. They have capital invested in their businesses consisting of fixtures,' trucks, accounts receivable, and other assets. While they do not carry on the major portion of the laundering process, some of them do parts of it, such as ironing, pressing and mending. They turn over wash to the companies for laundering on a contractual or job basis, and make their profits from the prices they in turn charge their customers for the complete laundry service. They are thus, at the same time, both customers and competitors of the laundry companies, but are not their employees. They are, as plaintiffs aver in their bill, “independent business men,” and have been so engaged for a period of years.</p>

Part 2 of the contract recites the existence in the trade of the independent operators or “bob-tails”; it is stated that they are in direct competition with the route salesmen employed by the laundry, that they often sell their services below the prices charged by the laundry to its own retail customers, that they have affected the earnings of the route salesmen, and that, in order to carry out the purposes of the agreement, it is necessary to “stabilize” the prices to be charged by the “bobtails” ; therefore the parties agree that the laundry com<a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>pany will not accept work from any “bob-tail” who is not a member of the union nor from “bob-tails” with whom it is not now under contract or for whom it is not now performing laundry service, that “bob-tails” shall not charge lower prices in selling their laundry service than those charged by the company to its own retail customers, that no person not now engaged as a “bob-tail” shall be accepted as such by the company or be eligible for membership in the union, and that a “bobtail” desiring to sell his “route” must first offer it for sale to the company with which he does business, and then, if the offer is not accepted, to any “bob-tail” who is a member of the union or to another laundry company, upon the same terms and conditions. The contract is to be in force for a period of three years and to continue thereafter from year to year unless either party gives thirty days’ notice, prior to the end of the year, of an intention to terminate or modify it.</p>
    <p id="b399-3" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[150,1340,1154,748]]]'>It is the provisions of part 2 of the contracts to which plaintiffs object, and against which they seek protection in the present proceedings. They do not complain of, and are not affected by, the provisions of part 1, which establish closed shops in the industry in Philadelphia and relate only to the laundry companies and their employees. The closed shop has, by legislation, become legalized in Pennsylvania, and the present case is in no way concerned with it. The issue here is as to part 2, which deals, not with labor relations between the laundry companies and their employees or between the “bobtails” and <em>their </em>employees, but with trade relations between the laundry companies and the “independent business men” or “bob-tails.”</p>

The clauses of part 2 of the contracts complained of by plaintiffs will, if carried into operation against them, so manifestly impair and, indeed, destroy their business enterprises that there can be no doubt as to their right to injunctive relief if those provisions are illegal, — a question which can be determined only by the consideration of each of them separately.</p>

To the same effect see <em>Philadelphia Cleaners &amp; Dyers Association, Inc. v. Dollar Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc., </em>19 D. &amp; C. 327; <em>Chapter No. 768 of Associated Master Barbers of America v. Andrea </em>Gambino, 27 Northampton Co. Rep. 6. A laundry company may charge a “bob-tail” with whom it does business whatever amount it desires, but, having sold its service at a price satisfactory to itself, it cannot control the price which he, in turn, shall charge his customers. If “bobtails” are able, in the light of the cost of the laundry work which they themselves do and the prices at which they can get the remainder done for them, to sell the complete service at lower prices than those charged by the laundry companies, an agreement is not legal which <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>compels them to raise their prices and thus accept more profit than they care to demand. After the companies have charged the “bob-tails” what they are willing to accept for their service “the public is entitled to whatever advantage may be derived from competition in the subsequent traffic”: <em>Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park &amp; Sons Co., </em><a href="/us/220/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="220 U.S. 373" data-case-ids="3656614" data-case-paths="/us/220/0373-01">220 U. S. 373</a>, 409.

    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[279,902,1156,855]]]'>(2) The provision that a laundry company may not accept work from any “bob-tail” with whom it is not now under contract or for whom it is not now performing laundry service is also clearly illegal, since it works an unreasonable and wholly unjustifiable restraint of trade. It is an obvious attempt to stifle competition by confining each “bob-tail,” as a customer, to one laundry company, thus placing him at the mercy of that company by obliging him to pay for its service whatever price it may choose to exact and not allowing him to obtain a competitive rate from other companies. The apportioning of customers to specified dealers is not permitted : <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc. v.

    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[277,1778,1154,535]]]'>(3) The provision that no person not now engaged as a “bob-tail” shall be accepted in that capacity by a laundry company is illegal because it effects a further drastic restraint of competition by restricting “bobtails” to their present number and preventing newcomers from engaging in the wholly legitimate business of collecting wash on their own account and having it laundered by a laundry company. Those engaged in an industry have no right, by agreement of all of them, to exclude others thereafter from participating in it.</p>
    <p id="b402-6" data-blocks='[["BL_402.6",402,[279,2326,1150,97]],["BL_403.1",403,[149,359,1155,1249]]]'>(4) If the provision that a “bob-tail” desiring to sell his “route” shall first offer it for sale to the laundry <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>company of which, he is a customer has no penalty to support it, a “bob-tail” may, of course, ignore it entirely, but if, as is apparently intended, his obtaining service from a laundry company is conditioned upon his submitting to it, it is a wholly arbitrary and illegal restriction upon his right to sell his property to whomsoever he desires. For two contracting parties to impose upon a non-assenting third person a requirement that he limit the sale of his business — for the sale of his “route” necessarily involves the sale of his entire business — to a designated purchaser is without precedent or justification. There must come a time, sooner or later, when the need or desire to sell the business of each and every “bob-tail” will arise because of the death or retirement of the proprietor or for some other reason. If no laundry company or existing “bob-tail” will buy, the business cannot be sold at all, because no other purchaser could become a “bob-tail.” If, on the other hand, a laundry company purchases, then, since it cannot do business with any other “bob-tail,” the business purchased is automatically extinguished, and the result is inevitable, if the agreements continue in effect, that the “bob-tail” industry will thus cease to exist.</p>

It is somewhat difficult to understand what such membership is intended to accomplish. In so far as it is designed to restrict the “bobtails” in the operation of the trucks which they themselves drive, and in their collection of laundry, to hours and working conditions prescribed by the union and embodied in its agreement with the laundry companies, the union has a legitimate interest in thus seeking to protect the laundry employees against the lowering of work<a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>ing standards on tlie part of those who themselves, although in a different legal capacity, perform to some extent the same kind of labor. So far, therefore, as a “bob-tail,” by becoming a member of the union, would be bound by its reasonable rules as to such matters, there would seem to be no valid objection to this provision. But such membership cannot be made the means of controlling the regulation by the “bob-tails” of their own business enterprises in the various aspects heretofore considered.</p>
    <p id="b404-4" data-blocks='[["BL_404.4",404,[281,914,1154,1516]],["BL_405.1",405,[156,362,1152,158]]]'>To summarize our conclusions, part 2 of the agreements between the union and the laundry companies, except for the provision as herein discussed in regard to “bob-tails” becoming members of the union, is invalid because it effects an illegitimate restraint of trade. If the “bob-tails” do not submit to its terms they cannot obtain service from the <em>laundries; </em>if, on the other hand, they do submit, they are forced hereafter to deal only with the particular company with which each now does business, compelled to raise their prices to their own customers, and obliged ultimately to sell their businesses in such manner that their part of the industry will be annihilated. Because of these oppressive provisions part 2 is violative of the common-law prohibition of monopolies and unreasonable restraints of trade. It must be borne in mind that we are here dealing with agreements governing the entire laundry industry in the City of Philadelphia, and that, while one person may do business with whomsoever he pleases upon terms mutually agreed upon, the law will not permit an arrangement, understanding, agreement, or combination among all those in the trade in a given locality, the effect of which is to deprive others of the right to engage in that industry and to deprive the public of the benefits of fair competition therein. No group may enhance its own interests at the expense of the legal rights of others, nor, by acts or agreements violating public policy, interfere with the interests of the public: <em>Nester v.

The majority opinion holds the contract in question to be “in restraint of trade”; I consider some restraint of trade as much a necessary incident of a “closed shop” as some restraint of individual liberty a necessary incident of living in an organized society. One cannot be for the “closed shop” <em>in practice </em>without accepting a certain amount of trade restraint.</p>

It is clearly illegal.” That statement ignores the fact that what the “bob-tail” is selling is his <em>own labor. </em>He is receiving for that labor the difference between what the laundry charges him and what he collects from his customer. He is <em>not selling a commodity but labor service. </em>He is doing <em>exactly the same hind of labor and to the same end as the unionised laundry solicitors, </em>and the legally recognized “closed shop” principle cannot be circumvented by calling what the “bob-tails” are doing a “resale of service to consumers.” The laundry performs the service of laundering. The “bob-tail” only “brings the grist” to the mill and his “toll” is his pay for his labor. If by taking less wages for their labor than the union laundry solicitors these “bob-tails” reduce the work of these solicitors, they are violating the “closed shop” principle and that is precisely the “unfair labor practice” (according to modern conceptions) that the Laundry Drivers’ Union proposed to stop. If it is not stopped, the “bob-tails” could by accepting less pay for their services in collecting laundry put the union laundry solicitors <em>completely out of business. </em>The contract now challenged is a contract which the union laundry solicitors deem necessary to their own preservation. The “bob-tails” can join the union on reasonable terms and thus be secured in this work and at a remunerative wage.

For example, the Anthracite Coal industry is a “closed union shop.” The agreement between the Anthracite operators and the United Mine Workers of America provides that “special and individual contracts in the mining of coal where now in use shall be eliminated.” The purpose of that provision was the same as in the provision in the contract before us that “the company will not accept laundry work or serve or do any laundry work for any ‘bob-tail’ who is not a member of the union.” The purpose in the Anthracite agreement was to prevent the undercutting of the wage scale of labor by individual contractors; the purpose in the provision just quoted in the contract before us is the prevention <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>of the underselling of their labor* by the “bob-tail” solicitors.</p>

These laundries could legally say to the “bob-tails”: “We accept laundry only from our own solicitors.” Laundries are not like hotels or railroads, which must serve all who seek service of them.

If A is a “bob-tail” employing a dozen assistants and he wants his laundry work accepted by the companies which are parties to this agreement, he must join the union. Calling a “bobtail” an “independent contractor” does not disguise the fact that he is a human being engaged in the work of soliciting laundry. Calling a man who shingles houses an “independent contractor” does not disguise the fact that he is a carpenter.

Calling these “bob-tails” “independent contractors” does not affect the fact of their labor work and the fact of their competition against union solicitors. Of their anti-union practice, it can correctly be said, as Justice Day said in his dissenting opinion (concurred in by Mr. Justice Hughes) in <em>Coppage v. </em>Kansas, <a href="/us/236/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="236 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="8285078" data-case-paths="/us/236/0001-01">236 U.

It is helpful to have as many as may Ibe in the same trade in the same community united, because in the competition between employers they are bound to be affected by the standard of wages of their trade in the neighborhood.” But even if the contract did work some economic disadvantage to the “bob-tails,” that would not entitle them to an injunction against it. That certain actions of men may bring some economic loss to other men, gives these other men no cause of action either in law or in equity. Picketing visits an economic loss on the owner of the place of business picketed; it is intended for that purpose, the theory being that the economic loss occasioned will “bring to terms” the owner whose place is picketed. Yet courts uphold the right to peaceful picketing. This court, in <em>Kirmse et al. v.

The dissenting opinion dwells at length upon the subject of the legality of closed shops, and evidently seeks to convey the wholly unjustified impression that the majority opinion holds that the “bob-tails” cannot be unionized. The dissenting opinion says: “The workers have no right (under the court’s decision) to enter into a contract with the laundries to make the ‘bob-tails’ stop lowering these working and wage standards,” etc. On the contrary, the decision of the court is that the contract of the union with the laundries is valid in its provision that the “bob-tails” shall, if permitted to do so, become members of the union, and the opinion distinctly states that “In so far as it is designed to restrict the ‘bob-tails’ in the operation of the trucks which they <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>themselves drive, and in their collection of laundry, <em>to hours and working conditions </em>prescribed by the union and embodied in its agreement with the laundry companies, the union has a legitimate interest in thus seeking to protect the laundry employees <em>against the lowering of working standards </em>on the part of those who themselves, although in a different legal capacity, perform to some extent the same kind of labor.” Moreover, the employees of the “bob-tails” are members of a union.

One such illustration is in regard to the right of picketing, and another in regard to the evil of women doing “piece-work on garments and hats in their own tenement houses in New York,” in other words, sweat-shops. Sweat-shops are non-union institutions, working under unsanitary conditions and for extremely low rates of compensation; the work is done for a manufacturing establishment which pays for it. It is perfectly clear that in the present case the “bob-tails” do not work for the steam laundries, and receive no compensation from them whatever; on the contrary, they are customers of the steam laundries and pay them for the work the laundries do for them, and their own customers are not customers of the laundries.

The dissenting opinion states that the resale price-fixing cases applied to commodities, whereas here we are dealing with the sale of labor. But what the “bob-tails” are in fact reselling is the service of the laundry companies, and once the latter have fixed their own price for such service to the “bob-tails” they are precluded, by every principle of decisional law, from combining to compel the “bob-tails” to charge a fixed minimum price by which this service is turned over, supplemented to some extent, to the customers of the “bobtails.” In this connection it was held in the <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers </em>case, cited in the majority opinion, that prices could no more be fixed for services rendered in the business of cleaning and dyeing than for commodities. The dissenting opinion confuses the doctrine of the <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers </em>case with the principle that, of course, it is perfectly legal for employees to combine in order to obtain an increase of wages and such combinations do not fall within the ban of a restraint of trade. It fails to distinguish between the sale of <em>labor </em>in the sense of a transaction by which the owner of a business enterprise sells to his customers services performed by the employees of his establishment, and the sale of wages, meaning the compensation paid by an employer to his employees for the services rendered by them to him; the former — for example, the sale of laundry service — is analogous to the sale of a commodity, while the latter — that is, the fixing of wages — is not.</p>

The dissenting opinion says that no laundry in Philadelphia “is <em>obliged </em>to accept any business from ‘bob-tails’ or from anybody else,” and therefore the provision in the contracts that a laundry company may not accept work from any “bob-tail” with whom it is not now dealing adds nothing to their present right to refuse to trade with “bob-tails.” It is so elementary a doctrine of the common law that, while any business concern may deal with whomever it pleases, a combination or agreement by many concerns, and especially by all of them in the community, is an illegal restraint of trade if aimed to drive another out of business by boycotting him, that no added comment would seem necessary.</p>

It is the failure of the dissenting opinion to recognize these averments that leads to the irrelevancies in that opinion to which I have already referred, namely, those concerning closed shops and the relations in general between employers and employees, as well as to its insistence that the question of restraint of trade is not involved.</p>

The dissenting opinion says that the fact that “ ‘restraint of trade’ is no longer looked upon in this Commonwealth as per se anti-social,” is illustrated by the passage of the Fair Trade Act of June 5, 1935, P.

It would seem from the tenor of the dissenting opinion that the doctrine of “restraint of trade” has become practically obsolete. Its effect would be to sweep aside one of the oldest and most fundamental doctrines of the law, the subject of treatment in scores of current cases throughout the nation <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>and in the Restatement of the Law of Torts by the American Law Institute.</p>

It seems to me scarcely necessary to say that an owner of property may agree to give an option to buy it to whomever he pleases, but I know of no precedent for holding that an owner may be obliged to give such an option involuntarily because other parties by agreement attempt to compel him to do so under penalty of a boycott that insures the destruction of his business. In fact, the dissenting opinion fails throughout to appreciate the difference between being put out of business by what it calls “the march of progress,” that is, by social changes, as distinguished from being put out by coercion, illegal combination and boycott.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">*</a>

Most of it seems to me to be an attempt at defense of principles which are in no way attacked. We are dealing here only with a peculiar situation in a particular industry. In a word, it may be said that, as represented in the bill of equity, the “bob-tails” are not, as the dissenting opinion would have it, employees similar to those of the laundry companies, but persons conducting, as employers, a legitimate business enterprise, and that the contracts here involved raise the legal question, not of a labor problem, but of a restraint of trade affecting the entire laundry industry in Philadelphia. Certainly, if an itinerant grocer, or butcher, driving his own wagon from house to house to supply his trade, were denied the right to purchase his commodities, by an agreement among all the wholesalers in Philadelphia and the labor unions of the wholesale trade not to sell to him, such combination would be enjoinable as in restraint of trade and would in no sense involve a question of closed shop, or the rights of organized labor.

In instances where they operate alone, what they make is not a wage, but a profit, just as in the case of any other individual storekeeper.

The two statements quoted in the concurring opinion from the dissenting opinion are from two entirely different portions of that opinion, and therefore are not directly related to each other as the concurring opinion would lead one to believe. However, both statements are statements <em>of facts </em>and are in no way, shape, form or manner in conflict with any averments in plaintiffs’ bill or defendants’ answer, as anyone who examines this record can quickly determine. Any bob-tail who collects laundry can send it to any laundry anywhere which will take it. Any bob-tail wishing to sell his “route” can place his own price on it and if the company with which he has been dealing does not accept his offer, he can then offer his route “to any other bob-tail who is a member of the union or to any other laundry doing wholesale work, upon the same terms and conditions” (quoted from paragraph 24, of the agreement challenged by plaintiffs). Plaintiffs’ charge is that they, the bob-tails, will, unless they join the union, “be unable to have their customers’ wearing apparel, linens and fabrics washed and laundered by any laundry company in Philadelphia.” The answer to the “monopoly” charge made in the concurring opinion is that the “bob-tails” do not charge that they cannot send their collected “wash” to laundries outside of Philadelphia and since Philadelphia comprises only 128 square miles of Pennsylvania’s 44,832 square miles, and since “trade” knows no municipal bounds in the United States, it is ridiculous to hold that the contract in question is iu restraint of trade. If a group of men had the exclusive license to sell cars in Philadelphia, such a license could not be looked upon as a restraint of the automobile trade.</p>

But the concurring opinion says: “On the contrary, the decision of the court is that the contract of the union with the laundries is valid in its provision that the bobtails shall, if permitted to do so, become members of the union.” Of what avail would it be to the unionized laundry solicitors to have the bob-tails <em>&lt;{join the union” </em>but to continue their <em>practice of soliciting laundry at a rate </em>which would mean putting the union solicitors out of business <em>unless they accepted a lower remuneration in order to meet the competition of the bob-tails f </em>The concurring opinion then adds: “The [majority] opinion distinctly states that ‘in so far as it is designed to restrict the “bob-tails” in the operation of the trucks which they themselves drive, and in their collection of laundry, <em>to hours and working conditions </em>prescribed by the union and embodied in its agreement with the laundry companies, the union has a legitimate interest in thus seeking to protect the laundry employees <em>against the lowering of working standards </em>on the part of those who themselves, although in a different legal capacity, perform to some extent the same kind of labor.’ ” It will be observed that the majority opinion uses the phrase “the union has a legitimate interest” in seeking to protect the laundry employees, etc., as just quoted. If by that phrase the majority opinion means that the union has <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>an interest which it and its members can protect by <em>contract, </em>then why does the majority opinion strike down as illegal <em>this </em>contract whose purpose is to protect that “legitimate interest” by making the bob-tails conform in working conditions, including remuneration, to the standards of the “Laundry &amp; Linen Supply Drivers’ Union’s” closed shop?</p>

Paragraph 28 of part 2 of the contract, and that is the part the majority opinion declares invalid, provides as follows: “The Union agrees on behalf of its bob-tail members, that their retail prices in selling laundry services shall not be lower than those charged by the Company to its own retail customers.” Part 2 also says in its preamble: “Said bob-tails are in direct competition with the retail route salesmen employed by the laundry performing such service, and for the protection of said retail route salesmen and to enable the Company to fulfill its obligations under this agreement, it is necessary to stabilize the conditions under which said bob-tails shall operate and prevent unfair advantages which they now have over the said retail route salesmen.” It is too clear to require argument that if part 2 of this agreement is struck down, there is nothing to stop the cut-throat competition of the bob-tails with the retail route salesmen of the laundries.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a>

The writer of the concurring opinion thinks he avoids the analogy by calling those who patronize the bob-tails “customers.” The answer to that is those who bought the products of the sweat shops were also “customers.” The analogy drawn in the dissenting opinion is that the “sweat shops” were not permitted to ignore decent standards of wages and working conditions and thus undersell others engaged in the same work, by hiding under the cloak of “independent contractors” and likewise the bob-tail collectors of laundry should not be permitted to undersell unionized collectors of laundry by hiding under the cloak of “independent contractors.” The “cloak” in each cáse is too transparent to hide the “cut-throat” competition which is behind it.

Since the bob-tails do exactly the same work as the laundry solicitors and their remuneration consists of the difference between what they get from their “customers” and <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>what they pay the laundry, it is obvious that this difference is their <em>pay for their work, </em>exactly as a newsboy’s one cent profit on each paper for selling his papers is his pay for <em>his work </em>as a newsboy. The concurring opinion says: “Once the” laundry companies “have fixed their own price for such service to the bob-tails they are precluded by every principle of decisional law, from combining to compel the bob-tails to charge a fixed minimum price by which this service is turned over, supplemented to some extent, to the customers of the bob-tails.” If that argument is sound newspaper publishers would be powerless to refuse to turn newspapers over to newsboys who went out on the streets selling for two cents papers whose fixed price was three cents. The phrase “supplemented to some extent,” in the concurring opinion, is indeed a mild and innocent looking recognition of the fact that this bob-tail “supplementing” of laundry service is his work as a <em>laundry collector </em>just as a newsboy’s “supplementing” of newspaper service is his work in selling papers. If a newsboy sold for two cents a newspaper which a unionized newsboy sold for the regular price of three cents, the first newsboy would be underselling the second newsboy and no fallacious verbiage about a newsboy “reselling” news service <em>could disguise that fact. </em>As Chief Justice Shaw said in <em>Com. v.

If this court is going to permit these bob-tail solicitors of laundry to strike down this contract as illegal, by according them the status of “independent contractors,” then all similar contracts in this state are illegal. To be consistent this court when the matter is brought before it, must declare illegal the contract entered into bétween the Anthracite Mine Operators and the Anthracité Mine Workers of America, for that contract declares that “special and individual contracts in the mining of coal where now in use shall be eliminated.” I hold, as do the courts of Massachusetts, <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>New York and numerous other states, <em>such contracts legal. </em>There is no difference in principle between the contract this court is now striking down and the just referred to contract between the Anthracite Coal Operators and the Anthracite Miners of Pennsylvania.</p>

The purpose of the act is set forth in its title as follows: “To protect trademark owners, distributors, and the public against injurious and uneconomic practices in the distribution of articles of standard quality under a distinguished trademark, brand or name.” This court said in <em>Bristol-Myers Co. v.

Likewise, when á bob-tail laundry solicitor signs the contract challenged here, which provides that he must first offer his route for sale to the laundry company, and if the offer is not accepted, hé must then offer it to another bob-tail who is a member of the union, and if it is not accepted, he can offer his route to any laundry anywhere, cannot complain that he is being illegally coerced and boycotted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a> In the first <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>place, he is not legally obliged to sign the contract.

In the instant case there is not even a charge of price fixing. This is a plain case of a contract for a “closed shop” and such contracts have been legalized by the state and federal governments and have been almost universally recognized judicially.

I said (p. 236) : “This anti-union contract is so at war with the public welfare as to disentitle it to legal recognition.” I said (p. 237) : “These essentially coercive anti-union contracts are socially wrong and legally indefensible.

This ease goes to the very vitals of the “closed shop” question, and it cannot be side-tracked as a case of an illegal “restraint of trade.” It restrains trade only as all closed shop contracts restrain <em>trade in labor </em>and such restraint is both legislatively and judicially regarded as being for the public good. The concurring opinion says: “Certainly, if an itinerant grocer, or butcher, driving his own wagon from house to house to supply his trade, were denied the right to purchase his commodities, by an agreement among all the wholesalers in Philadelphia and the labor unions of the wholesale trade not to sell to him, such combination would be . enjoinable as in restraint of trade and would in no sense involve a question <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>of closed shop, or the rights of organized labor. The case before us is just such a one in principle.” That statement might have been supportable under the philosophy-prevailing fifty or one hundred years ago but it is utterly ««supportable under the enlightened and humane philosophy. of the 1930s and 1940. The Restatement of Contracts, Vol. 2, p. 1000, says this: “A, a manufacturer, makes agreements with a number of agents for the sale of his goods, each of the agents being authorized to sellA’s goods in specified territory only. As part of the agreements the manufacturer promises that each of these agents shall have the exclusive privilege of selling A’s goods in the territory assigned to him. The agreements are legal unless they are part of a scheme whereby it is sought to establish a monopoly.” It is ridiculous to charge that the contract here establishes a monopoly. It is too limitéd both in space and in time. This court in <em>Monongahela Co. v. Jutte, </em><a href="/pa/210/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="210 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="937835" data-case-paths="/pa/210/0288-01">210 Pa. 288</a>, in which it was charged that a certain contract created a monopoly in coal in a certain area, said that the old common law rule as to contracts in restraint of trade was now “much relaxed and the first modification of the doctrine was. the recognition of the validity of contracts of this nature where the restraint was limited as to space or time and reasonable in its nature. . . . This is the general current of decision in this day.” In the instant case the contract now struck down as illegal and in restraint of trade is limited in its space to the 128 square miles of Philadelphia and is limited in time to “a period of one year subsequent to April 11, 1942, unless thirty days’ notice, in writing, be given by either party to the other party prior to that date of a desire to cancel, change or modify either part of this agreement, and so on for additional terms of one year unless either party shall give the other party notice of such intention thirty days prior to the end of any such subsequent year.” In <em>Harbison-Walker R.

Is it unusual or illegal for a business organization to enter into a contract to purchase all its supplies from a single source, or to confine its distribution in a given area to a particular agency upon whom exclusive rights are conferred? Could not the laundry companies confine the distribution of their service to a single organization? They have chosen to restrict distribution to those persons or organizations that solicit and sell laundry service to the consumers who are members of the defendant association. . . . The policy of our law, however, recognizes the legality of a closed shop and permits the employer and his employees to agree that no person not a member of the employee’s association shall be permitted to work in the industry. . . . Plaintiffs perform the same economic functions as the employees who are members of the association.” In the latter pages of the dissenting opinion are examples of contracts now in operation affecting meat dealers and other contracts affecting fur coat workers which contracts are analogous to the contract now struck down by the majority opinion after the court below upheld it.</p>

Sessions, Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia), the indictment charged Pullis and certain other boot and shoemakers of Philadelphia with a combination to raise their wages. The rationale of that case is today as obsolete as the rationale of the Dred Scott decision.

Tbe laws of tbis society are grievous to those not inclined to become members — they are injurious to tbe community, but they are not tbe laws of Pennsylvania. . . .

Paragraph 4 (p. 360) of the majority opinion reads as follows: “If the provision that a ‘bob-tail’ desiring to sell his.‘route’ shall first offer it for sale to the laundry company of which he is a customer has no penalty to <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>support it, a ‘bob-tail’ may, of course, ignore it entirely, but if, as is apparently intended, his obtaining service from a laundry company is conditioned upon his submitting to it, it is a wholly arbitrary and illegal restriction upon his right to sell his property to whomsoever he desires. ...” In making <em>that argument </em>the majority opinion ignored and did not quote the provision that the bob-tail can, if his offers to his laundry and his fellow bob-tails are not accepted, offer his route to any <em>laundry anywhere. </em>The writer of the majority opinion based his <em>argument </em>and <em>conclusion </em>that the restriction on the sale of the route was “arbitrary and illegal” on <em>the part of the provision he quoted </em>in that argument. He should <em>then and there </em>have quoted all of the provision so that a reader of the opinion might come to his own conclusion as to whether or not the argument was sound. The writer of the concurring opinion well knows that the writer of the dissenting opinion was not attempting to conceal the obvious fact that the majority opinion in the earlier parts of it which contain a summary of certain provisions of the contract, did give the <em>substance </em>of the provision about resale of routes.</p>
