A wall at one end of the basement was damaged by a flood and required reconstruction. It was from 25 to 30 feet long, about 12 feet high and was constructed of bricks with <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>white tiles over the bricks. The flood had caused the wall to bulge into the room. Constructed in front of and parallel with the wall and originally a short distance from it, was a coil or set of ten iron pipes 10 feet 2 inches long. They occupied a rectangular space 10 feet 2 inches by 3 feet 7 inches extending along the wall about 6 feet from the top. They were connected with other pipes and constituted the ammonia refrigeration machinery supplying cold water throughout the building; a tank containing liquid ammonia operated under pressure was installed on the floor below the pipes.</p>

DeGiovanni, called by the plaintiffs, testified that he<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> employed one, Impetra, to take down the wall; Impetra employed Valles and Del Re who, while so engaged, were injured.</p>

It is not now contended that the explosion was <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>caused by any defect in or lack of repair of the pipes and equipment; there was no evidence to support such a contention.

It was necessary for them to show some breach of duty owing by defendant to them, and the breach of duty relied on in argument, as we understand it, is appellant’s failure to give notice to the two workmen of the contents of the pipes and the dangers incident to breaking them. The pipes and equipment were not concealed; they were in open view. DeGiovanni, the contractor, called by the plaintiff, testified that he saw and considered them in making his bid for the work. Neither he nor any other witness testified that he was not informed of or did know what they contained; the plaintiffs had averred that he was not informed but they did not prove it, though proof of the fact was essential to recovery :<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Here, on the contrary, DeGiovanni was the independent contractor who had examined the <em>locus </em>for the purpose of informing himself of the work and the conditions under which it must be done. He knew, better than anyone else, whether he <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>appreciated the risks involved or had been advised of them. The appellant conld not have superior knowledge on that subject. Plaintiffs therefore failed in not putting in evidence to show that DeGiovanni was not informed of the contents of the pipes and of the dangers incident to breaking them. For that defect in plaintiffs’ case, defendant’s motions for judgment should be granted on the authority of cases to be referred to later. But it is unnecessary, on this record, to proceed solely on plaintiffs’ failure to show that DeGiovanni was not informed. Plaintiffs called a witness named Saterial, who was superintendent of appellant’s building. During his cross-examination, the following occurred: “Q. Mr. Saterial, before you let this contract to Mr. DeGiovanni, did you show him the place where the work was to be done? A. Yes, sir. Q. And were the pipes shown in this picture there evident? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you tell him what those pipes contained? A. Yes, sir. Mr. Evans: I object to that and ask that the answer be stricken from the record and the jury instructed to disregard it. It is immaterial. The Court: Objection sustained and the answer is stricken out and the jury will pay no attention to it. As I understand the averments here, it is alleged that this machinery and so forth was in a dangerous condition. Mr. Dickie: No, that the thing itself was dangerous and that there was no notice given of it. The Court: To the plaintiff.”</p>

The ruling is assigned for error. The evidence should have been allowed to remain. The cross-examination was not improper within the rule that the cross-examiner may not go outside the examination in chief and, under the guise of cross-examination, introduce his defense. The plaintiffs had alleged, as a proper part of their case, the failure to warn the contractor; it was an averment of breach of duty owing by appellant to the contractor and a fact to be established by the plaintiffs. The transaction which resulted in the contract between appellant and the contractor was conducted by the witness. The examination in chief showed and was designed to show, what that transaction was, and necessarily, the whole transaction, not merely part of it. The witness had stated in reply to questions in chief, that he was “in full charge of the building”; he had described the pipes and equipment and their operation; had detailed the working of the ammonia refrigerating system, and had stated that he, acting for the appellant, “arranged with Mr. DeGiovanni to take the old wall down and install a new wall”; he had described the conditions surrounding the place both before and after the accident. It was therefore competent in cross-examination to elicit from the witness any further elements in the transaction, resulting in the contract, which had not been brought out by the examination in chief. Plaintiffs had made the whole transaction a part of the inquiry. One element in the transaction was that elicited by the first <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>question, whether he had shown Mr. DeGiovanni the place where the work was to be done and the pipes; another element was whether he had told him what the pipes contained, and informed him of the danger incident to the work.

His responsibility to an independent contractor’s employes while performing the <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>contract on Ms premises is not the same as Ms responsibility to his own employes. The subject was recently considered in an opinion by Simpson, J., from which the following is pertinent: “An owner of a building owes no statutory duty to the employee of a contractor, in order to guard against injury to the employee, to instruct him as to the dangers of the employment, or to give him a reasonably safe place in which to work. While the owner in such a case is required to use reasonable care to guard the employees against injury, he will not be liable where causes of the injury intervened which he neither did nor could expect: <em>Rugart v.

Valles’s evidence of the injury (there is no other) is to the effect that Del Re stood on a scaffold loosening bricks with a bar wMch he, Valles, would catch and throw to the floor. While so engaged, a pipe 2 or 3 inches long, extending at right angles from one of the pipes along the wall, broke off and discharged ammonia gas, which, being inhaled, injured the men. Plaintiffs contend that the pipe was broken by a brick from the wall, a contention which, for present purposes, may be accepted. It was part of the duty of the men to avoid damaging the pipes, for, unless they damaged them, the contents could not in<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>jure them. Valles’s evidence that he had not been informed of the risk is, as against appellant, immaterial on this record; he was not employed by the bank but by the contractor, DeGiovanni, who was fully informed, and whose duty it was to instruct the workmen he sent or caused to be sent there to work. The decisions in this state require us to hold that if there was a breach of duty to the workmen it was DeGiovanni’s and not appellant’s. Without some wrongful act or omission by appellant, liability to the contractor’s workmen would not result. Defendant performed its duty when it gave notice to DeGiovanni; it would be unreasonable to require warning to every sub-contractor and laborer who entered the premises, on the theory that it was appellant’s duty to foresee that the contractor would not perform his duty and so permit the work to be done improperly.</p>

That case illustrates the application of the rule against their contention. The owner is relieved of responsibility to an independent contractor and his servants if, in the words of the rule, “the defects responsible for the injury were known to the contractor.” In Kulka’s case, there was no independent contractor performing a contract for the defendant; Kulka was engaged in removing a machine bought by his employers, but without warning of the inadequate setting of the machine which fell on him. The owner’s responsibility was direct to Kulka; it was not insulated by the intervention of a relationship like that of DeGiovanni in this case.</p>
