As the car started across the triangular intersection of Germantown Avenue with Broad Street and Erie Avenue, one of thé city’s busiest and most complicated, after having been delayed by a traffic signal, appellant, although yet several city blocks from his destination, stood up, unsupported, in front of his seat on the first cross seat on the left side of the car, next to a window which was open above a fifteen inch protective grating, because <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>he “was tired and wanted to stretch” or to “get some air.” As the car negotiated the crossing appellant’s arm was projected out of the window next to which he was thus standing, through the opening above the upper edge of the protective grating, as the result of a series of three successive and allegedly violent jolts or jerks of the trolley which threw appellant first forward and then backwards and sideways. The arm was immediately caught by a trolley car passing in the opposite direction resulting in a compound fracture and other injuries.</p>

The court said: “There is no hard and fast rule that requires a passenger in a moving trolley ear who arises from his seat to observe special precautions to maintain his balance during exceptional and unusual motions of the car. Ordinary prudence, however, dictates the exercise of greater care in this regard when the car is in motion than when it is standing, and perhaps still greater care when the car is moving over tracks known to be of such a character, due to crossings, curves and the like, that the irregularities in the movement of the car are likely to be more forceful than at other times. . . . Whether the plaintiff’s election to stand in the moving car rather than to remain seated in safety until his destination was reached was contributory negligence per se we need not determine, for a passenger who chooses to stand in a moving trolley car must at least exercise care sufficient to enable him to retain his balance dur<a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>ing usual and expected irregularities in the movement of the car, and the plaintiff’s own evidence shows that he made no effort whatever in this regard until he had lost his balance, and then it was too late. . . . The plaintiff, according to his own testimony, knowingly placed himself in such a position that a sudden jerk of the car might be expected to disturb his equilibrium. It was his duty to observe precautions against such a result which would be taken by a reasonably prudent man. There were hand straps available that he did not use. The backs of seats and the hand rails ordinarily found in street ears were [as a photograph introduced into evidence by appellant shows] at hand. . . . Plaintiff’s failure to exercise ordinary care for his own protection . . . contributed to the accident to such an extent that the jury, under the instructions of the court, should have rendered a verdict for the defendant.”-</p>

It is well established by a long line of decisions that testimony indicating that a moving trolley car jerked suddenly or violently is not sufficient, of itself, to establish negligence in its operation. There must be a showing of additional facts and circumstances from which it clearly appears that the movement of the <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>car was so unusual and extraordinary as to be beyond a passenger’s reasonable anticipation, and nothing short of evidence that the allegedly unusual movement had an extraordinarily disturbing effect upon other passengers, or evidence of an accident, the manner of the occurrence of which or the effect of which upon the injured person inherently establishes the unusual character of the jolt or jerk, will suffice.

Viewing appellant’s evidence as to how the accident happened in its most favorable light, it indicates nothing more than a mere loss of balance by a standing passenger in his attempt to regain which he suffered the injuries complained of. And, as was said in <em>Smith et ux. v. Pittsburgh Rys.

      <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>'Disinterested testimony on appellee’s side of the case presented an entirely different version of the accident from that of appellant. A woman passenger who was sitting about two feet away from appellant and facing him at the time of the accident testified that he was riding with his arm resting on the top of the window screen with a piece of paper in his hand and that his arm was caught by the passing trolley car as he reached out to throw the paper away. The doctor who treated appellant’s injuries testified that appellant told him, on the day following the accident, that “the accident was caused because his elbow was protruding over the window screen.” We have considered none of this evidence, or other evidence to like effect adduced by appellee, in reaching our conclusion that the action of the court below in entering judgment on the whole record for it was proper.</p>
