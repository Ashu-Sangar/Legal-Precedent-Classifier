The record shows that all of the appellants, as directors of the districts of the townships of Munster and Allegheny, joined with appellees, directors of the other three districts involved in the consolidation proceedings, in petitioning the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for permission to have the question of forming the proposed union district submitted to the electors of the five districts at the municipal election, held November 2, 1937, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of May 26,1933, P. L. 1067 (amending sections 127,128, 129 and 130 of the School Code of 1911 and adding section 131), in compliance with which, erroneously, as appellants now contend, the consolidation was carried through. It further appears that following the election, the returns of which showed that a majority of the voters in each district favored establishing the union district, appellants, together with the directors of the other districts, on May 28,1938, attended and participated in a meeting called for the purpose of agreeing on a tentative budget, salary schedule, tax levy, and length of school term for the new district, which matters were then voted upon. Thus, appellants not only recognized the legality of the formation of the union district, but regarded themselves as members of its board of directors until May 28, 1938. It is provided in section 131 of the code that “Whenever any two or more school <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>districts shall be so consolidated into a union school district, the directors then in office in each of said districts shall continue in office until the expiration of their respective terms, and shall jointly constitute the board of school directors of the union school district.” Having thus actively participated in the institution, formation, and organization of the union district, appellants are not now in a position to attack the legality of its existence.

They argue that since section 129 of the Code provides that “Whenever any union district shall be formed as herein provided, such district shall become a union school district on the first Monday in July after it has been formed,” and since the first Monday of July, in 1938, fell on July 4th, it follows that the consolidation was not “actually accomplished and completed” before July 1, 1938, as required by the saving clause of section 108, as amended.</p>

To construe the words “actually accomplished and completed such consolidation” as contended for by appellants would be to render the saving clause meaningless and impossible of performance. When the provision, in section 127 of the Code, that the question of formation of a union district shall be submitted to the electors of the districts involved “at the next general or municipal election” and the provision in section 129 that when any union district shall be formed, it shall “become a union school district on the first Monday in July after it has been formed,” are considered together, it becomes evident that, under appellants’ construction of the language of the saving clause, no district obtaining the requisite approval of the State Council between the dates of January 1, 1937 and July 1, 1937, could possibly bring itself within it. <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>The situation presented calls for application of the “settled rule of construction that the legislature will be presumed to have intended what is reasonable and effectual, and not what is productive of absurd or anomalous consequences or is impossible and incapable of execution”: <em>Foster’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/243/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="243 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1001647" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0092-01">243 Pa. 92</a>, 98; Statutory Construction Act, Act of May 28, 1937, P.

The section in question provides: “Whenever any two or more school districts shall be consolidated into a union school district as herein provided, all the debts and liabilities of the several districts shall become the debts of the union school district, unless otherwise provided by an agreement in writing approved by a majority vote of each board of school directors prior to the time said question of forming a union school district is submitted to the voters.
