Gregory Moneta, has been regularly dismissed as pastor of St. John the Baptist Uhro-Rusin Greek Catholic Church of Ambridge, Pennsylvania, by lawful action of the congregation thereof.</p>
    <p id="b522-6" data-blocks='[["BL_522.7",522,[293,844,1155,915]]]'>The questions before us under appellant’s assignments of error and statement of questions involved relate solely to whether there is competent evidence to support the chancellor’s findings of fact, arrived at after hearings during the course of which approximately 1700 pages of testimony were taken and affirmed by the court en bane, particularly the finding that St. John’s Church was organized and dedicated as, and is, a Greek Catholic church independent of all ecclesiastical authority other than the congregation itself and not, as appellant sought to establish, a Uniate Greek Catholic church. If there is any such evidence, the chancellor’s conclusion of law, upon which the decree primarily rests, that the right to appoint and discharge pastors rests exclusively with the congregation of St. John’s church, is not open to question: <em>Malanchuk et al. v.
