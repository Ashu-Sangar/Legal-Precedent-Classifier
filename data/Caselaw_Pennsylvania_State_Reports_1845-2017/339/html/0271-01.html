    <p id="b314-11" data-blocks='[["BL_314.13",314,[282,1445,1153,755]]]'>Plaintiff was employed by defendant to do repair work at its Water Street passenger station in Pittsburgh. On March 6, 1928, he was directed to assist other workmen in replacing a frame shanty at its original location in the terminal yard, from which it had been temporarily removed. The building contained flags, fusees, lanterns, torpedoes, and other signaling equipment used by defendant in the operation of its trains in both interstate and intrastate transportation. The structure was in continuous use during its removal and replacement, and from it trainmen obtained such signal devices as they required. At the time plaintiff was injured it was occupied by an employee of defendant engaged in filling, trimming and cleaning lanterns.</p>

When it had been brought to the proper location, the shanty was elevated upon four railroad jacks, one at each corner, so that wooden sills could be laid beneath it to form a support. Plaintiff was engaged in placing <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>the sills when a jack slipped, causing the building to fall and crush his hand.</p>

This motion was refused and the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff. Thereafter the court below entered judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto, and plaintiff has appealed. No question is raised as to defendant’s negligence, and the only issue between the parties is the applicability of the federal law.</p>

His immediate employment was not “in interstate transportation, or in work so closely related to it as to be practically a part of it” in accordance with the rule established by the Supreme Court of the United States. What he was doing did not impede or facilitate the movement of interstate trains. The facts clearly show that the relation of his work to interstate transportation was too remote to afford a basis for recovery under the Federal Act.</p>

Such attempt at judicial estoppel merits no extended discussion. It is based not only upon the false premise that plaintiff had acquired vested rights under the earlier cases although his claim had not yet been adjudicated, but also upon the mistaken assumption that the two Erie R.

It is argued that the purpose of this amendment was to bring all cases of injuries to railroad employees within the provisions of the Federal Act, whether or not such employees were engaged in interstate commerce, and further that the amending act is retrospective, although not expressly so declared. To adopt this construction would violate the fundamental principle “that a statute shall not be given retroactive effect unless such construction is required by explicit language or by necessary implication”: See <em>United States v.

In affirming an award to the claimant under the State law, the court said (p. 296): “Repairing the shanty is a step further removed from commerce movement than is the shanty itself and its use. . . .
