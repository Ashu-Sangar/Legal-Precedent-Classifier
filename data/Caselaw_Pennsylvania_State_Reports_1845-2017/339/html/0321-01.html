The petition averred the judgment and that the city had fixed an upset price of $128,244.01 required to pay all taxes and municipal claims but that such a bid was not received when the property was offered by the sheriff. A rule was granted requiring respondents, parties interested in a mortgage on the property, to show cause why it should not be sold “freed and clear of their respective claims, mortgages, charges and estates” pursuant to the Act of May 16, 1923, P. L. 207, and supplements (53 PS section 2051). An answer was filed by Erie Elks Building Association, Bondholders Protective Committee, and Harry W. Mehl, trustee for mortgage bondholders. Among other things, they denied that the Act of May 16, 1923, P. L. 207, authorized the divestiture of the lien of respondents’ mortgage dated May 3, 1922, and recorded prior to the Act of 1923. They agree that the Municipal Tax Lien Act of 1901, P. L. 364, as amended, was, as respects this proceeding, in substance the same as the Act of 1923, but contend that it had been repealed by the Act of 1921, P. L. 1089, befoi'e the mortgage was recorded. Their position, shortly stated, is that as the mortgage became a lien after the Act of 1901 was repealed and before the Act of 1923 was passed, the Act of 1923 could not, constitutionally, be applied to divest the lien of their mortgage. The <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>learned court below accepted that view and dismissed tbe petition.</p>

J., in <em>Haspel v. </em>O’Brien, <a href="/pa/218/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="218 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="999569" data-case-paths="/pa/218/0146-01">218 Pa. 146</a>, 149, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20A.%20123" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="67 A. 123">67 A. 123</a>, to be “a revision and consolidation for clearness, certainty and convenience of all prior statutes on the subject, a partial codification to the purpose of which amendment or change was only incidental.” One of the subjects included in the Act was “city taxes.” That act was amended May 28, 1915, P. L. 599. Those acts provided (section 32 of the Act of 1901 and section 9 of the Act of 1915) for the discharge of the lien of a mortgage if necessary to collect the taxes in full. They were followed by the Act of 1921, P. L. 1089, which reenacted provisions for the sale of land for certain tax claims free of mortgage liens and repealed inconsistent legislation. This act, the learned court thought, repealed the Act of 1901 as to all tax liens instead of those specified in the repealing clause; as a result it was held that there was no legislation, when the mortgage was recorded, providing that its lien could be divested by a sale on a judgment for city taxes. That conclusion must be rejected.</p>
    <p id="b365-7" data-blocks='[["BL_365.6",365,[146,1998,1155,430]],["BL_366.1",366,[275,357,1152,1400]]]'>In section 1 of the Act of 1901, said to be repealed, it was provided “That the word ‘taxes,’ as used in this act, means any county, city, borough, township, school, bridge, road, or poor taxes.” The Court is now concerned with the words “city taxes” in that provision. It was also provided that “The words ‘tax claim,’ as used in this act, mean the claim filed to recover taxes.” “Tax claim” would then include a claim for “city” taxes. <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>As long as the •word “city” was not taken ont of the law by some repealing statute, “city” taxes remained subject to the act. We then, examine the scope of the repealing provision of the Act of 1921 to see whether the “city” tax provision of the Act of 1901 was repealed. Section 32, P. L. 1102, reads: “The act [of 1901] . . . and the several amendments and supplements thereto, so far as the same relate or apply to tax liens and tax claims are hereby repealed. ...” The taxes and tax claims, so referred to, are defined in section 1 of the repealing Act of 1921 at page 1089 as follows: “The word ‘taxes,’ as used in this act, means any county, bridge, road, borough, township, school, or poor taxes. The words ‘tax claims’ or ‘liens,’ as used in this act, mean the claim filed to recover taxes.” It will be noted that the word “city,” which is in the Act of 1901 and in the amendment of 1915, is omitted. We must read the words “tax liens” and “tax claims” as used in the repealing section in the light of the definition of the words “taxes,” “tax claims” or “liens” as defined in section 1 of the act, and when that is done it becomes clear that they do not comprehend city taxes because city taxes were omitted from the definitions given by the legislature in the enactment. The result must be that city taxes and the method of collecting them remain subject to the Act of 1901 as amended in 1915.</p>

L. 207, referred to above, repealed inconsistent legislation, but in substance reenacted section 9 of the Act of 1915 and expressly included city taxes. As there was no repeal, by the Act of 1921, of the provisions relating to city taxes in the Acts of 1901 and 1915, the Act of 1923 was a mere continuation of what had been the law all along. The rule is stated in <em>Haspel v. O’Brien, </em><a href="/pa/218/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="218 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="999569" data-case-paths="/pa/218/0146-01">218 Pa. 146</a>, at page 149, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20A.%20123" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="67 A. 123">67 A. 123</a> (1907), by Mitchell, C.

    <p id="b367-3" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[158,844,1157,1574]],["BL_368.1",368,[268,354,1153,2059]],["BL_369.1",369,[160,341,1154,373]]]'>Second. We are equally clear that even if the Acts of 1901 and 1915 had not been in effect when the mortgage was recorded, the city would be entitled to the benefit of the Act of 1923 and that no impairment of the contract between the mortgagor and the mortgagee would result from the discharge of the lien of the mortgage if the mortgagee elects not to pay the taxes. The purpose of such legislation is to enable the government to collect its tax. For as long as ten years, taxes have remained unpaid on this mortgaged property. The double nature of a mortgage as an estate and as a security is familiar. By recording the mortgage, the mortgagee obtained a lien which had certain statutory preference. In providing for the collection of taxes, the Act of 1923, in section 31, P. L. 207, 221-222, 53 PS section 2051, provided what might be done in the future if, after an attempt to sell for taxes, the property could not be “sold for a sum sufficient to pay all taxes and municipal claims, together with the costs thereon.” After a tax claim had been filed a year, the city was authorized to present its petition stating that it had exposed the property to sheriff’s sale and had been unable to obtain a bid sufficient to pay the upset price in full. Thereafter, the court was authorized to grant a rule on all parties interested to show cause “why a decree should not be made that said property be sold, freed, and cleared of their respective claims, mortgages, charges, and estates” and provided that after hearing the court might order “that said property be sold at a subsequent sheriff’s sale day, <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>to be fixed by the court without further advertisement, clear of all claims, liens, mortgages, charges, and estates, to the highest bidder at such sale; and the proceeds realized therefrom shall be distributed in accordance with the priority of such claims; and the purchaser at such sale shall take, and forever thereafter have, an absolute title to the property sold, free, and discharged of all tax and municipal claims, liens, mortgages, charges, and estates of whatsoever kind, subject only to the right redemption as provided by law.” This procedure was followed in this case. That the mortgage was made and recorded before the act was passed, is no constitutional objection to the application of the Act of 1923. The statute applies to all mortgaged lands; the legislature had the power to tax the mortgagee’s interest in the land. The procedure enables the mortgagee to have his day in court and protect his lien by paying the tax if he does not wish to lose the lien; he has the alternative; the statute provides: “Any person interested may, at any time before the sale, pay the petitioner the whole of his claim, with interest and costs, whereupon the proceedings on petition shall at once determine.” There is no legal reason why the legislature should not require a mortgagee, who has had the protection of the government, to submit to the collection of the taxes out of the land against which they are assessed if his own debtor neglects to pay them. The procedure was prospective; that its application would operate on relations theretofore existing did not make the statute retroactive in any prohibited sense: compare <em>City of Johnstown v. Dibert, </em><a href="/pa-super/88/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="88 Pa. Super. 117" data-case-ids="667365" data-case-paths="/pa-super/88/0117-01">88 Pa. Superior Ct. 117</a>, 120. The land had always been subject to taxation. If a mortgagee elects not to foreclose for default in payment of taxes on the land he holds as security, he does not, by his election, exempt his interest or estate in the land from taxation; no law gives him such right of exemption. When he secured his loan by taking the mortgage, he did so with knowledge that the land was. <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>and would continue to be, taxed. He will not be heard to say that because he had a lien under the recording acts, the government must go without its taxes. All his relations growing out of his contract with his debtor were subject to the implied condition that the taxes must be paid out of the land. There is therefore no impairment of his contract with the mortgagor.</p>

If this view is accepted we have the anomalous situation that the Act of 1901 was repealed as to seven kinds of taxes but left in force as to city taxes. This interpretation is not only not required by the context but is in conflict with it. Section 32 of the Act of 1921 plainly says that the Act of June 4, 1901, is repealed. The words “the same” which follow the phrase “the several amendments and supplements thereto,” clearly refers to that phrase appearing before the pronoun “same.” Webster’s New International Dictionary defines the pronoun “same” as “the one just referred to — now chiefly archaic except in legal language.” The things “just referred to” were “the several amendments and supplements thereto.” Section 33 of Article III of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. D. 1019, says that in construing an act “General words shall be con<a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>strued to take tlieir meaning and be restricted by preceding particular words.” The general words, “the same,” therefore must be restricted by the preceding particular words “amendments and supplements.” Section 52 of the Construction Act says that, in ascertaining the intention of the legislature, courts must consider “that the legislature does not intend a result that is absurd ... or unreasonable.” To hold that section 82 of the Act of 1921 repealed the Act of 1901 as to county, bridge, road, borough, township, school and poor taxes is to reach a result that is “absurd and unreasonable.” No possible reason can be assigned for making-city taxes an exception in this repealing clause 32. No proper purpose could be served by making an exception to it and the legislature nowhere indicated any intention of making city taxes an exception to the repealing clause.</p>

On page 155 of Purdon’s Tables, there appears in the last column under 1901 P. L. 364, this notation: “Entire act including amendments or supplements repealed as to tax liens and tax claims 1921, May 24, P. L. 1089, sec. 32. Supplied 1923, May 16, P. L. 207.” Again, in 53 Purdon Statutes, sec. 2051, pp. 457, 461, 462, 465, and elsewhere in the notes, the Act of June 4, 1901, is referred to as having been “repealed” by section 32 of the Act of 1921 and “supplied” by the Act of 1923. Nowhere in Purdon’s Statutes is any part of the Act of 1901 treated as being in force after the passage of the Act of 1921. That the careful editors of Purdon’s Statutes, who are adept and experienced in determining whether or not statutes have been repealed, interpret section 32 of the Act of 1921 as <em>repealing the Act of 1901 in its entirety </em>harmonizes with my conviction that <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>section 32 of the Act of 1921 does in fact repeal in toto the Act of 1901. Nowhere in Purdon’s Statutes or in Pennsylvania decisions is there any indication that any part of the Act of 1901 was operative after the repealing clause in section 32 of the Act of 1921 was passed. On the contrary, the very language of section 2 of the Act of 1923 shows that the legislature recognized the fact that the Act of 1901 had been repealed in toto by the Act of 1921. This section provides: “All taxes which may hereafter be lawfully imposed or assessed on any property in this Commonwealth, and all taxes heretofore lawfully imposed or assessed by any municipality on any property in this Commonwealth for the years one thousand nine hundred and twenty-one, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-two, and one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three, in the manner and to the extent hereinafter set forth, shall be and they are hereby declared to be a first lien on said property, together with all charges, expenses, and fees added thereto for failure to pay promptly; and such liens shall have priority to and be fully paid and satisfied out of the proceeds of any judicial sale of said property, before any other obligation, judgment, claim, lien, or estate with which the said property may become charged or for which it may become liable, save and except only the costs of the sale and of the writ upon which it is made.” If the Act of 1901 had not been entirely repealed by the Act of 1921, why was it necessary in the Act of 1923 to specifically declare that taxes imposed “by any municipality” on any property in this Commonwealth for the years <em>1921,1922, </em>and <em>1923 </em>shall be a first lien on said property. If the Act of 1901 was operative during those years in respect to municipal taxes, as the majority opinion declares it was, there was no purpose served by the just quoted provision in the Act of 1923. And why were only taxes imposed “by any municipality” thus referred to, while <em>no other </em>taxes were mentioned in that paragraph, if the legislature was not thus <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>recognizing the fact that the Act of 1921 had <em>entirely </em>repealed the Act of 1901, and that the word “municipality” (or “city”) had been inadvertently omitted from the second clause of paragraph one of the Act of 1921?</p>

L. 207, 53 PS sec. 2051. Since section 9 of the Act of May 28, 1915, P. L. 595, refers to “the lien of a tax,” and since after the repeal in 1921 of the Act of 1901 there was no lien for city taxes until the Act of 1923 was passed, it follows that the quoted section 9 of the Act of 1915 is of no materiality whatever in determining the question before us.</p>

The city in 1922 had <em>no sueh hold </em>on this seated land. Nothing can be more certain than the fact that as against the mortgage, the city’s claim for taxes in 1922 had to take a secondary place.

A mortgage gives its owner an estate in the premises mortgaged. Chancellor Kent defines a mortgage as “the conveyance of an estate by way of pledge for the security of debt, and to become void on payment of it.” When the mortgagee acquired its estate in this land, there was no act which made taxes on seated land in cities a first lien. Such taxes were payable out of personalty. There was then no provision in the law under which the lien of the mortgage could be divested on a sale for unpaid city taxes. The court below held, and, I think, properly that “the mortgagee obtained certain vested rights, and at a time when there was no Act of Assembly which might interfere with the same.”</p>

The first answer to that is the Act of 1923 does <em>not purport </em>to do any such thing.

The Statutory Construction Act of 1937 provides in section 56: “No law shall be construed to be retroactive unless clearly and manifestly so intended by the legislature.” That merely expresses what has always been the rule. Endlich on “The Interpretation of Statutes,” sec. 271, says statutes “are construed as operating only on cases or facts which come into existence after the statutes were passed, unless a retrospective effect be clearly intended.” Endlich cites as an example of this rule the following: “A provision that married women shall be bound like other persons, by estoppel in pais, was held inapplicable to the case of a mortgage made by such person before the enactment.” Another example is “an act which makes certain provisions ‘when any judgment is obtained’ is construed as referring to such cases only ‘when any judgment is <em>hereafter </em>obtained.’ ” In section 273 Endlich says: “It is chiefly where the enactment would prejudicially affect vested rights, or the legal character of past transactions, that the rule in question prevails. Every statute, it has been said, which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, or imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect of transactions or considerations already past, must be presumed out of respect to the Legislature to be intended not to have a retrospective operation. ...”</p>

Unless expressly made so by statute, a tax is not a lien on property”: 61 Corpus Juris, sec. 1155, p. 912.

No one contends that “charges upon or estates in land created by the owner thereof can avail as against the taxing power of the Commonwealth.” But the important point is the taxing power of the Commonwealth must act vigilantly and <em>in time </em>to make taxes a first lien. <em>They do not become first liens automatically. </em>No proposition of law is better settled than <em>that.</em>

Federal Land Bank of Baltimore, </em>108 Fed. 2d 275. In that case the law of Puerto Rico provided that “the tax that is assessed for the current fiscal year and for the three prior fiscal years against any parcel of real property . . . shall constitute the first lien thereon.” Due to economic conditions an act was passed which upon a taxpayer’s application extended the time of payment “over a period of 20 years.” In 1937 suits were instituted to foreclose certain mortgages on property in <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>Puerto Rico. Then attachments were levied on the mortgaged property to cover installments due on “extended” taxes. The District Court, upon application, cancelled these attachments and held that “the only lien for taxes which has priority to complainant’s mortgage is for taxes for the current year and the three preceding fiscal years.” On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals, First Circuit, reversed the decree of the District Court. The Circuit Court pointed out that “the records do not indicate what years are covered by the attachments for extended taxes involved in this appeal. If they were for the fiscal year 1934-1935, and perhaps also for the fiscal year 1933-1934, then at the time the taxes were extended the old prior liens given by Section 315 of the Political Code were still valid and subsisting. . . . As a matter of indulgence, the tax collector refrained from enforcing the liens. As a matter of grace, the legislature prescribed that the People of Puerto Rico would not insist upon a preference over the outstanding mortgagee’s interest for more than three years after the taxes became due. But the mortgagee, whose interest was at all times subordinate to the taxing power, had no vested right to a continuation of this indulgence and of this legislative grace.” Since the mortgagee took the mortgage knowing that under the law then existing his mortgage would be subordinate to the lien of taxes, there was no substantial impairment of his estate in the land by the passage of the law which gave the taxpayer an <em>extension of time </em>for the payment of those taxes. The mortgagee could proceed at any time after default in payment due him to foreclose on the mortgage. The decision in that case is not a precedent against what the court below decided in this case. There are dicta in that Puerto Rico Case about the power to revive lapsed liens even to the prejudice of a mortgagee, which dicta I think are unsound in reasoning and contrary to the weight of authority. It is flatly contradictory to the above quoted dictum of this court in <em>Scranton Lacha</em>

It was held that it did not so discharge the claim. The Superior Court in its opinion said: “The Act of [May 28,1915, P.

This related only to the remedy for the collection of taxes and <em>municipal claims, which claims, under the pre-existing law, already had the right to priority of payment over the mortgage </em>[italics supplied].” The “preexisting law” referred to was the Act of 1901, supra, which, as we have already pointed out, was repealed by section 32 of the Act of May 24, 1921, P.
