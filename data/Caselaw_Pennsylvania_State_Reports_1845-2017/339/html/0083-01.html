He was found one evening lying in front of the boilers so horribly burned that he died immediately thereafter.</p>

At the trial of the suit brought on these policies defendant contended that plaintiff was not entitled to recover because he had no insurable interest in Cybuck’s life. The learned trial judge charged the jury that the controlling question was as to who paid the premiums after the making of the assignments; if they were paid by plaintiff the policies would then represent wagering contracts and plaintiff would be barred from recovery, but if the insured continued to pay the premiums the verdict should be for plaintiff even though admittedly he had no insurable interest in Cybuck’s life. The jury found for defendant (as another jury had done on a previous trial of the case), but the court granted <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>plaintiff a new trial solely on the ground that “the question of whether the assignments were made in good faith and not as a mere cloak or cover for the procuring of insurance by the plaintiff who was without an insurable interest should have been submitted to and passed upon by the jury.” Defendant appeals from the granting of the new trial, plaintiff from the refusal of the court to enter judgment in his favor n. o. v.</p>
    <p id="b127-3" data-blocks='[["BL_127.4",127,[131,797,1156,427]]]'>The court was in error in granting a new trial. The charge of the trial judge correctly defined the issue, and the verdict should have been upheld. There was ample evidence to warrant the conclusion, which the jury must have reached, that plaintiff, at least after becoming the assignee of the policies, paid the premiums, and if this was so the law would not permit plaintiff to recover, irrespective of any question of good faith.</p>

The first is that a person may take out a policy of insurance on his own life and name as beneficiary whomsoever he pleases, regardless of whether or not such beneficiary has an insurable interest, or, having taken out a policy, he may assign it to one without an insurable interest, provided, in either event, the insured continues at all times to pay the premiums; under such circumstances no question arises of a wagering contract obnoxious to public policy: <em>Scott v.

If such assignment is merely a subterfuge, planned or contemplated when the policy was issued, to enable the assignee thereby to accomplish what he could not have done directly, namely, to obtain insurance on a life wherein he had no insurable interest, it would not be sustainable. But where the assignment is not in execution of such a preexisting purpose to circumvent the law, but arises from subsequent happenings, may the assignee recover on the policy? There has been a wealth of discussion pro and con on this subject in judicial opinions and in textbooks, and there is a sharp division of authority. In the great majority of jurisdictions it is held that such an assignment is valid, even though the assignee pays the premiums: see 2 Joyce on the Law of Insurance, 2d ed., 2009, section 919; 1 Cooley’s Briefs on Insurance, 2d ed., 349 et seq.; 6 Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, 5197, et seq., section 1458(e). The best arguments in support of this view are to be found in <em>Grigsby v. Russell, </em><a href="/us/222/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="222 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="3660504" data-case-paths="/us/222/0149-01">222 U. S. 149</a> (followed in <em>Midland Rational Bank v. Dakota Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/us/277/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="277 U.S. 346" data-case-ids="3902851" data-case-paths="/us/277/0346-01">277 U. S. 346</a>, 350). But there are a number of states, among which Pennsylvania has consistently maintained its place, where it is held that the assignment of a policy, whether in “good faith” or not, to one who has no insurable interest and who thereafter pays the premiums is as contrary to public policy, and therefore as legally objectionable, as the original issuance of the policy to such a person would have been. This viewpoint has been maintained in Pennsylvania through a course of so many years and by such a number of repeated affirmations that, if it were now sought <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>to change it in order to bring it into harmony with the prevailing doctrine, the appeal for that purpose would have to be directed to the legislature and not the courts.

In the former of these, an insured, being unable to continue to pay the premiums, assigned the policies to his nephew, who paid the premiums thereafter; it was held that the nephew was entitled to the proceeds of the policies. It may be said of that decision that the Act of 1921 recognizes as an insurable interest one which, in the case of persons related by blood or law, is engendered by love and affection, and, as was said by the lower court in the case, “There was no pecuniary consideration for the change of beneficiary, nor did decedent gain <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>anything by it. What motive conld he have had other than natural love and affection?
