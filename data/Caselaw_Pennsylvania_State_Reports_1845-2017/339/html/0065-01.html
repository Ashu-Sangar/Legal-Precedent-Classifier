L. 639, its supplements and amendments. But, in this most recent of numerous attacks upon the validity of the Act as applied to chiropractors, all of which have thus far been unsuccessful, they contend that “the methods of enforcing this valid Act of Assembly, and the rules and regulations laid down by the administrative body charged with its enforcement, amount to a denial to persons subject to its jurisdiction, of the equal protection of the laws, as guaranteed by the XIVth. Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and by the Bill of Eights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” in that the State Board of Medical Education and Licensure, without express statutory authority, has set up a system of healing arts termed “drugless therapy” under which to license certain practitioners of medicine and surgery, including chiropractors, and has refused to set up rules and regulations to license chiropractors as such, in that the regulations of the board in regard to professional qualifications of candidates are impossible of performance by appellants, because none of the schools whose graduates are recognized by the board as eligible for examination for license would accept appellants upon the basis of the minimum educational standards adopted by the Board, and in that the Board <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>has refused to approve any schools of chiropractic at which students may receive acceptable instruction in chiropractic.</p>
