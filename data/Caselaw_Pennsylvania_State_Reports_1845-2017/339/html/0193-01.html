    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[160,523,1154,967]]]'>The children of George W. Elkins base their claim to two-thirds of the income upon the theory that the conditions of the gift to them of Ida’s share, as provided in the Fourth Codicil, have been satisfied. They assert that their interest in this part of the estate was contingent upon their being alive at the death of Ida, and upon her dying without leaving descendants to survive her. It is argued on their behalf that while Ida did not live to enjoy her life estate, such fact cannot destroy the alternative gift to them since they took by purchase, as direct objects of the testator’s bounty, and not by inheritance from Ida. In other words, their interest was not dependent upon the taking effect of Ida’s prior estate, and its failure did not cause their gift to lapse. They say that in the Fourth Codicil, when the testator said “the share of said daughter,” he meant the prospective share of the daughter, using the word “share” as a unit of measure or distribution.</p>
    <p id="b241-6" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[157,1509,1158,593]]]'>The position of the children of Eleanor Elkins Bice is that the provision of the Fourth Codicil in favor of George W. Elkins’ children altered the terms of the ninth paragraph of the will only as to the share of a daughter who survived the widow, and thereafter died without issue; that the division into shares under the ninth paragraph was to take place upon the death of the widow, and as the daughter Ida did not survive her, the contingency provided for did not occur, and Ida had no “share” which could be made the subject of an alternative gift.</p>

He said <em>“at the time of the decease of </em>
      <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>

We are always reluctant to supply words of material import to a will, and particularly to a will so carefully and skilfully drawn as this one. If testator had intended to add such a contingency to the gift, he would have used apt words to express his purpose.</p>
    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[276,747,1155,426]]]'>However, appellees have advanced several considerations which, they say, require that this condition be read into the clause of gift. First, that the will as a whole is “patriarchal,” and as its predominant characteristic is stirpital equality, it follows that the most narrow construction possible must be given to the codicil in order that the symmetry of the original testamentary scheme be preserved.</p>
    <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[275,1185,1154,534]]]'>It is true that “a codicil shall not be construed to disturb or change the dispositions of a will further than is necessary to give effect to the provisions of the codicil” : <em>Chauncey’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/335/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="335 Pa. 73" data-case-ids="1193036" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0073-01">335 Pa. 73</a>, 76.

In the Second Codicil he further disturbed the original equality by completely eliminating the children and descendants of his son William from participation in the residuary estate. And in the Fourth Codicil, he emphatically de<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>dared his intention that only the line of his son George should benefit by the failure of issue of either of his daughters. He there said: “It is my intention that no children of mine other than my said son George and that no descendants of any child of mine other than a descendant of my said son George shall take under any of the foregoing provisions. ...”</p>
    <p id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[139,740,1156,581]]]'>In view thereof it is futile to insist that the testator had no intention to depart materially from the original scheme of stirpital equality. And to contend that he did not mean to prefer the descendants of George above those of his other children is to deny the plain meaning of his own forceful words. While he desired that Ida and her possible descendants should have an equal share in the residuary estate, yet if this gift could not take effect, his alternative purpose was that the children and descendants of George, <em>and no others, </em>should enjoy that share.</p>
    <p id="b243-6" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[138,1343,1156,481]]]'>We can see no reason to ingraft upon the language of the Fourth Codicil a provision that the gift to the children and descendants of George was to be contingent upon the purely fortuitous event of Ida’s surviving the widow. It is impossible to see in what way the time of her death could affect the manifest purpose of the testator to benefit the issue of George upon the extinction of her line. Such a condition would obviously be at variance with his expressed intention.</p>
    <p id="b243-7" data-blocks='[["BL_243.6",243,[137,1835,1157,317]]]'>Appellees place great stress upon the phrase “the <em>share </em>of said daughter” used by the testator in this Fourth Codicil.

There, after referring to the death of his son William, he said: “This direction covers the share of the residue as the same shall be swollen by the falling in of my son <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>
      <em>William’s share.” </em>The testator used the words “William’s share” although William had predeceased him, and would not be alive at the death of the widow. It is clear that he meant, “such a share as William would have become entitled to had he survived.” In the same codicil he spoke also of <em>“George’s share ” </em>although no share had been given to him, <em>nominatim. </em>His meaning could only have been, “the share which George will enjoy if he survives.” These two instances show that the testator conceived of a child’s “share” as having existence prior to the death of the widow, — not as a definite, distributive part of the estate, nor as a vested, transmissible interest therein, but as that quantitative portion which he had mentally allotted to each of his four children and their descendants, — Ida’s share, George’s share, William’s share, and Eleanor’s share.</p>
    <p id="b244-5" data-blocks='[["BL_244.4",244,[290,1235,1153,363]]]'>Therefore, the construction of the Fourth Codicil for which appellees so earnestly contend, cannot be sustained, and it is apparent that the direction in the ninth paragraph of the will to divide the estate into “parts or shares” at the decease of the widow was for the purpose only of ascertaining the life tenants, and of fixing the commencement of their estates at that time.</p>
    <p id="b244-6" data-blocks='[["BL_244.5",244,[289,1618,1152,480]]]'>It seems to us that Ida’s “share” was, after the exclusion of William and his descendants from participation in the residuary estate, the one-third portion which would have been held in trust for the payment of income to her for life, and for ultimate distribution to her descendants as remaindermen, had she survived or left issue.

All of her children also died before the survivor of the life tenants. The personal representatives of her deceased children subsequently sought to obtain the share which Charlotte would have enjoyed had she survived. The lower court held that there was no determinable “share” which the personal representatives could take, because Charlotte’s “share” never came into being. The appellate court reversed the court below, and held that the intention of the testatrix was to benefit directly the children of Charlotte, and that this could be effectuated only by construing the words “the share of my said sister Charlotte” to refer to “the aliquot share of the estate destined by the testatrix for Charlotte and her children.”</p>
