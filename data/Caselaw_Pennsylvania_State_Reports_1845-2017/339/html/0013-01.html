C. F. Kenowski, Esq.; that she took out letters of administration on the estate of her deceased husband; that, in case she does not succeed in her suit, plaintiff is informed and believes that suit will be brought by her as administratrix, or by Kenowski as her assignee, or by both; that it disclaims liability for the double indemnity provided for in the policies if the death of the insured should occur as the sole result of accidental means. The bill prays that the proceedings in the action at law brought by Rosella Moore be stayed, that a decree be entered that there is no liability on the part of the company under the double indemnity clause of the policies, and that an interpleader be framed fco determine who is entitled to the proceeds of the policies and the extent to which the company is liable thereunder.</p>

Whatever defenses it has, whether arising from the alleged murder, the guilty plea of manslaughter, or the circumstances relied upon to relieve it from liability for double indemnity, can be set up in the action at law brought by defendant. As far as its apprehension of other suits is concerned, plaintiff can petition for an interpleader in the law proceedings. While such an interpleader would not have been granted prior to the adoption of Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 2306 (c) (1) because of plaintiff’s denial of liability for at least part of the amount claimed — a limitation which applies also to bills of interpleader in equity <em>(Appeal of the Bridesburg Manufacturing </em>Co., <a href="/pa/106/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="106 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="455742" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0275-01">106 Pa. 275</a>)— <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>that rule has changed the practice, and, although its effective date was subsequent to the institution of defendant’s suit, it is applicable to all further proceedings therein: <em>West Arch Building &amp; Loan Association v.

Moore, deceased, and A. C. E. KenowsM, Esq. Such additions would not avail to support the jurisdiction in equity since, for the reasons stated, there is an adequate remedy at law by petition for interpleader in the pending suit. Accordingly, that petition is dismissed.</p>
