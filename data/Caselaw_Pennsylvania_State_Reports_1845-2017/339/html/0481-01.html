The learned court below ordered an account and at the audit found defendant indebted to plaintiff in an amount ordered to be paid. The decision depends on the meaning of the contracts made by the parties.</p>
    <p id="b524-7" data-blocks='[["BL_524.9",524,[281,1100,1156,913]]]'>Plaintiff invented a profiling machine but had not the means to develop it. February 15, 1927, he made a contract with Edson S. Harris and Chester W. Earner granting to them “an option on an exclusive license to manufacture and sell said invention . . . said option to run for a period sufficient to enable” them (briefly) to satisfy themselves of its value. They exercised the option. They agreed to pay plaintiff a “royalty of ten (10) per cent of the selling price” on all machines sold by the licensee. The 13th paragraph provided “The Licensees agree to reimburse the Licensor (plaintiff) out of the net profits from their sales of said machines and as soon as said profits aggregate a sum sufficient for the purpose, for the expenditures made by the Licensor to date in the development of said machines, provided, however, that the total sum so paid shall in no event exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00).”</p>

This agreement provided that “The aforesaid <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>agreement of February 15, 1927 is hereby cancelled and terminated as of this date.” An application for a patent had been made and plaintiff assigned his rights in it to defendant. This agreement provided a different method of compensating plaintiff from that specified in the first contract. Instead of a fixed percentage of the selling price of machines sold, they agreed to pay plaintiff from 30% to 48% of defendant’s “net earnings . . . available for payment to its common stockholders.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b525-3" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[126,856,1155,416]]]'>While this agreement was in force, the defendant, on December 16, 1931, made an agreement with The Cincinnati Milling Machine Co., by which, for $20,000, defendant assigned to the Cincinnati company all its rights etc. in the invention etc. The Cincinnati company agreed, in addition to the $20,000 payment, to pay specified rates of royalty; other terms need not now be stated.</p>

Plaintiff then assigned to defendant two patents both dated March 27, 1934, and repeated his former covenants to assign all patents for improvements or modifications on the machine. The <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>royalty was also changed by eliminating the sliding scale for determining the rate of royalty: “Out of all net earnings of Company derived from said profiling and contouring machines available for payment to its common stockholders, Company shall pay to Patentee thirty per cent (30%) thereof. No dividends shall be paid on the common stock of Company unless and until Patentee’s share of the net profits available for dividends shall have been paid to him as aforesaid.” Defendant agreed to render quarterly statements, and quarterly to pay royalty. They recited the agreement of October 28, 1930, and agreed that it should be cancelled and terminated.</p>

In the report nothing was charged against that <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>sum for development expenses. When plaintiff received the report he telephoned defendant and asked when he would receive his 30% of it; he was informed that “he would have to wait until the Company made a profit.” Shortly after, on November 12, 1935, defendant sent to him another report headed “Total Expenses a/c Anderson Profiler up to and Including Dec. 31, 1934” showing a deficit as of December 31, 1934, of $26,769.54.”</p>
    <p id="b527-3" data-blocks='[["BL_527.4",527,[139,784,1156,528]]]'>It was a case for an account: <em>Curtis v. ¡Serrill, </em><a href="/pa/303/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="303 Pa. 267" data-case-ids="1130065" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0267-01">303 Pa. 267</a>, 271, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20487" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="154 A. 487">154 A. 487</a>. The account covered transactions from 1927 into 1938. The contract of May 13, 1935, provided, as was stated above, that plaintiff should receive 30% of the net earnings derived by the defendant from his inventions “available for payment to its common stockholders.” It is the meaning of that provision (also contained in the contract of 1930) as related to the transactions of these parties, that must be determined.</p>
    <p id="b527-4" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[141,1333,1157,866]]]'>The argument of appellant is that it “had no net earnings available for the payment of dividends to its common stockholders.” Referring to the contract of 1930, the brief states that neither party by that contract could have intended to “impose upon the appellant the obligation of absorbing without recovery or reimbursement all of its expenditures prior thereto. In fact, they clearly had the exactly opposite intention as is evidenced by the provisions of their agreement of October 28, 1930; for the earlier contract of February 15, 1927, gave Anderson a royalty of a certain proportion of the sales price of the machines whereas the contract of October 28, 1930, gave Anderson a proportion of the ‘net earnings available for dividends,’ which, as will be seen, could not exist until after the development and other expenses had first been reimbursed to the appellant.”</p>
    <p id="b527-5" data-blocks='[["BL_527.6",527,[142,2212,1154,212]],["BL_528.1",528,[281,343,1156,1087]]]'>We must construe the contracts as the parties made them. It is certain that in 1927 they did not provide for reimbursement of development expenses. The provision was just the other way. If they had intended, <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>by the contract of 1930, to provide that plaintiff should receive no royalty until after defendant had been reimbursed for development expenses made from 1927 to 1930, a sum in excess of $35,000, we think they would have said so by direct expression and not relied on implication.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The defendant had paid these expenses without any agreement for reimbursement before plaintiff’s royalty became payable; there is no possible ground to imply a provision for recoupment. Plaintiff had been entitled to a percentage of the sale price and, in changing their relations in 1930, he agreed to receive less than was promised in the 1927 agreement; defendant, who by that time may, from its conduct, be presumed to have known that the machine had commercial value, received more by the new agreement. We do not think that the words “net earnings . . . available for payment” of dividends meant that an obligation to reimburse defendant should be created or, in other words, that defendant should have the right to recoup such expenditures before plaintiff should receive his royalty.</p>
    <p id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[279,1441,1152,470]],["BL_529.1",529,[152,351,1156,861]]]'>Defendant called an accountant who testified that defendant’s books had been properly kept and that “since the incorporation of the appellant company in 1927 [it did not] . . . have a surplus consisting of net profits derived from the Anderson Profiling machine available for the payment of dividends to its stockholders, but that on the contrary, instead of net profits the appellant had sustained a deficit which on April 22, 1938, amounted to Seventeen Thousand Nine Hundred Sev<a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>enty-Seven Dollars and Fifty-Seven Cents ($17,977.57).” The witness also said that until the deficit “has been eliminated by receipts of royalties from the Cincinnati Company, there will be no ‘net profits available for the payment of dividends’ in the appellant’s hands out of which any payments can be made to the appellee under the contract.” But that testimony does not aid the court in determining the legal meaning of the contract. Of course, the development expenses were a charge against cash, but, after those expenditures were made, the defendant had the patents and a valuable experimental model to its credit which would tend to balance the account. By the sale to the Cincinnati company, it transformed these assets into another form which it considered a proper equivalent and from which it is receiving the benefit.</p>
