L. 3, amending sections of the Fiscal Code of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343. The second is the Act of April 8, 1937, P. L. 239, amending the Capital Stock Tax Act of June 1, 1889, P. L. 420. Prior to these amendments of 1937 it was provided by the Fiscal Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> that “The amount of every tax . . . shall become due and payable sixty days after the date of the settlement . . .” and corporations subject to the capital stock tax were directed by Section 21 of the Act of 1889, as amended, “to transmit the amount of said tax to the Treasury of the Commonwealth within the time prescribed by law for the payment of state taxes <em>settled </em>by the Department of Revenue. ...”</p>

The Act also adds to the Code Section 805(c) which requires <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>that “The amount of all . . . taxes and bonus due the Commonwealth shall be due and payable upon the dates the reports or returns thereof are required by law to be made. . . .” Included therein is the capital stock tax. Then follows an amendment to Section 806 which prescribes that “All tax and bonus due the Commonwealth, as provided by law, shall bear interest at the rate of six per centum per annum from the date they are due and payable until sixty (60) days after settlement, and thereafter at the rate of twelve (12) per centum per annum until paid. ...”</p>

It asserts that the corporate taxpayer is now required to assess or compute the amount of its tax, and to pay the same at the time the capital stock tax report is filed; that any deficiency in the tax, which results from an undervaluation of the capital stock by the taxpayer, bears interest at the rate of six per cent per annum from the due date of the tax (when the report is filed) until the date when payment of the tax deficiency is made.</p>

    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[117,849,1154,1298]]]'>On March 15,1937, the defendant filed its capital stock tax report for the year 1936, declaring the taxable value of its stock at $500,000, and in accordance therewith paid a tax of $2,500 on the same day to the Department of Revenue. The payment was accompanied by a written protest. After an examination of the report by the fiscal officers of the Commonwealth, the Auditor General, on April 22, 1938, approved a settlement of the tax which increased the valuation of the defendant’s capital stock to $750,000, and the amount of its tax to $3,750. The defendant did not appeal from this settlement and does not now challenge its correctness. The tax deficiency of $1,250 was paid on May 23, 1938. Shortly thereafter an additional settlement was approved by the Auditor General charging the defendant with interest of $89.38, or six per cent of the amount of its underpayment for the period from March 15, 1937, — the filing date of the report when the initial payment was made, to May 23, 1938, — when the deficiency payment was made. From this interest settlement the defendant appealed to the court below, which sustained .its contention that the imposition of interest was invalid, and entered judgment in its favor. The Commonwealth has appealed from the decree accordingly entered.</p>

However, it is clear to us that the legislature intended <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>to substitute for the assessment of the capital stock tax, theretofore made by the taxing officials of the state, a new method of self-assessment by the taxpayer, and to change the date upon which the tax became due and payable. The provisions of these two Acts require the corporate officials to “compute and pay” the tax, which is expressly made “due and payable” on the date prescribed by law for the filing of the annual return. We are satisfied that the legislature used the word “compute” in the sense of “assess,” and this is apparent to us from the context of the Act of 1937, P. L. 3, as a whole.</p>
    <p id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.4",568,[290,1013,1151,1073]]]'>The defendant’s contention that the assessment must be made by officers of the Commonwealth fails to give effect to the provisions of Section 801(d) of the Code, as amended by the Act of 1937. This section retained the provision that if the Department of Revenue shall not be satisfied with <em>“the appraisement and valuation” </em>of the capital stock, as made and returned by the officers of any corporation, the Department itself is authorized to make a valuation thereof, and added thereto is the new provision for <em>payment of the tace </em>at the time of the filing of the return. It is manifest that it is the purpose of the legislature to place upon the corporate taxpayer the duty which the Department of Revenue theretofore performed of assessing the capital stock tax. This seems to us a reasonable construction of the Act, and one that implies no violation of the legal requirement for an assessment of the tax. We therefore cannot agree that the legislature intended to require payment of the tax before its amount had been determined by an assessment, as the defendant unwarrantedly assumes.</p>

The burden placed upon the taxpayer in the present instance is not onerous, because it falls upon the corporate officers who are in the best possible position of ascertaining the value of the property and assets of the corporation, and the legislature has fixed the rate and supplied a basis for the valuation thereof. The officers are compelled merely to make a mathematical calculation and a determination of fact in the same manner as they have been required in the past to prepare the annual return to the state’s fiscal authorities.</p>

This method of reaching subjects, capable of successful concealment, and liable to escape the notice of the most vigilant assessor, has, for many years, been recognized by our courts as a valid exercise of the legislative power.”</p>

The cases relied upon by defendant<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> fail to establish any constitutional requirement for an assessment by the taxing officers of the Commonwealth. They hold merely that <em>some </em>method of assessment must be provided for an <em>ad valorem </em>property tax; or if one is prescribed, that it must be followed. It seems to us <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>that if it is constitutional to permit a taxpayer to evaluate property which is the <em>measure </em>of a privilege tax, it is equally constitutional to permit him to evaluate that which is the <em>subject </em>of a property tax.</p>

In <em>Fox’s </em>Appealsupra, we said (p. 352) : “The taxing power of the state is great and searching. Within the limits of the constitution it is bounded only by the necessities of the state and the will of the people.” The fact that the system of assessment which the legislature has prescribed for the capital stock tax is <em>new </em>does not condemn it.

It remains only for us to consider whether the state may lawfully charge interest at the rate of six per cent upon the amount of any tax deficiency discovered at settlement, for the period from the due date of the tax to the date of payment. We think it is clear that where the legislature has the power to levy a tax, it has the correlative power to impose interest charges upon delinquent payments as a means of enforcing prompt compliance with the law.

There it will have full opportunity to be heard, and the burden of proof will be upon the Commonwealth to show that the taxpayer’s assessment of its capital stock tax is incorrect (See <em>Com. v.
