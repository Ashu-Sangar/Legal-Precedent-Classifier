Plaintiff filed the present bill in equity against defendant, The Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh, liquidating trustee of the City Deposit Bank and Trust Company (formerly the City Deposit Bank), seeking to obtain credits upon his indebtedness because of alleged improper dispositions made by the Bank of these mortgages. Plaintiff asked for an accounting of alleged overpay<a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>ments to the Bank, and for general relief. The bill sets forth at length a series of transactions between plaintiff, the Bank, and third parties, which need not be detailed herein, as the controlling issue on this appeal is one principally of procedure.</p>
    <p id="b201-3" data-blocks='[["BL_201.4",201,[140,623,1159,1074]]]'>Defendant filed an answer and an amended answer, raising preliminary objections, and moving the court to dismiss the bill on the ground that the matters therein alleged are res adjudicata. Although the answer contains a statement, as provided by Equity Buie 48 (7), that the defendant has “a full and complete defense to plaintiff’s claim, which does not require the production of evidence to sustain it,” it further avers that the claim asserted is in substance identical with that involved in three prior proceedings, in the same court, each instituted under the following caption: “Lymia Naffah v. William B. Seerist and City Deposit Bank and Trust Company, Common Pleas Court of Allegheny County, October Term, 1930.” Attached to the answer is a copy of the docket entries of the three proceedings. The court in banc took judicial notice of the records in the cases referred to, and being of opinion that they were conclusive of all of the matters set forth, sustained the objections and dismissed the bill. This appeal by plaintiff followed.</p>

The provisions of Equity Buie 48 (7), providing for the raising of preliminary objections, aré to be construed in the same manner as are the provisions of the Practice Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 483, for preliminary objections to the statement of claim, and the question to be decided upon such objections is whether, under the facts averred in plaintiff’s pleading, it appears as a matter of law that he is not entitled to recover: <em>Gray v. Phila. </em>&amp; <em>Reaching Coal &amp; I. Co., </em><a href="/pa/286/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="286 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1096512" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0011-01">286 Pa. 11</a>.

    <p id="b202-4" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[288,736,1156,1248]]]'>It is well established that a court may not ordinarily take judicial notice in one case of the records of another case, whether in another court or its own, even though the contents of those records may be known to the court: <em>Steel v. Levy, </em><a href="/pa/282/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="282 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1088401" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0338-01">supra;</a> <em>R. K. O. Dist. Corp. v.

It follows that unless the circumstances relied upon to sustain a plea of res adjudicata appear from the allegations of the bill itself, this question may not be raised by way of preliminary objection. In <em>Steel v. Levy, </em><a href="/pa/282/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="282 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1088401" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0338-01">supra,</a> it is said (p. 342) : “Hence the only way to dispose of the question of res adjudicata, when the facts are not admitted, is at the trial of the case, when, upon a consideration of the record of the prior judgment offered in evidence, <em>and of any extrinsic evidence which may be produced in order to show exactly what questions were raised and adjudicated in that </em>proceeding<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> . . . the court, aided by the jury, if there is a material dispute, will then determine whether or not there can be a recovery in the new action.” See also <em>Vondersmith v. Urban, <a href="/pa-super/108/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="108 Pa.
