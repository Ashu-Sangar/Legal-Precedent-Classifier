The appeal of the receiver of the Trust Company from that rilling must be sustained for the reasons stated in the opinion in re appeal No. 376, Jan. T., 1939.\nThe decree of the court below is reversed, the costs to be divided equally between the receiverships of the Trust Company and the Successful Building Association.",
