    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[269,531,1140,886]]]'>On August 1, 1978, Eugene Lewis, one of the appellees herein, was seriously injured while in the course of his employment on the production line of S.I. Handling Systems, Inc. At the time of his injury, Lewis was operating an overhead, electric chain-hoist to lift into position a sizeable, metal carriage assembly, which was a component of a machine being produced by his employer. The overhead electric hoist was such that it could be started and stopped, and its load maneuvered into various positions, by means of a “control pendant,” which was comprised of a control box attached to a cable leading to the hoist motor overhead. The cable was expandable to a distance of about fifteen feet, making the control box, to a degree, portable. Protruding from the surface of the box were push-type buttons by which the hoist was operated. Accordingly, physical depression of one of the buttons would activate the hoist and cause it to perform one of its functions.</p>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[265,1437,1138,679]]]'>The injury to Lewis occurred when a carriage assembly became jammed on one of the hoists because of a stuck chain. In an effort to correct the situation, he moved the control pendant to a certain position relative to the suspended load. In the course of doing that he stumbled and fell, causing his thumb to strike the “down” button on the control box. As a result, the front end of the carriage assembly held aloft by the hoist chain became unstuck, swung forward, and hit Lewis in both legs. Besides suffering bruises, contusions and lacerations in the lower portions of both legs, Lewis also suffered fractures of the fibia and tibia of his right leg. As a consequence of his injuries, he was out of work for a year.</p>

As a result of the injuries suffered by Eugene Lewis, he and his wife filed against Coffing, in the Court of Common Pleas of <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>Northampton County, an action asserting strict liability in tort pursuant to Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, and also included counts charging negligence and breach of warranty. The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the control box for the hoist was defectively designed in that there was no guard or other protective feature over the buttons on the box to prevent accidental activation of the hoist. Just prior to trial the plaintiffs elected to proceed only on the theory of strict liability under Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts.</p>
    <p id="b523-4" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[280,840,1138,1159]]]'>Based on an <em>in limine </em>motion by the plaintiffs, the trial court made certain rulings concerning the admissibility of evidence at trial. First, the court barred the defendant from putting into evidence a publication of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (“ASME”) setting forth standards respecting the manufacture of electric hoists and other industrial lifting equipment. The trial court excluded this evidence on the ground that the ASME publication was totally silent on the subject of the design and guarding of buttons on the control pendants of electric hoists. The court also ruled that the defendant could not present testimony, through its expert witness, that “at least ninety percent” of the electric hoists made in this country had control boxes devoid of any type of guard around the activating buttons. In excluding Coffing’s evidence on this point, the court concluded that proof of the defendant’s compliance with industry-wide standards, practices and customs would inject into the case concepts of negligence law, and that under our decision in <em>Azzarello v. Black Bros. Co., </em><a href="/pa/480/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="480 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1745082" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0547-01">480 Pa. 547</a>, <a href="/pa/480/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="480 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1745082" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0547-01">391 A.2d 1020</a> (1978), negligence concepts have no role in a case based entirely on strict liability under Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts.</p>

According to the plaintiffs’ expert, <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>each of these alternative designs would have been safer than the defendant’s because they would prevent unexpected activation of the hoist through inadvertent physical contact with the buttons. In support of his further opinion that the suggested design alternatives were technologically and economically feasible, this witness was permitted to show the jury a model of a control box which featured recessed control buttons. He was also allowed to display photographs of an actual control box, made by another manufacturer of electric hoists, which had flanges around the control buttons.</p>
    <p id="b524-4" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[283,888,1140,829]]]'>Coffing called only one witness, Mr. William Ellis, who was the company’s “Director of Products Reliability.” Mr. Ellis testified that the control pendant involved in the case was designed in 1964 and was no longer used after 1977. He also stated that the instant case represented the first complaint about the safety of Coffing’s control device, and that, in his opinion, it was safely designed. Ellis further opined that the model presented by the plaintiffs’ expert witness, featuring recessed buttons, presented a greater risk of accidental activation than the defendant’s. Regarding the plaintiffs’ photographs showing an actual control box with protective flanges around its buttons, the defendant sought to offer proof that the manufacturer of that device also made one which had no type of guard around the buttons. The trial court barred that evidence as being irrelevant.</p>

The motion was denied by a court <em>en banc, </em>which endorsed the trial court’s reasoning as to the evidence involved. Following the entry of judgment on the verdicts, Coffing appealed to the Superior <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>Court. That tribunal affirmed in a memorandum opinion. <a href="/citations/?q=346%20Pa.%20Super.%20639" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="346 Pa.

    <p id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[278,553,1137,903]]]'>As indicated, the question presented by this appeal is whether the trial court properly excluded the appellant’s evidence of industry standards and practices relating to the design of control boxes for electric hoists. To resolve this issue, we must start by observing that the fundamental consideration in determining the admissibility of any evidence is its relevance to the fact sought to be proved. <em>Martin v.

E.g., Azzarello v. Black Bros. Co., supra; Cronin v. J.B.E. Olson Corp., </em><a href="/cal-3d/8/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="8 Cal. 3d 121" data-case-ids="2321916" data-case-paths="/cal-3d/8/0121-01">8 Cal.3d 121</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20433" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="104 Cal.

It must be noted, however, that Section 402A provides no definition of the term “defect,” and thus, of itself, does not afford an effective working guide as to what kinds of factual circumstances will result in the imposition of strict liability on a manufacturer for injuries which are caused by its product. Consequently, the various jurisdictions have fashioned diverse formulas, most especially with regard to the subject of design defects.</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[279,1071,1141,731]]]'>One such approach to the question of design defect looks to “consumer expectations.” Under this standard, a product may be found defective in design if it failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner. <em>Barker v. Lull Engineering Co., </em><a href="/cal-3d/20/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="20 Cal. 3d 413" data-case-ids="2288519" data-case-paths="/cal-3d/20/0413-01">20 Cal.3d 413</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20225" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="143 Cal.

Another test provides that a product may be found to be defective in design if, after the plaintiff proves that the design caused his injury, the defendant fails to establish that, on balance, the benefits of the challenged feature outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such design. <em>Id.; see generally </em>A. Weinstein, A. Twerski, H. Piehler &amp; W. Donaher, <em>Products Liability and the Reasonably Safe Product </em>43-59 (1978).</p>

In <em>Azzarello, </em>this Court, after holding that the supplier of a product is a guarantor of its safety, further stated that: “the jury may find a defect where the product left the supplier’s control <em>lacking any element necessary to make it safe for its intended use </em>or possessing any feature that renders it unsafe for the intended use.” 480 Pa. at 559, <a href="/pa/480/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="480 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1745082" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0547-01">391 A.2d at 1027</a> (emphasis added).</p>

Recognizing that same principle, the appellate courts of most jurisdictions, regardless of the linguistic variations in their definitions of “defect,” have held that it is the product itself which is on trial, and not the manufacturer’s conduct. For example, in <em>Barker v. Lull Engineering Co., supra, </em>the California Supreme Court pointed out that in a design defect case based on strict liability, as contrasted with an action based on negligent design, the jury’s focus is properly directed to the condition of the product itself, and not the reasonableness of the manufacturer’s conduct. So too, the Supreme Court of Washington in <em>Lenhardt v. Ford Motor Co., </em><a href="/wash-2d/102/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="102 Wash. 2d 208" data-case-ids="1137142" data-case-paths="/wash-2d/102/0208-01">102 Wash.2d 208</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=683%20P.2d%201097" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="683 P.2d 1097">683 P.2d 1097</a> (1984), emphasized that under its rule of strict liability attention had to be focussed upon the product and not upon the actions of the manufacturer. Going further, the Court in <em>Lenhardt </em>said, with regard to a strict-liability case, that: “The liability of the manufacturer is measured solely by the characteristics of the product he has produced rather than his behavior and, therefore, strict liability does not sound in negligence.” <em>Id. </em>at 213, <a href="/citations/?q=683%20P.2d%201097" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="683 P.2d 1097">683 P.2d at 1100</a>. <em>Accord Johnson v.

Using the theory that negligence concepts are to be kept out of cases based on strict liability under Section 402A, various courts have excluded attempts by manufacturer-defendants to prove that the quality or design of the product in question comports with industry standards or is in widespread industry use. Such a holding was rendered by the Supreme Court of Washington in <em>Lenhardt v. Ford Motor Co., supra. </em>In <em>Lenhardt </em>the Court concluded that the question of whether or not the defendant has complied with industry standards improperly focusses on the quality of the defendant’s conduct in making its design choice, and not on the attributes of the product itself. Therefore, in the view of the <em>Lenhardt </em>Court, such evidence should be excluded because it tends to mislead the jury’s attention from their proper inquiry.

However, merely because a piece of evidence by itself has <em>little </em>probative value, is not reason to exclude it so long as it has <em>some </em>probative value. Moreover, considering evidence of industry-wide acceptance in connection with the position of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers that, in fact, the switch was safely designed, the jury could properly conclude that the widespread use is at the least probative of the industry’s acceptance of appellant’s design as a safe one. For these reasons, I would admit the evidence, not to show the reasonableness of appellant’s use of the switch, but to show that users of the switch widely regard it as safe and so perhaps it is.</p>

A courtroom is a poor substitute for a design office. Design develops a product to perform a particular function within perceived physical, technical and economic constraints. As a creative process it is teamwork oriented, not adversary oriented. Academic experience, access to the proper tools and, most importantly, experience in the field are the attributes of a good engineer or engineering organization. Courts are at best novices in the designer’s field and often illiterate in his language. The technical or design expertise we gain in one case is generally not transferable to the next.
