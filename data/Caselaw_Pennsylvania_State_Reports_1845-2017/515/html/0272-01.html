While this phrase, <em>standing alone, could arguably </em>support <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>an inference that the Commonwealth has discretion whether to proceed under section 9712 (i.e., whether the Commonwealth has the “intention to proceed”), such an inference is an overly literal one which ignores the context in which that phrase occurs and the remainder of the Act. The second and third sentences of subsection (b), and subsections (c) and (d), establish unambiguously that the sentencing court is to be the sole adjudicator of the applicability of section 9712 and that, once the court makes that determination, there is no authority or discretion in the court to impose anything less than the mandatory minimum five year jail term.</p>

Subsection (b) is designed, therefore, to give the defendant notice of his sentencing under this section, and an opportunity to present evidence (important procedural rights because the provisions of this section are not elements of the crime of which he has been convicted.) However, in light of the subsequent provisions of subsection (b) reposing the sole authority to determine the applicability of section 9712 in the sentencing court, and in light of subsections (c) and (d) (to be discussed), I do not read subsection (b) as giving the prosecutor any authority or discretion to decide whether or not to proceed under this section, and I agree with the lower courts that where, as here, the prosecutor fails to render the requisite notice, the sentencing court must supply that notice where it determines that section 9712 applies.

Under subsections (b) and (c) therefore, the court (and <em>only </em>the court) determines whether section 9712 is applicable and, when it determines that this section is applicable, <em>it has no authority to impose anything less than five years imprisonment. </em>By the majority’s interpretation, however, a prosecutor may unilaterally render these provisions meaningless, and thwart the mandatory nature of the Act and the legislative intent, simply by refusing to give notice of his or her intention to proceed under section 9712. This interpretation would, in this case, require the court to impose a sentence <em>which it has no authority to impose </em>because it is less than the <em>mandatory </em>minimum five years which the court has determined to be applicable.</p>
