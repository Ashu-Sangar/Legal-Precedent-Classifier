By contrast, disposition of the case under review is based on the issue of a sanction order for failure to respond to interrogatories. This qualitative difference clearly distinguishes the two cases. But even more compelling, is the yawning spectre of an avalanche of appeals which easily could overburden the judicial system. By insisting that sanctions are final orders, the dissent, in effect, would open the floodgates to perpetual judicial impermanence and impotence at the trial level and an unmanageable quantum of cases choking the appellate system. We should be reminded that trial courts are empowered to sanction litigants in a variety of ways and enforce the obligations of the judicial system in a fair, fast, and firm manner. Followed to its logical conclusion, the argument of my learned colleague would lead inexorably to disastrous consequences.</p>

In the instant case no discovery order was even issued, although such an order was requested by the plaintiff as an alternative to striking the New Matter and prohibiting support of the defenses raised therein.

Common Pleas’ order barring appellants’ new matter is in practical effect a final order and, therefore, appellate review is proper. I recognize that no appeal will lie to this Court from an interlocutory order unless otherwise expressly permitted by statute. <em>Stevenson v.

However, in determining whether an order is final, we should look beyond the technical effect of the adjudication to its practical ramifications. <em>T.C.R. Realty, Inc. v. Cox, </em><a href="/pa/472/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="472 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="1727742" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0331-01">472 Pa. 331</a>, 337, <a href="/pa/472/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="472 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="1727742" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0331-01">372 A.2d 721</a>, 724 (1977). Although the appellants are not technically “out of court” since they still must appear at trial before the court below, the practical effect of the discovery sanction is to deprive them of an opportunity to present their defenses to appellee’s libel action against them. Appellants’ new matter raised seven affirmative defenses to appellee’s libel claim. Striking their new matter deprives them of the opportunity to assert or prove matters essential to an effective defense of a libel action, including the constitutionally protected defenses of truth and privilege under the Pennsylvania Constitution. The sanction order precludes appellants from contesting the merits of appellee’s claim.</p>
    <p id="b239-8" data-blocks='[["BL_239.8",239,[236,1962,1134,360]],["BL_240.1",240,[282,306,1140,686]]]'>Moreover, in <em>Grota v.

We reasoned that precluding the opportunity to amend to incorporate an affirmative defense put them out of court. The extreme sanction order entered here also deprives appel<a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>lants of the opportunity to assert affirmative defenses essential to vindication of free speech and public comment on official performance guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The order here is simply not analogous to the myriad interlocutory orders involving discovery. It denies appellants fundamental rights secured by the constitutions which govern us. While I agree that most discovery sanctions are not final and appealable, the sanction in this case effectively put the appellants out of court on a number of key defenses. Unless we overrule <em>LaBocetta </em>and its progeny, this discovery sanction is <em>a fortiori </em>a final order and appealable.</p>
