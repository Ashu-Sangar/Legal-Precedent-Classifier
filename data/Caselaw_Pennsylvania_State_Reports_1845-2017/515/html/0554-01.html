Kozak and Mary Ann Kozak, appeal by allowance a Superior Court order which affirmed Allegheny County Common Pleas’ judgment on a jury verdict for appellee Wayne Struth. They argue that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting appellee’s expert witness to comment on the totality of the evidence. Because an expert may not usurp the jury function by weighr ing and testing the credibility of other witnesses, we hold, under all the circumstances presented by this record, that admission of the particular expert testimony given was an abuse of the trial court’s discretion. We therefore reverse the order of Superior Court and remand to Common Pleas for a new trial.</p>

Kozak, while enrolled in a swimming class at McKeesport Area High School, attempted to dive into the shallow end of the school’s swimming pool. Patrick, then 16 years of age, struck his head on the bottom of the pool, severing his spinal cord and leaving him paralyzed. He and his mother filed an action in trespass against the instructor in charge of the swimming class, appellee Wayne Struth. Struth then joined the McKeesport Area School District as an additional defendant. At the close of the evidence, the school district’s motion for a compulsory nonsuit was granted. The jury then returned a verdict for appellee Struth and against the appellants.

We have declined, believing that requiring the proponent of an expert opinion to clarify for the jury the assumptions upon which the opinion is based avoids planting in the juror’s mind a general statement likely to remain with him in the jury room when the disputed details are lost. Relying on cross-examination to illuminate the underlying assumptions may further confuse jurors already struggling to follow complex testimony. Additionally, total reliance on cross-examination permits the party propounding the expert’s evidence to introduce it generally in a conclusory manner without relation to the record and casts the whole burden of disqualifying it on the opponent.

Here, the testimony which approaches expert opinion on the <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>ultimate issue involves an unstated evaluation of credibility based arguably on irrelevant factors. Had the expert commented on the question of due care by setting forth the proper procedures, this problem would not have arisen. <em>See supra </em>at 421-422. However, in dealing with causation, he went on to state the accident was in fact wholly caused by Patrick’s failure to think. This presented the jury with a confusing mixture of fact and opinion which directly attacked Patrick’s credibility on an ultimate issue. The witness’s unstated implication that the appellee was more credible was arguably based on reasons, <em>e.g., </em>appellee’s distinguished schooling, which had no relevance to the case at hand. Considering all these circumstances, we conclude that the trial judge did abuse his discretion by permitting the opinion evidence given on this record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
