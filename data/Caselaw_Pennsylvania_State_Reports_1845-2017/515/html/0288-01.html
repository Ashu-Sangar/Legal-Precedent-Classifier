    <p id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[258,532,1139,887]]]'>Appellant, Mary Hollman, and appellee, Wade Hollman, were married in May, 1938. They separated in March, 1967, and two years later, they entered into a written separation agreement which provided that appellee would pay appellant $300.00 per month for her support. The parties were divorced in May, 1969. Appellee paid support as agreed and continued to do so after he retired in 1975. In November of 1978, however, appellee ceased making support payments and six months later, moved to Florida and removed all of his personal assets from Pennsylvania except for his pension which is disbursed to appellee by the United States Steel and Carnegie Pension Fund in the amount of $1,661.69 per month. This pension was established under the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001-1461" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461">29 U.S.C.A. §§ 1001-1461</a> (ERISA), and appellee’s pension plan provides that benefits “shall not be subject ... to assignment.”</p>
    <p id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[256,1438,1138,627]]]'>Appellant brought two actions to enforce the support agreement. The first, an action in assumpsit for arrearages (Hollman I), was filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Civil Division. On April 13, 1981, that court entered a default judgment against appellee in the amount of $1,800.00. Appellee’s pension benefits were attached pursuant to a writ of execution. Appellee contested the attachment, filing a claim for exemption from attachment pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. Rule 3123.1, which claim was dismissed. Appellee appealed this dismissal to Superior Court and continued to avoid his support obligation by failing to make monthly payments.</p>

A second attachment was made against appellee’s pension benefits, and the trustees of the pension plan raised the issue of the statutory exemption of the pension benefits from execution and attachment. The trial court dismissed appellant’s judgment of attachment with prejudice.</p>

In other words, Mrs. Hollman’s remedy in this case would be to bring an assumpsit action on the separation agreement and to seek enforcement in Florida, her former husband’s current residence. Admittedly, such a course of action is more cumbersome and perhaps more expensive than attaching the pension fund based on an <em>in rem </em>order, but that is what the pre-1980 law requires.</p>
