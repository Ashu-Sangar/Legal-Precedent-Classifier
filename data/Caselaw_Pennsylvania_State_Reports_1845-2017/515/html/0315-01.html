In February, 1981, appellant worked as a screen-maker responsible for manually producing the frames and screens used to make decorative designs for impressions upon appellee’s products known as Corning Ware. In making screens and frames, appellant would cut and shape stainless steel mesh, punch holes into the mesh and screw ten to twenty metal screws of various sizes through the mesh into a metal frame, using a screwdriver. <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>This job also involved strenuous pulling of an overhead lever. The screen-making process was described as employing <em>“a </em>lot of physical labor.”</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[290,483,1137,836]]]'>In early February, 1981, appellant experienced pain and swelling in her upper right arm (appellant is right handed) and observed black and blue marks along her arm. On February 4, 1981, appellant complained of these problems to a company nurse, who referred her to the company doctor, Dr. Arthur Paluso, who in turn referred her to Dr. Leslie Morris, an angiologist who specializes in peripheral vascular diseases. Dr. Morris, Chief of the Vascular Clinic at Montefiore Hospital in Pittsburgh, examined appellant on February 6, 1981, ordered an emergency venogram test which revealed a blood clot (an “effort thrombosis” of her right subclavien vein which obstructed the flow of blood), and immediately admitted her to the hospital where she remained until February 21, 1981. During her stay in the hospital and following her discharge, appellant’s thrombosis was treated with rest and anti-coagulent medications.</p>
    <p id="b505-5" data-blocks='[["BL_505.5",505,[289,1339,1137,734]]]'>Compensation benefits were paid to appellant beginning on March 9, 1981, pursuant to a notice of compensation payable. Dr. Morris examined appellant on March 6, 17 and 31, 1981, observing continued improvement in appellant’s arm, with the swelling reducing and the thrombosis resolving, although she continued to experience some pain in her arm which tired easily. On March 31, 1981, Dr. Morris advised appellant and her employer that she was “fit to return to work on Monday, April 6, 1981, however, not to her former occupation.” Specifically, Dr. Morris informed Dr. Paluso that appellant “was permanently unfit for the type of work that she had performed in the screen department, which produced her present problem.” Reproduced record (R.) at 73, Deposition Testimony of Dr. Morris at 23.</p>

In her capacity as screen-maker instructor, appellant instructed several other <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>people in how to make screens for the Corning Ware. This job required her to demonstrate the screen-making operation, and therefore required her to perform the same work that had produced the effort thrombosis. On April 10, 1981, appellant experienced a flare-up of her arm injury, including swelling and soreness, and was examined by Dr. Morris who found the veins in her right arm to be slightly more dilated than when last measured on March 31. Dr. Morris advised appellant in no uncertain terms to avoid the strenuous physical labor involved with screen-making, especially screw driving and lever pulling. He also advised her to avoid similar exertions at home and elsewhere, and suggested a very mild exercise regimen (described by the doctor as lifting a very light weight for two minutes, twice a day, but without hyperabducting the arm).</p>

R. 71. For example, Dr. Morris stated that “in my opinion, she should never make screens again as long as she lives,” and that, without doubt, her effort thrombosis was caused by her work as a screen-maker. R. 80, 93 and 70-71. He further expressed the opinion that, although her symptoms had abated (a venogram on September 22, 1981 showed that the obstruction/occlusion in the affected vein had been resolved), there was “no room for debate” that to return to work as a screen-maker would expose her to great risk of another, potentially more dangerous thrombosis attack,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and that to perform such work would be like playing Russian Roulette.

R. 119-23 and 135-38. While Dr. Morris did not waiver in his opinion as to causation, and did not accept that appellant had a “peculiar physiological makeup” that caused the thrombosis, R. 121-22 and 135-36, he did state on cross-examination that “she may have what we call a tight thoracic outlet. She may have a little more pressure on the vein when it emerges from the thorax down the arm than you or I would have,” and that she should “refrain from activities tending to aggravate that____” R. 136.</p>

We have found today that it was “unconscionable for the appellee to require appellant to return to work as a screen-maker upon the threat of foregoing workmen’s compensation ...” We have further held <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>that the lower tribunals pulled Dr. Morris’ words out of context, distorted those words, and capriciously or wilfully disregarded his unequivocal and uncontradicted medical opinion that appellant’s work had caused her injury. While it may have some bearing on the “reasonableness” of its contest that appellee persuaded the referee, Board and Commonwealth Court to deny compensation, we cannot say on the record before us that such a reasonable basis was established as a matter of law.</p>
    <p id="b518-4" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[284,822,1139,787]]]'>It is necessary for the referee or Board, in the first instance, to determine whether, under the circumstances, the appellee had a reasonable basis for contesting liability and whether, if it so finds, it will exercise its discretion to exclude attorney’s fees. An appellate court cannot initially exercise this discretion-indeed, we may only review the record to determine whether the lower tribunals have abused that discretion. Accordingly, we must remand the issues of the appropriateness of attorney’s fees and what is a reasonable sum for the specified mandatory costs and expenses under section 440, to the Board for determination, and for such further proceedings as are deemed necessary. Any such proceedings shall not, however, delay the immediate payment of appellant’s long overdue workmen’s compensation benefits.</p>

This award is in the sound discretion of the referee. As this is the first stage of the proceedings where claimant has prevailed, and the referee has not previously had a chance to consider the propriety of an award of attorney’s fees, I would, thus, remand to the referee for a prompt determination of this question.</p>
