This is not necessarily the case. A jury may choose to believe all, some or none of a witness’s testimony. <em>Weidemoyer v.

Requiring the experts to speak in terms of numerical percentages<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> introduces a false precision into the evidence. Mathematical exactitude is not found in the real world of medicine. We should not mislead lay jurors by requiring experts to falsely imply its existence. Honest, but more flexible, words such as “substantial factor,” “major contribution” or “significant cause” are more suitable to the proper jury function of justly and fairly resolving uncertainties. It is unfair and unjust to place on appellee the whole burden of supporting appellant for a disability his own experts admit he himself substantially caused. The rule “drafted” for Section 433A of the Restatement does not reduce that injustice and the “law” written by its draftsmen, who were never elected to the legislature, finds its only authority in reason and need not be followed to an unjust result.</p>

The evidence favoring apportionment of damages provides a “reasonable basis” for that verdict, which simply took into account the “substantial” adverse impact appellant’s own conduct had on his condition.
