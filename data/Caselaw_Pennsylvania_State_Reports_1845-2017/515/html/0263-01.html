She gave the guarantee in an interim during which the applicable loan disclosure law did not require certain disclosures on business loans even though they could subject residential real estate to lien or levy.

Appellee was unwilling to grant that loan solely on the security of the business assets; it wanted additional collateral. Accordingly, it required appellants to execute the Agreement of Guarantee at issue before approving the loan. This Agreement gave appellee a “security interest” in any property appellants owned and <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>allowed appellee to confess judgment against them.

Absent this Agreement of Guarantee signed by both William and Mary Flanagan, appellee could not reach or levy on their residence upon default. The loan documents and the collateral guarantee were all executed on March 29, 1979. William Flanagan used about $27,000 of the total loan proceeds to pay off prior outstanding business loans.

In April, 1981, appellee sought to strengthen its position in the event of default by obtaining a judgment against appellants pursuant to the confession of judgment clause in the Agreement of Guarantee. William Flanagan defaulted on the loan in January, 1982. Appellee then tried to collect the debt from appellants on the judgment confessed under the Agreement of Guarantee. To do so, it sent them the “notice of foreclosure” required by the loan statute before a lender may expose residential real estate to levy and sale by the sheriff.
