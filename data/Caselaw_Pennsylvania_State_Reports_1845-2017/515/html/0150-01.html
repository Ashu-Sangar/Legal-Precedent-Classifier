At issue in this appeal is not “the right or power of ... [a] political subdivision to create or issue indebtedness” but, rather, whether the political subdivision in question created a record which established the prerequisites for the exercise of such right of power under the Local Government Unit Debt Act, 53 P.S. § 6780-1 <em>et seq.</em>
