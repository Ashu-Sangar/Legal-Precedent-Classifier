The appellant, Victor Bracero, was tried before a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, and convicted of the burglary of a dwelling house on South Tenth Street in the City of Lebanon.

The appellant argued to the Superior Court that the statements of “Spunk” offered through the testimony of Harry Tobias, even though hearsay, should have been admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule because they were declarations against the declarant’s penal interest. The Superior Court, relying on its opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Hackett, </em><a href="/pa-super/225/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="225 Pa.

The Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s ruling excluding the out of court statements allegedly made by “Spunk”. The appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal to the court was granted.</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[284,598,1140,1258]]]'>The appellant argues that the rule adopted by the Superior Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Hackett, supra, </em>and applied in this case should be rejected by this Court. In <em>Hackett, </em>the defendant was convicted of possession of heroin and of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of a narcotic drug. At trial the defendant asserted the defense that he had been drugged involuntarily. He sought to call one Dennis Keyser to the stand to testify as a defense witness. It was ascertained preliminarily that Keyser would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refuse to testify if called as a witness. The trial judge, therefore, declined to permit defendant to call Keyser. In addition, the trial court refused to allow into evidence certain oral and written statements made by Keyser which exculpated the defendant. The defendant wanted to call his former counsel who would have testified that Keyser admitted to him that he, Keyser, put heroin in the defendant’s soda bottle without the knowledge of the defendant. The trial court refused to allow this testimony. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed the trial court and held that Keyser’s out of court statements made to both a member of the bar and the accused were relevant and trustworthy and should have been admitted. The court said:</p>

Nash was convicted of aggravated robbery, aggravated assault and battery and carrying a concealed weapon. Robinson was convicted of aggravated robbery. The trial court refused to allow the testimony of one Renee Edwards, a girlfriend of Robinson, who was called as a defense witness. Ms. Edwards would have testified that a Willis Daniels had admitted to her that he committed the crimes for which Nash and Robinson were on trial. The testimony was rejected as inadmissible hearsay. Following the trial in <em>Nash, </em>and while that case was pending on appeal, the Superior Court decided <em>Commonwealth v. Hackett, supra </em>and the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in <em>Chambers v.

Green, </em><a href="/us/399/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="399 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="6168934" data-case-paths="/us/399/0149-01">399 U.S. 149</a>, 158, <a href="/us/399/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="399 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="6168934" data-case-paths="/us/399/0149-01">90 S.Ct. 1930</a>, 1935, <a href="/us/399/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="399 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="6168934" data-case-paths="/us/399/0149-01">26 L.Ed.2d 489</a> (1970). A number of exceptions have developed over the years to allow admission of hearsay statements made under circumstances that tend to assure reliability and thereby compensate for the absence of the oath and opportunity for cross-examination. Among the most prevalent of these exceptions is the one applicable to declarations against interest — an exception founded on the assumption that a person is unlikely to fabricate a statement against his own interest at the time it is made. Mississippi recognizes this exception but applies it only to declarations against pecuniary interest. It recognizes no such exception for declarations, like McDonald’s in this case, that are against the penal interest of the declarant. <em>Brown v.

At the outset, some assurance of reliability inheres in the “circumstance that the fact stated, being against the declarant’s interest, is not likely to have been stated untruthfully.” 5 Wigmore, Evidence § 1455. The ultimate question of the degree of reliability which should be attributed to the evidence is a proper one for resolution by the fact-finder. During the trial, opposing counsel, through the vehicle of cross-examination, may probe for weaknesses, inconsisten<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>cíes, and the bias of the witness attesting to the out-of-court declaration. In closing, the fact-finder’s attention may again be focused upon the reliability of the declaration through proper argument. Ultimately, the question of the degree of reliance to be placed on the declaration should be determined by the fact-finder.</p>
    <p id="b554-5" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[272,647,1143,843]]]'>Those courts which have imposed a requirement of additional indicia of reliability have, as the opinion authored by Mr. Justice Larsen correctly notes, been largely motivated out of fear of opening a door to perjured testimony regarding declarations that were never made. In the words of Professor Wigmore, however, “This would be a good argument against admitting any witnesses at all, for it is notorious that some witnesses will lie and that it is difficult to avoid being deceived by their lies. The truth is that any rule which hampers an honest man in exonerating himself is a bad rule, even if it also hampers a villain in falsely passing for an innocent.” 5 Wigmore, Evidence § 1477. Thus, where the out-of-court declarant is unavailable to testify at trial, I would admit evidence of his declaration against penal interest, and allow this evidence to be tested in the traditional fashion.</p>
    <p id="b554-6" data-blocks='[["BL_554.5",554,[267,1531,1140,794]]]'>Because it has not been demonstrated that the out-of-court declarant was indeed unavailable at the time of trial, however, I would exclude the evidence in this case. The witness Tobias would have testified that the declarant left for Florida on the 21st of February. The trial of the instant matter was conducted in June of the same year. It seems likely that the declarant intended to absent himself from the jurisdiction for the purpose of avoiding prosecution, and Tobias’s testimony would have indicated the same. But whether the declarant was still absent at the time of trial is not known. Before admitting the out-of-court declaration, I would require the party offering the evidence to show that the declarant’s presence at trial could not have been secured. As this was not done, the evidence was properly excluded. Thus, I concur in the result.</p>
