    <p id="b320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[261,427,1140,776]]]'>This case arose from the following facts. Appellant, Robert C. Orner, was a guest at a series of high school graduation parties which took place during the night of June 12, 1981, and the early morning hours of June 13, 1981. At that time Mr. Orner was approximately nineteen and one half years old. Mr. Orner attended at least three parties. The first party took place at the home of Edward and Ann Esslinger where Mr. Orner was allegedly served intoxicating beverages. The second party took place at the home of Elizabeth Bonsall where Mr. Orner was also allegedly served intoxicating beverages. The third place was at the Regency Hotel where Mr. Orner was again allegedly served intoxicating beverages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At this last site Mr. Orner, who was allegedly intoxicated at the time, fell over a second floor railing and sustained serious head injuries.</p>
    <p id="b320-6" data-blocks='[["BL_320.6",320,[259,1221,1138,617]]]'>Mr. Orner instituted suit against the hosts of all three parties in September, 1982. In May, 1983, after some procedural steps not here relevant Ms. Bonsall, the host of the second party, filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. The Honorable William R. Toal Jr., of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, sustained the demurrer and dismissed Mr. Orner’s action against Ms. Bonsall. The actions of Judge Toal were based upon the then prevailing law in this Commonwealth that no social host liability existed, even for service to a minor. <em>See Congini v.

As remarked above, the defendant, Ms. Bonsall, filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. As such, for purposes of considering the instant appeal, the facts as stated in plaintiffs complaint are accepted as true. <em>Sinn v. Burd, </em><a href="/pa/486/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="486 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="1757610" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0146-01">486 Pa. 146</a>, 149, <a href="/pa/486/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="486 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="1757610" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0146-01">404 A.2d 672</a>, 674 (1979). In addition, fact-based defenses, even those which might ultimately inure to the defendant’s benefit, e.g., the plaintiff’s contributory or comparative negligence, are not relevant on demurrer. Thus, the only relevant inquiry is whether the facts as pleaded state an actionable claim of negligence on the part of the defendant. <em>International Union of Operating Engineers v. Linesville Construction Company, </em><a href="/pa/457/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="457 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="477670" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0220-01">457 Pa. 220</a>, 233, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20353" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="322 A.2d 353">322 A.2d 353</a> (1974).</p>

The consequences of accepting intoxicants were left to the personal responsibility of the guest, and the host was not required to answer for their effect. The adult guest who drank more than he should answered alone to himself and to all others for whatever injury followed his acceptance of intoxicants.</p>

Because the law in general seeks to protect minors where it can from their own indiscretions, and in specific prohibits the service of alcohol to minors, we felt compelled to sanction in the civil law what the criminal prohibits. Thus, in <em>Congini </em>we held that a social host “was negligent <em>per se </em>in serving alcohol to the point of intoxication to a person less than twenty-one years of age, and that they can be held liable for injuries proximately resulting from the minor’s intoxication.” <em><a href="/pa/504/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="504 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1787735" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0141-01">Id.,</a> </em>504 Pa. at 163, 470 A.2d at 518.

Unfortunately, the Superior Court misapprehended the underlying rationale of our decision in <em>Congini, </em>and as a result erred in its decision.</p>
