Appellants argue that the language “this act shall not apply in any case,” coupled with the prohibition against violence in Section 4(d), 43 P.S. § 206d(d), prevents the use of Section 8 of the Act in cases involving violent acts. Careful scrutiny of Section 4, 43 P.S. § 206d, reveals that subsections (a) through (d) were added to the Act of June 2, 1937, P.L. 1198, No. 308, by the Act of June 9, 1939, P.L. 302, No. 163. Prior to that amendment, Section 4 concluded with the word “Commonwealth” immediately before the proviso. Subsection (d) was <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>added to restore to a chancellor the power to enjoin a violent labor dispute. The subsection does not abrogate the protections afforded in Section 8 which apply to any organization or association “in any civil action at law or suit in equity.” Anti-Injunction Act, <em>supra, </em>§ 8, 43 P.S. § 206h. It does not apply to actions at law for damages. An injunction poses no threat to the viability of a labor organization whereas damage awards may quickly strangle the entity responsible for bargaining on behalf of workers. Hence, in amending the original act in 1939, the legislature retained the original higher standard of proof for damage actions. The 1939 amendment was intended to insure that an injunction will quickly issue when required to calm a heated and violent labor dispute. <em>Link Belt Co. v.

A union qua union can have no legitimate interest in preventing an injunction against violence on the picket line, whether or not it participated in fomenting that violence. If it did, it is properly a party. If it did not, it should support an end to the violence as all good citizens are required to do. On the other hand, a civil suit for damages against a union which did not participate or foment unlawful acts by its members can destroy or severely cripple a union which has taken no part in its members’ unlawful acts.

Also, appellants proffered evidence of a parade held in Philadelphia three days after the shooting; however, there was absolutely no showing that the officers of the IBT sanctioned this event as a demonstration of support of the violence of January 25. This showing falls well short of the clear proof of actual authorization or actual participation called for in Section 8. <em>Cf. Riverside Coal Co. v.

The uncontroverted evidence repudiates the majority’s implication that the status of these two individuals as stewards and negotiating committee members was such that their conduct could be sufficient to establish that Local 107 actually participated in the acts. Neither of these positions vested authority in those individuals to control the picket line; yet, the majority presumes such authority existed, stating “No one used his authority to remove [the pistol] or stop the drinking.” [Majority Opinion at 17.] Contrary to the expansive responsibilities imagined by the majority to exist in one who held those positions, a steward’s only responsibility was the processing of grievances. R. 461a, 475a. This function had significance only as long as the collective bargaining agreement was in effect.</p>

This finding is the entire underpinning of the majority’s theory <em>of </em>liability as it relates to Local 107. Without evidence that Crossan and Kendig were responsible for supervising the conduct of the striking workers while on the picket line, their actions are not a proper predicate for establishing liability of Local 107. The record demonstrates that as members of the negotiating committee, Crossan and Kendig simply acted as sources of information relative to the progress of the negotiations. R. 447a, 476a. No actual participation in the violence, or authorization, by the union is established simply by showing that members who happened to be on the negotiating committee were involved in acts of violence.</p>

However, <em>Bonanno </em>reinforces only one premise of the majority’s syllogism. The deficiency of the majority’s logic is that the facts in this case do not support the same premise. In Bonanno, there was an indisputable breach of responsibility to control violence. When the company had first requested an injunction against the union, its representative “promised the court he would control the pickets”, <em>Id. </em>at 11, and the court refused the injunction. After the violence, a restraining order was issued on the court’s finding that the representative who had the power and authority to control the violence had deliberately failed to deliver on his promise.

      <em>Bonanno </em>does not provide proper support for the majority’s leap from the statement that the union officials were involved in the negotiating process to the conclusion that they had the power and authority to control the picket line. Although the court in <em>Bonanno </em>made this point, it did so by taking out of context a statement by the Supreme Court in the seminal case interpreting the Norris-LaGuardia Act, <em>United Brotherhood of Carpenters v. United States, </em><a href="/us/330/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="330 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="353686" data-case-paths="/us/330/0395-01">330 U.S. 395</a>, <a href="/us/330/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="330 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="353686" data-case-paths="/us/330/0395-01">67 S.Ct. 775</a>, <a href="/us/330/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="330 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="353686" data-case-paths="/us/330/0395-01">91 L.Ed. 973</a> (1947). The Court did say that “[t]he grant of authority to an officer of a union to negotiate agreements with employers ... may well be sufficient to make the union liable.” <em><a href="/us/330/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="330 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="353686" data-case-paths="/us/330/0395-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/330/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="330 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="353686" data-case-paths="/us/330/0395-01">at 410</a>, <a href="/us/330/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="330 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="353686" data-case-paths="/us/330/0395-01">67 S.Ct. at 783</a>. The illegal act for which the union was sought to be held criminally liable in that case, however, was entering into a contract that violated the Sherman Act. If the purpose of the more stringent proof required by the act is to protect “unions as entities from adverse consequences arising from acts in which they did not participate,” Majority Opinion at 11, there is nothing unusual in finding union participation in an antitrust violation where its representative, with authority to enter a contract, entered a contract that was in fact illegal. “[T]he particular act charged, or acts generally of that type and quality, had been expressly authorized, or <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>necessarily followed from a granted authority.” <em><a href="/us/330/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="330 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="353686" data-case-paths="/us/330/0395-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/330/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="330 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="353686" data-case-paths="/us/330/0395-01">at 406-07</a>, <a href="/us/330/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="330 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="353686" data-case-paths="/us/330/0395-01">67 S.Ct. at 781</a>.
