He graduated from Cheltenham High School, where he was editor-in-chief of the school newspaper. Respondent then attended Dartmouth College, where he was vice-president of his class and managed the campus radio station. While at Dartmouth Respondent won a fellowship which enabled him to work for academic credit at the National Labor Relations Board in Washington, D.C. Respondent graduated from Dartmouth with high honors in 1963 and subsequently entered the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he was an editor of its Law Review, wrote several articles on labor law, and assisted a professor in writing a labor law treatise. He graduated from law school cum laude in 1966 and was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar in November of that year.</p>

At Blank, Rome, Respondent supervised several other attorneys in the labor section. He also chaired the Philadelphia Bar Association’s Labor Law Committee during the mid-1970’s.</p>

One of the largest of those clients was the Frankford Quaker Grocery Company (“Frankford Quaker”), which served a local supermarket chain. In 1980 Frankford Quaker experienced fi<a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>nancial difficulties due to a shrinkage in volume and sought the cooperation of Local 500 of the Teamsters Union, which represented Frankford Quaker’s employees, with regard to work assignments. Officers of Frankford Quaker asked respondent to deliver Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) to William O’Farrell, President of Local 500, in the hope that O’Farrell would not oppose the requested assistance. Respondent initially refused to deliver the money but eventually acceded to his client’s demands when Frankford Quaker threatened to retain other counsel. Respondent met with O’Farrell on two occasions, successfully delivering the Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) on the second occasion.</p>

In early 1982 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) began investigating bribes allegedly extorted by O’Farrell. Respondent met with two Assistant United States Attorneys and an FBI agent in or about January, 1983.

Re<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>spondent emphasizes his outstanding success as a labor attorney and his otherwise unblemished disciplinary record. He also points to his contrition and his cooperation with federal law enforcement officials. In addition, Respondent stresses his active participation in professional, community and religious programs in the Philadelphia area. Finally, Respondent details the economic hardship, loss of social and professional standing and strain on his health and family life he has endured in the wake of his own misbehavior. We find that these factors do not offset the seriousness of Respondent’s disciplinary violations or support his contention that he remains fit to practice law. As to Respondent’s much emphasized cooperation with the federal authorities, the record reflects that he made his admissions only after being confronted by federal law enforcement officials aware of his misconduct. Cooperation at that point was clearly in his own self-interest. The same is, of course, true with respect to the subsequent disciplinary proceedings. We also note that the stipulations into which Respondent entered, while admitting misconduct, were hardly a model of candor, and attempt to paint as favorable a picture as possible under the circumstances. Respondent’s involvement in professional, civic and religious activities, while laudable, is not relevant to our basic inquiry, Respondent’s fitness to practice law in this Commonwealth. Moreover, without denigrating Respondent’s extracurricular endeavors, we note that such activities are widely employed as a means of professional advancement. Finally, as to the disastrous personal consequences of Respondent’s well-publicized misconduct, we must conclude that pleas for sympathy must not obscure this Court’s responsibility to protect the public from unscrupulous lawyers. Respondent’s downfall is entirely of his own making and, being the product of a deliberate decision to violate the law, is well-deserved.</p>
