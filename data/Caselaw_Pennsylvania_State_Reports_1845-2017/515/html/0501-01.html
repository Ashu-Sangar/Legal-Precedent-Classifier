The issue of the extent of permissible public access to such affidavits arose following the arrest of Timothy S. Fenstermaker, Edward Grey, and Brent A. Smith, all of whom were arrested pursuant to warrants issued by a magistrate in connection with charges of homicide, rape, indecent assault, conspiracy, and underage drinking. The arrest warrants were issued on the basis of affidavits of probable cause executed by a police detective.</p>

Specifically, the Court of Common Pleas held that a magistrate must permit inspection of affidavits of probable cause unless there has been filed by the District Attorney or defense counsel a certified statement setting forth reasons that public inspection should not be allowed. Such asserted reasons might include claims that prejudice to the defendant or to other persons would result from public dissemination of the document. The Court of Common Pleas further held that, in the event that the requisite certified statement has been filed by the District Attorney or defense counsel, the magistrate shall seal the affidavit of <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>probable cause from public inspection, and that any interested person may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas for a hearing and determination as to whether, under the circumstances of a given case, rights of public access outweigh the rights of the defendant or other individuals threatened by public disclosure. In making that determination, the Court of Common Pleas noted, the affidavit can remain sealed only if other reasonable means are unavailable to protect the interests threatened by disclosure, and, if the prejudicial or damaging information has by then become public, or if the danger of prejudice has since passed, the continued sealing of the document would be unwarranted. The Court of Common Pleas further noted that, if disclosure would result in pretrial publicity, it cannot be assumed that such publicity would automatically render a fair trial impossible.</p>

The Superior Court held that the lower court’s decision represented an appropriate accommodation of the respective rights of defendants under the fair trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment and the rights of the public to gain access to information under the First Amendment. The instant appeal ensued.</p>
    <p id="b691-5" data-blocks='[["BL_691.5",691,[266,1602,1135,628]]]'>It is to be noted at the outset that there has been no assertion in the instant case that arrest warrant affidavits should be open to public inspection prior to an actual arrest having been made. The issue presented, therefore, concerns only access to affidavits supporting arrest warrants that have already been executed. The Commonwealth contends that affidavits of probable cause for arrest frequently contain information that could be prejudicial to a defendant’s right to a fair trial, and, thus, that all such affidavits should be closed to public inspection until such time as the guilt determining process has been completed. We do not agree.</p>

In addition to the policy considerations discussed supra which favor regarding such affidavits as accessible to the public, it is significant to note that arrest warrant affidavits are “filed” to become a part of the permanent record of the case, and, as filed documents, their “public” character is enhanced. Under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, the “filing” of arrest warrant affidavits is clearly contemplated, for Pa.R.Crim.P. 101 A(a) provides, “The District Attorney of any county may require that criminal complaints, <em>arrest warrant affidavits, </em>or both <em>filed </em>in the county by police officers, as defined in these rules, have the approval of an attorney for the Commonwealth prior to <em>filing.” </em>(Emphasis added). Further, Pa.R. Crim.P. 146 provides that, when a defendant is held for court by an issuing authority, the issuing authority shall transmit to the proper court a number of items including the original complaint, the summons or the <em>warrant of arrest </em>and its return, and “all affidavits <em>filed </em>in the proceeding____” (Emphasis added). Additional basis for the conclusion that arrest warrant affidavits are writings filed as part of the permanent public record of a case can be discerned from the fact that, at any hearing on a motion challenging an arrest warrant, no evidence is admissible to establish probable cause other than the affidavits sworn to before the issuing authority. Pa.R.Crim.P. 119. Based upon these considerations, the affidavits in question cannot <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>be regarded as private documents, but rather must be taken to be part of the official public case record.

In this manner, the possibility will be diminished that, after an arrest has been made, the public will go to the magistrate’s office and inspect the affidavits before a realistic opportunity to obtain a court order sealing the documents has been afforded. That possibility, however, is of rather minor concern, for the majority of arrests do not attract sufficient public attention as to invite public inquiry into the affidavits, and, further, the common law right of the public to inspect such documents must not be required in every case to yield as a result of the fact that there are a small number of cases where sealing of the affidavits may be warranted.
