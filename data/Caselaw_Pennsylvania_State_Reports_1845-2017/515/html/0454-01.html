While driving through this area, Munson observed a person carrying a package from one of the storage facilities to a parked car. Based on seventeen years of experience as a drug enforcement officer, Munson believed that the package he saw was a bale of marijuana. Shortly after this person put the package into the car, another person appeared from the same corridor of storage lockers, looked furtively in the officer’s direction, and walked to the car carrying a similar package. The two then drove away. Munson identified the building as Building 4.</p>

Upon checking Rent-A-Space records to identify the lessee of locker number 47, Gahagan found that one Dwight Johnston had signed the lease. Gahagan recognized Johnston as a person who had been arrested twice before on narcotics violations. Gahagan also talked with Agent Munson, who had originally seen the men carrying the suspected bales of marijuana, and Munson repeated what he had seen the day before. Agent Gahagan then composed an affidavit in support of a request for a search warrant, and a warrant was issued.

In <em>Place, </em>the Court held that there was no search at all. The consequence of this holding, of course, is that police use of narcotics detection dogs in the context of <em>Place </em>facts need not be justified or explained under the Fourth Amendment.</p>
    <p id="b650-6" data-blocks='[["BL_650.5",650,[276,1167,1137,1175]]]'>We believe that the present case lacks the exigencies which were so important in <em>Terry, </em>and for that reason, the determination of whether there was a search cannot be made by balancing the privacy interests of the individual against the law enforcement objectives of government, and in this we disagree with the majority’s analysis in <em>Place. </em>As Mr. Justice Brennan puts it, the balance has already been struck by the Fourth Amendment itself. The issue under Pennsylvania law, then, and contrary to <em>Place, </em>is not whether a search occurred, for it is our view that it did, but whether the search that occurred should implicate the usual warrant requirements characteristic of police searches of private areas. This question necessarily involves a balancing analysis. Thus, while we are unwilling to balance the privacy expectations of the individual against the law enforcement interests of government for the purpose of determining whether there was a search, we find the balancing inquiry appropriate to determine whether this particular kind of search in these circumstances necessarily implicates the fullblown warrant requirements of most other police searches. Professor LaFave puts the question this way:</p>
    <blockquote id="b651-3" data-blocks='[["BL_651.3",651,[264,306,1095,1379]]]'>
      <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>If the issue is framed in terms of whether a totally unrestrained use of such dogs in a dragnet fashion would be tolerable in a free society, one’s answer might likely be no. If so, then under the test earlier suggested as appropriate under <em>Katz, </em>such use of trained dogs to detect concealed contraband should be held to constitute a Fourth Amendment search. Yet it is clear that this particular surveillance technique amounts to a relatively minor intrusion upon privacy, much less than is involved, say, in the physical entry and ransacking of a house in an effort to find a quantity of narcotics. Because this is so, and because the use of trained dogs is a valuable surveillance technique which would be considerably hampered if it could be utilized only upon full probable cause and with search warrant in hand, from this perspective the push is in the direction of a holding that the use of trained dogs to detect concealed contraband is not a search. This quite obviously leads to the question of whether there is some Fourth Amendment middle ground, that is, whether it is possible to subject this law enforcement practice to <em>some </em>restraints so as to ensure that it is not used in a dragnet fashion or in a random or unprincipled fashion, but yet not destroy its effectiveness by imposing <em>all </em>the limitations which are applicable to other, more traditional kinds of searches that are much more threatening to privacy and security.</blockquote>

Initially, police suspicion was aroused when DEA Agent Munson observed a person emerge from Storage Building Four carrying a parcel which Agent Munson, based on seventeen years of experience, believed to be a bale of marijuana. He explained that he could identify the parcel as suspected marijuana because of its size and shape. Bales of marijuana frequently are prepared in foreign countries using trash compactors, which produce bales of marijuana of the same approximate size and shape as the one appellant carried from his storage room.</p>

We are not called upon to decide in this case whether the same rules we have established today apply to a canine search of a person instead of a place; and we note also that should it become apparent that canine sniff searches are not reliable, either in a particular case or in general, the rationale of this Opinion would become invalid, for then the sniff search would become as intrusive as any other search.</p>

On the other hand if one cannot contain the odor of their business from seeping into the public domain they have betrayed their secret. If the odor proves the nature of the substance, and that substance is illegal contraband there is probable cause for a warrant. If the smeller, whether it is an experienced man, machine, trained dog, pig, or canary, can say upon training or experience that such an odor emanates from an illegal substance the warrant should issue. The other considerations are entertaining concepts for a world where people cannot die from what they smell.</p>

I agree with the majority of the United States Supreme Court that such a sniff is “so limited both in the manner in which the information is obtained and the content of the information revealed ...” that it does not constitute a search for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v.
