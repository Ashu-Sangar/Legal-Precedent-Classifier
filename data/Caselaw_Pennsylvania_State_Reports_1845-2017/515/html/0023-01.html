    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[272,532,1136,889]]]'>The sick leave proposal, Article XII, makes clear that sick leave is available when needed and “shall not be a ‘right of taking’ as a vacation.” Since sick leave may be taken only when an employee is ill, an occurrence which neither the employer nor the employee can control, the court’s supervisory power would not be affected. Sections 4 and 5 of Article XII, however, would slightly affect that power. Section 4 provides that the employer is to notify his immediate supervisor as soon as possible that he will be on sick leave. While this procedure is hardly unusual, it is ultimately for the court to determine the appropriate person to be so notified. Similarly, section 5, which specifies when a doctor’s certification may be required, establishes a policy which should be made by the court in the first instance. In accordance with the procedure outlined in <em>County of Lehigh, supra, </em>the County may bargain over those provisions only after consultation with the court.</p>

While the court should permit the use of funeral leave where feasible, the possibility exists that the bereaved employee’s absence could adversely impact upon the administration of justice. In such a situation an alternative method of compensation would be appropriate. Thus, while funeral leave is a permissible subject of collective bargaining, the decision as to when and under what circumstances it may be taken must be left to the court. The county commissioners must therefore consult with the court as to this aspect of the funeral leave provision.</p>
