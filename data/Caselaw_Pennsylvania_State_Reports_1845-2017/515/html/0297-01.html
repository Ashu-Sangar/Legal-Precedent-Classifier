In <em>City of Washington, supra, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found no constitutional right to an appeal from binding arbitration under the same statute in a dispute between a political subdivision of the Commonwealth and police and fire department employees. Nevertheless, the Court granted judicial review within the following parameters:</p>
    <blockquote id="b490-5" data-blocks='[["BL_490.4",490,[316,682,1093,364]]]'>If an appeal is prohibited by an Act, or the decision of the Agency is stated to be final or conclusive, the law is well settled that an appeal will lie to the Courts in the nature of a narrow certiorari and this Court will review only (1) the question of jurisdiction; (2) the regularity of the proceedings before the Agency; (3) <em>questions of excess in exercise of powers; </em>and (4) constitutional questions.</blockquote>
