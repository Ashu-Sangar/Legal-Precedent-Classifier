As an answer to Question 11 on the Statement, concerning gifts, Judge Glancey inserted the following: “Response respectfully declined at this time on grounds of constitutional privilege.” Another judicial officer, the Honorable John J. Chiovero, also filed a Statement on May 1, 1986, for 1985. Judge Chiovero responded to Question 11 by stating: “On advice of counsel, this answer is not provided at this time in reliance upon the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.” Although the two judges varied in formulating their reasons for not providing the required information, it is clear that each was asserting that he did not have to answer <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>based on the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</p>

The Respondents also asserted that to penalize them for their replies to Question 11 of the Statement amounted to a violation of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, guaranteed by the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution and made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment. The Board, with the concurrence of both judges, consolidated the cases because of the identity of the issues raised.</p>

The Respondents renewed their argument that the fifth amendment of the federal constitution barred the imposition of any penalty for not providing the information about the receipt of gifts. They also challenged the validity of Question 11 itself, by asserting that its inquiry does not relate to activity of a judge in his judicial capacity or in the conduct of his office. Following receipt of the report of the Hearing Panel, the Board prepared its Report and Recommendation, which it proceeded to file with this Court.</p>
    <p id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.5",393,[276,1054,1139,625]]]'>The Board found that the Respondents had knowingly and willfully failed to answer Question 11. The Board also concluded that such failure constituted misconduct, and amounted to violations of Article 5, section 17(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution; Canons 1 and 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct; and 42 Pa.C.S. § 3302. The Board reached the further conclusion that the Respondents’ failure to answer the inquiry in issue “impugned the integrity of the judiciary and the judicial system, and reduced the public’s confidence in the judiciary.” The Board’s recommendation to this Court was that the Respondents should be removed from their judicial offices.</p>
    <p id="b393-6" data-blocks='[["BL_393.6",393,[278,1698,1137,413]]]'>A curious feature of the Board’s Report is that, while finding that the Judges Glancey and Chiovero were guilty of misconduct and the other violations, the Board also concluded that the replies given by the two judges to Question 11 were a proper exercise of the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. However, in the view of the Board, the propriety of those replies did not preclude the imposition of sanctions.</p>

They also argue that the recommendation of removal violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. Underlying this argument is a contention that no pre-existing statutory provision, canon of conduct or rule of this Court warned them that invoking the fifth amendment privilege would expose them to sanctions. Another due process infirmity envisioned by the Respondents is that to deprive them of their judicial offices, for not having answered Question 11, amounts to burdening their right to hold office with a condition or qualification not found in Article 5 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In amplification of this argument, the Respondents further assert that the state constitution at no place requires the relinquishment of constitutional rights and privileges as a condition of holding public office; and that if it did, such a requirement would offend against the federal constitution.</p>

Among the several provisions of this statute is a requirement that all officials of the Commonwealth and its subdivisions make certain disclosures concerning their personal financial affairs.

Indeed, the statement of policy, purpose, and philosophy set forth in the Commentary to Canon 2 of the Code, <em>supra, </em>is essentially the same as the declaration of purpose underlying the Ethics Act.

In <em>Garrity </em>certain police officers were summoned to an inquiry conducted by the state Attorney General concerning the fixing of traffic tickets. Although the policemen were warned that their answers to questions could be used against them in any criminal proceeding, they were also warned that if they did not answer they would be fired from their jobs. Given that hard choice, the policemen answered the inquiries. Their answers were later used, over objection, as evidence to convict them of criminal conspiracy. The Supreme Court reversed the convictions on the ground that the prior statements should not have been admitted, because they were the result of governmental compulsion. As in <em>Spevack, </em>the coercive element was found in the choice given to the person questioned: answer or lose your livelihood. <em>Garrity v. New Jersey </em>is much relied upon by the instant Respondents. However, it is <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>important to note that the issue addressed by the Court in <em>Garrity </em>was not the right of the government to elicit the information from the employees, but rather the government's right to use the elicited statements in a subsequent prosecution for a crime. In that regard, the Court said: “We agree ... that the forfeiture-of-office statute is relevant here <em>only </em>for the bearing it has on the voluntary character of the statements used to convict petitioners hn their criminal prosecutions.” 385 U.S. at 496, 87 S.Ct. at 618 (emphasis added). Thus, the import which <em>Garrity </em>gives the fifth amendment privilege is that information which a government employee is compelled to give in order to save his job cannot be used as evidence against him to secure his conviction of a crime.</p>

This case involved a New York City police officer who was summoned before a grand jury to testify about the performance of his duties. The grand jury was investigating allegations of police corruption. The policeman was advised of his privilege against self-incrimination but was also told that, under New York law, if he did not waive the constitutional privilege and the immunity from prosecution, he would be fired. The policeman refused to execute such a waiver, and was discharged for that reason. The Court held the dismissal to be unconstitutional, deciding that a public employee could not be discharged for failing to enter into a waiver of his fifth amendment privilege. It is important to note that what the employee in <em>Gardner </em>was asked to do, as a condition for keeping his job, was not simply to give information relating to his work but also to relinquish the protection of the fifth amendment with respect to any subsequent criminal prosecution that could result from the information he provided. The effect of the <em>Gardner </em>decision is that a public employee cannot be deprived of his position for not yielding to a joint demand that he both <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>cooperate in an inquiry and, at the same time, prospectively waive the fifth amendment privilege in any criminal prosecution that may result from his disclosures.</p>

Further delineating the difference between a public officer of the law and an attorney, the Court observed that an attorney is directly responsible to his client but the policeman is “either responsible to the State or to no one.” <em>Id. </em>at 278, 88 S.Ct. at 1916. With respect to the case at bar, it might be argued, in the abstract, that elected judges are responsible to the voters and not “the State.” However, when consideration is given to the great length of time between the elections of judges, it must be said as a practical matter that the government itself is the only force that can hold judges to their responsibilities in the interim. The Supreme Court’s opinion in <em>Gardner </em>recognized that government has a valid interest in eliciting information from public employees <em>concerning the performance of their public duties. </em>In formulating an adjustment of this interest with the values of the fifth amendment privilege, the Court stated:</p>

Each of these cases involved a New York statute which the United States Supreme Court declared to be violative of the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Under the statute in <em>Turley, </em>any person with a public contract was barred from asserting the constitutional privilege in any proceeding in which he was called to <em>testify </em>about his contracts or transactions with the state or its political subdivisions. The statute further mandated that, should the privilege be asserted, any existing public contract which the person had would be cancelled and he would be disqualified from obtaining future contracts. In other words, the right of a person to obtain a public contract was conditioned upon an outright waiver of the fifth amendment protection should he be called to testify about his dealings with governmental units. The petitioners in <em>Turley </em>were two architects whose right to seek public contracts was nullified when they asserted the fifth amendment before a grand jury investigating various charges of bribery, conspiracy, and larceny. In its review of the statute, the Court found compulsion in the obvious fact that a person had to either enter into a broad waiver of his constitutional right or be deprived of economic opportunity. In declaring the statute unconstitutional, the Supreme Court held that although a state may require public contractors to respond to inquiries, it may not insist that they also waive the fifth amendment privilege and consent to the use of the fruits of the inquiry in later proceedings against them.</p>

There, the Supreme Court held to be unconstitutional the dismissal of a professor at a New York City college for his assertion of the fifth amendment when asked, in a <em>congressional inquiry, </em>about his past activities with the Communist Party. The .dismissal was based on the same provision of the New York City Charter, at issue in some of the other cases, requiring the discharge of a city employee who utilized the fifth amendment to avoid answering questions pertaining to his official conduct. In reaching its decision the Court reasoned that the professor’s city employer had impermissibly used the assertion of the privilege as a basis for inferring guilt. Moreover, the Court found it significant that the inquiry in which the professor asserted the privilege was <em>not </em>one seeking to elicit information relevant to the qualifications of the employee. <a href="/us/350/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="350 U.S. 551" data-case-ids="12034225" data-case-paths="/us/350/0551-01">350 U.S. at 558</a>, <a href="/us/350/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="350 U.S. 551" data-case-ids="12034225" data-case-paths="/us/350/0551-01">76 S.Ct. at 641</a>.

It is also true that, pursuant to Article 5, section 18 of our state constitution, misconduct is grounds for removing a judicial officer from office. However, it is important to note that Order No. 47, while making it mandatory for a judicial officer to provide information, does not at the same time require him, or her, to waive the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination in any future criminal proceeding that might be based on the disclosures made. Thus, although compliance with the reporting requirement is compulsory in the sense that one’s right to hold judicial office is conditioned upon it, there is not present the demand for a total relinquishment of fifth amendment rights which was the constitutional defect in cases such as <em>Gardner v.

In view of the fact that the instant Respondents may not have been given sufficient advance warning that their conduct would be noncompliant, we consider it just and proper that they be given thirty (30) days to provide the required information.</p>
