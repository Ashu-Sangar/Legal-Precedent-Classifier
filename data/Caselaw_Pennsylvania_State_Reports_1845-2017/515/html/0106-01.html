It is readily foreseeable that the unlawful sale of beer to a single minor carries with it substantial risk that the beer will reach and affect others in the same age group and these concerns were addressed by the drafters of the Liquor Code.

The common usage of “customer” describes one who is a buyer, purchaser, or patron. “Requisite legal capacity” has been grafted onto the plain meaning of the term by the majority. The flaw in this interpretation is demonstrated by following the majority’s own analysis. The majority first states that licensees have absolute immunity from liability in instances where the licensee has taken good faith efforts to verify a prospective customer’s age pursuant to 47 P.S. § 4-495(e). The majority then holds that a licensee is liable to third parties for injuries sustained as a result of the service of alcohol to a minor and that § 4-497 is inapplicable because a minor is not a “legal” customer. Finally, the majority states that its holding is not intended to affect the statutory immunity contained in 47 P.S. § 4-495(e).
