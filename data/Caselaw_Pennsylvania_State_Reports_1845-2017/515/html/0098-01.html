    <p id="b286-11" data-blocks='[["BL_286.8",286,[253,1047,1141,1001]]]'>On August 24, 1984, after a trial by jury, appellant Anselmo C. Gonzalez was acquitted of murder and voluntary manslaughter, but found guilty of possessing an instrument of crime. These charges arose out of the shooting death of Juan Martinez, a member of a Philadelphia street gang. Post-trial motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial were denied and, on September 26, 1984, appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one to three years. Appellant’s motion to modify sentence was denied on October 5, 1984.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> On direct appeal in Superior Court appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction, and asserted error in the trial court’s refusal to grant his motion for a mistrial after the prosecutor questioned appellant concerning an uncharged offense.

    <p id="b287-5" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[269,528,1138,784]]]'>The record in this case reveals the following facts. Appellant owned a small variety store in a high crime area of Philadelphia. On March 19, 1984, appellant was working in his store: his wife and ten year old daughter were also present. (The family lived in an apartment above the store.) Juan Martinez and another member of a gang called the Outlaws entered the store and threatened to steal a radio from a customer, Timmy. Appellant forced the gang members out of his store saying, “Don’t come around here messing with my customers. I’m going to kill somebody.” When Timmy left the store a few minutes later, the gang, now numbering at least 8 or 9, chased Timmy in an attempt to again steal the radio. According to appellant, Juan Martinez, before joining in the chase, threatened appellant, “I’m coming back for you.”</p>
    <p id="b287-6" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[270,1331,1137,307]]]'>Martinez returned five minutes later with 15 to 20 members of his gang and approached appellant’s store. Appellant, in the doorway of his store, shot and killed Martinez with a sawed-off shotgun. According to Commonwealth witnesses, Martinez was unarmed and was not threatening appellant when the shot was fired.</p>
    <p id="b287-7" data-blocks='[["BL_287.6",287,[269,1657,1136,510]]]'>Appellant, on the other hand, testified that Martinez told him, “I’m going to shoot your butt.” Martinez then reached into his jacket and began to draw a black, shiny object. Appellant knew Martinez often carried a gun, and had seen the gun on several occasions. Appellant also had seen Martinez and his gang carry knives and rob people in and around the store. Appellant testified that he shot Martinez out of fear for his own and his family’s safety. No gun was found on Martinez when the police arrived at the scene.</p>

    <p id="b288-9" data-blocks='[["BL_288.6",288,[272,968,1137,940]]]'>Appellant urges that our holding in <em>Commonwealth v. Watson, </em><a href="/pa/494/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="494 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1769170" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0467-01">494 Pa. 467</a>, <a href="/pa/494/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="494 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1769170" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0467-01">431 A.2d 949</a> (1981), controls this case. The appellant in <em>Watson </em>shot and killed her husband during a struggle and was convicted of both voluntary manslaughter and carrying a concealed weapon. We held that insufficient evidence had been presented at trial to disprove self-defense and reversed the voluntary manslaughter conviction. We further held that the conviction for carrying a concealed weapon must also be reversed due to insufficient evidence to establish criminal intent in possessing the gun used in the killing. No crime had been committed with the gun, and there was no other evidence presented to support a finding of criminal intent. <em><a href="/pa/494/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="494 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1769170" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0467-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/494/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="494 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1769170" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0467-01">494 Pa. at 475</a>, <a href="/pa/494/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="494 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1769170" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0467-01">431 A.2d at 953</a>. In the instant case, the same analysis applies. Appellant did not commit a crime with the shotgun. Thus, the jury could not infer from the killing of Martinez that appellant possessed intent to employ the shotgun criminally.</p>
    <p id="b288-10" data-blocks='[["BL_288.7",288,[271,1931,1137,411]],["BL_289.1",289,[243,299,1138,874]]]'>The Commonwealth, however, asserts that the jury could have inferred criminal intent from appellant’s statement during the initial altercation with Martinez, “Don’t come around here messing with my customers. I’m going to kill somebody.” We disagree with the Commonwealth’s assertion because, when viewed in the context in which it was made, appellant’s statement at best presents equivocal evidence of intent. First, appellant did not wield the shot<a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>gun when he made the statement. In fact, appellant did not make use of the shotgun until the second altercation which began when Martinez and the gang returned from their unsuccessful attempt to rob Timmy. Second, the Commonwealth’s own witnesses confirmed that appellant was attempting to protect Timmy from being robbed when the statement was made (Notes of Testimony at 1.9), and the statement itself evidences appellant’s concern for Timmy’s safety. Third, the neighborhood in which the shooting occurred is a high crime area where robberies, like the attempted robbery of Timmy in this case, occur in broad daylight in front of appellant’s store. Possession of a weapon for protection in such a setting is reasonable. Finally, appellant’s statement is consistent with an expression of his preparedness to kill <em>in self defense </em>(which is what the jury determined he did in this case); an interpretation at least as plausible as that advanced by the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[244,1190,1137,198]]]'>Appellant’s statement is not, of itself, sufficient to support a finding of criminal intent, since any jury interpretation of what appellant actually intended by the statement would be no better than guesswork.</p>
    <p id="b289-6" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[244,1406,1136,251]]]'>Therefore, since appellant did not commit a crime with the shotgun, and no other evidence sufficient to support a finding of criminal intent was presented at trial, appellant’s conviction for possessing an instrument of crime must be reversed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The jury, however, resolved this issue in favor of appellant and acquitted him of homicide. Nevertheless, it is clear that the jury did not consider appellant to be wholly blameless, effectively recognizing that appellant’s action in confronting a group of teenagers on a public sidewalk, with a loaded shotgun in hand, contributed to the escalating tensions which led to the victim’s death. Hence, there is no question in my mind that the verdict in this case was a compromise, and should be allowed to stand.</p>
