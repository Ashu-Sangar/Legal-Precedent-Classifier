A threshold issue here is whether Common Pleas had jurisdiction to modify support orders which were on appeal to allow credit for the custodial distributions. Since the modification involved the <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>issue on appeal, we hold it did not.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> On the merits,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a> we hold that a parent’s obligation to support minor children is independent of the minor’s assets. UGMA funds may not be used to fulfill the parent’s support obligation where the parent has sufficient means to discharge it himself. Upon determining that the parent has sufficient funds to reasonably support the minor without seriously depriving himself or other persons to whom he has a similar obligation, the court should not thereafter consider the minor’s funds in setting the support obligation. This is not to say that a custodian cannot, as a fiduciary, exercise his statutory discretion in certain circumstances to distribute custodial funds for a minor’s support in addition to those due from the parent. However, where the parent is also custodian, his dual obligation comes into conflict. In such case, he may not credit his custodial distribution against his support obligation. In the event of a dispute over the extent of his parental obligation, the parent custodian is removable at Common Pleas’ discretion on petition by or on behalf of the child.</p>

This was improper; the court lacked jurisdiction because those questions were pending above.

When he can “reasonably” do so, the father is obliged to provide support for his minor children regardless of the UGMA property. <em>Conway, supra. </em>Whether it is reasonable to require a father to supply all or part of the support his children require without regard to their own means is a threshold question. It involves balancing the parent’s income, assets, earning power and needs against the children’s needs. If the court determines that the parent can reasonably provide for their needs at an appropriate level, that obligation is paramount and the children’s means should not be considered. The inquiry should thereafter deal only with the children’s reasonable requirements, with a possible exception for children seeking higher education. <em>See </em>op. at 405-408, <em>infra. </em>If, however, the parent’s assets are not adequate, the court should state, on the record, both the children’s total needs and the parent’s reasonable contribution.

We also believe that these facts present a conflict of interest which would require the custodians’ removal.

This would be akin to removing the parent’s support obligation to the extent the children have assets and is contrary to law. <em>See </em>op. at 402, <em>supra, </em>and cases cited therein. Child support is a parent’s personal obligation and must be paid by him. If the parties cannot agree, the court must determine the amount which the parent should pay from his own assets. Any additional sums required for support in excess of the support order can be paid by the UGMA custodian. Where the parent lacks the means to fully meet his children’s needs, the court may specify the excess sum needed and order the custodian to pay it as a minimum. Otherwise, additional payment should be left to the custodian’s good faith discretion. If the court fails to do so, an uncertain custodian may ask the court to specify a minimum sum to be paid from custodial assets.
