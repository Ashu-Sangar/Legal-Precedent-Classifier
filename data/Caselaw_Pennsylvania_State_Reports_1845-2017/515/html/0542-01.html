In 1978 Ridley Arms brought an action in equity challenging the constitutionality of the Ridley Township Refuse Collection Ordinance. The relief sought was that the court enjoin Ridley Township from collecting any fees from Ridley Arms pursuant to its refuse collection ordinance and that the court order the refund of moneys paid to the township for refuse collection which was never performed. The Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance, but ordered a partial refund of moneys paid to the township. The court reasoned that although the taxpayer had not met its burden of establishing that the classifications were not reasonably related to the purpose of the statute, since this case involved a charge for services rendered, and since the taxpayer never received the service, the taxpayer was entitled to a refund of taxes in the amount of moneys it paid to a private hauler for removing its refuse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The parties cross-appealed to Commonwealth Court, 90 Pa.Cmwlth. 148, <a href="/citations/?q=494%20A.2d%20870" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="494 A.2d 870">494 A.2d 870</a>, which affirmed that part of the chancellor’s decree upholding the constitutionality of the statute and reversed that part of the decree requiring repayment.

Instead, Ridley Arms has contracted with a private refuse hauler to remove refuse from the complex three times a week from five dumpsters each having a capacity of six cubic yards, provided at no cost by the private contractor. Between 1977 and 1981 Ridley Arms paid this private contractor $22,929.00 for its services, and it also paid the Township of Ridley $58,156.67<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> in fees pursuant to the refuse collection ordinance.

Facially, the classification is reasonable with respect to its purpose in that it provides a refuse collection service, presumably to promote public health and safety, for those least able to bargain for favorable private rates (individual homeowners), while excluding those who might overburden the system (commercial establishments) were they included. Actually, however, Ridley Arms has established in the proceedings below that the township collects refuse from 205 commercial establishments who are exempt from the refuse ordinance and charges them the rate paid by homeowners.</p>

However, if having this purpose, the township then proceeded to collect refuse from the same properties it sought to avoid, the relationship between the classification and the purpose is at least suspect.</p>

Ridley Arms also established at trial that although apartments in Ridley Township pay refuse fees equivalent to 18.9% of the revenue received each year from these fees, the costs of collecting refuse from apartments was between 5% and 9.5% of revenue. Moreover, the chancellor found as a fact that the township conceded that its actual cost per unit in 1981 for collecting refuse from apartment complexes ranged from $19.99 to 30.00. The refuse collection fee charged residential units in 1981, including apartments, was $70.00 per unit. <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>Thus, by either calculation, and allowing the higher costs to the township, the township collected twice as much from apartments as it cost to collect from apartments.</p>

In reversing the Commonwealth Court’s decision, the majority has interpreted the Ridley Township Refuse Collection Ordinance (“Ordinance”) in an illogical manner. They have also unnecessarily decided a constitutional question rather than merely considering whether the Ordinance was unreasonable under 53 P.S. § 56527.</p>
    <p id="b737-13" data-blocks='[["BL_737.14",737,[219,1613,1135,568]]]'>In deciding whether the amounts charged by the Township to Ridley Arms were excessive, and thus, that the Ordinance was unreasonable under the First Class Township Code, 53 P.S. § 56527, there was no reason for the majority to analyze the Ordinance’s constitutionality. “It is well settled that when a case raises both constitutional and non-constitutional issues, a court should not reach the constitutional issue if the case can properly be decided on non-constitutional grounds.” <em>Ballou v. State Ethics Commission, </em><a href="/pa/496/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="496 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1772873" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0127-01">496 Pa. 127</a>, 129, <a href="/pa/496/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="496 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1772873" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0127-01">436 A.2d 186</a>, 187 (1981) (footnote omitted).</p>

The majority’s analysis of “reason<a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>able fees and charges”, comparing only the payments made by Ridley Arms to the Township for the services and the payments made by Ridley Arms to the independent refuse collector, is too simplistic. Instead, a determination of whether a rate is unreasonable requires a comparison of the total costs to the Township of providing refuse collection to its residents, and the total fees taxed to the residents for such services.</p>
    <p id="b738-4" data-blocks='[["BL_738.4",738,[297,750,1134,610]]]'>The heavy burden of showing that this tax was unreasonable rested on Ridley Arms. <em>See, Amidon v. Kane, </em><a href="/pa/444/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="444 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="1938612" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0038-01">444 Pa. 38</a>, 51, <a href="/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%2053" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="279 A.2d 53">279 A.2d 53</a>, 60 (1971). To show this, Ridley Arms presented the testimony of the building owner and of an expert, a sanitary engineer. A review of this testimony indicates that the expert testified to a great extent about the sanitary implications of the Township’s refuse collection, but testified very little about the costs. The testimony concerning costs by the expert consisted mainly of his bald conclusion that the Township’s charges were unreasonable, and his opinion that its method of determining the price of refuse collection services was not equitable.</p>
    <p id="b738-5" data-blocks='[["BL_738.5",738,[297,1378,1134,455]]]'>On this record, all that has been shown by Ridley Arms is that it cost more to pay the Township for refuse collection than to pay a private collector. To say that the tax is unreasonable solely for this reason is naive, for the Township, as a government, has other considerations associated with providing services that a private entrepreneur does not have — such as costs associated with bidding requirements and providing service to the entire community at a reasonable price.</p>
    <p id="b738-6" data-blocks='[["BL_738.6",738,[297,1849,1135,508]],["BL_739.1",739,[209,317,1135,299]]]'>Comparing costs encountered by the Township to those of a private contractor does not logically compel a finding of unreasonableness. In order to show the Township’s costs were unreasonable, Ridley Arms should have been required to show that the rates charged exceeded the Township’s costs. The record is void of such a showing and does not persuasively show that amounts charged by the Township were excessive. In fact, contrary to the tenor of the majority’s opinion, which would lead one to believe otherwise, the record in this case shows that the Township <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>suffered losses each year in providing refuse collection to the community. For example, in 1979 the Township collected revenues for refuse collection in the amount of $493,-118.00, but the cost of providing the service was $643,087.00 —a deficit of $149,969.00. R., Exhibit “H”. The deficits in other years were not as great, but significant.</p>
    <p id="b739-5" data-blocks='[["BL_739.4",739,[210,633,1134,612]]]'>Finally, the majority’s solution to this dilemma is overly broad. Under their approach, any time a taxpayer could obtain services through the private sector at a lower price than that at which the municipality provided the services, he could challenge the tax as being unreasonable and prevail. In the instant case, it would allow the homeowners who also paid the rate to mount this same challenge and be successful. The majority’s analysis would also allow a person whose child attended private school for less money than the school district taxed for public schools to challenge the tax as being unreasonable, thereby exempting himself from the tax and perhaps establishing a right to a tax refund.</p>
    <p id="b739-6" data-blocks='[["BL_739.5",739,[211,1263,1135,404]]]'>The problem of refuse disposal is a municipal problem and calls for a municipal solution. By analyzing this case in a manner dealing only with the individualized impact of taxes and costs of one building, the majority has ignored this fact and set an overly broad precedent which will seriously impede the ability of municipal corporations to provide services such as refuse collection at reasonable costs to everyone in the community.</p>
