In every one of the cases cited by the majority, the claims of ineffectiveness were dismissed at the <em>first </em>inquiry — whether counsel was ineffective.

The majority errs, however, where it attempts to interpret the Step 1 finding as being identical to the greater Step 2 burden under <em>Strickland </em>which requires an additional showing of prejudice <em>following </em>a finding of ineffectiveness under Step 1. In each case cited by the majority, the Step 2 burden was <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>never reached due to the failure to find ineffectiveness at the <em>initial </em>inquiry. It is clear, therefore, that the prejudice standard referred to by the majority as being identical to the federal test cannot be supported by citation to these cases. Indeed, under the majority’s theory, if, in any of the above cases, a defendant <em>could </em>have shown a claim of arguable merit, the ineffectiveness claim would still have been susceptible to dismissal under a “harmless error” theory (Step 2) if there had otherwise been found overwhelming evidence of that defendant’s guilt; that is, if the defendant could not show prejudice, the acknowledged error could be overlooked as harmless. I can find no support for such a theory in any case decided by this Court.</p>

This effectively allows his fundamental right to the effective assistance of counsel to be denied on the basis of an appellate court’s determination that there was overwhelming evidence of his guilt, and his claim therefore dismissed as harmless error.

First, it is often very difficult to tell whether a defendant convicted after a trial in which he was ineffectively represented would have fared better if his lawyer had been competent. Seemingly impregnable cases can sometimes be dismantled by good defense counsel. On the basis of a cold record, it may be impossible for a reviewing court confidently to ascertain how the government’s evidence and arguments would have stood up against rebuttal and cross-examination by a shrewd, well prepared lawyer. The difficulties of estimating prejudice after the fact are exacerbated by the possibility that evidence of injury to the defendant may be missing from the record precisely because of the incompetence of defense counsel, (footnote omitted) In view of all these impediments to a fair evaluation of the probability that the outcome of a trial was affected by ineffectiveness of counsel, it seems to me senseless to impose on a defendant whose lawyer has been shown to have been incompetent the burden of demonstrating prejudice.</blockquote>

While this Court has stated that federal law governs the application of harmless error to violations of the Federal Constitution, <em>see Chapman v. California, </em><a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="265" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">386 U.S. 18</a>, 21, <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="266" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">87 S.Ct. 824</a>, 826, <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="267" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">17 L.Ed.2d 705</a> (1967), that cannot mean more than that state courts <em>must </em>reverse convictions when the Constitution so mandates. When the Constitution does not mandate a particular remedy, this Court may not ‘declare which of many admittedly constitutional [remedial] alternatives a state may choose.’ <em><a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="268" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="268" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">at 48</a>, <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="269" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">87 S.Ct., at 840</a> (Harlan, J. dissenting) (footnote omitted). We have never held that the Federal Constitution forbids state courts from reversing certain convictions pursuant to state substantive or procedural law, nor can I imagine what provision of the Constitution could grant us such power. Thus, the Delaware Supreme Court remains free on remand to decide that even though it applied the substantive standards of the Sixth Amendment to determine whether error occurred, its harmless error analysis was the product of state rather than federal Law.</blockquote>

I must therefore reject outright any inference which could be drawn from the majority’s observations of the Supreme Court’s intent in <em>Van Arsdall, </em>as indicating <em>this </em>Court’s willingness to abdicate <em>any </em>of its interpretive functions where an appellate question implicates rights guaranteed under <em>our </em>state constitution.</p>

It was, in large part, <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>for this very reason, the harsh results experienced in the jurisprudential application of the presumption of guilt that prompted the migration of the Europeans to this Commonwealth over 200 years ago. The inequity of that system was that many innocent individuals suffered punishment because they could not overcome the overwhelming burden of proving themselves innocent of charges, the evidence of which was in the sole possession of the accusors. I do not choose to move one step closer to that system. I must therefore dissent from what I characterized in <em>Christy </em>to be nothing more than a move by this Court toward a “shortcut, result-oriented practice of jurisprudence.” <em>Commonwealth v.

It would have indeed been helpful to my understanding of the majority’s holding today had it set forth its analysis of how that test compares with the harmless error test this Court announced in <em>Commonwealth v. Story, </em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="273" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">476 Pa. 391</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="274" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">383 A.2d 155</a> (1978). In <em>Story, </em>we placed the burden of showing harmless error with respect to all other trial errors upon the Commonwealth, <em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="275" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="276" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">476 Pa. at 406, n. 11</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="277" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">383 A.2d at </a>162 n. 11, setting the burden of proof at the greatest possible degree, “beyond a reasonable doubt". In other words an error is to be considered harmful, and the basis for granting relief, unless the Commonwealth can establish otherwise. To my knowledge, this Court has never overruled nor modified that test by shifting the burden to the defendant to prove the negative.</p>
