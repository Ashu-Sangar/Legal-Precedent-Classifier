The mortgage created a lien against two separate parcels of real estate owned by the Fethermans. Subsequently, the Fethermans defaulted in payment of the note. Because of the default, appellee, First National Consumer Discount Company, on October 20, 1975, filed a complaint in mortgage foreclosure against Clyde and Veronica Fetherman. On December 3, 1976, a judgment in the sum of $27,600.00 was entered in the foreclosure action in favor of the appellee and against the Fethermans. On the same day a praecipe for a writ of execution as to one of the Fethermans’ parcels was filed by the appellee.</p>

The appellee was the successful bidder for the Fethermans’ parcel, purchasing the property for the bid price of $28,-500.00.</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[260,585,1136,575]]]'>Following the sale, the sheriff prepared a proposed schedule of distribution of the proceeds. When the schedule was made known, two junior judgment creditors filed exceptions to the proposed distribution. By Order of Court dated August 4, 1978, the exceptions were dismissed and the sheriff was directed to proceed with distribution as proposed. The proceeds of the sale were distributed as follows: $91.52 to Warminister Municipal Authority to pay a water and sewage obligation; $640.24 for costs; $428.00 for state realty transfer taxes; $428.00 for local realty transfer taxes; and the balance of $26,912.24 to the appellee.</p>

The appellee’s attorney responded to this request by a letter dated September 25,1978. In that letter, appellee’s counsel informed the Fethermans’ counsel that he had prepared an order to mark the judgment satisfied and was about to file it with the court. A copy of the order ready to be filed was enclosed with the letter. Several months later it came to the attention of the Fethermans that the appellee had taken no action with regard to the judgment in question. The judgment had not been marked satisfied as appellee’s counsel represented it would be. The Fethermans made at least two additional written demands on the appellee that the judgment be marked satisfied, each to no avail. The appellee’s continued failure to have the judgment marked satisfied moved the Fethermans to initiate court proceedings. The Fethermans petitioned the Bucks County Common Pleas Court to order the judgment marked satisfied pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8103, and to award them liquidated damages as prescribed by 42 Pa.C.S. § 8104.</p>

This, however, is precisely the kind of case to which the Deficiency Judgment Act was intended to apply.

Even though, under Section 8103, the judgment creditor is deemed to have been satisfied in full if he fails to petition for a deficiency judgment within six months after the sale, the Superior Court, nevertheless, would permit such creditor to defend a claim for liquidated damages under Section 8104 by urging a deficiency. This would tend to negate the purposes of the Deficiency Judgment Act, which was enacted to remedy an inequity resulting to judgment debtors when the judgment creditor bought the debtor’s property at a forced sale.

(42 Pa.C.S. § 8103(c).)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> If no petition to fix the fair market value of the property is timely brought by the creditor, the judgment in favor of the creditor is satisfied, released and discharged as a matter of law. (42 P.S.C.S. § 8103(d).) In this case, in spite of the provisions of the Deficiency Judgment Act, the Superior Court decided that the appellee’s purchase of the property at the sheriff’s sale did not satisfy appellee’s judgment for purposes of liquidated damages under Section 8104, even though that court did not have the benefit of evidence of <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>the fair market value of the real estate, and the time within which to establish fair market value had long since expired.</p>
    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.4",283,[293,426,1137,784]]]'>We hold that where a judgment creditor purchases the debtor’s real estate at a sheriff’s sale and then fails to petition to fix the fair market value of that real estate within the statutory time limitation, the judgment creditor is deemed to have received full satisfaction in kind of the underlying debt obligation. Further, at the written request of the judgment debtor and the tender of the fee for satisfaction, the judgment creditor has the duty to have the judgment marked satisfied of record. Where the judgment creditor fails to do so for more than thirty days after receiving such written notice, the judgment creditor is liable for liquidated damages pursuant to Section 8104(b). In a proceeding to recover liquidated damages, the judgment creditor will not be heard to say that he did not receive full satisfaction.</p>
    <p id="b283-6" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[294,1251,1137,789]]]'>In this case the appellee judgment creditor purchased the Fethermans’ real estate at the sheriff’s sale. The appellee did not bring a petition to fix the fair market value of the real estate within six months after the sheriff’s sale. Thus, the appellee is deemed to have been satisfied in full in kind and will not be heard to say it did not receive full satisfaction. Subsequently, the appellee received a written request to satisfy the judgment on the record. The appellee’s written response informing the Fethermans that an order to mark the judgment satisfied was being filed, waived the lack of tender of the filing fee. Thereafter, the appellee, for more than thirty days, failed to have the judgment marked satisfied. As a consequence, the appellee is liable for liquidated damages pursuant to the provision of Section 8104(b).</p>
