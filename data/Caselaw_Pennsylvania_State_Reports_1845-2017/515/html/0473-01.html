    <p id="b660-12" data-blocks='[["BL_660.11",660,[258,1478,1134,468]]]'>On April 19, 1984, in a trial by jury in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, the appellant, James R. Bryant, was found guilty of burglary, robbery, and murder of the first degree. A suspended sentence was imposed with respect to burglary, and a ten to twenty year term of imprisonment was imposed for robbery. In connection with the murder conviction, a separate sentencing hearing was held, as required by 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711, and appellant was sentenced to death. The instant direct appeal ensued.</p>
    <p id="b660-13" data-blocks='[["BL_660.12",660,[257,1966,1133,361]],["BL_661.1",661,[264,315,1134,256]]]'>The incident from which the convictions arose was one in which an elderly woman was beaten and robbed in her home. Specifically, on December 1, 1978, at a time nearing midnight, the home of a seventy-four year old woman in the Germantown section of the City of Philadelphia was burglarized. In the course of the burglary, the woman, Edith Steckle, was brutally beaten and robbed. Steckle died <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>approximately two weeks later as a result of the injuries sustained. The injuries included a badly beaten face, broken ribs, a broken leg, etc. The perpetrator of the crime also ransacked Steckle’s house, and stole a number of items including a television set, a radio, and a ring.</p>
    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.4",661,[264,589,1135,1003]]]'>There was no direct evidence as to the identity of the guilty party, for Steckle never regained consciousness after the beating, and there were no other eyewitnesses to the crime. One of Steckle's neighbors did observe an individual, believed to be male, walking along an adjoining street shortly after the crime occurred, and the individual appeared to be carrying a television set on his shoulder. The neighbor testified at trial, however, that it had not been possible to observe many identifying details of the individual’s appearance. The neighbor was only able to testify that the individual was wearing a dark jacket, and that the individual was between 5'5" and 5'8" in height, but details such as race and other physical characteristics had not been observed. There were no useful fingerprints recovered from the crime scene, and the case against appellant rested primarily upon the circumstantial inference to be drawn from the fact that, approximately four weeks after the crime, a search of appellant’s residence was conducted and the stolen television, radio, and ring were recovered.</p>

It is now argued that admission of such evidence constituted prejudicial error warranting a new trial. We agree. The prior crime consisted of a burglary and assault that occurred slightly more than two months before the instant one, at a location approximately four blocks away. The victim was an eighty-four year old woman, who, in the course of a burglary of her home, was severely beaten about the face, but who later recovered from her injuries. The beating was inflicted with fists, and with a ceramic door stop that the victim had kept in her home. The perpetrator, wearing a dark jacket, had entered the <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>victim’s house through a window, within an hour after midnight, and proceeded to ransack the premises. He defecated on the floor of the dining room, and left additional traces of excrement on the floor in an upstairs bedroom. Police had been alerted that a burglary was in progress, and, upon arriving at the scene, confronted the perpetrator as he left the premises through the front door. He ran from the scene and escaped, but police later positively identified him as appellant. Appellant’s palm print was also discovered in the victim’s house. Based upon this evidence, appellant was convicted.</p>

For example, both crimes occurred in the middle of the night, and both were perpetrated by individuals wearing dark jackets. It is, however, common for burglaries to occur at night, and it is certainly not unusual for persons to be seen wearing dark jackets. Similarly, both of the burglaries in question involved the ransacking of houses. Yet, in connection with domestic burglaries, it is most common that burglars are looking for goods to steal. A television, a radio, and a ring were stolen from the home of the present victim, but the record is silent as to what items, if any, were stolen in the course of the earlier crime. Nor can much significance be ascribed to the fact that the victims of both crimes were senior citizens living in the Germantown section of the City of Philadelphia.

The majority correctly holds that the similarities between the two crimes in this case are not sufficient to admit evidence of the earlier crime for the purpose of showing appellant’s identity as the perpetrator of this homicide. In admitting evidence of a prior crime because it is so near in method to the crime charged as to show that both were committed by the accused, there must be unique common characteristics between the two crimes. As Dean McCormick has stated, “The pattern and characteristics of the crimes must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature____ In addition, the courts tend to apply stricter standards when the desired inference pertains to identity as opposed to state of mind.” McCORMICK ON EVIDENCE § 190 at 560-563 (E. Cleary, 3d ed. 1984). As the majority points out, there is nothing uniquely similar about these two crimes. None of the similarities are so “unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.” I further agree with the majority that where there are insufficient similarities to analogize the commission of the two crimes to appellant’s “signature,” there is no need to examine the dissimilarities between the two crimes. In exercising his discretion on whether to admit evidence of prior crimes under a <em>modus operandi </em>standard, a trial judge should not consider <em>dissimilarities </em>between the crimes, or lack thereof, until he is satisfied there are sufficient <em>unique </em>similarities.</p>

While this independent evidence would be relevant in showing sufficient evidence to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the sufficiency of the evidence is not an issue presently before us.</p>

As Mr. Justice McDermott observes, the similarities between the assault on Bessie Sawyer and the assault on Edith Steckle on December 1, 1978 were quite remarkable. Both victims were elderly women who lived within blocks of each other, and of appellant, in the Germantown area of Philadelphia. Both defenseless women were viciously and senselessly attacked, a bit more than two months apart, at night in their homes, which were thoroughly ransacked. Appellant, a short black man, was positively identified as the attacker of Bessie Sawyer by eyewitnesses who saw appellant leave the scene wearing a dark leather jacket. A neighbor observed a short person leave Ms. Steckle’s home on the night of her brutalization carrying a television set and wearing a black leather jacket. The neighbor testified that he believed the person to be a black male.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> The manner of the attacks was also <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>quite similar, each victim having been repeatedly and mercilessly beaten about the face and body, and left bloody and battered.</p>
    <p id="b670-5" data-blocks='[["BL_670.5",670,[267,482,1133,411]]]'>The evidence of these two crimes, so close in time and geographic proximity, and so similar in the gratuitous brutality accompanying a burglary and ransacking of homes, showed such a logical connection between them as to naturally show that the person who committed the one also committed the other. Contrary to the majority’s assertion, the vicious and gratuitous beatings of defenseless elderly victims are not “common elements” of most burglaries.</p>
    <p id="b670-6" data-blocks='[["BL_670.6",670,[266,913,1134,1206]]]'>
      <em>Additionally and importantly, </em>there was further evidence that established an affirmative link between the “perpetrators” of these two crimes, namely appellant’s positive identification and palm print at the scene of Ms. Sawyer’s assault and the fact that appellant was in possession of several items (a radio, television set, and a 1919 high school ring) stolen from Ms. Steckle’s home, and the similar descriptions of the perpetrators. Thus, the significance of the evidence of the prior crime was <em>not only </em>that the perpetrator left his “signature” on both crimes (and on both victims), but also that one person — appellant—was positively linked to <em>both crimes </em>by extraneous evidence. The evidence of appellant’s assault and burglary of Ms. Sawyer was <em>extremely probative </em>of his guilt of the Steckle assault and burglary. Such evidence raised to a near certainty the probability that appellant attacked Ms. Steckle and stole her property, and discredited his feeble attempts to demonstrate that he had just coincidentally happened to purchase Ms. Steckle’s stolen television set and radio from a participant in a crap game in a Philadelphia school yard. (Appellant produced a witness to this “purchase,” a man who had been in Graterford prison with appellant and whose testimony was discredited on cross-examination).</p>

Obviously, the major dissimilarity was that appellant had defecated at the first crime and he did not at the second.
