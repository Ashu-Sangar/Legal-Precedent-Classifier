    <p id="b228-12" data-blocks='[["BL_228.11",228,[291,1609,1136,363]]]'>Dennis Landis worked for Hershey Equipment Company for over three years. His job was to install and service poultry equipment in chicken houses, tasks which often placed him in enclosures abounding with chicken excrement. While so employed, Landis began to experience peculiar visual problems manifested by a distortion and loss of central vision in his right eye.</p>
    <p id="b228-13" data-blocks='[["BL_228.12",228,[291,1992,1137,362]],["BL_229.1",229,[208,301,1137,789]]]'>An ophthalmologist informed Landis that his sight was affected by a condition associated with his work environment. The specific diagnosis was “presumed ocular histoplasmosis,” a rare disease the etiology of which is not clearly understood. Landis’ ophthalmologist explained the working hypothesis of how the disease progresses as follows. There is a fungus called histoplasma which exists in <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>soil and flourishes in accumulations of fowl excrement. The spores of this fungus become airborne and are inhaled by humans. In a small number of those persons so invaded, the presence of the histoplasma triggers an “allergic” reaction in the host’s eyes characterized by inflammation of the macular area, that part of the eye enabling clear central vision. This enhanced reaction to the histoplasma organism is designated “presumed ocular histoplasmosis.” The doctor explained that the adjective “presumed” is used “because the organism which causes the reaction has never been found in the ocular tissue in patients that have had all the clinical findings of the syndrome;” and that the designation “presumed ocular histoplasmosis” is “the working hypothesis that this is the type of allergic reaction in the eye to the presence of the organism elsewhere in the body.”</p>
    <p id="A80" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[206,1108,1136,469]]]'>In the case of Mr. Landis the inflammation was accompanied by hemorrhaging and subsequent scarring that affected the central vision in his right eye. Though he could still perform his duties, Landis feared further damage to his eyesight and prudently chose to abandon his employ with Hershey Equipment. Unfortunately, this change came too late to prevent the permanent loss of central vision in his right eye. This loss prompted Landis to file a claim for benefits under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

However, for whatever reason, the Commonwealth Court ignored this precedent and ordered recovery where claimant’s evidence demonstrated nothing more than he had a “greater risk of exposure” to the disease by virtue of his employment. This evidence was deficient in two critical aspects. First, the claimant’s witness never qualified what he meant by “greater.” A one percent increase in risk of exposure constitutes a greater risk, but it does not constitute “a substantially greater” risk as required by the statute. Secondly, “risk of exposure” is not the same as “incidence of disease.” The first description, which merely identifies potential, is in no way equal to the latter description, which identifies actual injuries attributable to the conditions of the workplace. The statute mandates proof of the latter.</p>

Such a claimant may still prove his claim by showing the existence of a work-related injury under section 301(c), 77 P.S. § 411. Neither the Board, nor the referee considered whether claimant’s medical evidence was sufficient to show causation under the general injury section of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, section 301(c), 77 P.S. § 411. In addition, because at the time of Mr. Landis’ claim the Board considered section 108(n) the exclusive means by which a claimant could recover for an unenumerated insidious disease neither of the parties presented their cases as a section 301(c) claim. Therefore, we think it is necessary to remand this to the Board for a new hearing at which time new evidence can be adduced concerning Mr. Landis’ claimed injury.</p>
