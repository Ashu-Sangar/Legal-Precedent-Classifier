At issue in this appeal is not \u201cthe right or power of ... [a] political subdivision to create or issue indebtedness\u201d but, rather, whether the political subdivision in question created a record which established the prerequisites for the exercise of such right of power under the Local Government Unit Debt Act, 53 P.S. \u00a7 6780-1 et seq.\nTo expedite this matter we will in this instance remand the above-captioned case to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County to provide the opportunity for the Sto-Rox School District to establish a record that would justify the incurring of the desired unfunded debt.\nJurisdiction is relinquished, and further appeals, if any, should be directed to the Commonwealth Court. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 762(a)(4)(i)(A).",
