        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nThe issue before the Court in this case is whether there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of appellant\u2019s guilt of possessing an instrument of crime.\nOn August 24, 1984, after a trial by jury, appellant Anselmo C. Gonzalez was acquitted of murder and voluntary manslaughter, but found guilty of possessing an instrument of crime. These charges arose out of the shooting death of Juan Martinez, a member of a Philadelphia street gang. Post-trial motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial were denied and, on September 26, 1984, appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one to three years. Appellant\u2019s motion to modify sentence was denied on October 5, 1984. On direct appeal in Superior Court appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction, and asserted error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant his motion for a mistrial after the prosecutor questioned appellant concerning an uncharged offense. Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence by per curiam order, 350 Pa.Super. 631, 503 A.2d 455 (1985), and, in the memorandum opinion in support of that order, relied on the analysis in the trial court\u2019s opinion. We granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nIn reviewing appellant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cwe must view that evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, here the Commonwealth; all reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the evidence must be drawn favorably to the verdict winner as well.\u201d Commonwealth v. Burns, 490 Pa. 352, 354, 416 A.2d 506, 507 (1980).\nThe record in this case reveals the following facts. Appellant owned a small variety store in a high crime area of Philadelphia. On March 19, 1984, appellant was working in his store: his wife and ten year old daughter were also present. (The family lived in an apartment above the store.) Juan Martinez and another member of a gang called the Outlaws entered the store and threatened to steal a radio from a customer, Timmy. Appellant forced the gang members out of his store saying, \u201cDon\u2019t come around here messing with my customers. I\u2019m going to kill somebody.\u201d When Timmy left the store a few minutes later, the gang, now numbering at least 8 or 9, chased Timmy in an attempt to again steal the radio. According to appellant, Juan Martinez, before joining in the chase, threatened appellant, \u201cI\u2019m coming back for you.\u201d\nMartinez returned five minutes later with 15 to 20 members of his gang and approached appellant\u2019s store. Appellant, in the doorway of his store, shot and killed Martinez with a sawed-off shotgun. According to Commonwealth witnesses, Martinez was unarmed and was not threatening appellant when the shot was fired.\nAppellant, on the other hand, testified that Martinez told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot your butt.\u201d Martinez then reached into his jacket and began to draw a black, shiny object. Appellant knew Martinez often carried a gun, and had seen the gun on several occasions. Appellant also had seen Martinez and his gang carry knives and rob people in and around the store. Appellant testified that he shot Martinez out of fear for his own and his family\u2019s safety. No gun was found on Martinez when the police arrived at the scene.\nAppellant asserts that insufficient evidence was presented at trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed intent to employ his shotgun criminally, one of the elements of the crime of possessing instruments of a crime. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 907(a) provides as follows:'\n(a) Criminal instruments generally. \u2014 A person commits a misdemeanor of the first degree if he possesses any instrument of crime with intent to employ it criminally.\n(Emphasis added.) \u201cThe Commonwealth must prove every element of the offense, including criminal intent, beyond a reasonable doubt____ Although criminal intent can be inferred beyond a reasonable doubt from the surrounding circumstances, it cannot be inferred from mere possession.\u201d Commonwealth v. Moore, 476 Pa. 19, 21, 381 A.2d 845 (1978).\nAppellant urges that our holding in Commonwealth v. Watson, 494 Pa. 467, 431 A.2d 949 (1981), controls this case. The appellant in Watson shot and killed her husband during a struggle and was convicted of both voluntary manslaughter and carrying a concealed weapon. We held that insufficient evidence had been presented at trial to disprove self-defense and reversed the voluntary manslaughter conviction. We further held that the conviction for carrying a concealed weapon must also be reversed due to insufficient evidence to establish criminal intent in possessing the gun used in the killing. No crime had been committed with the gun, and there was no other evidence presented to support a finding of criminal intent. Id., 494 Pa. at 475, 431 A.2d at 953. In the instant case, the same analysis applies. Appellant did not commit a crime with the shotgun. Thus, the jury could not infer from the killing of Martinez that appellant possessed intent to employ the shotgun criminally.\nThe Commonwealth, however, asserts that the jury could have inferred criminal intent from appellant\u2019s statement during the initial altercation with Martinez, \u201cDon\u2019t come around here messing with my customers. I\u2019m going to kill somebody.\u201d We disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion because, when viewed in the context in which it was made, appellant\u2019s statement at best presents equivocal evidence of intent. First, appellant did not wield the shotgun when he made the statement. In fact, appellant did not make use of the shotgun until the second altercation which began when Martinez and the gang returned from their unsuccessful attempt to rob Timmy. Second, the Commonwealth\u2019s own witnesses confirmed that appellant was attempting to protect Timmy from being robbed when the statement was made (Notes of Testimony at 1.9), and the statement itself evidences appellant\u2019s concern for Timmy\u2019s safety. Third, the neighborhood in which the shooting occurred is a high crime area where robberies, like the attempted robbery of Timmy in this case, occur in broad daylight in front of appellant\u2019s store. Possession of a weapon for protection in such a setting is reasonable. Finally, appellant\u2019s statement is consistent with an expression of his preparedness to kill in self defense (which is what the jury determined he did in this case); an interpretation at least as plausible as that advanced by the Commonwealth.\nAppellant\u2019s statement is not, of itself, sufficient to support a finding of criminal intent, since any jury interpretation of what appellant actually intended by the statement would be no better than guesswork.\nTherefore, since appellant did not commit a crime with the shotgun, and no other evidence sufficient to support a finding of criminal intent was presented at trial, appellant\u2019s conviction for possessing an instrument of crime must be reversed. Commonwealth v. Watson, supra.\nThe judgment of sentence is reversed and appellant is discharged.\nMcDERMOTT, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which HUTCHINSON, J., joined.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 907(a).\n. Appellant was released on bond pending appeal on March 29, 1985.\n. Because of our disposition of this issue, we need not reach appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial when the prosecutor cross-examined appellant regarding an uncharged offense.",

        "text": "McDERMOTT, Justice,\ndissenting.\nAppellant was convicted of the general crime of possessing an instrument of crime. That statutory offense requires the following:\nA person commits a misdemeanor of the first degree if he possesses any instrument of crime with intent to employ it criminally.\n18 Pa.C.S. 907(a).\nThe evidence in this case demonstrated that appellant shot and killed an unarmed man. While it is true that appellant possessed a subjective belief that his life was threatened, that is not normally enough to satisfy the burden of establishing self-defense. The jury, however, resolved this issue in favor of appellant and acquitted him of homicide. Nevertheless, it is clear that the jury did not consider appellant to be wholly blameless, effectively recognizing that appellant\u2019s action in confronting a group of teenagers on a public sidewalk, with a loaded shotgun in hand, contributed to the escalating tensions which led to the victim\u2019s death. Hence, there is no question in my mind that the verdict in this case was a compromise, and should be allowed to stand.\nThe opinion of the majority is grounded in a belief that appellant\u2019s weapon conviction is invalid because a homicide conviction was not accomplished. However, such reasoning ignores the fact that appellant was convicted of an inchoate crime, which by its nature does not require the successful completion of an independent criminal act. Merely because the jury found that at the moment appellant fired the gun his actions did not warrant a homicide conviction does not mean that for the period of time up to that final moment appellant could not be guilty of this possessory offense.\nAdditionally, the reliance by the majority on Commonwealth v. Watson, 494 Pa. 467, 431 A.2d 949 (1981) is unpersuasive, and' it ignores the fact the crime in Watson was distinct from the crime at issue here.\nIn Watson the defendant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, a crime which is defined as follows:\nA person commits a misdemeanor of the first degree if he possesses a firearm or other weapon concealed upon his person with intent to employ it criminally.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 907(b). Since Mrs. Watson only employed the admittedly concealed weapon at a time when her life was threatened, this Court held that there was no foundation upon which to conclude that she had been carrying the concealed weapon with an intent to commit a crime.\nHere the appellant was convicted of possession of an instrument of crime generally, a crime which contains no element of concealment, and which can be committed, and obviously the jury believed was committed, prior to the situation which appellant believed he was facing.\nFor these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of sentence.\nHUTCHINSON, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
