    "head_matter": "Pearson\u2019s Estate.\nDecedents\u2019 estates \u2014 Legacies \u2014 \u25a0Interest on legacies \u2014 Wills \u2014 Construction.\n1. Interest on a legacy will be payable, either from the date of the testator\u2019s death, or from one year thereafter, depending upon the relation in which the testator stood or which he assumed toward the object of his bounty. If the legacy is coupled with an intention to maintain or educate the legatee, so that it appears that the testator assumed to stand in loco parentis towards the legatee, interest on the legacy will accrue from the date of testator\u2019s death; but if the legacy'is uncoupled from such intention, interest will begin to run from one year after the death of the testator.\n2. Where a testator bequeathed a sum of money in trust for the benefit of his niece, said sum \u201cto be paid by my executors and trustees at their discretion and as they may determine to be for her advantage, for her education and maintenance, or to start her in business,\u201d the intention of the testator to stand in loco parentis toward his niece was disclosed and the court properly decided that the legacy bore interest from the date of testator\u2019s death.\nArgued Oct. 15, 1915.\nAppeal, No. 164, Oct. T., 1915, by Aline L. Eabe, executrix and residuary legatee, from decree of O. O. Allegheny Co., June T., 1914, No. 137, on bill of review, In re Estate of Prank Pearson, Deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Potter, Stewart and Frazer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill of review for the reopening of an adjudication.\nThe facts appear in the following opinion of Trimble, J.:\nThe question involved is whether a legacy bears interest, and, if so, whether it accrues from the date of the death of the testator, or from one year thereafter.\nPrank Pearson executed his last will and testament on the 28th of November, 1906, and died October 6,1907.\nThe eleventh paragraph of his will is:\n\u201cI give, devise and bequeath to my executors and trustees the sum of five thousand ($5,000) dollars, to be held in trust for my niece, Maud Pearson, said sum to be paid by my executors and trustees at their discretion, and as they may determine to be for her advantage, for her education and maintenance, or to start her in business.\u201d\nThe debts were all paid before the final account was filed, and it shows a balance far in excess of any sum necessary to pay the legacies.\nBefore the audit of the final account the Sewickley Valley Trust Company was appointed guardian of Maud Pearson, who is about twelve years old; but her guardian had no notice of the audit, except the formal advertisement. At the audit the guardian did not appear; but the decedent\u2019s widow who is the residuary legatee, opposed the payment of any interest on the legacy given to the testator\u2019s niece. A decree was entered by which the amount of legacy, without interest and less the collateral inheritance tax, was awarded to the guardian on July 14, 1914. After making fruitless efforts with the representatives of the estate to adjust the interest, the guardian filed a bill of review on January 22, 1915, praying that the decree of July 14, 1914, be opened and for such other order respecting the trust fund as the minor is entitled to have made, and as to justice and equity appertains.\nThe legacy to Maud Pearson is vested. It is not dependent upon a time and event which controls the payment, and therefore contingent, as illustrated in Duffey v. Presbyterian Congregation of Bellefonte, 48 Pa. 46, and since it is not a contingent legacy, interest has accrued on it from the time when the legacy fell due. If the time of payment is not deferred, as in Gunning\u2019s Estate (No. 3), 234 Pa. 148, the interest will be payable either from the date of the testator\u2019s death, or one year thereafter, depending upon the relation in which the donor stood, or which he assumed toward the object of his bounty: Jacoby\u2019s Est., 204 Pa. 188. If the legacy is a mere benefaction, uncoupled from an intention to maintain or educate the legatee the interest will begin to run from one year after the death of the testator; but if he assumed to stand in loco parentis to the child, it will accrue 'from the date of his death. There is no doubt that it is. not payable at the convenience of the executors. It is payable absolutely, but at the trustees\u2019 discretion, as they may determine to be for the advantage of the legatee, and for her education and maintenance, or to start her in business. The trustees were obliged to pay, and the discretion with which they were invested was legal and not arbitrary. While the court will not substitute their discretion for that of the trustees, nevertheless it is an imperative power; it is legal and not capricious, and must be honestly and reasonably exercised, and when there is an abuse, the courts will correct it: See note to Section 511, 2d Yol., 6th Ed., Perry on Trusts and Trustees; and Gochenauer v. Froelich, 8 Watts 19, 23, where in construing a discretionary power the Supreme Court \u2022 said: There are cases where a claimant is entitled to the whole of his demand, as much as to any part of it; and there are cases where a part may properly be allowed and not the whole.\u201d \u201cA person in loco parentis to a child is a person who means to put himself in the situation of a lawful father of the child with reference to the father\u2019s office and duty of making provision for the child\u201d: Robinson\u2019s Est., 35 Pa. Superior Ct. 192. In this case the testator\u2019s nephew received a legacy upon which interest was allowed from the testator\u2019s death. See also Cooper v. Scott, 62 Pa. 139 j Seibert\u2019s App., 19 Pa. 49, and Corbin v. Wilson, 2 Ashmead 178, where it is said that the intention of the testator to stand in loco parentis must be gathered from the whole will.\nMaud Pearson was about five years old when her uncle died and left her this legacy. The purpose of the gift, shown by his unequivocal language, was inspired by a solicitude for her nothing less than parental. \u201cFor her education, maintenance, or to start her in business\u201d were his own words in directing how the trustees should spend the legacy. He not only makes the gift, but shows his anxiety for the child\u2019s future, by directing its expenditure in the essentials of life; by his own language he places himself in loco parentis to this young girl, and the result is that the legacy given to her will bear interest from the date of his death.\nIt is not tenable to argue that interest is not payable because the estate did not have sufficient funds to pay the same until a long time after the death of the testator, for in Huston\u2019s App., 9 Watts 472, 477, itis said: \u201cEven though a legacy is to come out of a part of the testator\u2019s estate which cannot be recovered for a long time after the year, and the testator directs the legacy to be paid when the money which is to constitute it can be recovered, still the payment of interest, if practicable, or at least the computation of it, will commence from the end of the year after the testator\u2019s death.\u201d\nJanuary 3, 1916:\nThe court awarded the relief prayed for in the bill. Aline L. Rabe, executrix and residuary legatee, appealed.\nError\u2019assigned was the decree of the court.\nF. C. McGirr, with him John E. Laughlm, for appellant.\nR. T. M. McGready, for appellee."
