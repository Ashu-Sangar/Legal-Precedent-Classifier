    "head_matter": "Lindemann v. Pittsburgh Railways Company, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Street railways \u2014 Releases\u2014Mental capacity \u2014 Case for fury \u2014 Charge\u2014Inadequacy\u2014Waiver.\n1. In an action against a street railway company to recover damages for personal injuries occasioned to a passenger, where defendant relied upon a release of all damages for a consideration of $80.00 alleged to have been executed by plaintiff, but where there was evidence, though contradicted, that plaintiff was not capable of comprehending his act and its nature and probable consequences in executing the release, the case was for the jury and a verdict for the plaintifE was sustained.\n2. In such case the defendant was in no position to complain that the failure of the court to explain to the jury the meaning of \u201cclear, precise and indubitable\u201d used in describing the quality of proof required to overthrow a written instrument, was error where at the conclusion of the charge, counsel were requested to direct the court\u2019s attention to any matters to which they wished the attention of the jury drawn, and defendant\u2019s counsel did not indicate any specific respect wherein the charge was lacking, especially where points for charge submitted by defendant were affirmed by the court, and where counsel for defendant, in his address explained to the jury in the language of the Supreme Court, the meaning of \u201cclear, precise and indubitable\u201d and such explanation was not questioned.\nArgued Oct. 12,1915.\nAppeal, No. 47, Oct. T., 1915, by defendant, from judgment.of O. P. Allegheny Co., Jan. T., 1913, No. 2250, on verdict for plaintiff in case of J. G-. W. Lindemann v. Pittsburgh Railways Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Potter, Stewart and Frazer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries.\nThe facts appear in the following opinion of Brown, J., sur defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial:\nIn a collision between cars Of the defendant company, the evening of September 1, 1912, plaintiff, a passenger on one of them, was seriously injured. He was taken to the Pittsburgh hospital the same evening.\nHis appearance at the trial was pitiful. He seemed to be a physical and mental wreck. One of defendant\u2019s Avitnesses testified that plaintiff \u2014 at the trial \u2014 looked better than he did at the time he was in the hospital suffering from his injuries.\nIn bar of plaintiff\u2019s right to recover damages, defendant set up a Avritten release executed by him in the hospital the day following his arrival there \u2014 releasing and satisfying, for a consideration of fifty dollars paid him, his claim for damages. The validity of the release was denied by him on the ground of mental incapacity to execute it. Defendant\u2019s points read to the jury and affirmed by the court were:\n\u201c1. If the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff signed the release when he was rational, and either read or had read to him the contents of the release, your verdict must be for the defendant.\n\u201c2. If the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff signed the release when he was mentally capable of knowing its contents but later developed mental weakness, the release is binding and your verdict must be for the defendant.\n\u201c3. If the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff signed the release when mentally capable of knowing its contents, and accepted the .money named in the release, he is barred from recovery, and your verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d\nThe issue of fact for the jury was: Whether, at the execution of the release, \u25a0 plaintiff was capable of comprehending his act, its nature and probable consequences. If he was, defendant was entitled to a verdict. If not, he was entitled to a verdict. Upon this issue the jury found in his favor.\nNumerous witnesses \u2014 lay and expert \u2014 testified touching his mental condition after the accident \u2014 and preceding, during and following the execution of the release; some of them testifying to direct observation of his conduct and action, and some, upon hypothetical questions put to them \u2014 all this for the purpose of determining his mental condition \u2014 mental ability or non-ability to transact business, to execute the release. This testimony of direct facts and of opinions based on them took a wide range. Some of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testifying that after the accident \u2014 before he reached the hospital, and while in the hospital \u2014 his mind was dazed, confused; lacking ability to carry on coherently and connectedly conversation touching the ordinary affairs of life \u2014 incapable of transacting business. Some of defendant\u2019s witnesses testifying that his mind was not impaired, but sufficiently rational to understand the transaction covered by the release.\nIt is plain that the execution of the release, to be legally binding on him, required more than his mere signature. It was necessary that both mind and will should co-operate in the execution and delivery of the instrument. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony asserted there was no such co-operation; defendant\u2019s, that there was. If there was not such co-operation \u201cthen, in contemplation of law, there was no execution and delivery of the alleged release. A substantial question of fact was thus presented which it was the exclusive province of the jury to determine in the ordinary way\u201d: Gibson v. Western N. Y. & Penna. R. R. Co., 164 Pa. 142,157.\nThe next issue of fact for the jury related to (a) the nature and extent of his physical, nervous and mental ailments; (b) drug, doctors and hospital bills; (c) loss of earnings; (d) pain and suffering and inconvenience.\nTouching the physical, nervous and mental ailments, much testimony was presented \u2014 the opinions of the doctors and specialists varying to some extent; some of them expressing the view that plaintiff might get better or some better; and some, that he was not likely ever to recover in any substantial degree \u2014 but more likely to grow worse.\nAt the conclusion of the charge counsel were requested to direct the court\u2019s attention to any matter to which they wished the attention of the jury drawn. To this request counsel did not indicate in what specific respect the charge was lacking; and the court learned only by the argument of defendant\u2019s counsel on his motion for a new trial that it was the failure to explain to the jury the meaning of \u201cclear, precise and indubitable.\u201d Under the circumstances, the answer to that is:\n(a) The suggestion of counsel \u2014 in response to the court\u2019s request at the end of the trial \u2014 was general and not specific. Had counsel specifically (orally or by point in writing) drawn the court\u2019s attention, it would have been an easy matter to reply to it.\n(b) Defendant\u2019s counsel, in his address to the jury, clearly explained and defined the meaning of \u201cclear, precise and indubitable\u201d \u2014 explained and defined it as the Supreme Court had in numerous decisions:\n\u201cIndubitable proof. ______is evidence that is not only found to be credible, but of such weight and directness as to make out the facts alleged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the terms \u2018clear, precise and indubitable\u2019 are used by the courts to define the requisite proof of a fact, it is meant that the witnesses shall be credible, that the facts are distinctly remembered by them, that details are narrated exactly, and that their statements are true.\u201d\nHis explanation to the jury was conceded. No one disputed it. The jury got the benefit of it; and the failure to again call the jury\u2019s attention to it cannot be charged to the court as error.\nHad the court been sitting as a chancellor in an equitable proceeding to cancel and declare void the release upon the ground of plaintiff\u2019s mental incapacity to execute it, it would have declared the instrument void \u2014 for the testimony of such incapacity was strong and convincing, \u201cclear, precise and indubitable.\u201d As said by the Supreme Court in Highlands v. Philadelphia & Reading R. R. Co., 209 Pa. 286, 297: \u201cWe are of opinion that the testimony at the trial was ample to sustain a chancellor in reforming the release.\u201d\nAs already suggested, many lay and expert witnesses testified touching the issues submitted to the jury. The credibility of their testimony \u2014 all oral \u2014 was to be weighed by the jury: Reel v. Elder, 62 Pa. 308; Duffy v. York Haven Water & Power Co., 233 Pa. 107, at p. 110. Credibility is the touchstone of testimony in the measure of its weight. The weight of testimony is that which the jury determines after considering the various elements necessarily entering into its make-up; such as, the manner and appearance of the witnesses on the stand; their bias and interest in the subject matter of the controversy; the consistency and inconsistency, contradiction and variation in the stories told by them; and other surrounding circumstances giving it an impress weak or strong, true or false. Some testimony may be as good as gold, as genuine as a standard coin, and some, as worthless as a counterfeit. Testimony may bear the. stamp of truth or the badge of fraud and perjury. Who is to pass upon its value? The jury alone. The court cannot invade the province of the jury. The court\u2019s supervisory control rests in the discretion to grant new trials.\nThe charge, we think, fully and fairly explained to the jury: (a) the issues of fact to be'passed on by it; (b) in connection with the meaning of \u201cclear, precise and indubitable,\u201d as defined by defendant\u2019s counsel in his argument to the jury \u2014 the method of weighing and measuring testimony, lay and expert; (c) the duty of determining the nature and extent of the resulting injuries \u2014 nervous, mental and physical; (d) the measure of damages.\nBelieving \u2014 in the light of all the circumstances \u2014 that a fair trial was had and substantial justice reached by tbe verdict, a new trial is refused.\nJanuary 3, 1916:\nVerdict for plaintiff for |13,000.00 and judgment thereon. Defendant appealed. -\nError assigned was tbe charge to tbe jury.\nRichard C. Long, with him Clarence Burleigh and William A. Challener, for appellant.\nRody P. Marshall, with him Thomas M. Marshall, for appellee."
