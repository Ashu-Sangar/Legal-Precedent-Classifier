        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nThis is an appeal by the plaintiff from an order of the court below refusing to permit an amendment in the designation of the party defendant.\n\u201cThe Valvoline Oil Works, Limited,\u201d is a partnership association, created and existing under the laws of this State, with its principal office and works at East Butler, Avhere the plaintiff was employed. He was injured, at the defendant\u2019s plant, on March 19, 1911, and brought suit to recover damages from his .employer, naming it as \u201cThe Valvoline Oil Works, Limited, a corporation.\u201d On November 5, 1914, the plaintiff having learned that the defendant was a partnership association, and not a corporation, moved for leave to amend by striking from its name the words, \u201ca corporation,\u201d and adding, in their stead, the words, \u201ca partnership association.\u201d The court below refused to permit this amendment, on the ground that it introduced a new party to the action after the statute of limitations had run; hence this appeal.\nThe lawyers who accepted service of the original summons were attorneys for \u201cThe Valvoline Oil Works, Limited,\u201d for whom the plaintiff worked, and in whose service he was injured; at that time, they also represented a corporation named \u201cThe Valvoline Oil Company,\u201d with whom the plaintiff, so far as the record shows, had no connection.\nThe appellant contends that the desired amendment does not name a new party defendant, but merely corrects the name of the defendant- originally designated and summoned, citing: Wright v. Eureka Tempered Copper Co., 206 Pa. 274; Druckenmiller v. Young, 27 Pa. 97. (See also Meitzner v. Balto. & Ohio R. R. Co., 224 Pa. 352, and Tonge v. Item Publishing Co., 244 Pa. 417.)\nOn principle, the above authorities rule the present case. \u201cThe Valvoline Oil Company\u201d was not designated or summoned as defendant, but a concern with quite a different name \u2014 \u201cThe Valvoline Oil Works, Limited\u201d; and, since we have no. \u201climited\u201d corporations in this country, it is not at all likely that any one interested could reasonably have been misled by the insertion of the word \u201ccorporation\u201d after the word \u201climited\u201d in the title of the defendant. The plaintiff did not sue the wrong party; he simply made a mistake in stating the name of his employer, and this he had a right to correct.\nThe authorities relied on by the defendant and cited by the court below do not govern the present case. White Co. v. Fayette Auto. Co., 43 Pa. Superior Ct. 532, 533, states the recognized rule, \u201cIf the effect of the amendment will be to correct the name under which the right party was sued, it should be allowed; if its effect will be to bring a new party on the record, it should be refused.\u201d The amendment was denied in that case, however, because it did not seek merely to change a name, but also to bring in as defendants five individuals not previously named. Girardi v. Laquin Lumber Co., 232 Pa. 1, where the amendment was refused, is an instance of precisely the same character.\nThe assignments of error are sustained, the order is reversed, the amendment allowed and the record returned to the court below with a procedendo.",

Where a plaintiff makes a mistake in the name of the party whom he is suing, he should be allowed to correct the error, even though the statute of limitations has barred the commencement of another action on the claim.\n2. Where an action of trespass for personal injuries was brought against \u201cThe Valyoline Oil Works, Limited, a corporation,\u201d and plaintiff subsequently learned that defendant was a partnership association, and not a corporation, it was error to refuse to permit plaintiff to amend the record and pleadings by striking out the words \u201ca corporation,\u201d and adding in their stead \u201ca partnership association.\u201d\n3. In such case plaintiff did not bring an action against the wrong party, but merely made a mistake in stating the name of defendant, which he had a right to correct.\nArgued Oct. 7, 1915.\nAppeal, No. 82, Oct.
