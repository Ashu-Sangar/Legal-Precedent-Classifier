It appeared at the audit that decedent had failed in the liquor business, and had thereafter carried on the business of the produce company in his wife’s name, as manager for her; there was evidence that after effecting settlement with his creditors, the produce business was conveyed to decedent by his wife, and was thereafter conducted by him individually until his death; that decedent and his <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>.wife had separated under an agreement which provided that the business of the Italo-French Produce Company should be conducted by decedent without interference by the wife. The wife claimed the property of the produce company as hers alleging that the business had never been conveyed by her to her husband and produced the testimony of her children as to declarations and admissions by the decedent and by a witness in decedent’s employ, who had been convicted of embezzlement. The witnesses produced by claimant had previously testified in a proceeding to set aside testator’s will that the Italo-French Produce Company was the property of decedent; it further appeared that such witnesses were interested in procuring the allowance of the claim. The auditing judge found that claimant’s witnesses were unworthy of credence, and that she had estopped herself from claiming the business of decedent, by joining in the proceeding to set aside the will, wherein it was alleged that the business was his property, and dissallowed the claim. <em>Held, </em>the court did not err in dismissing exceptions to the adjudication.</p>

A part of this business was conducted while he was a licensee for the sale of liquors, but after his failure he devoted all of his time and attention to the increase of his macaroni, produce and grocery business, and borrowed money from his friends which was used in enlarging it. This borrowed money, together with the accumulation of profits from the business, and reinvestment of the same, was the foundation of what in after years became a large and prosperous business concern in the City of Pittsburgh.</p>

The real estate where the business was conducted, in Allegheny, now Pittsburgh, was conveyed to the decedent on the 4th day of May, 1908; new buildings were contracted for and erected in 1910 and 1911, and paid for by the decedent, out of the funds of the Italo-French Produce Company, and these buildings and all of their contents were insured by the decedent, and the insurance paid in the same manner. From the time the real estate in which the business was conducted was conveyed to him by his wife, all of the business which had formerly been transacted under the name of his wife, was thereafter, until his death, conducted by him individually, under the name of the Italo-French Produce Company, and from the date upon which the change in name was effected, until his death, the claimant exercised no rights or duties as owner.</p>

That he was a prosperous business man is admitted.

All of the land which was in Mrs. Pivirotto’s name at the time of the separation agreement was bought and paid for out of the funds of the Italo-French Produce Company. The settlement between them was fair; all of his estate was revealed to her, and in fixing the value of the share which each one received, the Italo-French Produce Company was appraised and made a part of the valuation. The total value of the share received by the claimant was $43,-000.00, and the share of the decedent did not exceed $47,000.00, and this included the Italo-French Produce Company. Two of the covenants of the separation agreement are, that he will “permit her......to follow and carry on such trade or business as she may from time to time choose,” and that she will “permit him ......to follow and carry on such trade or business as he may from time to time choose, without any interference from her.” The decedent was at that time carrying on the Italo-French Produce Company in his own name, and continued to do so until his death.</p>

Turn of these checks which paid his liability were drawn to Mrs. Pivirotto’s order, and were endorsed by her, with her mark, duly attested, and delivered by her to her son, who was her trustee, and who was with her when the settlement was made and money paid, to explain everything. One of the deeds delivered to her by her husband in carrying out the terms of this agreement, contains this recital: “This deed being made in order to explain the difference in names, and also to avoid confusion of names, due to the fact that F.

When the decedent conducted his business in the name of the claimant, and concealed real estate in her name, which had been purchased by funds taken from the business, the transactions were void as to creditors, but good between the parties. On the 4th of May, 1908, Mrs. Pivirotto conveyed to her husband the land where the Italo-French Produce Company was conducting the business, and on the 27th of October, 1908, the bank account was changed by striking off the word “Manager.” From the time when the land was transferred to the decedent and the account in the bank changed from himself as “Manager,” and thereafter conducted by him individually, the claimant can show no act of ownership, either express or implied, except by her own children, who testify to declarations and admissions of the decedent, and by one other witness, who was prosecuted and convicted at the instance of the decedent, for embezzlement.</p>

If this company or business belonged to her, she should have protested that the money which he gave her, by the checks of the Italo-French Produce Company, was hers, and not his; but she took it without objection, or assertion of ownership, and thereby admitted that it belonged to him. And in addition to that admission of ownership, she precluded all possible doubt about her belief in her husband’s ownership, when she accepted a deed from him in settlement, which recites that “F.
