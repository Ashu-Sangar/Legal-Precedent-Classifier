L. 852, and is entitled, “An Act for the better regulation and ventilation of mines, and for the protection of the lives of the miners in the County of Schuylkill.” Under its provisions the governor appointed a properly qualified person for the office of inspector of the coal mines of Schuylkill County. The appointment was for three years. The salary was fixed at three thousand dollars, and was paid by the State treasurer. The inspector made his reports to the governor. In the following year an act was approved on March 3, 1870, P. L. 3, entitled, “An Act providing for the health and safety of persons employed in coal mines.” Under its provisions the governor was authorized to appoint inspectors for five years, for the Counties of Luzerne and Carbon. Their salary was fixed at three thou<a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>sand dollars, to be paid by the State treasurer, and the inspectors were required to make annual reports to the governor. That act also changed the local Ac fc of Schuylkill County, just referred to, and provided for the appointment of three inspectors of mines for the Counties of Schuylkill, Dauphin, Northumberland and Columbia. Their salaries were paid by the State treasurer, and they were required to report to the governor. These two laws and subsequent local laws were merged into or repealed by an act entitled, “An Act to provide for the health and safety of persons employed in and about the anthracite coal mines of Pennsylvania and for the protection and preservation of property connected therewith,” “approved June 2, 1891, P. L. 176.” In the title of this act it is indicated that this law concerns mines of Pennsylvania. Inspectors of mines were appointed by the governor under its provisions until 1901, when the office became elective by virtue of an act approved June 8, 1901, P. L. 535. Inspectors of mines are now, and always have been paid by the State treasurer. They are “under the direction of the chief of the department of mines” in this Common-wealth, who assigns districts to them in their respective counties in which they are elected. They are elected by the qualified electors of inspection districts, and there are eight such districts. The County of Schuylkill constitutes the fourth district, and in it four inspectors are elected. We may contrast this fourth district with the eighth district, consisting of the Counties of Susquehanna, Wayne and Sullivan, in which three counties but one inspector is elected: Act of May 6, 1911, P. L. 120. Surely, no one could successfully contend that the inspector of the eighth district is a county officer, for he could not be such consistently with the constitutional provision that “no person shall be appointed <em>tú </em>any office within any county who shall not have been a citizen and inhabitant therein one year nest before his appointment, if the county shall have been so long created,” (Constitution, <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>Article XIV, Section 3) because it would be physically impossible for one and the same person to be an inhabitant in Susquehanna, Wayne and Sullivan Counties during the same year next before his appointment. Residence is not a qualification for appointment or election to the office of inspector of mines. “The person so elected must be a citizen, and shall have attained the age of thirty years. He must have a knowledge of the different systems of working coal mines, and he must produce satisfactory evidence to the board of examiners of having had at least five years’ practical experience in anthracite coal mines of Pennsylvania. He must have had experience in coal mines where noxious and explosive gases are involved.” Act of June 8,1901,' 535. He need not be an inhabitant of the county, but no one can become a candidate for election until he has filed “with the county commissioners a certificate from the mine examining board” and “setting forth the fact of the applicant’s having passed a successful examination.”</p>

We consider this a material error or defect apparent on the face of the petition. It is material to the qualified voters of the fourth inspection district to nominate at the fall primaries persons for only such offices as the law. provides shall be filled at the election to be held in November, 1915; and it is material to all taxpayers also that no expense be incurred in printing useless matter upon official ballots. As well might a candidate for governor or for the general assembly have his name printed on the official ballot for 1915.
