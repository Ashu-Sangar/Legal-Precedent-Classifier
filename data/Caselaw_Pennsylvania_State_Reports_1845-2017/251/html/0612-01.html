Interest on a legacy will be payable, either from the date of the testator’s death, or from one year thereafter, depending upon the relation in which the testator stood or which he assumed toward the object of his bounty. If the legacy is coupled with an intention to maintain or educate the legatee, so that it appears that the testator assumed to stand in loco parentis towards the legatee, interest on the legacy will accrue from the date of testator’s death; but if the legacy'is uncoupled from such intention, interest will begin to run from one year after the death of the testator.</p>

A decree was entered by which the amount of legacy, without interest and less the collateral inheritance tax, was awarded to the guardian on July 14, 1914. After making fruitless efforts with the representatives of the estate to adjust the interest, the guardian filed a bill of review on January 22, 1915, praying that the decree of July 14, 1914, be opened and for such other order respecting the trust fund as the minor is entitled to have made, and as to justice and equity appertains.</p>

There is no doubt that it is. not payable at the convenience of the executors. It is payable absolutely, but at the trustees’ discretion, as they may determine to be for the advantage of the legatee, and for her education and maintenance, or to start her in business. The trustees were obliged to pay, and the discretion with which they were invested was legal and not arbitrary. While the court will not substitute their discretion for that of the trustees, nevertheless it is an imperative power; it is legal and not capricious, and must be honestly and reasonably exercised, and when there is an abuse, the courts will <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>correct it: See note to Section 511, 2d Yol., 6th Ed., Perry on Trusts and Trustees; and Gochenauer v.

The purpose of the gift, shown by his unequivocal language, was inspired by a solicitude for her nothing less than parental. “For her education, maintenance, or to start her in business” were his own words in directing how the trustees should spend the legacy. He not only makes the gift, but shows his anxiety for the child’s future, by directing its expenditure in the essentials of life; by his own language he places himself in loco parentis to this young girl, and the result is that the legacy given to her will bear interest from the date of his death.</p>
