Susan M. McElwain is a daughter of Simon Beck, late of Wayne Township, said county, and claims title to said land by virtue of a devise to her contained in the last will and testament of Simon Beck, deceased — the eleventh clause thereof being in the following words: “I give and bequeath to my daughter, Susan M. McElwain, my farm situated in Cowanshannock Township, in said County of Armstrong, known as the S. J.
