When the elevator platform was at the second floor, this gate or trap was lifted to the ceiling of the second story, the bottom of it then being about six feet above the second floor, so that employees could pass under it. It was not lowered to its position on the second floor so as to guard the well hole before the elevator moved when being lowered <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>to the first floor, but moved down with the elevator, and did not get into position so as to protect this opening until the elevator platform was about six feet below the second floor. When the elevator platform was being lifted from the first floor to the second floor, this gate was lifted by the elevator when the platform had arrived within about six feet of the second floor, and carried up to the ceiling of the second story, thus leaving the well hole unprotected while the elevator platform was coming up to the second floor from the first floor.</p>

No elevator boy or person to operate the elevator was employed. Whenever one was on the first floor and wished to use the elevator, and found the platform to be at the second floor, he pulled a cord which was intended to ring the bell on the second floor, so. as to warn the employees that the elevator was going to move and leave the well hole open. In like manner when one was on the second floor and wished to use the elevator, he pulled a cord which was intended to ring a bell on the first floor, to warn those below that the elevator was coming down. Having thus pulled the cord another rope was then pulled which would start the elevator. After having pulled the cord and started the elevator the operator had nothing further to do, as the elevator was operated by compressed air and moved automatically either up or down as required when the cord was pulled.</p>

He waited until the employee using the elevator had left it, and then pulled the cord to ring the warning bell on the second floor; he then pulled the rope to start the elevator in motion and stepped back out of the way of the elevator as he had been instructed <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>to do when he first came into the employ, of the defendant company.</p>

He did not hear the warning bell on account of the noise of the saw, and did not know that the elevator was going to move until it started just as he was about to wheel the heavy truck upon it. The gate was up at this time. Seeing the elevator'start to move he endeavored to hold the truck back, but was unable to do so. He held on to it until he was struck by the descending gate, when he was forced to let it go and it fell through the well hole and there being no guard, bounded from the platform of the elevator to the floor below, where it again bounded and struck plaintiff who was standing back at the usual place waiting for the elevator to come down.</p>

    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[303,571,1146,959]]]'>The negligence with which the plaintiff charged the defendant, and of which it was found guilty by a jury, was its failure to comply with the requirement of Section 12 of the Act of May 2,1905, P. L. 352, that elevator wells shall be properly and substantially enclosed or guarded. Whether there had been a compliance by the defendant with the terms of the statute, and, if not, whether its failure to comply was the proximate cause of the injuries sustained by the plaintiff, were questions for the jury. They were submitted in a charge in which no error appears, and a specific instruction of the learned trial judge was that, if the jury should find that O’Neill had done anything he ought not to have done, or omitted to do anything he should have done that contributed to his injury, the verdict should be for the defendant. The case could not have been taken from the jury, and nothing in the thirteen assignments of error calls for its retrial.</p>
