This testimony of direct facts and of opinions based on them took a wide range. Some of plaintiff’s witnesses testifying that after the accident — before he reached the hospital, and while in the hospital — his mind was dazed, confused; lacking ability to carry on coherently and connectedly conversation touching the ordinary affairs of life — incapable of transacting business.

Credibility is the touchstone of testimony in the measure of its weight. The weight of testimony is that which the jury determines after considering the various elements necessarily entering into its make-up; such as, the manner and appearance of the witnesses on the stand; their bias and interest in the subject matter of the controversy; the consistency and inconsistency, contradiction and variation in the stories told by them; and other surrounding circumstances giving it an impress weak or strong, true or false. Some testimony may be as good as gold, as genuine as a standard coin, and some, as worthless as a counterfeit. Testimony may bear the. stamp of truth or the badge of fraud and perjury. Who is to pass upon its value? The jury alone. The court cannot invade the province of the jury. The court’s supervisory control rests in the discretion to grant new trials.</p>
