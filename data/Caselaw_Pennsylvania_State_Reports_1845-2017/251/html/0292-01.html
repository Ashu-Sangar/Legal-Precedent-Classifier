A preliminary injunction was awarded as prayed for and the power was turned on and furnished continuously after the bill was filed. Defendant claimed the full amount of the contract price of the power; plaintiff claimed that it was not required to pay during the period when the power was not satisfactorily furnished. It appeared that plaintiff had been compelled to procure extra power for which it paid $338.01. The lower court dissolved the preliminary injunction and awarded defendant the amounts called for by the contract, less the amount paid by plaintiff for procuring extra power. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[194,766,1150,646]]]'>The consideration of this case is undertaken with some hesitation. At first blush the whole matter seems confused and hard to understand. Some difficulty is occasioned by the subject-matter of controversy and the character of the evidence which was introduced. But the principal trouble arises through the long delay which has characterized the proceeding. The impressions at the hearing have faded and the great advantage of hearing the witnesses has been lost. The bill was filed December 24,1910; the testimony was taken Dec. 19,1912, and the case was not called for argument until June 10,1914.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.6",339,[195,1423,1153,976]],["BL_340.1",340,[280,336,1146,263]]]'>But if we can steer clear of technical terms and rivet attention on the real matter in dispute it may be possible to avoid confusion and arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. The contract between the parties requires the plaintiff to pay a demand charge of two thousand dollars per year “based on ample power to operate not more than three (3) double truck cars at any one time.” The plaintiff alleging that the power furnished was insufficient refused to pay in accordance with the contract. Because of such refusal, the defendant on the 24th December discontinued the lines and refused to furnish further power. The bill avers failure on part of the defendant company; that the plaintiff had paid all that was fairly due and prays: 1. That a mandatory injunction issue requiring the defendant to furnish power in accordance with the contract and, 2. That the court determine what amount, if any, may be due the defendant under the contract from Nov. 22, 1909, to Nov. 30, 1910. The power was turned <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>
      <em>on; </em>it has been furnished continuously since the bill was filed and the service is satisfactory. The only matter, therefore, to be determined is the amount, if any, due the defendant for power furnished between Nov. 22, 1909, and Nov. 30, 1910.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[277,609,1149,643]]]'>The defendant claims the sum of $1,900.60 with interest from first of December, 1910. This claim seems to be justified under the terms of the contract, if it be conceded that the contract was performed by the defendant. There can be no dispute about the prices because they are fixed in the agreement and the parties agree as to the amounts paid. A simple calculation, therefore, shows that under the contract and allowing for payments made that there is due the sum of $1,900.60. The plaintiff, however, contends that it should not be required to pay anything because the service contracted for was not rendered by the defendant company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.6",340,[275,1263,1150,1133]],["BL_341.1",341,[172,351,1151,589]]]'>The plaintiff’s cars could hot be operated successfully from November, 1909, till August, 1910. The trouble experienced has been told by witnesses for plaintiff and their statements have not been contradicted. During this period frequent complaints were made to the defendant. The witnesses do differ as to the cause of the trouble and they also disagree as to whether sufficient power was supplied. Much testimony was produced on these two matters. Without attempting to review such testimony in detail it is a significant fact that there has been no trouble in running the cars and no complaint since about August 1, 1910. It further appears that in June, 1910, the defendant company caused the wires from the Manor sub-station to be connected with the trolley wires of the plaintiff at Irwin and that also in June or July, 1910, a Westinghouse induction motor of 300 kilowatt capacity was removed from the sub-station at Arona and there was put in its place a synchronous motor of the capacity of 375 kilowatts. After such changes were made, complaints ceased and the cars were rufi without unnecessary interruption. Before the <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>changes were made there was constant trouble. After the new machine was installed at Arona and the new connection made with the Manor sub-station there was no further trouble in the running of the cars. With such facts before us it looks as if there had been some defect in the service and that the trouble of moving the cars was due to an insufficient supply of power. In order to reach such conclusion it is not necessary to be familiar with voltage, amper or kilowatt. Nor is it essential to wrestle with the testimony of experts who differ in opinion as to the cause of the trouble.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b341-3" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[169,953,1152,1018]]]'>But it does not follow if the power supplied was insufficient that the plaintiff is to be relieved from payment. There was at least partial performance under the contract, and it does appear that the defendant made every reasonable effort to supply this deficiency. Although the power was to be supplied from the Arona substation connection was made with wires at Manor. Besides the plaintiff has already paid over four thousand dollars which is an admission that it ought to pay what the service was worth. But even conceding that no more should be paid than the service was worth, we have no data except in one particular on which an estimate could be used. There is no evidence to show what amount of loss, if any, was occasioned by the alleged default of the defendant. The testimony does show, however, that it was necessary to get extra power and that the sum of $338.01 was paid for the same, which amount should fairly be credited on defendant’s bill. The account would then stand as follows:</p>
