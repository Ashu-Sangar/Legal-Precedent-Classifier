    <p class="summary" id="b590-4" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[269,1374,1152,1026]],["BL_591.1",591,[142,345,1151,700]]]'>The argument upon exceptions to the findings of fact and conclusions of law has not convinced us that any error was. committed, in holding that the defendant was not responsible for the acts, both of omission and of commission, of those in active charge of the affairs of the Farmers’ Co-operative Supply Company. In our opinion, the proper construction of the by-laws, quoted in Findings of Fact 2, compels the conclusion reached upon that proposition. The board of directors, and not the treasurer, had sole control of the affairs of the corporation and of all officers, agents and employees, including the hiring and discharging of them. Upon what theory then, which has been stated in the bill, can there be a finding that the defendant is responsible? The evidence does not show that he has failed to account for any moneys which came into his custody. Neither does it show that he has improperly disbursed any of such moneys. No claim against the corporation, which arose out of the defendant’s failure of duty as treasurer, was <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>established at the trial. Neither was it shown that the corporation had suffered loss, by reason of any failure of duty by the defendant as treasurer. The burden of the complainant’s contention now is that the defendant was negligent in not ascertaining what the employees were doing and in not reporting the same. But the difficulty with this proposition is that the alleged acts of negligence were those of the board of directors, whose duty it was to supervise all the affairs of the corporation. If this bill had been filed against the directors, a different issue might have been presented. But, of course, we can only dispose of the questions raised by the pleadings.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b591-3" data-blocks='[["BL_591.4",591,[124,1056,1168,1246]]]'>The important controversy raised by the exceptions to the defendant’s account was embraced in the third and fourth. That related to the defendant’s responsibility under the by-laws. As we have shown, the responsibility for the acts of employees rested upon the board of directors and not upon the defendant, as treasurer. All the other exceptions were most general; none were specific.- In any event, the treasurer was not obliged to know the details of items. He did not keep the books; he did not establish the system of keeping accounts; he did not purchase goods; nor did he sell them. He received cash, checks and notes, and was required to deposit the same; and he was to pay out the moneys at the direction of the board, which was in supreme control. His accounts were audited by the board a number of times, and they were audited by a special committee, at the same time there was an audit of the manager’s accounts upon which the plaintiff relies so much, but the defendant’s accounts were found to be accurate. This happened within about a year of the time the receiver was appointed. The whole evidence discloses that the defendant has fully accounted for all the moneys and property for which he was responsible.</p>
