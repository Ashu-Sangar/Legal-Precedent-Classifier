Plaintiff’s contention is that defendant failed to properly guard the saw, and to recover damages for the injuries sustained this action was brought, and a verdict rendered in favor of plaintiff. The reasons filed in support of these motions are too numerous to discuss in detail. In substance, one class relates to the question of defendant’s negligence and plaintiff’s contributory negligence, and the other to our ruling on the admissibility of certain testimony. Defendant’s negligence depends upon whether or not it complied with the Factory Act of May <em>2, </em>1905, P. L. 352, Sec. 11, which requires, inter alia, all saws to be properly guarded. Whether the saw which caused plaintiff’s injury was sufficiently guarded, or capable of being guarded and used for its intended purpose, were disputed questions of fact, and therefore for the jury: Wagner v. Standard Sanitary Manfg. Co., <a href="/pa/244/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="244 Pa. 310" data-case-ids="1003453" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0310-01">244 Pa. 310</a>. Upon an examination of our charge and answer to defendant’s points, in connection with the very elaborate brief of defendant’s counsel, we have not been convinced that our instructions to the jury were either erroneous or prejudicial to defendant. On the contrary, the instructions were fully as fair to defendant as it was entitled to have them, not only on the questions of negligence and contributory negligence, but also the measure <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>of damages. The exceptions to onr rulings on the admissibility of testimony, in our opinion are without merit. The testimony objected to related to the practicability of attaching a guard to,the saw in question without rendering it useless for defendant’s purposes. It was, consequently, in our opinion, properly admitted. The verdict is not excessive. Plaintiff’s hand is badly crippled, so much so that he is prevented from following his trade as a moulder, and is obliged to seek employment that is much less remunerative. Higher verdicts for almost similar injuries have been sustained by the courts. We have not been convinced that either motion should be sustained.</p>
