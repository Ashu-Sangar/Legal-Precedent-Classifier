The respondent was at the time the sole judge of the courts. The respondent filed an answer to the effect that the estate of the debtor in question was greatly involved and had necessitated receiverships of twelve other estates, amounting in all to one hundred million dollars; that the interest of the petitioner and other creditors would be best preserved by a delay in the filing of the orders; and that all parties interested, with the exception of the petitioner, had consented to such delay. Held, the answer was insufficient and the petitioner was entitled to the writ of mandamus as prayed for.</p>

There was a full statement by counsel of their reasons for desiring a further postponement of action by the court. All of the parties interested were invited and urged by the court to give full expression to their opinions either for or against the application for further postponement of the decisions, in order that the court might obtain the true sentiment of the parties interested and be fully advised as to, what counsel believed would be for the best interests of all the parties concerned. It was represented to the court that the postponement of the decisions up to that time had been of great benefit to the receivership estates and to the community at large, in that valuable assets of the receivership estates had not been required to be sacrificed, thus greatly benefiting all unsecured creditors, and in that in the meantime numerous persons not in the hands of receivers but whose estates had been jeopardized by the financial embarrassments of those already in the hands of receivers had. been enabled to adjust their financial affairs so that they would be in no future danger.of financial troubles as the result of the financial embarrassments of the said Josiah V. Thompson and others whose estates were then in the hands of receivers; that no injury had resulted to any of the unsecured creditors of any of the parties in the hands of receivers by reason of the postponement of the decision of the court up to that time, and that on account of the improved conditions of business, the nature of the assets of the receivership estates, and the prospects for an early adjustment of the financial embarrassments of said Josiah V. Thompson and others whose estates were in the hands of receivers, it would be to the very great interest and advantage of all the unsecured creditors of said receivership estates, and of vital interest to the community at large, that a further postponement of the decisions of the court be had. A number of the attorneys who addressed <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>the court in favor of the further postponement of the court’s decisions stated that they were not only representing clients but were large creditors themselves of some of the receivership estates, and that it was their wish and desire that the court should grant the application for further postponement of the decisions. In the discussion before the court it appeared that many millions of dollars of claims were represented by those favoring the further postponing of the court’s decisions, while those opposed thereto represented comparatively small amounts. Some of counsel present, in addition to representing their own clients, stated that they were authorized to speak for other members of the bar representing large claims and to represent to the court that they also were in favor of the further postponement of the decisions. At the close of the arguments of counsel an informal motion was made by one of the attorney’s present that the filing of the court’s decisions be further postponed until March 14, 1916. In order to ascertain the sentiment of counsel on that motion the court asked all the attorneys interested who were in favor of the motion to rise to their feet, and in response thereto eighteen lawyers arose. Upon the request of the court for those to arise who were opposed to the motion only two members of the bar indicated their opposition thereto, being those representing William Funk, the petitioner for the mandamus in this case. Several members of the bar representing claims against the receivership estates who were not present in court had sent word that they favored the postponement of the court’s decisions until a later date. Whereupon I stated that in view of the almost unanimous request of the creditors, as represented by counsel, no decision would be rendered prior to March 14, 1916, which was the date suggested to the court by counsel themselves, unless conditions should so change in the meantime as to make earlier action advisable, and I then suggested to counsel that the matter could again <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>be called to the attention of the court if conditions should so change.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.6",284,[300,1049,1149,575]]]'>Such petition alleged that in the event of the lower court being ordered to file the opinion and orders immediately similar action would have to be taken where other, petitioners who were creditors of the estate had filed like applications and that such action would result in thousands of suits, would force the estate of the debtor in question into bankruptcy, and throw thousands of workmen out of employment; and prayed that the facts therein recited be given consideration in the determination of the rule to show cause granted on the respondent.</p>

The petition of the members of the bar of Fayette County, filed by permission of the court, has no proper place in the pleadings. Let the writ of mandamus go out at respondent’s costs.</p>
