Beach on Private Corporations, Section 421. And it may be that a mortgage securing funds to be used for such a purpose is void when the mortgagee is shoivn to have knowledge of the purposes and consented to the wrongful use. Here, however, the evidence is not sufficient to justify a finding that the moneys were loaned by the complainant upon any understanding or agreement that the moneys were to be applied by the borrower, the Pittsburg-Buffalo Company, in financing the Four States Coal and Coke Company. It may be true as is contended by exceptant that the cash resources of the coal company unless aided by borrowed money were insufficient to enable it to advance the Four States Coal and Coke Company the amount loaned, to wit, $1,500,000. But the inference sought to be drawn that the complainant knew and had full knowledge that the sum borrowed was to be used by the Pittsburg-Buffalo Company in financing the coal and coke company is not justified by the evidence.</p>
