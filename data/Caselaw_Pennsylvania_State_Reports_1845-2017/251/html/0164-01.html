L. 237, and April 25, 1907, P. L. 104. From an examination of the answer to the petition there is no definite denial that the road was not an abandoned turnpike. The fact that the supervisors may have worked on and kept this highway in repair for a number of years would not relieve the commissioners from keeping the road in repair, if these acts commanding this to be done are constitutional. The averment that the road was taken over by the State highway department lacks definiteness, in that it is not shown under what act of assembly this was done, the route number with the information therein contained, and the time when the State highway department assumed jurisdiction. “While the act of assembly may have incorporated this highway into the State highway system by a given route, the procedure indicated by the laws creating and regulating State highways must be complied with; and this answer should have set forth when the State assumed control. The court below states that the formal notice of the State highway depart<a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>ment assuming jurisdiction over the highway, was given to. take effect June 15, 1915.”</p>
