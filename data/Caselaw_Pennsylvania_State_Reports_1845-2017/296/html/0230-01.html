Sanson, Esq., 1218 Chestnut Street, the sum of $4,591. Through some unexplained mistake of its officials, plaintiff’s check for that sum, drawn by and upon itself, was made to the order of S. W. Samson, who, so far as appears, was a nonexistent person. Through another unexplained mistake of its officials, the check was mailed to Albert W. Sampson, 5842 Crittenden Street, Philadelphia, who had no interest in the settlement or right to the money; the letter, with which the check was enclosed, being also directed to him and stating, “We are enclosing herewith check to your order in the amount of $4,591,” etc., etc. Before the check left plaintiff’s bank, or shortly thereafter and before it was taken to defendant, the mistaken name of S. W. Samson was changed to the equally mistaken one of A. W. Sampson<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> (to whom, as already stated, the check was mailed), by writing the latter name over the former. No attempt was made to conceal the change; it was observable even on the most casual glance. It i% difficult to believe plaintiff’s contention that it was made after mailing, since, while fastened to the letter addressed to Albert W. Sampson, it passed under the scrutiny of five of plaintiff’s officials or employees, one of whom signed it, <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>another OK’d it, one or two others verified it and a fifth signed the letter to Sampson which said “We are enclosing herewith check to your order”; but, in the view we take of the matter, it is of no consequence when the change was made. Such alterations in the name of the payee are quite common in checks brought for deposit, the custom of banks, when they occur, being to refuse to receive the check in question except for collection, and to pay nothing on account of it until it has been honored by the drawee bank.</p>
    <p id="b258-4" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[282,896,1154,1563]],["BL_259.1",259,[175,346,1168,253]]]'>Albert W. Sampson, to whom, as stated, plaintiff sent the check, took it to defendant and sought to open an account with it. Because of the alteration in the name of the payee, defendant, following the custom of banks above referred to, refused to take the check except for collection, and this being assented to by Sampson, he endorsed it in the presence of defendant’s officials, they stamped upon it their endorsement, which contained also the words “prior endorsements guaranteed,” and, in due course, the check, palpably altered as stated, was presented to and paid by plaintiff. A few days later, Sampson called on defendant to see if the check had been honored, defendant called plaintiff up on the telephone, and one of the officials of the latter, after inquiry regarding or examination of the altered check, replied that it had been paid. Defendant then allowed Sampson to open a checking account with it, and the whole amount was paid to him, or on his order, before defendant received any notice that the check should not have been paid by plaintiff. Fifty-two days after plaintiff had paid the check, A. W. Sanson, Esq., to whom it should have been drawn, inquired of plaintiff why he had not received his money. This led to an investigation, the errors above set forth were discovered, and five days later plaintiff notified defendant thereof and demanded a refund of the amount of the check. This being refused, plaintiff sued defendant on its endorsement; the trial judge refused defendant’s point for binding instructions, but gave such instructions for plaintiff; a <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>verdict was rendered accordingly; the court in banc refused to enter judgment non obstante veredicto for defendant, but instead, entered judgment on the verdict, and defendant prosecuted this appeal. The judgment, is erroneous for several reasons..</p>
    <p id="b259-3" data-blocks='[["BL_259.4",259,[175,619,1153,1564]]]'>In the first place, it should have been entered for defendant, because of Land Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Bank, <a href="/pa/196/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="196 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="916771" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0230-01">196 Pa. 230</a>, from which it cannot be distinguished in principle. There the check was drawn to the order of the proper person, but handed by plaintiff’s employee to a third party, supposed to be the proper person, and was endorsed by that third party and deposited in the defendant bank, which also endorsed it and collected its amount from plaintiff. After the fund had been paid out by defendant, the mistake was discovered, plaintiff sued defendant on its endorsement, the trial court, as here, gave binding instructions in plaintiff’s favor, but we reversed and entered judgment for defendant, because the money was in fact paid to the person to whom plaintiff, by its actions, showed it intended the money should be paid, though there, as here also, plaintiff thought it would be used by an entirely different person. There is, of course, no difference in principle between delivering a check to the wrong person by <em>handing </em>it to him, supposing him to be the right one, and delivering a check to the wrong person by <em>mailing </em>it to him, supposing him to be the right one. In that case, as in this, plaintiff caused a specified person to receive the check, expecting he would use it, defendant endorsed the check and collected it from plaintiff, and thereafter paid its amount to the person to whom plaintiff had delivered it. There an instructed verdict for the drawer was reversed, and here a like instructed verdict must receive the same treatment.</p>

W. Sampson,” was the signature of the A. W. Sampson, to whom plaintiff sent the check, and not the signature of A. W. Sanson, Esq., to whom it was neither drawn nor sent, and of whom defendant had no knowledge. Neither defendant, nor any one else to whom the check was given, could know, nor were they required to know, that, in the minds of those acting for plaintiff, there was an undisclosed intention to have the money received by some one other than the person named on the face of the check. The liability is not to be determined by a consideration of plaintiff’s undisclosed intent, but by determining whether or not it was negligent in delivering the check to the one who obtained the money on it (Houser v. Nat. Bank of Chambersburg, <a href="/pa-super/27/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="27 Pa. Super. 613" data-case-ids="856529" data-case-paths="/pa-super/27/0613-01">27 Pa. Superior Ct. 613</a>, per Rice, P. J.); that it was, is an admitted fact in the instant case. This is, indeed, the law respecting any written instrument, but it is especially so in regard to commercial paper, for, from the earliest days to the present, it has always been held to be a “courier without luggage.”</p>

Case, know of the circumstances under which the check was given. Nor is it a matter of any consequence, in the consideration of the present point, even if the fact be so, that the name of the payee was altered after the check left plaintiff’s bank, for the point of the decision in the Land Title &amp; Trust Co. Case — and it is equally applicable here —is that the money was paid to the one to whom plaintiff delivered the check, in order that it might be paid to him. So, also, the objection last stated fails for the further <em>reason </em>— and <em>this is an additional and independent basis for entering judgment for defendant </em>— that “it is not reasonable to charge the bank with the consequences of the payment of a forged endorsement when <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>the plaintiff put in circulation checks which were not susceptible of a genuine endorsement [there being no S.

Case to the present situation, growing out of the statement in the opinion there (page 238) that the Avrongdoer “would have received money instead of a check if he had asked for it, or he could have drawn the money in the banking department in an adjoining room,” which could not have been done here, and the later award of a new venire, as set forth in a footnote to that case (the reason for such award, as shown by the petition for it, appearing in our records to January Term, 1899, No. 285, being the statement just quoted, which it was alleged was not true in fact), is clearly shown to be imaginary by our opinion when the case.reached us after the second trial: Land Title &amp; Trust Co. v.

In that opinion we said (page 214) : “The only fact not developed on the first trial, which was proved on the second, was that the check yms taken to the banking department of the institution by the person to whom it had been delivered, and payment demanded. The paying teller refused to pay it unless the person presenting it was identified, whereupon the latter said he would deposit it in his own bank. This was the person to whom the settlement clerk of [defendant] had handed the check, intending to designate him as the payee, [but] the appellee, which had no knowledge” of this is not affected by it. There, we affirmed the judgment on an instructed verdict for defendant, despite that new evidence, and it may be. of interest to observe <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>that we also- said (page 213) : “In the note to the report of the [first] case in 50 L.

    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[285,510,1151,903]]]'>There is, however, a still more important reason for entering judgment for defendant in the present case, growing out of plaintiff’s long delay, after the check was paid by it, in discovering that it was paid to or on account of A. W. Sampson, and not A. W. Sanson, Esq., who was its real creditor; and also in the delay in notifying defendant, after the fact of the erroneous payment was actually known by plaintiff. The leading case on these points is Price v. Neal, 3 Burr. 354, by Lord Mansfield. It holds that if the drawee actually paid on a forged instrument, he was, by that fact alone, debarred from recovering back from an innocent payee. There are a multitude of cases sustaining this conclusion, and but a few varying from it: see note <a href="/citations/?q=12%20A.L.R.%201089" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="12 A.L.R. 1089">12 A.

Bank of the United States, 1 Binney 27. To relieve against this severity, the rule was modified by section 10 of the Act of April 5, 1849, P. L. 424, 426. It provides that where the signature of any “drawer, acceptor or endorser, shall have been forged thereon,” recovery back can be had by the payer: see Tradesmen’s Nat. Bank v. Third Nat.

A forger may be insolvent or beyond the reach of civil or criminal process, but, by prompt proceedings against him, others may become interested in him and come to his assistance, who after delay may not do so. This incident to a bank’s right to promptly proceed against a forger is not to be overlooked. Whenever a depositor knowingly withholds from it knowledge without which it cannot so proceed in an effort to protect itself, he ought to be regarded, when he comes to enforce alleged rights against it, as having withheld from it a substantial right, without regard to what might or might not have resulted from a prompt exercise of that right.”</p>

If there be any difference between them, the principle is stronger here than there; for there the acceptor is [only] presumed to know the drawer’s signature. Here, a fortiori, the maker must be presumed and is bound to know his own notes. He cannot be heard to aver his ignorance; and when he receives notes, purporting to be his own, without objection, it is an adoption of them as his own.” This reasoning is so cogent and convincing, as respects cases arising under the law merchant, as to obviate the necessity for further quoting from or considering the drawer-drawee cases. From them, the inevitable conclusion is that plaintiff, as drawer of the check, was bound to know, when it was presented for payment, whether, when it mailed the check to Albert W. Sampson, it was payable to his order, as in the accompanying letter plaintiff said it was, or whether it was still drawn to the nonexistent S. W. Samson, and was afterwards altered to make A. W. Sampson the payee. It must be remembered, in this connection also, that the alteration of the name was not a skilfully hidden Iking, but plainly observable when plaintiff paid the check.</p>

In the case last cited, it will be recalled that the drawee bank was refused the right to recover back, because of five days delay in discovering the forgery; here we have 52 days delay in discovering the erroneous payment, and 5 days additional delay in notifying defendant, after plaintiff had actual knowledge thereof. In the case of a skillful forgery there might be some excuse, in fact if not in law, in failing to detect it. Here, where the alteration in the name was patent, even that excuse fails. But there can be no excuse for a failure to give immediate notice after the facts are known. In States v. First Nat.

The check was intended for' A. W. Sanson. He was an attorney who was entitled to receive the money in payment of a mortgage. By mistake, the check was mailed to Albert W. Sampson, a police officer. When Sampson received the check he took it to the Chelten Trust Company. He had no account there and they knew nothing about him except that he was recognized by the teller who received the check from him as a police officer whom he had seen in the vicinity of the bank. When the check was presented it had been <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>altered so that the payee read “A. W. Sanpson.” It was endorsed “A. W. Sampson.” The teller did not pay the cheek, but put it to the credit of Albert W. Sampson in a saving fund. Instead of forwarding the check to the Market Street Title &amp; Trust Company for collection, defendant endorsed it generally, guaranteeing the prior endorsement and forwarded it, presumably through the clearing house. A few days thereafter, Sampson called at the Chelten Trust Company, requesting that the funds represented by the check be put in such shape that he could draw against them. The Trust Company called up the plaintiff, asked if the check had been paid; plaintiff said that it had been, and thereupon the money was placed by the defendant to Albert. W.

He and his wife testified that they did not alter the check. The testimony on behalf of the plaintiff was that the check when it left its hands was unaltered. The inference is very strong that the man who perpetrated the fraud had forged the altered name of the payee, but this plays no important part in the matter. Subsequently the real payee of the check called upon the plaintiff for the money; this led to an investigation and the discovery of the fraud and this suit was brought by it against defendant to recover the amount of the check under its guaranty. I would hold the defendant liable, otherwise its guaranty of prior endorsements amounts to nothing. I think it should be determined that such an endorsement amounts to a declaration by the endorsing bank that the proper payee, the individual to whom the drawer of the check intended the money to be paid, had endorsed it, otherwise with the vast number of checks passing through banks in today’s great volume of business, drawee banks will have no adequate protection against forgeries. The legal determination, so it seems to me, should' be that a drawee bank <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>(or one as in this case which is both drawer of the check and drawee) need only look at the forwarding bank’s endorsement; if that is a guarantee of prior endorsements, the drawee bank can pay to the bank so endorsing without being affected in any way by the invalidity of prior endorsements: Nat.

There the paying and forwarding bank had not endorsed guaranteeing prior endorsements, but had endorsed for collection only, as the dissenting opinion discloses. That case involved an impostor to whom the drawer in fact meant the check to go, and the decision was expressly predicated on that fact. The impostor cases, as I understand them, are limited to the instances when the swindler presents himself in person and receives the instrument as his own. I am unable to agree that the plaintiff here, as drawer, intended Albert W. Sampson to receive payment merely because the envelope containing the check was addressed to him.

Defendant’s teller who accepted the police officer’s endorsement did not know that he was A. W. Sampson, save from his own statement, and knew nothing about the letter forwarding the , check to him. He appeared at the Trust Company with the bare check, with nothing to show that it was his.

The draft, bearing these endorsements, was presented to the plaintiff and paid by it. Subsequently it was notified, not only that the endorsement of the name of John Davis, the payee of the draft was a forgery, but that a fraud had been perpetrated upon the beneficial order by falsely representing that Benjamin Davis, who was a member of the order, was dead and that his beneficiary, John Davis, was therefore entitled to receive the amount payable on his death. The defendant endeavored to avoid liability by averring that the draft was issued by the beneficial organization without proper precaution having been taken to ascertain whether or not the person insured was alive, and it set up that this negligence was imputed to the plaintiff bank by reason of its being the depositary of the funds of the order. As to this defefise it was said: “The matter which it is thus sought to inject into the case as a defense has no proper place there. The liability of the defendant here is that of an endorser. The form in which its endorsement was placed upon the back of the draft, was not the mere writing of its name there, which of itself would create an implied warranty of the genuineness of the previous endorsements, but it was more; the defendant expressly guaranteed the previous endorsements. What reason then is there for excusing it from complying with the terms of its contract?...... The form in which the defendant endorsed the draft, makes clear its intention not only to transfer, but to be bound as endorser, and as guaranteeing the validity of the prior endorsements.” But, it is argued, plaintiff’s acts or negligence as <em>drawer, </em>in not noting the alteration when the cheek was returned to it and giving <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>prompt notice, prevent recovery.

I agree, of course, that a drawee bank cannot maintain an action against a collecting bank unless it suffers a loss (Brady, op. cit. page 152), but I do not agree that anything done here by plaintiff, as drawer, would bar its right of action if it were suing its drawee bank. See Brady, page 455. In Union Tool Co. v. Farmers’ &amp; Merchants’ Nat. Bank, <a href="/cal/192/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="192 Cal. 40" data-case-ids="2143274" data-case-paths="/cal/192/0040-01">192 Cal. 40</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20P.%20424" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="218 P. 424">218 Pac. 424</a>, the payee’s name was altered and then the endorsement forged. The drawer was, nevertheless, permitted to recover from the drawee. The court said: “Assuming that the plaintiff (drawer) was negligent in not making a more thorough examination of the returned checks ......still the depositing bank may not escape liability for the payment of amounts paid on forged checks unless it has itself been free from negligence.” In my opinion, therefore, defendant is liable to the plaintiff for money paid upon a forged endorsement, and plaintiff, as drawer or drawee, is not precluded from setting up the forgery, and that the caséis essentially different from the so-called “impostor” cases, the “fictitious payee” cases such as Snyder v. Corn Exchange Nat. Bank, <a href="/pa/221/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="221 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="956143" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0599-01">221 Pa. 599</a>, and also the cases in which the amount of the check has been raised or the check issued in such condition as to facilitate alteration, forgery and fraud. We are here dealing with a forged endorsement which had been guaranteed by defendant to be genuine. This act made the fraud and consequent loss possible, without <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>this guarantee the swindler would have been detected when the check came to plaintiff’s hand.</p>
    <p id="b273-3" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[175,471,1150,526]]]'>I would further hold that the delay of five days in giving defendant notice of the forgery .was not an unreasonable one under the circumstances. The Trust Company was no different from any other endorser and certainly an individual endorser would not be relieved by the delay. Furthermore, from my viewpoint the success of the forgery was due to the active negligence of the defendant and it should not be permitted to take advantage of its own lack of care. I would affirm the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b273-4" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[178,1041,1147,89]]]'>Mr. Justice Frazer and Mr. Justice Sadler joined in the dissent.</p>
