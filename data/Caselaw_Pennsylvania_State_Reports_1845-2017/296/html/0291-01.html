It will be noted in this case that when the renewal note of September 8 th was given, the original of June 8th was retained by the bank, and, clearly, the former could not then be treated as a substitute for the latter. When, however, the second became due on December 8th, a different course was pursued by the bank, and the new note of the Triangle Silk Mfg. Co. was accepted and the earlier obligation of September 8th surrendered. We find here defendant in the actual possession of the renewal previously given, and an apparent acceptance of a new paper in lieu thereof. Ordinarily, this would raise a question of fact as to whether or not-it was the intention of the bank to accept the new note in place of that executed by Lipschitz as an individual.</p>

Later, on December 24th, the last named, president and chief executive of the bank, furnished to the defendant a list of the obligations on which Lipschitz was personally liable, and those of the Triangle Silk Mfg. Co., adding to the latter that of December 8, 1926, executed by it. It was then suggested that a new obligation should be signed by the corporation for $10,000, which had been fixed as the limit of credit which should be given to the company, and that payment of this should be guaranteed by Lipschitz. A copy of the new note, so endorsed, was forwarded for execution to the defendant, but he refused to sign the warranty. He did lift three accommodation notes on which his individual liability was apparent, but refused to assume responsibility for the note of December 8th, insisting that new paper had been accepted in lieu thereof.</p>

It may be observed that no fraud on the part of defendant in effecting the change or securing the actual possession of his note is averred. The president and chief executive of the bank was Greenzweig, and it was through his solicitation, and a director of the bank, Lewis, that the signature to the original note was secured so as to make good the acceptance chargeable to the manufacturing company. The fact that defendant became the accommodation maker, with full knowledge of the bank, would be no defense to the note originally executed, yet the circumstances which caused it to be given may be considered in determining whether the final acceptance on December 8th of the Triangle note was intentional and impliedly agreed to be in substitution for the earlier notes.</p>

It is contended that a president and chief executive had no power to discount or accept new paper without express consent of his board of directors, and that therefore any attempted substitution of the note of December 8th by him, or with his knoweldge and consent, being without express warrant, was ineffective. It is true that where such an officer acts beyond the scope of his general authority, the institution which he represents will not be bound by his acts: Mutual Trust Co. v. Stern, <a href="/pa/235/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="235 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="984840" data-case-paths="/pa/235/0202-01">235 Pa. 202</a>; Lehigh Val. Nat. Bank v.

Here the renewal note was surrendered by the <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>bookkeeper upon the presentation of a new obligation, while the president and chief executive was temporarily absent at lunch, but upon his return he was informed of what had been done, and made no immediate demand for a return of the obligation surrendered-. Later, he telephoned and communicated by letter of. December 24th, already referred to, not then suggesting that the Triangle note had not been substituted with authority for the earlier one of Lipschitz, but endeavoring to have him reassume liability by guaranteeing a new obligation of the silk company for $10,000, which was the limit of credit fixed for that corporation in the particular bank by its directors. No specific approval of the transaction by the board as such appears, but, on the other hand, we find no express repudiation, though the whole question was later referred, as appears by the minutes, to the attorney of the institution on January 4th following. At that time the action of the executive committee of the bank as to prior transactions was generally approved by the directors. By the by-laws, the president, who was a member of it, was required to report all loans or renewals, and the executive committee, of which he was a member, had imposed upon it the duty of acting on all loans. Greenzweig testified that “when the note was taken it was brought to the attention of the board.”</p>

It may well be that no such purpose existed, and, if it did not, then the new note is to be treated merely as collateral security for the earlier, one on which suit was brought, but the note was surrendered into the possession of defendant, and the evidence indicates that there was knowledge by the directors of the substitution. Whether there was any intention that Lipschitz, the maker, should be relieved, and the silk company made <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>solely liable in Ms place, is a matter of doubt, but tbe circumstances attending tbe transaction are such as to make these questions conflicting ones of fact, and a summary verdict for plaintiff should not have been ordered.
