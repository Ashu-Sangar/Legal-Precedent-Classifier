Early, minority stockholders of the Early Foundry Company, filed a bill in equity against that corporation and Anna E. Early, “secretary, director and^ stockholder,” (hereinafter designated as “defendant”) and John F. Grier, “president, director and stockholder,” praying for the appointment of a receiver, the winding up of the corporation’s affairs and the dis<a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>tribution of its assets; and that, in the meantime, an injunction should issue to restrain the individual defendants and others connected with the company from interfering with its management; general relief also was asked. None of the specific prayers was granted, but, under the prayer for general relief, the court below decreed that defendant should pay back to the corporation certain salaries drawn by her as its secretary; and she has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[248,831,1153,1236]]]'>The bill averred, inter alia, that the corporation had fourteen stockholders, defendant owning a little more than one-half of the entire capital stock, plaintiff J. W. Early about one-fifth, and the balance being distributed among others named; that the majority of the stock was originally owned by John P. Early, the founder of the company, who was the brother of plaintiff J. W. Early and the husband of defendant, and who, until his death in 1926, controlled the corporation; that John P. Early bequeathed his stock to defendant, and friction as to the company’s management then arose between her and the four plaintiffs, who at that time were directors of the corporation. Plaintiff J. W. Early occupied also an executive position in the management of the corporation, he having been assistant to John P. Early during the latter’s lifetime. Plaintiffs further averred that John P. Early had drawn a salary, as manager, of $150 a week, and that, after his death, “in order to help Mrs. Early,” she was paid $250 a month “as secretary”; that, at a later date, after a new board of directors had been elected, her salary was fixed at $150 a week. The total of this last mentioned salary is the amount in controversy.</p>

In this connection, she averred that the old board of directors, of which three of the plaintiffs were members, had at first given her $150 a week, and, in November, 1926, they voted her a salary of $90 a week; that, in May, 1927, the new board, of which she was a member, passed a resolution “authorizing the said Anna E. Early to adjust salaries,” in pursuance of which she thereafter received $150 a week. Finally, on -the point of compensation paid to defendant, the answer • contains the following paragraph: “If the court should be of the opinion that the board of directors in voting to her, for acting as secretary, the same salary which the former board ......, of which three of the plaintiffs, Joseph W. Early, Thomas J. Shannon and J. J. O’Connor, were members, is unreasonable, that she is ready and willing to have the court fix her salary at the $90.00 per week which was fixed by the said directors at the meeting in November, 1926, and of which no complaint has been made, and to do such other things as to the court may.seem just and proper so as to best effectuate the carrying out of the charter purposes of the said company, and to make the same a success”; then, at the trial, defendant was asked by her counsel: “If the court should feel,......because of the law or auy other reason, that [your] salary should be reduced and an injunction issued to restrain you from taking that salary and fixing it at any sum which to the court would appear reasonable in view of -the testimony in this case, would you be satisfied with that?” to which she answered, “Yes.”</p>

    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[312,1000,1152,1019]]]'>The by-laws of the corporation explicitly provide that the board of directors “shall determine the salary to be paid the president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer.” Mrs. Early and her brother, John P. Grier, who is the second member of the present board and president of the company, had no power to depart from this law of the corporation, and, by resolution authorize her, as they did, to fix her own salary; particularly in the absence of the plaintiff J. W. Early, the third and only other member of the board. Any fixing of salaries had to be done by the board, and not by an individual member of that body, who, as an interested official of the corporation, would personally profit by the readjustment of compensation. This, in itself, is sufficient to warrant setting aside the compensation of $150 per week paid to defendant, following such readjustment of salaries. Here, however, the record shows no request for a surcharge to that extent, and apparently even the plaintiffs agreed that Mrs. Early was entitled to a proper salary.</p>

The chancellor, feeling, as he did, that the services rendered by Mrs. Early&gt;did not justify the compensation drawn by her, — that her salary was exorbitant, — should have found as a fact to what extent it was exorbitant; and, instead of ordering her to “return forthwith to the treasury of the Early Foundry Company the amounts taken by her as salary from June 1,1927,” he should have directed that she return so much of these moneys as represented the excess over proper compensation. In determining'"this question, the fact that the board of directors, composed in part of the present plaintiffs, in November, 1926, voted appellant a salary of $90 a week would have to be taken into account, and unless it appears that this represented a plain abuse of power, harmful to the corporation, and therefore to the minority stockholders, no court should undertake to <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>interfere with the decision of the managers of the corporation.</p>

We agree with the court below that this did not necessarily “estop” plaintiffs “from objecting” when defendant overturned their management, and a new board of directors, of which she was a member, permitted her to draw a higher salary than she had immediately theretofore been paid; but we agree also that the chancellor correctly confined his consideration of plaintiff’s objection to the salary drawn by defendant after the action of the new board, and in this plaintiffs apparently acquiesce, since they have not appealed.</p>

While the cases are rare in which a court should interfere in a matter of corporate management such as is here involved, yet, when a situation of this kind is taken in hand, it must be disposed of with minute care. Moreover, when a matter such is adjusted, it must appear that the chancellor has not merely substituted his judgment for that of the legally constituted managers of the corporation on a state of facts as to which it is reasonably conceivable that there might be a difference of opinion, — in all such cases, the record must also show that the managers have been guilty of an abuse of power, harmful to the corporation and therefore to the minority stockholders; in short, that a posi<a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>tive wrong has been found, which, so far as possible under the circumstances, the chancellor has endeavored to cure with equal justice to all concerned.</p>

Both parties, having had their day in court, should now endeavor to harmonize their differences before they destroy the valuable property in which they are mutually interested.</p>
