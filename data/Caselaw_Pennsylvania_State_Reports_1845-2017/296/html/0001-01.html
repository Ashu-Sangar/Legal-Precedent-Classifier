The verdict and judgment were for defendant, and plaintiff in this appeal specifies five alleged errors, which do not question the trial judge’s rulings on the admission or rejection of evidence, but challenge the following conclusions only: (1) that the evidence, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to establish a resulting trust in favor of defendant; and (2) that plaintiff, who <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>is an employee of Scott, was not a bona fide purchaser from him, but was simply holding the legal title for him.</p>

At the trial, the dispute regarding this purchase and construction was whether, as plaintiff alleged, Scott did these things under an agreement that he would underwrite the transaction, saying to the congregation that it might thereafter get the title by repaying the amount spent by him; or, as defendant alleged, Scott agreed, before the purchase of the land, that he would buy it and erect the building with money loaned by him to the congregation, — he, as its financial agent, expending it for the purposes stated —and would hold the property for them until they paid him $8,000, with interest beginning two years thereafter, the balance of the cost, whatever it might be, to be contributed by him as one of the church members. It further appeared by defendant’s evidence (which must be accepted as true, when considering whether or not plaintiff was entitled to binding instructions (Fluke v. Lang, <a href="/pa/283/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="283 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1090548" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0054-01">283 Pa. 54</a>; Kohn v.

This was agreed to, and it was further agreed that, if the church continued to pay the interest at the rate of six per centum per annum, Scott would <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>hold the property for it, and, after its incorporation, it was to take title and give him a mortgage for the $8,000. He admitted this arrangement except as to the mortgage; he said he wanted the $8,000 in money. In accordance with this agreement the treasurer of the congregation gave to him, on three several occasions, and he accepted and used, three checks: One for $240, which specified on its face that it was for “6 months int. Wharton Avenue Baptist Church”; one for $240, which specified on its face “Wharton Avenue Baptist Church”; and one for $480, which specified on its face “interest on Wharton Avenue Baptist Church to June 1,1926.” Subsequently, Scott got into a dispute with the pastor and some of the congregation, resulting in a statement by him, when the trustees, after incorporation, sought to arrange with him for the payment of the $8,000, that he would not transfer the property to the church at any price. Later he conveyed it to plaintiff, who had long been and still is one of his employees, who said he raised such money as he alleged was paid, by borrowing it from friends of his, who were unnamed and unknown, and were not called to corroborate him; that he had a written agreement of purchase with Scott, which he did not produce; that he knew there was some arrangement between Scott and defendant regarding the property, but not its exact terms, nor did he make any inquiry on the subject, though he knew defendant was in possession under that arrangement; that he took out no searches, and did not attempt to ascertain whether or not there were any taxes, liens or claims against the property, but accepted a deed, stating the purchase price as $1 only, without referring to any other consideration. This is the title under which he now claims.</p>

Neither by his pleadings, nor in the evidence, is it anywhere suggested that he has any right if Scott had not. On the contrary, when asked if he did not buy subject to defendant’s occupancy, he replied: “Yes, surely. Let me say here, the same law that was protecting Mr. Scott, has protected me as a buyer.” Despite this, and apparently without any suggestion from plaintiff, the trial judge charged the jury as follows: “So far as the plaintiff in this case, Mr. Lukens, is concerned, if he bought this church bona fide of Mr. Scott, then, even if there were a trust, he would be entitled to recover, because the law requires, in cases of resulting trusts, that a declaration of trust by the trustee must be made and recorded in the recorder’s office, or the cestui que trust must bring an action of ejectment, so that a bona fide purchaser may know that there is a trust. You will recall all the testimony in regard to the purchase of this church by Mr. Lukens; and ......decide from all this testimony whether Mr. Lukens is a bona fide purchaser of that property, or whether he is simply acting for the benefit of the grantor in the deed, Mr. Scott.” There was ample evidence, too elaborate to be further detailed, to justify the submis<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>sion of this question to the jury. Indeed, Scott’s intemperate answers and plaintiff’s evasions, when taken with the other evidence, impress us with the belief, as they must have more strongly impressed the trial judge and jury who heard and saw those witnesses, that the deed from Scott to plaintiff was a means adopted by the former, with the aid of the latter, to get even with the pastor and congregation, with whom he was once so closely affiliated, but from whom he had now become violently estranged. The jury’s verdict, therefore, settles this question also; and hence it is conclusively established: (1) that there was, as between Scott and defendant, an enforceable trust; and (2) that plaintiff was not a bona fide purchaser from Scott, but is “simply acting for the benefit of......Scott,” and thus the only points made by appellant are decided against him.</p>
