    <p id="b140-7" data-blocks='[["BL_140.13",140,[294,1220,1149,521]]]'>Plaintiff went into a small restaurant for lunch. He ordered two cheese sandwiches and a bottle of coca-cola. The sandwiches were prepared by the dealer, who placed mustard on the cheese at plaintiff’s request. The dealer took a bottle of coca-cola from the ice box, removed the cap, and handed to plaintiff the sandwiches and the bottle. Plaintiff was injured from swallowing ground and broken glass which he testified came from the bottle. This action was instituted against the manufacturer, and a verdict was recovered in the court below.</p>

    <p id="b141-3" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[171,571,1151,859]]]'>Appellant contends that no causal connection between defendant and the accident has been shown, nor is there any evidence from which it may be inferred. The dealer (restaurant keeper) had been a regular customer of defendant for years; he could not purchase coca-cola elsewhere, and had the day before bought the case from which the bottle was taken. It had' remained in his exclusive possession since that time. This' bottle had been moved a few moments before the accident from the case to the ice box. The dealer later took it from the ice box and removed the sealed cap. The carbonated water effervesced, and the taste was sweet and pleasant, like that of a freshly opened bottle. Within a few moments the customer complained; the bottle was examined, and a teaspoonful or more of broken glass was found in the bottom, while other particles adhered to the sides.</p>
    <p id="b141-4" data-blocks='[["BL_141.5",141,[174,1442,1148,367]]]'>It thus appears the bottle had not been tampered with after it left defendant’s possession; • otherwise it would not have effervesced. No facility was at hand to open, recarbonate and seal the bottle; nor did anyone other than the dealer have an opportunity to handle the contents.

This question compre<a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>bends a further discussion of the general principle above announced. Defendant, a manufacturer, sends a bottle containing a beverage to be drunk by a consumer, in the bottom of which is lodged a half-inch of broken glass-. In the ordinary conduct of its business this glass would not be there. It could get there only through accident or the carelessness of some servant along the line of preparation of the coca-cola, and its placement in the bottle. Before it left the hands of the manufacturer the presence of glass in the bottle could have easily been detected by inspection with modern scientific devices. A manufacturer of foods and beverages owes the duty of reasonable inspection of the commodity beforé placing it on the market for consumption: Catani v. Swift &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/251/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="251 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1019602" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0052-01">251 Pa. 52</a>, 61, 62; Tavani v.

The manufacturer was for all purposes in exclusive control of the bottle and its contents, as its contents were undisturbed until it reached the consumer’s hands. It is a case where the accident proves its own negligent cause, and the jury would be permitted to infer negligence, as the court below instructed it, from the fact that ground glass had been found in the bottom of the bottle. The particular dereliction is not shown, nor was it necessary; the negligent act is demonstrated by showing glass in the bottom of the bottle: Burning v. Hyman, <a href="/pa/286/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="286 Pa. 376" data-case-ids="1096502" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0376-01">286 Pa. 376</a>; Dei v.

The dealer prepared the sandwiches which were eaten by the customer. The glass could have been in them. But the dealer examined the part uneaten, and did not find any glass. This circumstance would not give rise to such a contributing cause that the court could hold, as a matter of law, precluded a recovery. If there was any other cause to which the injury might in equal fairness be attributed, the jury ought not to be permitted to guess which occasioned the injury: Strobel v. Park, <a href="/pa/292/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="292 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1109690" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0200-01">supra, 207</a>. But, as said in this last case, the test is whether the circumstances are such as would satisfy a reasonable and well-balanced -mind that the accident resulted from the negligence of the defendant. The testimony need not exclude everything which the ingenuity of counsel may suggest as having possibly caused or contributed to the injury: Gallivan v. Wark Co., <a href="/pa/288/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="288 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="1100765" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0443-01">288 Pa. 443</a>, 456.</p>
