There was oral testimony that he told the bank the permit was not nearly exhausted. So far as appears, he made no representations to the bank as to the action taken by the congregation. The evidence for the defendant was that the church had obtained loans to the amount of the §15,000 from two local banks shortly after the date of the permit; with which, and some §10,000 additional raised by the congregation, the specified improvements were made during 1923 and 1924. The loan in suit was the only one made by the pastor from plaintiff for defendant, although he was known to the bank and had previously done business with it. The proof tends to show that soon after making the loan in suit the pastor absconded with the §2,500. From the church funds the succeeding pastor paid the interest on this note for two years, but testified that he did so in ignorance of the true situation and without the knowledge or approval of the lay members.</p>

The age of the permit, nearly two and a half years, was such as to require inquiry of the <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>congregation. The plaintiff bank and the church were close neighbors and slight inquiry by the former would doubtless have disclosed the fact that the improvements stated in the permit had been completed and paid for, inter alia, by funds secured from other banks, to the full amount of the permit and that the congregation had refused to request a further permit. If, as a matter of fact, the church had previously secured loans to the full amount of the permit, it was functus officio. One who gives credit to a pastor on the faith of an old permit without inquiry from the congregation does so at his peril. Otherwise a pastor might bankrupt the church for his own purposes despite the limit in the permit. Happily, it is rare that a priest or pastor betrays his church. That the pastor had possession of the old permit proved nothing as to its vitality. The money having been secured from different banks, there was nothing strange in his retention of the permit, especially as it was his warrant for executing the notes. That it had been fully exhausted shortly after its date, quite clearly appeared by the evidence for the defense, yet the proof as to that, being oral, was probably for the jury.</p>

See 2 C. J. 527. Furthermore, he who relies upon the act of an agent must show his authority to do the thing relied upon: Moore’s Executors v.

The authority cannot be proven by the words or acts of the agent (Whiting &amp; Co. v.

He is not authorized under any circumstances blindly to trust the agent’s statements as to the extent of his powers”: 21 R. C. L., page 853. If this loan was valid, one for the <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>entire $15,000 would have been. -So the bishop’s express limit and the like limit of the congregation would go for nought.</p>
