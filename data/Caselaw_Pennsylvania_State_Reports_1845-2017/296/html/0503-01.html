It is not to be supposed that a final agreement and settlement cannot be vacated in proper cases, but the reason for the opening sentence of this opinion is the character of the testimony on which this final agreement was annulled.</p>
    <p id="b529-7" data-blocks='[["BL_529.12",529,[169,1991,1151,421]],["BL_530.1",530,[283,358,1147,207]]]'>The claimant was injured by being squeezed between two mine cars. In the claim filed and signed by him, he stated that the injury resulted in contusions on his back and shoulders. He was immediately treated and no claim was made for specific injuries to any other part ol the body. His compensation was then fixed at $12 per week and he received a total compensation of $62 up to September 19, 1921. At that time he executed a final <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>receipt. He returned to work within twenty days from the time he was injured, and worked for four consecutive years. Ceasing this work he engaged in business, conducting a small candy store for two years.</p>

When his petition to review the final agreement was filed, February 8, 1927, it was stated therein that about two years prior thereto his “injury re-occurred” to the extent that he was then permanently and totally disabled. This was the first intimation given the employer that the employee claimed for further disability from the injury of 1921. While this circumstance would not alone be a determining factor, yet, it, with other attending matters, becomes very important when considering the evidence in support of a petition to review and set aside a final receipt.</p>

The evidence must be more than a scintilla: Conway v. Philadelphia Hardware and Malleable Iron Works, <a href="/pa/232/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="232 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="977816" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0358-01">232 Pa. 358</a>; Johnston v.

While courts have been very generous as to the rules of evidence to establish causation when initial compensation depended on it, yet when that compensation has been paid and a final receipt given, the evidence to overthrow the latter must be of a more definite nature. While the quantity and quality of the evidence necessary to set aside a final receipt in a compensation agreement may not be analogous to that required in other writings, it must be such as to make it certain to the trier of the fact that the mistake existed; and, where the reason 'to set aside is the recurrence of a prior injury, particularly one which has happened many years before, and it depends on the opinion of experts, the causal relation must be shown by testimony as direct and positive as expert and professional testimony can make it; the evidence in this case falls far short of that.</p>

He had been treated for lumbago or muscular rheumatism prior to his injury, and for' the latter he was treated a brief time after -the injury. About ten months after the accident, he called on the physician in relation to his hip; he then thought his trouble was rheumatism, and the doctor diagnosed it as such. According to his statement, he had no pain in his hip for six or eight months after the injury of 1921.</p>

It is apparent at once that, unless great care is maintained in the acceptance of such proof, employers are easily at the mercy of designing employees; it will become quite easy to fabricate testimony to support a recovery, and its contradiction is almost impossible. There was not a scintilla of medical evidence that during a period of at least five years the claimant had ever attempted to secure medical attention. And it was not <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>until February 11, 1927, after Ms petition for review had been presented, that he appeared before a doctor and had an X-ray made of Ms leg. The doctor who made the X-ray testified that he believed the injury was responsible for the hip condition. On cross-examination he based Ms testimony solely on the claimant’s story and his deduction from the X-ray based on that story. He admitted that the hip condition could come from infection, but the condition could more probably be caused by the injury. He said that claimant “gave history of extensive and severe injury of the hip.” There was no evidence on the part of the claimant that he had an extensive and severe injury to his hip; his signed application showed that he had injuries about his back and shoulders. Moreover the facts show otherwise. He went to work in twenty days, and worked for four consecutive years. The doctor said that if the patient had been quiet for six or eight months after the accident he might not have experienced pain, but this claimant worked,— he was not quiet.</p>

He neglected to tell the doctor that he had been treated for lumbago or muscular rheumatism before the accident. And, finally, the doctor’s testimony was too equivocal on which to base such a drastic order as that made by the compensation board. On cross-examination he said: “If it is true he had a severe injury to his hip,” and in answer to a hypothetical question: “I believe it Vas.” It is scarcely necessary to cite authorities to show that equivocating testimony cannot be used as the basis of an award of initial compensation, and for a very much stronger reason should it not be permitted where the effort is to set aside a final receipt because of a recurrence of an injury.
