When asked, “How many men went up <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>there the day of this explosion?” Thomas answered, “Five; I know three of us went up, [the others being] the two fellows that got burned.”</p>

This fire boss, who was careful to see that no open lights or matches were carried into the mine, had, earlier that day, inspected the place where the explosion occurred, and, finding evidence of mine gas, had made a proper mark there to warn the workers; Baranick said he had seen this mark.</p>

The proofs simply established that, to the best of their knowledge, the three men (Baranick, Thomas and Burstitus), who testified, knew of no one except themselves, the deceased and the mine superintendent, being, on this day, at the place where the matches were found. There is nothing to show how long the matches had been there, that the superintendent, who discovered them, did not himself drop them there, or that they were hot dropped by some unknown person. As to the cigarettes, found some 80 feet from the matches, there is no proof that they could not have been left there by some one other than deceased. As a matter of fact, there was evidence that other men working in the mine were near enough- to the scene of the explosion to come quickly to the aid of those injured, and the mine foreman, defendant’s witness, when asked the question, “There might have been somebody else up [the chute where these cigarettes were found] that you don’t know anything about?” answered, “Yes, sir.” Further, it is to be noted that Thomas, who testified that no one visited the scene except the five persons before mentioned, did not, himself, reach the scene until an hour after the explosion; while, during this period, it is known that other men working in the mine had approached within at least seventy feet of the scene. The proofs contain nothing to show that these miners who had come to aid Baranick and his companion were not, during this hour, in the neighborhood of the explosion and at the places where the objects were found. Moreover, it is to be noted that no burned matches or cigarettes were found anywhere.</p>
