The defendant’s single track electric railway, extending southerly from Allentown along the easterly side of a public street, in a partially built-up suburban district, is crossed diagonally at grade by the Allentown and Bethlehem highway. The traveler approaching from the east has a clear view to the south, but to the north his view is obstructed by residences and nearer the track by trees <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>and poles. Just before reaching the track, however, there is a clear view of several hundred feet in that direction. At about five o’clock on the afternoon of November 16, 1925, plaintiff, a resident of Allentown, driving Ms automobile in a westerly direction, approached this crossing, with which he was familiar, at a speed of twelve miles an hour. He Avas vratehing in both directions, especially to the south as it was about time for the Philadelphia Limited. When the front of his auto was Avithin five or six feet of the first rail he passed the line of all obstructions to view and looking to the north saw a rapidly approaching electric car within "cavo hundred feet. Believing he had not sufficient time to clear the crossing and being unable to stop before reaching the track, he turned suddenly to the north (his right), collided AAÚth an electric polo, which threw the auto toward the track whore it came in contact with the electric car and plaintiff was seriously injured. It was admittedly a dangerous crossing, but <em>ike </em>automobile and car in question, approached it on an obtuse angle, so they partially faced each other. The jury found for the plaintiff, but the trial court later entered judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto on the ground of contributory negligence; therefrom plaintiff brought this appeal.</p>

This, plaintiff testified he did. The object of thV; rule is to enable the traveler to ascertain the position and movement of the electric cars that he may avoid entering upon the track in case of danger. The look is cf no avail when he who looks must enter upon the track <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>regardless of what he sees. Hence, as a companion to the rule above stated, is the additional rule that at the moment of such look the traveler must have his vehicle under control so he can stop before getting in the path of an approaching electric car. Here, plaintiff says he came to the track at the speed of twelve miles an hour and on seeing the trolley car turned sharply <em>to </em>the right in an effort to avoid a collision. The reason lie so turned was because of inability to stop before reaching the track. No one contends that an automobile moving twelve miles an hour can be stopped in five or six feet.</p>

"It was yet light, plaintiff was familiar with the surroundings, and no excuse is offered for his coming to the track at that rate of speed, especially as he had no information as to whether an electric car was approaching from the north, until he was near the edge of the track.
