Spiegelman, 292 Pa. 139, 140, and again, in Garland v. Gordon, 295 Pa. 99, 100, we very recently said that, where a trial court states in its opinion that \u201cthe interests of right and justice require that the case shall be retried......, we do not interfere on appeal.\u201d These authorities rule the present case.\nThe order is affirmed.",
