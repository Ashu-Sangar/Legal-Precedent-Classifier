Philadelphia, Trustee.\nMunicipal claims \u2014 Paving\u2014Street railway company \u2014 Liability of abutting property owner \u2014 Duty to pave streets \u2014 Contracts with city \u2014 Act of April 16,1907, P. L. 80.\nWhere a street railway company is obliged by its charter to pave all streets upon which it lays its tracks, the abutting property owner is relieved of the duty of paying the cost of such paving, and where the city, under authority of the Act of April 15, 1907, P. L. 80, enters into a contract with the railway company by which it relieves the latter of the duty of paving such streets in consideration of the annual payment of a sum of money, the city assumes the paving obligation which- the railway company was originally bound to discharge, and cannot thereafter successfully maintain a claim to the use of a contractor against the abutting property owner for the cost of such paving.\nArgued January 16,1914.\nAppeals, Nos. 329 and 330, Jan. T., 1913, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 4, Philadelphia Co., Dec. T., 1908, No. 132, and 133, M. L. D., discharging rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defense in case of City of Philadelphia to use of- Mack Paving Company v. City of Philadelphia, Trustee of Estate of Stephen Girard.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nSci. fa. on lien for paving. Willson, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nThe claims filed in these two cases by the city to the use of the Mack Paving Company are for the price of the paving on the north side of Porter street, between Seventeenth and Eighteenth streets, in front of the premises belonging to the defendant.\nThe claims are resisted upon the ground that, by virtue of the obligations assumed by the Union Passenger Railway Company in its charter obtained in 1864, and in the supplement thereto of the year 1873, that company was bound to pay the expense of paving the streets on which its tracks were laid, and remained so liable until, in pursuance of a contract made between the city and the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company in 1907, the two companies referred to were relieved of all duty to meet such expense, for a consideration of $500,000 to be paid annually to the City of Philadelphia.\nBy the original charter of the Union Passenger Railway Company, which was granted April 8, 1861, P. L. 297, it was expressly subjected to the obligation to pave streets occupied by its tracks. Porter street, however, at that time, was not included among the streets upon which the company was authorized to lay its tracks; but, by the supplement of February 19, 1873, P. L. 135, \u201cin addition to the powers heretofore granted\u201d that company, they were authorized \u201cto extend and lay tracks ......on such other street or streets south of Christian street, west of Twentieth street, north of Columbia avenue and east of Third street as the Councils of the Cily of Philadelphia may from time to time permit or authorize to be used by said company, with single or double tracks.\u201d In the second section of this supplement this provision is also found: \u201csaid company to be subject to all the restrictions and to have all the privileges and immunities in reference to said new routes and tracks as provided in the charter of said company and the several supplements thereto.\u201d By an ordinance of March 30, 1895, councils of the. cily authorized the Union Passenger Railway Company, in accordance with its charter, to lay a single track on Porter street from Severn teenth to Eighteenth street. That street was probably not within the limits designated, as before stated, in the Act of 1873. . .\nIt seems to us, however, from what has been said, to follow as a necessary conclusion that the Union Passenger Railway Company, by virtue of the acts of assembly and of the ordinance of 1895 before mentioned, became subject to the obligation, when it laid its track as it did in.; Porter street, either to pave the said street, or to.pay the cost of paying it. It seems to us also that it is a proper conclusion to reach that, when the legislature imposed such a duty upon the passenger railway company, it thereby relieved the property owner from what would otherwise be its duty with reference to paying the cost of paving.\nThe state of affairs that has already been described continued until the year 1907. On April 15, 1907, the Act of Assembly (P. L. 80) was approved, which enacted \u201cthat it shall and may be lawful for any city...... of the one part, and any street passenger railway...... of the other part, to enter into contracts with each other, affecting, fixing and regulating the franchises, powers, duties and liabilities of such companies......Such contracts may in law provide for payments by the companies to the local authorities in lieu of the performance of certain duties, or the payment of licenses, fees, or charges imposed in favor of such city, borough or township by the charters of the respective companies, or by any general law or ordinance......\u201d In pursuance of that act of assembly, councils of the city passed an ordinance, which was duly approved, providing for the making of a contract between the city and the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, and section 10 of that ordinance reads as follows: \u201cThe company shall, in addition to the other payments hereinbefore provided...... pay into the city treasury each year the sum of $500,-000 in cash......which payments, when made, shall be in lieu and satisfaction of all obligations and liabilities on the part of the company and its subsidiary companies for the paving, repaving and repair of all the streets occupied by their surface lines.......\u201d\nThe contract thus authorized was executed, and the obligation originally assumed by the Union Passenger Railway Company was thereby extinguished.\nIn our opinion, it is a reasonable and proper construction to give to the contract thus made, that, for reasons satisfactory to the municipal authorities and for the consideration of the large sum which it was stipulated the city should receive each year, it, the City of Philadelphia, assumed, in the place of the passenger railway companies, the duty of meeting such expenses connected with the paving of streets as the passenger railway companies were orginally bound to discharge. It thereby seems to us that, by implication, the city thus relieved the property owner from a burden which, otherwise, he or it would have been obliged to carry. We do not think that the mere fact that nothing was contained in the ordinance expressly exempting the property owner from such a burden constituted a shifting of the burden from the passenger railway company to the property owner. In other words, it seems to us that the city must be regarded as having fixed, as the amount which would represent the cost of paving the streets, the large lumping sum which, under the contract, it was to receive yearly, and the city cannot, with propriety, be allowed to collect this sum both from the railway company and from the property owner.\nThe position of the use-plaintiff in these cases is, of course, no better than that of the city, for it is, after all, the city which files the claims, or in whos\u00e9 right th\u00e9se claims are filed. The use plaintiff stands upon no higher ground than the city itself.\nIf it shall appear that, in the treatment of these cases, we have referred to matters which are not strictly upon the record, we have this to say, that all the matters referred to are set forth either in the affidavit of defense or in the briefs which have been submitted to \u00fas by the counsel, and about these matters there was no contention at the argument of the case.\nIt follows from what has been said, that, in our opinion, the rules for judgment, which have already been discharged, were properly so treated.\nThe court discharged plaintiff\u2019s rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. Plaintiff appealed.\nThe City of Philadelphia was granted leave to file a, paper book as an appellant on the ground that if the defendant was not liable for the claims for paving in question the city would be compelled to pay.\nError assigned was in discharging plaintiff\u2019s rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nWalter Biddle Saul, with him E. 0. Michener, for City of Philadelphia, to use of Mack Paving Company, appellant.\nHenry Bauer, Assistant City Solicitor, with him Michael J. Ryan, City Solicitor, for the City of Philadelphia, appellant.\nI. Hazleton Mirkil, with him Francis E. Brewster, for appellee.\nFebruary 16,1914:"
