Browne two thousand dollars, the interest or income to be paid to her, during her natural life, and immediately after her decease, the principal sum or income thereof to be paid to my niece Carlotta H.

Browne, to Carlotta H. Browne, upon the entry by her of security for the protection of the remainder interests ......, or the ‘income’ thereof to Carlotta H. Browne, in the event that the fund is paid to a trustee. No other interpretation would give effect to the words ‘during her life-time,’ and those words qualify the testatrix’s gift to Carlotta H. Browne......The court is bound to give effect to every word without change or rejection, if any effect can be given not inconsistent with the general effect of the whole instrument......It is quite true ......that the phrase, ‘in the event of her death,’ if it followed an absolute gift in the first instance would be construed to refer to death in the life-time of the testator or prior beneficiary......; but in this case it follows a restricted gift and if interpreted literally does not conflict with the words limiting the estate of Carlotta H. Browne, to a life:estate.” The court accordingly awarded the fund to Carlotta H. Browne “during her life upon her entering security......to protect the remainder interests”; and further ordered that upon-a failure to enter security, the fund should be held by a trustee under the will of Alexina B. Rudman, in trust, <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>“to pay the net income thereof to Carlotta H. Browne during her life......”</p>
