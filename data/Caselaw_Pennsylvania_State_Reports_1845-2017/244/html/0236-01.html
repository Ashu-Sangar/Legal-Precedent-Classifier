An insurance company loaned $70,000 to a power company, secured by bond and mortgage. When the loan was made alterations were in progress on the mortgaged property. To secure the insurance company against mechanics’ liens a bond in the sum of $70,000 was executed, in which the power company was principal and a bonding company was surety. The bond recited the execution of the bond and mortgage and the fact that the building erected on the property was not fully completed and contained /a condition that if mechanics’ liens filed after the recording of the mortgage were discharged the obligation was to be void, and a further stipulation that the surety, if compelled to make payment on account of the bond, should be entitled to an assignment of the bond and mortgage upon the payment to the insurance company of all money due thereunder, together with costs, fees, etc. The bond contained a confession of judgment. After the completion of the building liens were filed for material and labor. Default was made in payment of interest on the mortgage and thereupon the principal became due and the mortgage was sued out. The mortgaged property was purchased by the insurance company at the sheriff’s sale for $16,000. Upon distribution of the proceeds by an auditor there was awarded in payment of mechanics’ liens, together with costs, etc., the sum of $11,000. The insurance company then entered judgment against the power company as principal and the bonding company as surety upon the bond given as security against mechanics’ liens and damages were assessed in the sum of $11,000. Upon a petition by the bond<a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>ing company to open the judgment it appeared that tender had been made by the surety company to the insurance company of the debt, interest, costs, and amount of the mechanics’ liens and a demand made for the transfer of the title under the stipulation in the bond, but that this tender was not made until after the sheriff’s sale of the property. Held, that the petition to open was properly dismissed.</p>

In such case held further that there was no error committed in refusing to open the judgment upon the ground that there had been an understanding between counsel for the insurance company and counsel for the bonding company whereby the latter refrained from bidding at the sale under the belief that the property was to be purchased for the benefit of the bonding company where the testimony upon this point was confined to that of counsel for the bonding company on the one hand and contradicting testimony by counsel for the insurance company on the other.</p>
