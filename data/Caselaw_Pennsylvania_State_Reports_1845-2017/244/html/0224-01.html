    <p class="summary" id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[141,667,1153,1405]]]'>By the original charter of the Union Passenger Railway Company, which was granted April 8, 1861, P. L. 297, it was expressly subjected to the obligation to pave streets occupied by its tracks. Porter street, however, at that time, was not included among the streets upon which the company was authorized to lay its tracks; but, by the supplement of February 19, 1873, P. L. 135, “in addition to the powers heretofore granted” that company, they were authorized “to extend and lay tracks ......on such other street or streets south of Christian street, west of Twentieth street, north of Columbia avenue and east of Third street as the Councils of the Cily of Philadelphia may from time to time permit or authorize to be used by said company, with single or double tracks.” In the second section of this supplement this provision is also found: “said company to be subject to all the restrictions and to have all the privileges and immunities in reference to said new routes and tracks as provided in the charter of said company and the several supplements thereto.” By an ordinance of March 30, 1895, councils of the. cily authorized the Union Passenger Railway Company, in accordance with its charter, to lay a single track on Porter street from Severn teenth to Eighteenth street. That street was probably not within the limits designated, as before stated, in the Act of 1873. . .</p>

It seems to us also that it is a proper conclusion to reach that, when the legislature imposed such a duty upon the passenger railway company, it thereby relieved the property owner from what would otherwise be its duty with reference to paying the cost of paving.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[315,672,1146,1411]]]'>The state of affairs that has already been described continued until the year 1907. On April 15, 1907, the Act of Assembly (P. L. 80) was approved, which enacted “that it shall and may be lawful for any city...... of the one part, and any street passenger railway...... of the other part, to enter into contracts with each other, affecting, fixing and regulating the franchises, powers, duties and liabilities of such companies......Such contracts may in law provide for payments by the companies to the local authorities in lieu of the performance of certain duties, or the payment of licenses, fees, or charges imposed in favor of such city, borough or township by the charters of the respective companies, or by any general law or ordinance......” In pursuance of that act of assembly, councils of the city passed an ordinance, which was duly approved, providing for the making of a contract between the city and the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, and section 10 of that ordinance reads as follows: “The company shall, in addition to the other payments hereinbefore provided...... pay into the city treasury each year the sum of $500,-000 in cash......which payments, when made, shall be in lieu and satisfaction of all obligations and liabilities on the part of the company and its subsidiary companies for the paving, repaving and repair of all the streets occupied by their surface lines.......”</p>

It thereby seems to us that, by implication, the city thus relieved the property owner from a burden which, otherwise, he or it would have been obliged to carry. We do not think that the mere fact that nothing was contained in the ordinance expressly exempting the property owner from such a burden constituted a shifting of the burden from the passenger railway company to the property owner. In other words, it seems to us that the city must be regarded as having fixed, as the amount which would represent the cost of paving the streets, the large lumping sum which, under the contract, it was to receive yearly, and the city cannot, with propriety, be allowed to collect this sum both from the railway company and from the property owner.</p>
