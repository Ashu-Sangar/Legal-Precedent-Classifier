Exceptant contended that the interest passing under the will of the original testator was contingent upon the heirs or devisees of the testator’s children surviving the period of distribution, and claimed one-eighth of the estate as the only surviving lineal heir of her grandmother to the exclusion of any interest passing under the will of her aunt above mentioned, and also claimed to the exclusion of such aunt an interest in the estate devised by two children of the original testator to said grandmother of the exceptant. The auditing judge confirmed the account of the trustee and awarded the shares derived from exceptant’s grandmother in equal shares to exceptant and the executor of the deceased husband of exceptant’s aunt.

This clearly shows that there can be no distribution of principal until tbe specified time, and that tbe prior clause relates to income only. If any confirmation of this view is necessary it will be found in tbe language of tbe seventh clause containing tbe directions (a) that tbe payment of income to tbe children shall continue during tbeir respective lives; (b) that tbe share of tbe children or tbeir heirs shall be paid to them personally or to tbeir guardian or their attorneys-in-fact under letters of attorney executed within six months preceding a demand for payment under tbe same and ‘no letter of attorney shall be valid for more than one semi-annual payment,’ which obviously can refer only to payments of income; (c) that if any of tbe children assign or transfer tbeir respective parts in tbe estate, tbe trustee shall ‘thereafter’ pay sucb share or shares to tbe brothers and sisters surviving; where tbe word ‘thereafter’ must also refer to tbe continuing and successive payments of income rather than to tbe payment of a share of the principal; (d) tbe question was raised after tbe death of Charles W. Milligan when bis administrator c. t. a. claimed one-eighth of tbe principal and tbe claim was rejected by tbe auditor, Furman Shepard, Esq., in <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>his report filed in 1862, which decision has been acquiesced in for sixty years,</p>

Milligan died in 1860 and in his will did not refer to the provisions of the will of Francis Milligan nor did he refer to the estate of the latter. He merely gave and devised all his estate to his sisters. If the will of Francis Milligan be regarded as conferring merely and strictly a power of appointment upon Charles, the will of Charles having been executed before the Act of June 4, 1879, P. L. 88, Stew. Purd. 5145, would not operate as an execution of the power, and this share of the estate would be divided ‘among the legal heirs of any other children.’ But the direction in the will of Francis Milligan is to divide the estate ‘among the devisees if any and the lineal heirs of such as may not leave a will of my aforesaid children.’ Charles W. Milligan by his will distinctly named his sisters as devisees, and there is no reason for the application of the technical doctrine of powers. The ‘devisees’ in one case and the ‘heirs’ in the other are designated in the will as the persons who are to take at the deaths of the children. These are words of description just as if Francis Milligan had limited the remainder to children or sons or daughters or grandchildren, and the only question is whether there are any persons who come within the terms of the gift. The auditing judge has not been able to find any decision in Pennsylvania on this somewhat unusual point, but reference may be made to Drake v. Pell, <a href="/edw-ch/3/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Edw. Ch. 251" data-case-ids="487748" data-case-paths="/edw-ch/3/0251-01">3 Edw. Ch. (N. Y.) 251</a>, '270, at page 207. Of course this construction of the will of Francis Milligan does not preclude the right on the part of any of his children to designate the devisees who are to take by the <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>more technical means of the exercise of the power of appointment.</p>

Cross and Mary M. Cross Lotz, children of Isabella M. Cross, Mary and Frank M. Ashmead, children of Mary C. Ash-mead, and Samuel T. and Francis C. Armstrong, children of Laura M. Armstrong. Of these George W. Cross died before the death of Mrs. Armstrong, the time fixed for the division of thé estate, leaving one child, Helen T. C. Hart, now living, and Mary M. Lotz, who died in 1902, leaving no issue, but a will of which her husband was executor and under which he was sole legatee. His interest is represented by his executor, J. Theodore Smith; If all of the six children of the sisters were living, the share over which Mrs. Robbins had a power of appointment would be equally divisible among them, and this would be so whether her will contemplated a stirpital or a capital division, though on this point a distribution per capita would seem to follow from Hartley’s Est., 22 D.

Hart is concerned, the provision of Mrs. Robbin’s will applies, that ‘if any of these said children shall be deceased at th'e time of the divisiop leaving lawful issue, then the child or children of deceased child, shall receive the parent’s share’; and the question arises as to the participation or exclusion of Mary M. Cross Lotz or her estate. Notwithstanding the elaborate argument presented by the learned counsel for Helen T. C. Hart, the auditing judge is unable to perceive any distinction between this case and Carstensen’s Est., <a href="/pa/196/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="196 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="916820" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0325-01">196 Pa. 325</a>, where the language of the will is very <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>similar. The auditing judge, in Burk’s Est., 21 D. R. 357, where a like question arose considered the authorities, and any extended discussion of them is perhaps unnecessary. What Mrs. Robbins intended by her will was to give this share of the estate to the children of her sisters, and contemplating the possibility that some of them might die before Mrs. Armstrong, provided that if any should be then deceased leaving issue, the child or children of a deceased child should receive the parent’s share. This was a substitutionary gift in favor of such issue, but was not intended to divest the shares of those who died without issue. In other words, the gift in favor of the children of children who left children did not affect the shares of children who died without leaving children. In Rosengarten v. Ashton, <a href="/pa/228/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="228 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="969908" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0389-01">228 Pa. 389</a>, cited by Mr. Rumsey, the trust was upon the death of the last child to pay over and distribute the estate to all of the testator’s grandchildren and the issue of such as may be dead, such issue to take the share the parent would have taken if living. As was observed in that case, while the testator does not expressly say that the remaindermen are to be grandchildren then living and the issue of those deceased, no other intention is to be gathered from the words of the will; whereas in the present case the gift is distinctly to the children of the sisters, not to those of them who may then be living. It does not affect the question that Mrs. Robbins was merely exercising a power of appointment. Her will must be read in connection with that of the donor of the power. If Francis Milligan had in his will given the estate on the death of the last surviving daughters to their children equally there could be no doubt that the remainder would have vested in all the children living at his death and all those who might be subsequently born before the date fixed for distribution.

His intention must prevail, and, as it is so manifest, the rule of construction that the law favors a vested rather than a contingent estate, has no place on this appeal. Upon the death of each child it was instantly known who would take that child’s “share,” as the testator termed it, in his estate when it was to be distributed upon the death of the last of his children. The share of each deceased child was directed by the testator to go to his or her “devisees,” or, if dying intestate, to his or her lineal <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>heirs, or, if dying without such heirs, then to the legal heirs of the other children of the testator. When Charles W. Milligan died, in 1860, and gave his entire estate to his six sisters, each took a vested one forty-eighth interest in the corpus of the father’s estate, though the enjoyment of it by her legatees or next of kin was to be postponed until the time of distribution. Upon the death of Eliza J. Bobbins, in 1884, by the terms of her will, written in pursuance of authority given to her by her father, her one-eighth share in the principal of his estate passed at once to the children of her five surviving sisters, in the same way that the share of the son Charles W. had passed to the six sisters. Isabella M. Cross, the next of the daughters of the testator to die, was the grandmother of the appellant. She died intestate in 1895, leaving to survive her a son, appellant’s father, who died in 1905, and a daughter, Mary M. Cross Lotz, who died without issue in 1902, having left her entire estate to her husband. Upon the death of Mrs. Cross there passed, under the intestate laws, to her daughter Mary one-half of the interest which she had acquired in the corpus of her father’s estate under the will of her brother Charles; and there further passed, at the same time, to the daughter Mary a one-sixteenth interest in that corpus, for her grandfather had so directed in his will, if her mother should die intestate. What the daughter thus acquired, under the intestate laws and under the will of her aunt Eliza, passed under her will to her husband, and, on the' distribution of the fund in the hands of the trustee, the court below properly awarded to his executor what would have gone to her if living. Her interest in the principal of her grandfather’s estate was not contingent upon her living at the time of distribution, as learned counsel for appellant earnestly contend. Upon the death of her aunt Eliza and her mother she acquired absolute, substantive interests in her grandfather’s estate, to be paid to her in the future, and those interests <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>must, under all the authorities, be regarded as having vested in her lifetime. She did not take under the mere direction of her grandfather that his estate should be divided upon the death of his last child, but acquired interests in it many years before the time fixed by him for distribution, and in the ways in which he declared she would acquire them. In Rosengarten v. Ashton, <a href="/pa/228/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="228 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="969908" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0389-01">228 Pa. 389</a>, upon which counsel for appellant seem to place much reliance in support of their appeal, the situation was very different. The time for distribution was there fixed as the time when the interests vested because of the clearly indicated intention of the testator that a grandchild should take only if living at the time of the death of his last child. It is .needless to say more in vindication of the opinion of the learned adjudicating judge, approved by the court below on banc.</p>
