    <p id="b250-11" data-blocks='[["BL_250.20",250,[280,1603,1145,750]]]'>This action was against the family physician of the plaintiff, Bertha L. Stewart, by whose advice she went to a public hospital for a surgical operation. After the operation she was burned by a hot water bottle that had been left by a hospital nurse in the bed in which she was placed. Recovery of damages was sought on the ground that the plaintiff’s injury was caused by the negligence of the defendant or that of the nurse for whose action he wa,s answerable. It is alleged in the declaration that the defendant agreed to perform the operation and to treat the plaintiff with care and skill while under his charge and to furnish her the services of a skillful nurse and that he failed in the performance of his duty in this regard.</p>

All of these facts were established by the plaintiff' and her witnesses. Her case was therefore without any support whatever. The injury was caused by the negligence of a hospital nurse, for whose service the plaintiff paid the hopital and whose work the defendant was under no duty to supervise and would not have been permitted to supervise, and for whose negligence he was not responsible.</p>
