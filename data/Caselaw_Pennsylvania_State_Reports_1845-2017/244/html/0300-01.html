As such, it is manifest that there is an interest possessed beyond that of the public at large. The highway is the means of entrance and exit from the abutting land. It is a source of continuous interest with respect to the use of the highway, and is a source of perinanent interest in that the abutting land has a value by reason of fronting on the highway. The public at large would have no motive to conserve the highway for the protection of the abutting owner. We agree with the conclusion reached by Yerkes, J., in Com. v. Doylestown Supervisors, 16 Pa. C. C. R. 161, that owners of property on a public highway may have a mandamus to compel the supervisors to keep it in repair. This requires no further discussion.</p>

L. 345, it is prescribed that the petition shall set forth a demand or refusal to perform the act or duty. But the fact appears in the petition that the defendants have vacated and closed up this highway. There could be no more significant refusal to open and maintain it, than the action of the defendants in vacating and closing it. Why give them an opportunity to open and maintain that which they had vacated and closed? That such vacating and closing had the character of a refusal is shown by the answer, wherein they defend against opening and maintaining, because they had vacated and closed. We see nothing in this feature of the defense to stand in the relators’ way.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[295,1039,1150,1357]],["BL_331.1",331,[183,336,1153,2073]],["BL_332.1",332,[291,335,1148,1510]]]'>3. This brings us to the consideration of the question whether this highway has been legally vacated. This consideration commences with the general road law, which is the Act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 551. The first section is “That the Court of Quarter Sessions...... shall have power......to appoint viewers, and upon their report and at the next court the whole proceedings shall be entered on record, and thenceforth such road shall be taken, deemed and allowed to be a lawful public road or highway.” The eighteenth section is “The Courts aforesaid shall.....have authority......to change or vacate the whole or any part of any...... public road.” The twenty-second section is “Provided that nothing in this Act shall be construed to give authority to any of the Courts of the Commonwealth to vacate any lane, street or highway, within any city, borough, town plot, or any town or village.” Notwithstanding this proviso, the Court of Quarter Sessions has jurisdiction to vacate highways in townships. The jurisdiction has no other place upon which to operate than in townships, and this notwithstanding the prohibition of jurisdiction in towns and villages. Townships of the first class are nothing more than a township, with some change in the form of government, and with some additional specified powers. They are not municipal corpo<a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>rations: Dempster v. United Traction Co., <a href="/pa/205/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="205 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="930005" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0070-01">205 Pa. 70</a>. We, therefore, start with the proposition that the jurisdiction to vacate highways in the defendant township is in the Quarter Sessions. To what extent has this been changed by the Act of June 7,1901, P. L. 510? The first section of that act is: “The board of township commissioners, upon petition of property owners, shall have power to enact, survey, lay out, widen, straighten, vacate, and relay all......streets......within the township.” Provision is then made for notice and a hearing, “and after such hearing and consideration of the matter, should the said board or a majority thereof decide in favor of granting the prayer of said petition, they shall make written report, together with a draft or survey of said road, street, lane or alley, fixing the width thereof ......which report and draft shall be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Court of Quarter Sessions.” Provision is then made for exceptions, and a petition for review. It is manifest that the direction in this act to file a report only refers to cases where a highway is laid out. It is only in such cases that the direction for an accompanying draft or survey fixing the width is intelligible. The board of township commissioners has jurisdiction, when petitioned by property owners, to vacate a highway within the township. To this extent the jurisdiction of the Quarter Sessions is superseded. Their action is a finality, and there is reason in this. They are moved by the property owners. As representatives of the public, they withdraw the public right of use. No right to damage accrues to any one. The vacation of a highway is not an injury to the abutting land owners, within the provisions of the Constitution, requiring compensation, and in the absence of legislative provision for damages, none can be recovered: Howell v. Morrisville Boro., <a href="/pa/212/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="212 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="941808" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0349-01">212 Pa. 349</a>; Hinkson v. Chester, 12 Delaware County Reports 293. The defendants filed in the office of the Clerk of Quarter Sessions, a report of the vacation of the highway under consideration; but this being <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>filed without warrant of law, no force of res ad judicata can be attributed to a failure to file exceptions to it, and no laches can be interpreted from such failure. It appears that the highway in question was vacated on the petition of property owners. But is this highway under the Act of 1901 a highway within the township? True the termini .and the whole route of the section vacated are within the township. But this section is part of a public road which begins at the Valley Forge road in the adjoining Township of Newtown and extends therein two hundred and ten and thirty-eight one-hundredths feet, where it crosses the line dividing the townships of Newtown and Radnor and ends in the township of Rad-nor. Where a public road runs into or through a township of the first class, may the board of township commissioners under the Act of 1901, vacate a section of the road within the township? Seeing that the act of vacation is a withdrawal of the public user, did the Act of 1901 intend that the board of township commissioners should have the power to withdraw not only the user of the public whom they represent, but also the outside public, whom they do not represent? If so, then the Court of Quarter Sessions might lay out a public road through a township of the first class, and the board of township commissioners might proceed at once to vacate the part of it within the township and thereby nullify the action of the court. We cannot think that the act intended this.</p>

Boroughs are empowered by the general borough law of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320, in Section 2, pi. II, “To survey, lay out, enact and ordain ......streets.” In pi. IV “To regulate the......streets ......and they shall have all other needful jurisdiction over the same.” This impliedly includes the power to vacate, because of Section 27, where it is provided that complaint may be made to the Quarter Sessions, by any person aggrieved by any regulation in relation to streets, <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>“provided that every jury appointed to view, review, lay out, widen, or straighten or vacate, any road or part of road in any borough of this Commonwealth, shall have due reference to the town plot,” etc. The jurisdiction to lay out streets in a borough is in the borough authorities, under the Acts of April 3,1851, P. L. 320, and April 22, 1856, P. L. 525, but the jurisdiction to lay out a road partly in a borough and partly outside is in the Quarter Sessions: Somerset and Stoystown Road, <a href="/pa/74/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="74 Pa. 61" data-case-ids="1034690" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0061-01">74 Pa. 61</a>.

Superior Ct. 419</a>, there had been a turnpike road extending from Harrisburg to the diamond in Chambersburg Borough. The turnpike company abandoned the road within the borough, which thereafter became a public street. Afterward the borough authorities vacated it and it was held that' they had power to do so. But the only part of the road which could be vacated was the part in the borough. The turnpike road could not be vacated. The two sections had different characteristics. The borough street was not the same kind of a road as the turnpike road outside. Considered with reference to the susceptibility to vacation, the street was entirely within the borough. The very question seems to be decided with refer<a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>ence to boroughs in Palo Alto Road, <a href="/pa/160/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="160 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="852161" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0104-01">160 Pa. 104</a>, where it is held that where there is a road partly within a borough and partly without, the Quarter Sessions has jurisdiction to vacate a part of that within the borough. The exclusive jurisdiction of boroughs over streets is limited to those which begin and end in the borough. This case was decided under local laws conferring jurisdiction on the Quarter Sessions, with no such exclusion of borough as is contained in the twenty-second section of the Act of June 13, 1836. But in the case in hand, there is no exclusion of townships of the first class from the operation of the Act of 1836. Therefore while the case cited' is not a direct authority, the analogy is complete.</p>
