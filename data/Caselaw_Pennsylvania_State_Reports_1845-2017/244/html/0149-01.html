    <p class="headnotes" id="A9K" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[153,701,1151,1100]]]'>Upon an issue to determine whether a stock of store goods levied on by the sheriff was the property of the defendant in the execution or of his wife, the plaintiff in the issue, in whose name the business was conducted, plaintiff in support of her claim of ownership offered in evidence receipts in her name for the payment of mercantile taxes for 1913. It, however, appeared on the cross ex-animation of her husband that the original receipts for taxes for that year had been issued to him and that he had caused the change of name to be made a few days before the trial. His explanation of the change of name was that a mistake had been made. He was unable to say in whose name receipts for prior years had been issued and the plaintiff failed to produce the receipts on call. For the purpose of discrediting the plaintiff and her husband and rebutting an inference in her favor that would arise from her payment of ■ taxes the defendant called a clerk employed in the office of the city treasurer who was allowed to testify, under objection, that the books of the office, kept by another clerk with whose handwriting he was familiar showed that the receipts for the taxes for 1912 were issued to the plaintiff’s husband. On the cross examination of this witness the plaintiff extended the scope of inquiry and developed the fact that the receipts for a number of years prior to 1912 were not issued to the plaintiff but to her husband. <em>Held, </em>that there was no error in the admission of this testimony.</p>
