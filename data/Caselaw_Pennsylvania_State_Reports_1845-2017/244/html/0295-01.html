      <em>■ </em>In a case stated in assumpsit to determine the marketability of title to real estate, a judgment for the defendant is proper, where it appears that the plaintiff’s claim to a fee simple title to the tract in question is based upon the will of her father, which provided : “My daughter (the plaintiff) shall have (the real estate in question) during the natural life of herself and her husband, or the survivor of them, and they shall have the use, benefit and income of the same during their natural life, and after the decease of my said daughter and her husband, said farm shall come to the children of my daughter or to their lawful heirs share and share alike, and for which farm my daughter shall be charged the sum of $15,000, which sum shall be charged to her, I mean to say said amount shall be deducted from her share of inheritance out of my estate and each of my two other daughters shall have the right to take $15,000 of my best mortgages, judgments or promissory notes so that would bring them even with their sister.” The gift was a life estate only to plaintiff and her husband.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[283,1386,1146,318]]]'>The use of the word children certainly indicates an estate directly derived from the testator and not descended from Mary A.

      <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>There seems to be a distinction that when a charge is made on an estate alone and there are no words of limitation the devisee takes for life, bnt where the charge is on the person of the devisee in respect to the estate in his hands he takes a fee by implication. Bnt here there are words of limitation, and therefore this rule does not apply.

We know not what passed in the mind of the testator when he made his will, but the words used in the instrument are supposed to express what he intended. If we construe Mary A. Backenstoe’s interest as a fee what estate goes to her husband, for evidently the testator wished to give an estate equally to them? It was to be for their use, benefit and income, and to the survivor of them. If the wife died before the husband he would if the estate be a fee simple acquire the entire estate, for they held it by entireties. Thus the estate might pass to one not of the blood of the testator. This we can safely say was not the testator’s intention. The testator wished to reserve the farm for his daughter and her husband for their lives. He had a right to do so, and in this regard his purpose to my mind is clearly expressed.</p>
