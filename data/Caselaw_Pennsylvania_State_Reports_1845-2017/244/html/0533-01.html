    <p class="summary" id="b561-10" data-blocks='[["BL_561.14",561,[148,1656,1150,536]]]'>In this case suit was brought by the plaintiff against the defendant, Deborah K. McKently, executrix of the estate of Jonathan McKently, deceased, to recover damages in an action of crim. con. The plaintiff alleged that Jonathan McKently in his life-time had debauched his wife, Lillie E. Sunanday. This suit was brought after the death of the said Jonathan McKently, against the defendant as executrix. A nonsuit was granted at the time of the trial on the ground that the death of Jonathan McKently abated the suit.</p>

L. 236, an action like the present one, upon the death of the wrong-doer, did not survive against the estate. He claims, however, that under said act this <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>action can be maintained against tbe wrongdoer’s executrix.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.4",562,[307,451,1148,536]]]'>At the argument of this case counsel for plaintiff earnestly contended that an action of crim. con. is one at common law. That it is governed by tbe principles of tbe common law and that as at tbe common law bus-band and wife are one, a criminal assault upon or debaucbment of tbe body of tbe plaintiff’s wife would be an injury wrongfully done to the person of tbe busband in tbe eyes of tbe law, and is tbe same as if tbe busband bad been assaulted, and therefore redressable at common law in an action of trespass vi et armis.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b562-5" data-blocks='[["BL_562.5",562,[306,999,1148,1356]]]'>A complete answer to this contention is found in Drew v. Peer, <a href="/pa/93/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="93 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="442170" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0234-01">93 Pa. 234</a>, where it is held: “Where damages are claimed by a busband for tbe loss of bis wife’s services, and for medical attendance resulting from a personal injury to her, case is tbe proper form of action.” Tbe reason for this, together with tbe authorities therefor is stated in full by Mr. Justice Sterrett on page 241. Plaintiff’s contention is that tbe meaning of tbe term in tbe aforesaid act of tbe injury stated as done to tbe person of another which is to survive tbe death of tbe wrongdoer, and may be enforced against bis executrix or administrator, is sufficiently broad to include an action of tbe kind under consideration. This, however, is giving to tbe phrase an “injury wrongfully done to tbe person of another,” entirely too broad a meaning. It is there used in restrictive sense as is clearly shown by reading both sections of tbe act. That is, tbe personal injury that is to survive tbe death of tbe wrongdoer is such an injury as may or may not result in death. In Boyd v. Snyder, <a href="/pa/207/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="207 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="933578" data-case-paths="/pa/207/0330-01">207 Pa. 330</a>, on page 334, tbe court says: “Tbe Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 236, has no application to a suit for malicious prosecution. It is clearly intended to apply only to cases of injuries to tbe person, which may or may not result in death.” See also Patterson v. Williams, <a href="/pa-super/52/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="52 Pa. Super. 299" data-case-ids="432776" data-case-paths="/pa-super/52/0299-01">52 Pa.
