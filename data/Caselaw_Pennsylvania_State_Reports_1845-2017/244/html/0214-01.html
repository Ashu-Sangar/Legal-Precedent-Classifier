Elliott held the same as trustee for complainant, and by deed dated the 11th of April, 1912, the said William T.

Elliott, the then owner of the said premises, in the sum of $25,000, conditioned for the payment of such amount of damages as the said William T. Elliott should be entitled to receive for the entering by the said The Schuylkill River East Side Railroad Company upon a strip of land of the said William T.

The condemnation of the land was complete upon the acceptance of the bond by Mr. Elliott: Dilts v.

The bill avers that the bond was delivered in 1905. It nowhere avers that it was not accepted and the averment that it was afterwards assigned to the complainant was an exercise of dominion and an asser<a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>tion of a right to its benefits inconsistent with any theory other than acceptance. For damages for the taking of the land, therefore, an action at law was indicated and the statutes provide a method for their assessment. The fact that the parties have not as yet had the question of damages determined does not affect the condemnation, and it is not within the power of a Court of ■Equity to deal with the matter.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.4",246,[301,759,1147,1629]],["BL_247.1",247,[141,331,1185,1255]]]'>The bill apparently does not question this conclusion, but rather attacks the use to which the strip of land condemned is now being devoted. It is averred that the right to condemn does not contemplate a taking for the use indicated by the bill, but it fails to state in what respect the use is improper. It avers that the structure is a covered footwalk connecting the station of the railroad company at Chestnut street and the subway and elevated system of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company. If that is the purpose, it is not clear how that purpose brings the structure outside the provisions of the Act of March 17,1869, P. L. 12, under which the land was taken. Under that act, the right is given to widen the line whenever it may be necessary for the better securing the safety of persons or property and increasing the facilities and capacity for traffic. In Dilts v. Railroad Company, <a href="/pa/222/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="222 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="959455" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0516-01">222 Pa. 516</a>, it was held that such an easement gave the right “to exclusive possession, to fence in, to build over the whole surface, to raise and maintain any appropriate superstructure, including necessary foundations and to deal with it within the limits of railroad uses as absolutely and as uncontrolled as an owner in fee.” The averments of the bill do not show any facts from which we could conclude that the use to which the land is now being devoted is not within the limits of the railroad uses. It might with propriety be described as a necessary approach to the station proper, or a part of the station platform. “The law commits to the board of directors the determination of the question of the necessity in connection with the proposed <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>change”: Scranton Gas &amp; Water Company v. D., L. &amp; W. R. R., <a href="/pa/225/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="225 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="965319" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0152-01">225 Pa. 152</a>; Sutton v. R. R.

Aside from this consideration, there is no averment that _ the condemnation was for the purpose of constructing a covered footway. In fact, the condemnation was effectual nearly seven years before the construction of the footwalk was commenced, and the bill is silent as to the uses to which the eleven-foot strip was devoted during the intervening years. The condemnation, so far as the bill indicates, was without particular purpose, and the land could have been used for the general purposes to which the defendant was entitled to use it by the provisions of the Act of 1869, and which were acquiesced in by the acceptance of the bond. The bill does not aver as a fact that the proposed structure is not necessary for the “better securing the safety of persons and property and increasing the facilities and capacity for the transporta: tion of traffic.” We cannot entertain the bill.- If the railroad has been in possession for more than six years . under the condemnation, it cannot be ousted in equity. If complainant has any rights by reason of the use to which the strip is being devoted, the remedy is by ejectment : Peiffer v. R. R. Go., 12 Lane. Law Review 265.</p>

This property to the west of the railroad appears by the plan annexed to the bill to be seventy-seven feet wide at the sduth end and forty-eight feet wide at the north end and 453 feet long on the bulkhead line. The bill does not state that this property has been put to any use while in the possession of Mr. Elliott, or the complainant, or that any use is at present proposed. It does not aver that a crossing was had at any time since the railroad was built, or that the right to one was ever asserted. Neither is it averred <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>that a crossing is now desired by complainant and denied by the railroad. The bill contents itself with the averment that access is cut off.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b248-4" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[281,488,1149,1027]]]'>As we read the 38 (12) Section of the Act of Februry 19, 1849, P. L. 79, it is clear that a railroad company may be required to maintain a crossing where it bisects the land of any owner, and for a failure so to do is liable to damages to be assessed as provided by the 37 (11th) section. It is doubtful, however, if this applies in the case where the easement is acquired by deed, especially when the deed gives a right to “free and uninterrupted” user, as is the case here, so far as relates to the original right of way. The new strip having been acquired under the Act of 1869, it scarcely comes within the class of cases in which the land of an owner is bisected. The land on the other side of the strip is now held by the railroad under its deed and the other property of complainant is west of the land covered by that deed. In addition, it must be noted that by the deed the railroad is privileged to erect on the original right of way structures which would make a crossing at grade impossible.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.5",248,[279,1528,1147,525]]]'>But whether this fact is of importance or not, it is clearly provided in the act that if complainant is entitled to a crossing and the right to it is denied, the complainant has a remedy at law: Dimmick v. B. R. Co., <a href="/pa/180/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="180 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="888394" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0468-01">180 Pa. 468</a>. There is nothing in the bill which discloses any difficulty in erecting an overhead crossing, should complainant be entitled in law to have one, and should the erection of one be attempted by complainant and resisted by the defendant, a situation would be presented which is not before us now.</p>
