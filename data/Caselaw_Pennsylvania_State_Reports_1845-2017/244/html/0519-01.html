One can see no escape from the conclusion that they support the verdict. Whether, so far as in dispute — and these were the crucial facts — they could have been fairly so found was quite another ques<a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>tion, and wholly for the jury. Such finding depended upon the degree of credit, if any, to be given to the only witness who so testified. His testimony was not only directly contradicted by Rowland, but in itself was open to suspicion because of its radical alteration during the trial under circumstances not well calculated to give it the appearance of good faith. On its face his conduct was not unlike that of a witness who, discovering that he had unintentionally sworn his party out of court in the morning, comes back in the afternoon prepared to go any length to repair the damages. He had first identified Mr. Gilbert as the man to whom the alleged request was made. If made at all, that would have been entirely consistent in view of Mr. Gilbert’s functions there. He was the personal representative of the firm then using the elevator. There could be no question as to his authority to control its use, as the engineer was subject to his orders; but, as against this defendant, it would have been fatal to plaintiffs case. She would have been face to face with the barrier against liability for the act of an independent contractor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b550-5" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[299,1490,1151,919]],["BL_551.1",551,[172,342,1145,99]]]'>It may be conceded that the witness was laboring under some confusion of mind and memory, thus acquitting him of either corrupt or reckless swearing. But that in no way serves to strengthen his ultimate claim. It still leaves his final assertion so doubtful in value that, as against a positive denial on the other side, it is not apparent how it could be given any preponderating weight. It certainly could have none in mind of those having any knowledge of the nature of evidence. But that doesn’t out-law the testimony. So long as it can be referred to for present purposes only in terms either of weight or credibility, just so long it stands labeled as a question exclusively for the jury. True, the court is in duty bound in such case to call attention to those things, whether inherent or extrinsic, which tend to discredit the evidence; and it was so done in this instance. The limited review, however, to which the determination of <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>the jury is subject, can be had only on motion for new trial; and not, as in this case, on a rule for judgment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[171,452,1148,594]]]'>On the subject of “independent contractor,” counsel have submitted well prepared briefs. But on the facts above stated, the question of defendant’s liability is one of true agency, having nothing to do with any wrongful act of a subcontractor, whether independent or otherwise. That Mr. Rowland was defendant’s agent is agreed. The actionable negligence, if any, was the disregard of his promise upon which deceased had relied for security. It follows that the only other question would be as to the scope of the agency, either express or implied.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b551-5" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[171,1059,1147,152]]]'>As submitted to the jury, the inquiry was limited to that of apparent authority on the theory that the evidence did not go beyond that.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b551-7" data-blocks='[["BL_551.7",551,[163,1278,1156,1194]]]'>Upon review of the testimony — especially that of defendant himself — it appears that in cases of temporary and local conflict in the work, as between different trades, it devolved upon the superintendent to see that one should give way for the time being so that the fixtures and interior finish should go in place in due order. True, it did not distinctly appear that deceased could not proceed without access to the elevator shaft; therefore, it wasn’t clear that a case of conflict within the meaning of the terms of the agency had arisen. But that, in any instance, might be a debatable question, in the nature of which it would not be incumbent on the deceased, at his peril, to know the precise conditions under which the superintendent was authorized to act. Deceased would have the right to expect to be so advised if, for any reason, his request could not be acted upon. Hence, on the face of the facts found, the case presented is that of defendant’s personal representative clothed with actual authority not unlike that which he was asked to exercise. In that situation, if he so promised 'to act, the promise in itself would be evidence of his apparent authority in the premises.</p>

On the decisive question of the negligence of the defendant’s superintendent the weight of the evidence was against the finding of the jury, but there was evidence which if believed would sustain the verdict. The court would not therefore have been warranted in directing a verdict against the plaintiff and since a new trial was not asked for there was no opportunity to set aside a finding by the jury which was apparently illy considered. On a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto the court cannot enter judgment against the verdict where there was a conflict of evidence on a material fact or any reason why binding instructions could not have been given.
