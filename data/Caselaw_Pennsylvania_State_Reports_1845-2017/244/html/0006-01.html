The claim averred that the work was done and the materials furnished under a contract consisting of a written bid submitted by plaintiff to Rogers, the contractor, to furnish and erect the stairs in sixteen houses according to three sets of plans, designated as Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and the stairs in three single houses according to another set of plans, nineteen houses in all, for the sum of $3,750.00, and that said bid was accepted by Rogers.

It did not aver that any work had .been done on any of the other houses. So far as the record disclosed, the only work done under this contract was that for which the plaintiff filed the lien against this particular house.</p>

The court granted a rule to show cause why this item should not be stricken out for these reasons, which rule it subsequently discharged. The plaintiff issued a writ of scire facias on the claim and the defendants thereupon moved to quash the writ, upon the ground that the provisions of the Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431, and its supplements, changing the form of the writ of scire facias and regulating the manner of its service were unconstitutional, and the court granted a rule to show cause why this motion should not prevail, which rule it discharged.

The said material and labor were furnished between the dates of April 4, 1911, and November 20, 1911, on which said last mentioned date the last of the materials and labor was furnished to the said house.”</p>

He contracted not with the owner, but with Rogers, the contractor. When, therefore, he filed his claim for work done upon this building, he was required to disclose the nature' or kind of that work and when it was done. The claim states that the first materials were furnished on April 4th, and the last item of materials was on October 17th, and as to the material the exact date at which each item was furnished, is stated in the claim. Now stating when the work was done, it is said that it began on April 4th the day when the first materials were furnished, and it was not completed until November 20th, more than a month after the last materials were furnished. This covered a period of seven months and a half and yet the work was done in one hundred and thirty-seven hours of actual time. This would give less than an hour of time for eách working day, and it is manifest that the work was not continuous. No one man was employed in this work from April 4th to November 20th, nor any considerable por<a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>tion of that time. This claim simply indicates that 137 hours of work were put upon the building, or in the preparation of materials to go into the building, some time between April 4 and November 20, 1911, but it absolutely fails to sufficiently indicate at what time during that period the work was done.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-5" data-blocks='[["BL_38.4",38,[295,669,1148,1027]]]'>The claim also fails to indicate the nature of the work, whether it was done in preparation of the materials at the shop of the plaintiff, or in incorporating them into the building, by carpenters, cabinet makers, assistants or laborers. The objection of the appellant is that this is a lumping charge and the objection seems to be well taken: Chapman v. Faith, 18 Pa. Superior Court 578. If this item of the claim could be sustained it extended the time within which the plaintiff might have filed his lien by more than a month, for the limit claimed for the work was November 20th, yet the claim does not mention a specific day upon which any work was done. This case bears a striking similarity to McFarland v. Schultz, <a href="/pa/168/0634-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="168 Pa. 634" data-case-ids="868486" data-case-paths="/pa/168/0634-01">168 Pa. 634</a>, the claim in which was for work and labor done, to wit: “Grading and digging lots and carting away dirt from the same.”......“The said work and labor having been done and performed for and about the erection and construction of the .said buildings between August 29,1892, and October 22,1892.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-8" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[285,1708,1157,472]]]'>The Supreme Court said in that case, with regard to this statement of the claim: “It did not adequately set forth the nature and kind of the work done nor when it was done. The claimant was a subcontractor and bound to strict compliance with the provisions of the •statute on which he relied for his lien.” The statement in that ease was that the work had been done between certain dates and it was held that this was not a sufficient statement of when it was done.</p>

The case is clearly to be distinguished from Northern Electrical Manufacturing Company v. Columbia Brewing Co., 47 Pa. Superior Court 96, in which the question was whether the notice required to be given by the subcontractor to the owner, had been served within the time required after the completion of his work. The claim filed in that case had attached to and made part of it, the contract and specifications under which the work was done, which disclosed that the claimant was required to furnish two distinct electric generators specific machines and erect and install them in the building. The claim stated in detail the manner in which the claimants proceeded to execute the contract, stated the value of the various pieces of the machine at the factory in Wisconsin, that, these pieces were shipped upon a certain day stated to be “being the dates of shipment and not the dates of actual delivery, nor indicating the time of the completion of the erection of the generators in the building.”</p>

That under the contract the machines were not delivered until they were so erected, and that it appeared from the claim and the exhibits which • were made part of it, that the contract for the delivery of the specific machines, was not completed until they were erected in the brewery, and that the notice was in time.</p>

This was right as is clearly shown in the elaborate opinion of Judge Postee. The statute requires a mechanics’ claim to set- forth “the amount or sum claimed to be due, and the nature or kind of the work done, or the kind and amount of materials furnished, or both; and the time <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>when the materials were furnished, or the work done, or both, as the case may be.” The claim as filed shows that the material and labor “substantially consisted of furnishing and erecting stairs in said house,” and that they “were furnished between the dates of April 4,1911, and November 20, 1911.” This was not a compliance with the statutory requirement as to the nature or kind of work or when it was done. The items of materials and the dates when they were furnished are stated in the claim, but, as suggested by the Superior Court, it fails to show the nature of the work, whether it was done in preparation of the materials at the shop of the plaintiff, or in incorporating them into the building, by carpenters, cabinet makers, assistants or laborers. The only information as to the time when the labor was furnished is the statement that it was performed between the dates of April 4 and November 20, 1911, that is, sometime during a period of over seven months. Such claims have never been held to be sufficient as to the kind of work or the time when it was done, either under the present or prior legislation on the subject. They fail to give the necessary information to the owner to enable him to determine the correctness of the claim for which the contractor is primarily liable. The claimant here is a subcontractor who dealt with the contractor and not with the owner, and the latter is liable for the debt which is that of the cohtractor only when the claimant complies with the provisions of the statute which gives him the lien.</p>
