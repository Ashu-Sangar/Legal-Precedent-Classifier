L. 249, requiring that, “Every will shall be in writing and unless the person making the same shall be prevented by the extremity of his last sickness, shall be signed by him at the end thereof or by some person in his presence and by his express direction,” was intended to remedy the mischief that arose from attempting to probate memoranda, letters, and notes which were inchoate expressions of intentions. One of its purposes was to attain certainty as to the testator’s completed testamentary purpose by the placing of his signature at the end of the instrument, and while a signature by initials or by a part <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>only of the name may be a valid execution of a will, the present, actual and completed intent to execute must be apparent.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.4",603,[153,405,1149,226]]]'>2. The act of assembly, in providing that the testator’s intent should be manifested by signing at the end thereof, used the word “signing” in the usual acceptation of the word, and the sense in which presumably it is used in the act is the writing of a name or the affixing of what is meant as the signature.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b603-6" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[151,639,1151,366]]]'>3. The decedent died leaving a paper in his own handwriting, which was found in a drawer in his house, in a sealed envelope. Prior to his death he had told his daughter where the paper was and that if anything should happen to him she should get it and give it to her brother. The paper was testamentary in character, but was unsigned except with the words, “Tour miserable father,” which appeared in the handwriting of the decedent. <em>Held, </em>that probate of the paper was properly refused.</p>

Prior to the Wills Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249, it was not essential to the validity of a will that it should be signed by the testator if written by him or by his special direction. Section 6 of the act requires that, “Every will shall be in writing and unless the person making the same shall be prevented by the extremity of his last sickness, shall be signed by him at the end thereof or by some person in his presence and by his express direction.” The manifest intention of the legislature was to remedy the mischief that arose from admitting to probate memoranda, letters and notes which were inchoate expressions of intentions: Stickler v. Groves, <a href="/whart/5/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="5 Whart. 386" data-case-ids="8878289" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0386-01">5 Wharton 386</a>; Heise v.

The Act of January 27, 1848, P. L. 16, permits the execution of a will by a mark or cross. In Plate’s Est., <a href="/pa/148/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="148 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="981811" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0055-01">148 Pa. 55</a>, it was said that the statute in authorizing the execution of a will by a mark can only mean a mark made with the intent to execute the will thereby. In Knox’s Est., <a href="/pa/131/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="131 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="810252" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0220-01">131 Pa. 220</a>, in which the subject is fully considered by Mitchell, J., it is said that one of the purposes of the Act of 1833 was to attain certainty as to the testator’s completed testamentary purpose by the placing of his signature at the end of the instrument and . that while a signature by initials or by a part only of the name may be valid execution of a will, the present, actual and completed intent to execute must be apparent. The act of assembly defined the manner by which this intent is to be manifested — by signing at the end thereof.- Signing in the usual acceptation of the word and in the sense in which, presumably, it is used in the act is the writing of a name or the affixing of what is meant as a signature. It may be that the writing in question is a clear expression of the decedent’s intent to make a testamentary disposition of his estate but it is not evidenced by the formality required by the act of assembly.</p>
