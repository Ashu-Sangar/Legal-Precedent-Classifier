If any inmate violates the rules or regulations prescribed by the bureau, his release privileges may be withdrawn.” Pursuant to this statutory directive, the Bureau of Correction has promulgated regulations establishing various prerelease programs and governing the selection of inmates for participation in these programs. <em>See </em>37 Pa.Code §§ 95.21-95.27 (community treatment services program), §§ 95.31-95.42 (temporary home furloughs), §§ 95.111-95.128 (release status). The selection of participants for the community treatment services program and temporary home furloughs is made by the deputy superintendent for treatment services, subject to final approval by the superintendent, upon the recommendations of the applicant’s support team, caseworker, housing officer, work supervisor, educational supervisor, and other appropriate staff. 37 Pa.Code §§ 95.127(a), 95.128(a).

Other serious considerations, such as the staff’s evaluation of the progress of the individual to<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>ward treatment goals, the relevancy of the particular prerelease program to the treatment plan of the individual, and the backlog of eligible residents awaiting participation in a limited program shall be weighed carefully.” Among the factors to be considered are the applicant’s “previous offense and incarceration history; work, family, educational and religious history, marital history and status; past and present life style in its social context, and history of mental health disorders.” 37 Pa.Code § 95.121(a)(3).</p>

Community treatment center residency provides programs from a community-based residence under the jurisdiction of the Community Treatment Services Division of the Bureau of Correction. Community treatment centers are staffed by corrections counselors and house managers on a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week basis. This program [provides] community living facilities for those former residents of regional and State correctional institutions who no longer require intensive custody. The community treatment center programs are individualized such that a resident is enabled to enter into employment, educational pursuits, vocational-technical training, or specialized services as the needs dictate. Residents participating in the community treatment center program are required to pay rent for their quarters and assume costs of personal expenses. By participating in this type of a program, the resident facilitates his own transition to parole and subsequent release.” 37 Pa.Code § 95.-111.</blockquote>

The Civil Rights Act of 1871 provides for civil action remedies for denials of civil rights and for conspiracies to deny federal civil action remedies for denials of civil under color of state law. The Commonwealth Court expressed some doubt as to whether <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>actions pursuant to these statutes may properly be brought in state courts. It is apparent that the overwhelming majority of such actions have been brought in federal courts. There is nothing in the statutes, however, which limits jurisdiction of such actions to federal courts, and state court jurisdiction of such cases has recently been upheld in the following cases: <em>New Times, Inc. v.
