A transferee is under such an equitable duty to reconvey property to the transferor if the transfer was induced by fraud, duress, undue influence, or mistake, or if the transfer was the result of an abuse of a confidential relationship, <em>Chambers v.

A transferor of property who seeks to have a constructive trust imposed must, of course, prove the facts which would entitle him to relief by evidence which is clear, precise, and convincing.

    <p id="b673-4" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[177,946,1147,863]]]'>Under our case law a confidential relationship has been presumed with respect to transfers of property from a wife to her husband; in such cases, therefore, the husband as transferee has borne the burden of proving that he acted in good faith and took no undue advantage of his wife. <em>Shapiro v. Shapiro, </em><a href="/pa/424/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="424 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1904946" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0120-01">424 Pa. 120</a>, 129, <a href="/citations/?q=224%20A.2d%20164" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="224 A.2d 164">224 A.2d 164</a> (1966). There has been, however, no correlative presumption of a confidential relationship between spouses with respect to transfers of property from a husband to his wife; rather, it has been presumed that a gift by the husband was intended. <em>Lapayowker v. Lincoln College Preparatory School, </em><a href="/pa/386/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="386 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1268307" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0167-01">386 Pa. 167</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=125%20A.2d%20451" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="125 A.2d 451">125 A.2d 451</a> (1956).

Application of such a presumption in favor of wives only is a vestige of days, long passed, when it was <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>normal and expected that husbands should manage the family money and property without the advice or consent of their wives. No purpose would be served by providing for the equality of treatment of spouses by the extension of the presumption of a confidential relationship between spouses in order to afford protection to husbands, for neither husbands nor wives, as a class, today occupy the rather passive and submissive role to which women formerly were relegated.</p>
    <p id="b674-4" data-blocks='[["BL_674.4",674,[250,788,1162,687]]]'>The abolition of the presumption of a confidential relationship in a marital setting does not, of course, preclude a person from showing that a confidential relationship <em>in fact </em>existed in his or her marriage. As it is the province of the fact-finder to resolve disputes as to the existence of such a relationship, and as the chancellor below cast his findings in light of a now discarded presumption, I agree with my Brother ROBERTS that a remand for factual findings on this issue would ordinarily be in order. Because, however, my independent review of the record convinces me that a finding of a confidential relationship could not be supported by the record, I concur in the reversal of the chancellor’s decree.</p>

The master in this case apparently applied the rebuttable presumption that a trust is created in a wife’s favor if a husband obtains a wife’s property without adequate consideration. There is another presumption, not applied by the master, that a gift arises when a husband purchases real or personal property with his own funds and places <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>it in an entireties estate. <em>Clay v.

The Pennsylvania Equal Rights Amendment, Pa.Const. art. I, § 28, (adopted May 18, 1971) prohibits such presumptions unless they are applied equally to both the wife and the husband. See <em>Henderson v. Henderson, </em><a href="/pa/458/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="458 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="479783" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0097-01">458 Pa. 97</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=327%20A.2d%2060" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="327 A.2d 60">327 A.2d 60</a> (1974).
