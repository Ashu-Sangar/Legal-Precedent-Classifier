It would be unrealistic to expect the Attorney General to possess personal knowledge of the details of “the nature of the investigation and the need for the immunization of the witness” (19 P.S. § 640.2) concerning investigations underway throughout the Commonwealth and all witnesses in those investigations. The more realistic expectation is that personal knowledge will be possessed by the Attorney General’s subordinates who are actually involved in the conduct of the investigations, which knowledge, when related to the Attorney General, will enable him to make the decision whether immunity shall be sought.

He misunderstands both the statute and the petition. The Act requires the petition to set forth the need for immunization, not the need for the testimony. This petition adequately sets forth the need for immunization; it recites 1) that the grand jury is mandated to investigate police corruption; 2) that the grand jury was reliably informed that Falone had participated in a conspiracy to bribe members of the Philadelphia Police Department, from which it may be inferred that he possessed information relevant to the subject of the investigation; 3) that obtaining Falone’s information was necessary to carry out the grand jury’s mandate; and 4) that Falone, by invoking his privilege against self-incrimination, had shown that the information possessed by him would not be disclosed absent immunity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> Thus, the petition, read <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>as a whole, alleges that immunization is necessary for the grand jury to obtain information that is relevant to its inquiry from a witness who, it is reliably informed, possesses it.

Such is not a requirement of our law. The effect of the Court’s rulings was to inhibit the defense in two respects; 1) the defense has not heard the case presented by the Deputy Attorney General and does not know what contentions to rebut or how to persuade the court to rule his way and 2) the record is insufficient for the defendant to formulate meaningful arguments on appeal and for an appellate court to decide whether the supervising judge exercised sound discretion. The appellee argues forcefully that the hearing he received was constitutionally inadequate because it did not comport with standards of due process required by the United States and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Constitutions. More specifically, <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>it is contended that the hearing provided for in 19 P.S. § 640.1, <em>swpra, </em>must include the production of evidence in an adversary posture and, at a minimum, must provide for a clear record in order for appellee to exercise his right to appeal in a meaningful fashion.

It seems clear to me that the legislative intent was to grant immunity only in those cases where there was a true conspiracy to commit the substantive offenses listed therein. The principal evil the Act sought to cure was vast networks of well conceived criminal ventures by those involved in organized crime. To find, as the majority does today, that conspiracy modified <em>only </em>the substantive crime of murder and to support this finding by reasoning that the legislature intended to grant immunity when the substantive crimes of bribery and narcotics offenses were committed, defies logic. This reasoning would leave the substantive crime of murder unreachable under this Act. My construction would include all of the crimes listed as long as there was a conspiracy to commit them.</p>
