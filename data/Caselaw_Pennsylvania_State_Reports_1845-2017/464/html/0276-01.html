As noted above, proof of an “accident” is a necessary condition to entitlement to workmen’s compensation benefits. Act of June 2, 1915, <em>supra, </em>§ 301(a), as amended prior to 1972, 77 P.S. § 431; <em>Hinkle v. H. J. Heinz Co., </em><a href="/pa/462/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="462 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="485226" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0111-01">462 Pa. 111</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="462 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="485226" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0111-01">337 A.2d 907</a> (1975). Over the years the term “accident”, which is used in the workmen’s compensation statutes of most states, has become something of a term of art, acquiring by virtue of numerous court decisions connotations which differ somewhat from the meaning of the word in common parlance. <em>See generally </em>1A A. Larson, Workmen’s Compensation Law, §§ 37.00 <em>et seq., </em>38.00 <em>et seq., </em>and 39.00 <em>et seq. </em>(1973); 1 A. Barbieri, <em>supra, </em>§§ 3.08-3.17. In an early case this Court defined the term accident as a “mishap”, a “fortuitous happening”, or an “untoward event which is not expected or designed.” <em>McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Company et al., </em><a href="/pa/261/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="261 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1042265" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0312-01">261 Pa. </a><a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a><a href="/pa/261/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="261 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1042265" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0312-01">312</a>, 328, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20617" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="104 A. 617">104 A. 617</a>, 622 (1918); see also <em>Lacey v.

It has become well-settled that the element of unexpectedness or unforeseeability may be supplied not only by the manner in which the injury occurred but also by the “circumstances causing the injury or in the nature of the injury itself.” <em>Hinkle v. H. J. Heinz Company, </em><a href="/pa/462/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="462 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="485226" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0111-01">462 Pa. 111</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="462 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="485226" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0111-01">337 A.2d 907</a>, 910 (1975).

Thus, whether or not an “accident” for workmen’s compensation purposes had occurred is a conclusion of law, requiring the application of a voluminous body of case law to a set of factual findings as to what transpired at the relevant time and place. Because the answer to the question whether an accident has occurred is a legal conclusion rather than a factual finding, it is fully reviewable by the Board under the 1972 amendments to Section 423. <em>Holland v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>16 Pa.Cmwlth. 367, <a href="/citations/?q=332%20A.2d%20834" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="332 A.2d 834">332 A. 2d 834</a> (1975).</p>

Our own review of the referee’s findings of fact discloses that they are insufficient to enable the Board or an appellate court to decide this issue. The referee apparently accepted the claimant’s account of the episode in appellee’s store on March 11, 1971.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> He also found that in 1957 the claimant had suffered an injury to his back in an automobile accident. He did not, however, make findings as to whether the claimant’s fall onto the lawnmower caused his subsequent back disability or whether in 1971 he was still suffering any effects <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>of the 1957 accident. Both of these findings are essential to the determination of whether appellant sustained an accident in the course of his employment. The claimant’s fall over the lawnmower would seem to be the kind of unusual or unexpected occurrence which has generally been considered to be an accident for workmen’s compen- ' sation purposes. See <em>McCarthy v. General Electric Co., </em><a href="/pa/293/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="293 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="1111124" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0448-01">293 Pa. 448</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20A.%20116" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="143 A. 116">143 A. 116</a> (1928); see generally <em>Parks v. Miller Printing Maching Company, </em><a href="/pa/336/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="336 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1195608" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0455-01">336 Pa. 455</a>, 458-59, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20742" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="9 A.2d 742">9 A.2d 742</a> (1939). Thus, appellant’s back disability, if caused by the fall, would be compensable. Moreover, the fact that appellant’s back disability first manifested itself immediately after his attempted lifting of the lawnmower while acting in the course of his employment at Page’s may be sufficient to establish the occurrence of an accident under the “unusual pathological result doctrine”. Under that doctrine, an “accident” occurs “where the work or act performed by the employee is voluntary, and not marked by any abnormal or unusual feature, but where there occurs an unexpected and unusual pathological result. . . .” <em>Parks v. Miller Printing Machine Co., supra </em>at 459, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20742" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="9 A.2d 742">9 A.2d at 744</a>. In such cases “the accident resides in the extraordinary nature of the effect rather than in the cause.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20742" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="9 A.2d 742">Id.</a> </em>The unusual pathological result doctrine does not, however, relieve an employee of the burden of proving that his injury is causally connected to his employment. Thus, there can be no recovery under this doctrine if it is shown that a preexisting physical condition contributed to the employee’s injury. <em>Yuhas v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>8 Pa.Cmwlth. 302, <a href="/citations/?q=303%20A.2d%20266" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="303 A.2d 266">303 A.2d 266</a> (1973); <em>Rettew v.

Barbieri, <em>supra, </em>§ 3.11 at 21. It would therefore appear that appellant established the occurrence or an “accident” under the unusual pathological doctrine unless it were determined that he was still suffering from the effects of the 1957 automobile accident.</p>

Although the incident giving rise to this claim and the filing of the claim petition occurred prior to May 1, 1972, the effective date of the 1972 amendments, the appeal to the Board was heard and decided after that date. Legislation which affects substantive rights will not be construed to apply retroactively unless the legislature has expressly provided that it shall, but legislation which merely alters procedure will generally be applied to pending proceedings. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Fenner, </em><a href="/pa/399/0633-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="399 Pa. 633" data-case-ids="1290593" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0633-01">399 Pa. 633</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.2d%20150" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="161 A.2d 150">161 A.2d 150</a> (1960); <em>Kuca v. Lehigh Valley Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/268/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="268 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1061509" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0163-01">268 Pa. 163</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.%20731" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="110 A. 731">110 A. 731</a> (1920). A statute affects substantive rights if it alters a cause of action. See <em>Smith v. Fenner, supra. </em>The phrase “cause of action” may have different meanings for different purposes. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Memphis Cotton Oil Co., </em><a href="/us/288/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="288 U.S. 62" data-case-ids="79684" data-case-paths="/us/288/0062-01">288 U.S. 62</a>, 67, <a href="/us/288/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="288 U.S. 62" data-case-ids="79684" data-case-paths="/us/288/0062-01">53 S.

The definition which is perhaps most useful in making distinction between substance and procedure is that a cause of action consists of “the group of operative facts out of which a grievance has developed.” <em>Id.; </em>see also <em>Smith v. Fenner, supra, </em><a href="/pa/399/0633-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="399 Pa. 633" data-case-ids="1290593" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0633-01">399 Pa. at </a>641 n. 2, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.2d%20150" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="161 A.2d 150">161 A.2d at </a>154 n. 3, and the cases cited therein. Thus, a “cause of action” may be defined as the factual basis for a claim, or, to put it another way, a set of facts which, if proved, would entitle a party to relief.</p>

See <em>Kuca </em>v. <em>Lehigh Valley Coal Co., supra. </em>Thus, the changes in the Board’s scope of review wrought by the amendments of Section 423, being procedural in nature, are applicable to pending proceedings such as this claimant’s appeal to the Board. See <em>Universal Cyclops </em>v. <em>Krawczynski, </em>9 Pa.Cmwlth. 176, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20757" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="305 A.2d 757">305 A.2d 757</a> (1973). This is in contrast to the amendments made by the same Act to Section 301(a) and which eliminated the requirement of proof of an accident in workmen’s compensation cases. The latter provision clearly alters the facts which a claimant must prove in order to establish entitlement to workmen’s compensation benefits and is therefore not applicable to this claimant’s case, see note 3 <em>supra.</em>
