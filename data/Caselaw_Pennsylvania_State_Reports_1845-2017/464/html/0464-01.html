Thereafter he was left alone until 4:20 when he ate a meal provided by the police. After eating, he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights for a third time and advised of his co-defendant’s statement implicating appellant. At this point appellant orally confessed.

Counsel cannot reasonably be expected to present every conceivable and speculative basis for objection to the trial court on the ground that some time in the future some remedy may be found to exist for violation of a right. Competent counsel can only be reasonably expected to select for presentation the objections which, based on present law, have the best, realistic chance of success.
