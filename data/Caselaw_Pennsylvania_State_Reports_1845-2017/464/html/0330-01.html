No acceptable reasoning has been presented to persuade this Court to ignore the statutory requirements concerning the perfecting of an appeal de novo from an award of arbitrators under the Act of 1836. The Act provides that one <em>“shall </em>pay all costs that may have accrued in such suit or action”’ The Act further provides that “[s]uch appeal <em>shall </em>be entered, and the costs paid, and recognizance filed, within twenty days after the day of entry of the award of the arbitrators on the docket.” (Emphasis added.) We are unable to find any justification for giving the word <em>shall </em>a different meaning in one sentence than we give it in a different sentence of the same section of the Act of 1836. The only proper conclusion is that the word <em>shall </em>preceding the words <em>pay all the costs that may have accrued </em>must be considered mandatory in meaning in the same <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>manner as the word <em>shall </em>has been considered mandatory when referring to the time period for entering an appeal.</p>
