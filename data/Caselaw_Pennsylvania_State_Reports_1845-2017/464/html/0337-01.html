The only direct evidence against appellant was his confession which had been the subject of an earlier suppression hearing. Appellant contends here that he was denied due process of law because the confession should have been suppressed as involuntarily and improperly obtained. After reviewing the aggregate of the circumstances surrounding the taking of the confession, we believe that the suppression court correctly found that the appellant’s confession was voluntary. We therefore affirm.</p>

Appellant voluntarily came into the police station because he understood the Chief of Police wanted to talk to him. It had come to their attention, and appellant freely admitted, that he had often engaged in acts of anal intercourse with young boys, during the course of which he would grab his victim by the throat. <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>However, he steadfastly denied any knowledge of or participation in the crime in question and, after about two hours of discussion, appellant exercised his right to terminate the interview and left the police station.</p>

The detectives did not attempt to execute a search because they did not wish to disturb appellant’s mother who was the only person home at the time. Instead, the two detectives traveled to Philadelphia and appeared at the appellant’s father’s automobile repair shop where the appellant was working. Upon arrival, Dickerson told appellant in the presence of his father that they wanted to speak further with him about the Eugene Moore murder case. At this time, he also advised appellant of his constitutional right to remain silent, to have free counsel, etc., and appellant acknowledged his understanding of these rights. Appellant was not charged with any crime or taken into custody at this time. Dickerson also told him that they had a search warrant for his house. The appellant expressed willingness to speak with the officers, although he indicated a desire that the questioning take place in the repair shop. Dickerson stated his preference that the interview be conducted at the Court House in Media, in view of the cold and uncomfortable conditions in the repair shop, and, after a short exchange, appellant agreed to go to Media.</p>

Appellant then answered questions <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>for about twenty minutes, but steadfastly denied any involvement in the case.</p>

Both Detective Dickerson and the detective who administered the polygraph examination testified at the suppression hearing that they were aware that they were dealing with a person of less than average intelligence. In fact, appellant had only gone as far as the eighth grade in school, and psychiatric reports stated that his I.Q. was in the range of 70-75 which classified him as a borderline mental defective.</p>

It is apparent that both claims assert the involuntariness of the confession.

The sole witness for the defense at trial, Dr. Harvey Bartle, a psychiatrist, testified that he found the appellant to be intellectually deficient, functionally equivalent to an eleven to thirteen year old child. He also diagnosed appellant as a psychopathic or sociopathic personality meaning that “he just functions for the moment only.” Such a personality, Dr. Bartle testified, is very susceptable to duress and pressure.

Dr. Kool rebutted Dr. Bartle’s testimony by stating that a psychopath not only knows specifically what he is doing and its nature and consequences but that he can also be very cunning and adept at a specific ploy or act.

Although appellant’s chronological age was eighteen years at the time of his arrest and confession, <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>the record is uncontradicted that his ability to comprehend was not equal to that of most eighteen-year-olds. His I.Q. was in the range of 70-75 (a “borderline mental defective”) and he had gone only as far as the eighth grade in school. It is my opinion that a review of the circumstances surrounding the giving of the statement here shows that the confession was obtained in violation of appellant’s rights and should have been suppressed.

Yet, the testimony of the police officers themselves shows that appellant (an eighteen-year-old “mental defective” with an I.Q. of 70-75) was presented with what the police knew was a patently defective “warrant”, and then “requested” to accompany them from his father’s garage in Philadelphia to the courthouse in Media, Pennsylvania, in a different county and a distance of more than 15 miles away. It seems clear to me that no credibility issue need be resolved to conclude that appellant was subject to police control and, therefore, under “arrest” at the moment he left his father’s garage in their company.</p>
    <p id="b489-5" data-blocks='[["BL_489.5",489,[199,1777,1145,429]]]'>The majority states that “[t]he suppression judge obviously rejected [appellant’s] testimony [that it was impossible for him to leave the Media courthouse] as incredible.” More incredible, it seems to me, is the majority’s assertion that appellant (an eighteen-year-old “mental defective” with an I.Q. of 70-75) voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his rights and chose, of his own volition, to remain.</p>

The defense need not show that it was involuntary, unknowing, or unintelligent. Yet, the majority’s analysis focuses on what the defense did <em>not </em>show: (1) deception was <em>not proven </em>because the suppression judge made a credibility determination adverse to the defendant; (2) appellant did <em>not prove </em>that he was coerced into staying with police officers at the Media courthouse because that allegation was “incredible”; (3) appellant’s age and mental condition did <em>not prevent </em>a valid waiver because the suppression judge adversely determined that credibility issue; (4) there is <em>“nothing </em>in the testimony of appellant that he was tired, confused, or harassed or that he did not comprehend the frequent constitutional warnings.” But what is there on the other side? That appellant gave standard “yes”, “no”, responses to the officers’ pro for-ma recitation of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, that in the nine hours that appellant spent in police custody, only two were devoted to actual interrogation, and that he was “well treated in every respect by the police.” That evidence, it seems to me, falls far short of establishing a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of one’s constitutional rights. I therefore dissent.</p>
