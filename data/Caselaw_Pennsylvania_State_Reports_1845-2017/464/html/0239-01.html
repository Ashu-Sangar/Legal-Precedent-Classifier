We agree with the trial court that in light of this duty, the obvious purpose of Section 602(b) is to prevent any of <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>the named officers, as well as their chief clerks or deputies, from being in the position of auditing their own books.

    <p id="b385-4" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[204,751,1146,803]]]'>Appellant argues that his status as chief deputy recorder of deeds should not be determinative, but rather the actual functions that he performed as chief deputy recorder should control. He contends that because Section 602(b) intrudes on areas of expression protected by the First Amendment, it should be read narrowly so as to include the chief clerk or deputy only when he in fact exercises the duties of his principal (in this case the recorder of deeds) as he is authorized to do in case of a vacancy in the office, Act of August 9, 1955, P.L. 323, § 1305, 16 P.S. § 1305; or during the necessary or temporary absence of the principal office holder.

Here appellant’s duties were different from those of other office employees. He had a separate office area, was in charge of disciplining employees, signed the payroll for the office, signed requisitions for material, equipment, and furniture, and was in control of the office when the recorder of deeds was absent on vacation. It may be that he was closely supervised and directed in all of these activities by the recorder, but as chief deputy he was more than just another employee. He did, at various times, act in the name of the recorder of deeds, and it is the possible abuse of such a position at which Section 602 (b) is directed.</p>
    <p id="b386-9" data-blocks='[["BL_386.6",386,[249,1435,1156,694]]]'>Appellant also contends there are less drastic means of protecting the compelling state interest. He argues that in the case of a row officer, or his chief clerk or deputy, subsequently elected controller, the statute of limitations could be two years from the time his term as controller expires. This argument is untenable. If either a row officer, or his chief clerk or deputy, was guilty of some misconduct, he would have the opportunity to cover it up for four years during his first term as controller; eight years if elected to a second term; plus two more years under the suggested statute of limitations. After such a period, which could be as long as ten years, the misconduct, if any, may never come to light.</p>

Conducting an audit is not like checking to see if the light switch is on or off. In that instance one check would be adequate. An audit on the other hand, is a painstaking operation often requiring the checking of hundreds or thousands of documents. Subsequent audits frequently reveal discrepancies which went unnoticed in prior audits. Moreover, appellant himself argues that the audit performed by the controller’s office is probably ineffective for the discovery of any alteration of the books or embezzlement.</p>
    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.4",387,[216,910,1149,531]]]'>Appellant also argues that the annual audit conducted by the state auditor general’s office is sufficient to protect the state interest, particularly since the audit performed by the controller’s office is, according to appellant, ineffective. We feel it is a valid legislative judgment that there be more than one annual audit, the second acting as a check on the first. Such dual audits represent the minimum that must be done to assure that the state’s interest in protecting itself from official misconduct is fully protected.</p>
    <p id="b387-5" data-blocks='[["BL_387.5",387,[217,1465,1144,367]]]'>We also find no merit in appellant’s contention that there is no conflict of interest because of the alleged ineffectiveness of the audit. The alleged failure of a controller to properly perform his statutory duties can hardly be a valid reason for ignoring the purpose of Section 602(b). Section 1720 cannot be read to direct or approve the conducting of an ineffective audit.</p>
