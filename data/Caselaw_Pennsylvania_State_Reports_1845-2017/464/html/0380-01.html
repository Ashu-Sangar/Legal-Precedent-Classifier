The lower court dismissed her complaint, finding that appellant lacked capacity to sue because of Sections 111 and 114 of the Married Women’s Property Act which prohibit actions seeking to destroy entireties estates prior to termination of <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>the marriage.

We agree with this conclusion and for the reasons hereinafter discussed affirm the disposition of the lower court.</p>
    <p id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[184,592,1144,800]]]'>The facts leading to the present controversy are not in dispute. On May 18, 1968, appellant married the appellee, Russell T. Backus. They are still lawfully married although appellant instituted divorce proceedings on June 5, 1973. In July of 1969, the parties purchased a home as tenants by the entireties for the purchase price of $18,000 with the assumption of an existing mortgage in excess of $12,000. Appellant alleges that she paid $6,182.83 of her separate monies toward the purchase price and that while the parties lived together they both contributed towards the mortgage payments and for the repair and maintenance of their home. Since appellee’s desertion in May of 1971, appellant asserts that she has assumed the entire financial responsibility for the home in which she continues to reside.</p>
    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[181,1421,1147,588]]]'>The reason for appellant’s action is that once her divorce becomes final the parties will hold the real estate as tenants in common.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Consequently, appellant asserts that her husband will unfairly obtain the benefit of her initial purchase payment and continuing mortgage payments. Therefore, she has petitioned for a declaration that her husband be deemed to hold his interest in the property as trustee for her and that he be made to account to her for her payments on behalf of the property. The lower court found no merit in her position and sustained appellee’s preliminary objections.</p>

However, this overlooks the nature of the entire-ties estate.* Because this is an entireties estate and the parties are still lawfully married, her action is barred by the Act of June 8, 1893, P.L. 344, § 3, 48 P.S. § 111, which provides that a woman may only sue for divorce or to protect her separate property and by the Act of May 1, 1913, P.L. 146, § 1, 48 P.S. § 114, which allows a deserted woman to sue upon any cause of action except those which would destroy the right of survivorship in joint property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

It is true that she has several remedies available to her which are not precluded by the Married Women’s Property Act. The Act of May 23, 1907, P.L. 227, § 1, 48 P.S. § 131, provides that a woman may sue in law or equity for support for herself and her children. Once such a decree is entered, execution may be had against entireties property and the property sold in satisfaction of the claim under the Act of May 24, 1923, P.L. 446, § 1, 48 P.S. § 137. Also, the Act of May 24, 1923, P.L. 446, § 2, 48 P.S. § 138, provides that the wife is “entitled out of the proceeds of such sale to such sum of money as represents her share in such property, based on the proportionate part of the original purchase money furnished by her for the purchase of such property.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">

      <em> </em>While appellant argues that these provisions give her the right to sue generally, it is clear that they are limited to actions for support and allow for sale only to enforce this right.
