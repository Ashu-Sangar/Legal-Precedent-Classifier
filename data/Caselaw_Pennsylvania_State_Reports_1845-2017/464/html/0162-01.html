Therefore, The Author<a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>ity posits that, under these circumstances, the twelve month time limitation should be computed from the date it first became aware of the loss, i. e., May 10, 1971.

Aetna Insurance Company, </em>supra. In <em>Sager </em>the insured property owner had suffered damage from various acts of vandalism occurring between February 1, 1953, and January 14, 1955. The damage, however, was not discovered until January 14, 1955. On January 12, 1956, the insured property owner brought suit against the insurer to enforce its claim. The contract of insurance contained a “commencement of suit” provision identical to that herein involved and the insurer, based on this provision, denied liability for those acts of vandalism which had occurred prior to January 12, 1955. The insured contended, however, that all damage was recoverable since it had commenced suit within one year after discovery of the damage. The Seventh Circuit upheld the insurer’s position stating that the term “inception of the loss”: “has nothing to do with the state of <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>mind of the insured. It deals with an objective fact . . The loss occurs and has its ‘inception’ whether or not the insured knows of it.” <em>Sager Glove Corporation v. Aetna Insurance Company, </em>supra at 441. To the same effect see <em>Harris v. Hanover Fire Insurance Company, </em><a href="/f2d/425/1168-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="425 F.2d 1168" data-case-ids="3678881" data-case-paths="/f2d/425/1168-01">425 F.2d 1168</a> (5th Cir. 1970).</p>

Initially, we note that <em>Thompson </em>did not involve the interpretation of a contractual “commencement of suit” provision. Rather, it dealt with the bar of the six-year statute of limitations on contract actions in Pennsylvania. However, <em>Thompson </em>did set forth the rule peculiarly applicable to life insurance policies, necessitated by the existence of third person beneficiaries, that where such a beneficiary does not know of the <em>existence </em>of the policy until after the time limit stated in the policy has expired, he or she may still bring suit to enforce the policy provided: (1) he or she notifies the insurer at once after acquiring that knowledge, and (2) the lack of knowledge was without negligence or fault of the party seeking to be excused. Instantly, we are concerned with a fire insurance policy which, concededly, The Authority was aware of. Therefore, the equitable considerations present in Thompson, i. e., the innocent third party beneficiary, are not present here to support a belated commencement of suit.</p>
