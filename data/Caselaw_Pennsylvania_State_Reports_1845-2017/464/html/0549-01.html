Appellant, Edward McClellan Orwick, Sr., and Leann Shank were married in June 1968. A son, Edward, Jr., was born of this marriage on October 17, 1968.

At the time of separation a voluntary support agreement was entered into with the approval of the court, setting payment at $50.00 per month and granting visitation rights. The couple was divorced on July 7, 1971. Appellant’s last payment under the 1969 support order was made on September 6, 1972, at which time he was $940.00 in arrears.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> On December 9, 1971, Leann Shank remarried. Prior to this second marriage appellant made regular visits to his son. During that time, for the most part, appellant lived only a short walk from his son. After Leann Shank’s second marriage at the end of 1971 appellant’s visits with his son became less regular. The Shanks moved from the immediate area two months after their marriage to the town of Bellwood, Pennsylvania.</p>

In addition, on the child’s fifth birthday in October 1978, a card was sent and for Christmas 1973 a card and a United States Savings Bond were sent.

His wife and child, as a result of his neglect, were compelled to seek public assistance during 1971.

In any event, for a period in excess of twenty-two months just prior to the hearing in this case, appellant made no affirmative effort to see his son. He explains by saying that he felt his failure to support his son would bring the matter of his visitation rights before a court. We find this explanation inadequate.

We find his interpretation of <em>McAhren </em>to be incorrect. Unlike the present appellant, Mr. McAhren had consistently supported his children under a support order for two years. Mr. McAhren did not stop paying support until his former wife refused him his visitation rights for the second time. Even then he put the payments in escrow as evidenced by the County Court’s records. His lapse in support only lasted six months. In addition, Mr. McAhren had “continually persisted” in attempting to communicate, 460 Pa. at 72, 331 A.2d at 423, and the evidence indicated that one year preceding the filing of the involuntary adoption petition there involved, he had filed a habeas corpus action to enforce his visitation rights. That petition led to the resumption of his visitation privileges. The totality of circumstances revealed that Mr. McAhren wanted to remain a positive force in his children’s lives and was being thwarted in <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>his efforts by his former wife.
