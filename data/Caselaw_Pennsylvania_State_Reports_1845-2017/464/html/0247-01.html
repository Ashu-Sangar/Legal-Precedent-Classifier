In 1972, following a period of marital discord, the couple executed a separation agreement which provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that Victor would pay Antonetta $43 a week for the support of Rosetta. Later that year Victor and Antonetta were divorced.</p>

Antonetta filed a petition for child support in the Family Division of the Court of Common Pleas. After a hearing the court ordered Victor to pay child support of $31 a week. Neither party appealed from that order.</p>
    <p id="b390-12" data-blocks='[["BL_390.12",390,[251,1681,1155,419]]]'>Subsequently Antonetta filed an action in equity in which she sought to have the support provision of the separation agreement specifically enforced.

Antonetta then brought this appeal.</p>

      <em>Snively </em>and <em>Balph </em>hold that in a proceeding for support, a court is not bound by a support agreement between the parents which provides that the responsible parent must pay an amount for child support which is inadequate to support the child appropriately. The Superior Court explained the reasons for this policy as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.5",391,[258,991,1098,576]]]'>“ ‘ [A] support proceeding is not an action brought to enforce the performance of a contractual obligation. It is a quasi-criminal proceeding brought by the minor child in the name of the Commonwealth, though at the relation or on the information of the child’s mother. The relationship of parent and child is a status — not a property right . . . and a mother cannot, by contract, bargain away the right of her minor child to adequate support, to the relief of the father, irrespective of the legality of the agreement between the parents themselves.’ ”</blockquote>
