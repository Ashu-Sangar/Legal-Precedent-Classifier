It provided that income be paid to settlor and his wife for the remainder of their lives; after their death, the income was to be paid, in equal shares, to settlor’s children, Margaret Tracy Ritteman and Stephen Tracy, Jr. Upon the death of either child, “the share of such child shall be paid over to his or her issue per stirpes.” The question presented in this case is whether the natural daughter of Stephen Tracy, Jr. (Stephen Jr.), who was adopted by one unrelated to settlor in 1951, is entitled to share in the distribution to the “issue” of Stephen Jr. The orphans’ court concluded that she is entitled to share in that distribution and this appeal ensued.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We affirm.</p>

A daughter Stephanie (the appellee) was born to Stephen Jr., and his then wife, Cora Hepburn Tracy, on December 25, 1938. Stephen Jr. and Cora were divorced on August 21, 1942, and Cora took custody of Stephanie. On January 9, 1943, Stephen Jr. married his second wife, Thelma Budd Tracy.

At his death, his share “shall be paid over to his issue per stirpes.” Had settlor, his wife, and Stephen Jr. all died before Stephanie’s adoption in 1951, there would be no question that she would have been entitled to participate in this distribution as the daughter of Stephen Jr. The terms of the trust instrument clearly identify Stephanie as one of the objects of settlor’s bounty. It is unlikely that settlor would have desired to exclude Stephanie from benefits under the trust merely because his son gave his consent to her adoption by her stepfather.

Upon the death of the brother, the corpus was to be distributed among his “issue.” The brother had five children, two of whom predeceased him. Of the two children who predeceased the brother, each left a child. One of these grandchildren of testatrix’ brother was adopted, before the death of the brother, by a person unrelated to testatrix or her brother. When the brother died, the question arose whether this grandchild, adopted “out” of the family of testatrix’ brother, was entitled to participate in the distribution as “issue” of the brother.
