Williams filed a claim petition under the Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> alleging he was totally disabled as the result of employment by Spaulding Bakeries, Inc. [Spaulding], in a hazardous occupation. Williams had been employed by Spaulding from 1934 to April 21, 1969, interrupted only by two years of military service. During this time Williams served in many capacities, several of which involved exposure to flour dust. In his petition, Williams alleged that, as a result of his exposure to and inhalation of the flour dust, he had become totally disabled from “Baker’s Asthma” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and, therefore, qualified for compensation under the provisions of Section 108 (n) of the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The Board held that Williams is totally disabled due to “pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary emphysema induced by flour dust”. Spaulding then filed an appeal in the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County and this appeal was dismissed. An appeal was then taken to the Commonwealth Court which recognized the Board had acted without the benefit of our decision in <em>Utter v. Asten-Hill Mfg.

Whereas the prior lettered subsections of Section 108 designate specific occupational diseases, Section 108 (n) mentions no disease but, instead, provides that the term occupational disease shall include “other occupational diseases (1) to which the claimant is exposed by reason of his employment, and (2) which are peculiar to the industry or occupation, and (3) which are not common to the general population.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The underlying rationale of these cases was a determination that the legislature intended Section 108 (n) to apply only to the discovery of “new” diseases having their genesis in the claimant’s occupation. However, in <em>Utter v. Asten-Hill Mfg. Co., supra, </em>this Court expanded the usefulness of Section 108(n) as a vehicle for compensation in situations where the disease, although not enumerated elsewhere in the Act, is nevertheless generated by an occupational hazard. We there ruled that cancer, although common to the general public, can be an occupational disease as that term is defined by Section 108 (n), “if it may be shown by competent evidence that a claimant’s cancer is peculiar to the claimant’s occupation by its <em>causes and the characteristics of its manifestation”. </em>[Emphasis added.] <em>Id. </em>at 410, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20583" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="309 A.2d 583">309 A.2d at 588</a>.</p>

Therefore, we implicitly held that any disease, although common to the general public, would be an occupational disease within Section 108(n) if the claimant could demonstrate the disease to be peculiar to his occupation by its “causes and the characteristics of its manifestation”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
