    <p class="author" id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.6",161,[243,722,366,42]]]'>O’BRIEN, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b161-7" data-blocks='[["BL_161.7",161,[190,784,1151,370]]]'>This appeal arises from an order of the Commonwealth Court which granted the request of appellee, Pocono Pines Corporation, to compel appellant, the Pennsylvania Game Commission, to execute the necessary instruments to confirm appellee’s interest in land claimed by appellant. We granted Petition for Allowance of Appeal.</p>
    <p id="b161-8" data-blocks='[["BL_161.8",161,[186,1179,1155,1132]]]'>The facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. Appellant claims title to an interest in the disputed land through a deed recorded in Monroe County on December 28, 1949, from the United States of America to appellant for use of the land as a wildlife preserve. The deed left the mineral rights in the United States and provided that title would revert to the United States whenever the President or other governmental official declared the land was needed for defense purposes. The United States’ title was derived from a 1918 condemnation proceeding against Frank C. Miller, the original owner of the disputed land. Appellee claims title to the land through Frank C. Miller, and further claims that the United States’ condemnation of Miller’s property was ineffective for lack of notice to Miller. The Commonwealth Board of Property found the condemnation to be valid; this decision was appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which reversed the board, holding that the United States’ condemnation was invalid, and ordered the execution of the necessary documents to confirm appellee’s interest in the land. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b162-3" data-blocks='[["BL_162.3",162,[252,266,1159,260]]]'>
      <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>Initially, we must point out that while the action filed by appellee before the Board of Property carried no technical designation, it is, in our opinion, an action to quiet title, as defined in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1061(b)(3), 12 P.S. Appendix, which provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b162-4" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[295,557,1110,251]]]'>“ . . .to compel an adverse party to file, record, cancel, surrender or satisfy of record, or admit the validity, invalidity or discharge of, any document, obligation or deed affecting any right, lien, title or interest in land . . . . ”</blockquote>
    <p id="b162-6" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[244,846,1156,259]]]'>In the instant case, appellee brought suit to compel appellant to execute necessary documents in order to confirm a deed in favor of appellee. Based on this request, we must treat the petition filed by appellee as, in fact, an action to quiet title.</p>
    <p id="b162-7" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[242,1144,1155,312]]]'>Having found that the action filed before the Board of Property is, in essence, one to quiet title, we are of the opinion that both the Board of Property and the Commonwealth Court lacked jurisdiction to hear this action for want of an indispensable party, the United States government.</p>
    <p id="b162-8" data-blocks='[["BL_162.7",162,[225,1488,1168,801]]]'>The issue before the Board of Property was whether Pocono had a right to have a deed executed in its favor from the Pennsylvania Game Commission. This relief, as requested by Pocono, in turn centered on whether the deed to the Game Commission from the United States government in 1948, which left a reversionary interest in the property, as well as title to the mineral rights, in the United States government was valid based on the United States government’s acquisition of the property in a 1918 condemnation proceeding. If the condemnation was valid, Pocono could not prevail. It therefore becomes apparent that any decision rendered by the Board of Property would affect the property rights claimed by the United States government without its being represented before the Board of Property.</p>
    <p id="b163-3" data-blocks='[["BL_163.3",163,[196,273,1143,529]]]'>
      <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>The United States government had an interest to protect in the property and had a right to contest the alleged invalidity of the 1918 condemnation proceeding. Under these facts, we are of the opinion that the United States government was an indispensable party to the action before the Board of Property, and its failure to be joined as a party deprived the Board of Property of jurisdiction in the instant matter. In <em>Tigue v. Basalyga, </em><a href="/pa/451/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="451 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1948597" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0436-01">451 Pa. 436</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=304%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="304 A.2d 119">304 A.2d 119</a> (1973), we defined what is meant by an indispensable party:</p>

    <p id="b163-5" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[207,1107,1142,962]]]'>In the instant case, the reasoning of our <em>Tigue </em>decision also compels us to conclude that the United States government was an indispensable party before the Board of Property, and its fáilure to be present deprives the Board of Property of jurisdiction. The United States government, even though it deeded the property to the Game Commission in 1948, retained a reversionary interest and the title to mineral rights to the property now claimed by Pocono as a result of an alleged ineffective condemnation proceeding. The decision of the Board of Property, as the decision of the court in <em>Tigue, </em>would have the result of affecting or impairing the rights of the United States government, an indispensable party, which was not joined before the Board of Property. This failure divests the Board of Property of jurisdiction. Cf. <em>Mains v. Fulton, </em><a href="/pa/423/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="423 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="1903184" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0520-01">423 Pa. 520</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=224%20A.2d%20195" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="224 A.2d 195">224 A.2d 195</a> (1966); <em>Mohney Estate, </em><a href="/pa/416/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="416 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1892962" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0107-01">416 Pa. 107</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=204%20A.2d%20916" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="204 A.2d 916">204 A.2d 916</a> (1964).</p>

It is perfectly clear that the Board of Property could adjudicate the claim of appellee Pocono Pines and enter an appropriate decree without impairing any rights of the United States. All appellee is requesting is that the Board decide whether appellee or the Game Commission has a superior right to the interest that the Commission claims to own. Should it be determined that appellee has the superior right, the appropriate relief would be a decree awarding to appellee such interest as the Commission purports to have, subject to the rights of the United States. Complete justice could be administered between the parties before the Board, while the rights of the United States would remain to be determined at another time and in another forum.

Actions to try title to real property claimed by the Commonwealth may be brought only before the Board of Property. The United States may be sued concerning title to real property in which it claims an interest, if at all, in the federal courts. Thus, there is no judicial or administrative forum in which both the United States and the Game Commission can be joined for the adjudication of appellee’s claims. That result, though <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>harsh, would be the proper one if the United States were strictly indispensible, but surely we should strive to avoid such a result unless absolutely necessary for the protection of the rights of a non-party.
