They used words such as “guarantee,” “be responsible for,” or “see to it that another $100,000 was raised.” This type of language does not clearly reflect an <em>unconditional </em>promise to give. The more likely interpretation is that <em>if needed </em>he would see that the $100,000 was obtained in some way. At best, the language is subject equally to both interpretations and does not satisfy the burden of being clear, direct and convincing evidence of an offer to give $100,000. Under these circumstances, recovery by appellee required proof that the $100,000 was never obtained from any source.</p>
