    <p id="b720-17" data-blocks='[["BL_720.17",720,[266,2236,1150,97]],["BL_721.1",721,[185,305,1154,1510]]]'>On the morning of November 2nd, the caretaker of Ivan Birsic’s trailer, which Birsic had placed on his <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>property adjoining a dirt road approximately one mile from Pennsylvania Route 19 and two miles from the Pennsylvania State Police substation at Mercer, discovered that the gate had been broken by force during the evening or early morning hours. The trailer door was locked, however, and the caretaker had no key, and so it was not until Birsic himself was able to visit the property on November 11th that he learned that all of the furnishings of the trailer had been taken. In order to prevent a recurrence he had a burglar alarm installed which would be activated by the opening of the trailer door. On the night of November 10th-llth an electric saw and a tool box containing tools belonging to John Melhorn were stolen from Melhorn’s truck, and during the early morning hours of December 8th a tool box belonging to Glenn Speir and containing specialized tools specifically designed for trailer furnaces was stolen from Speir’s truck. On the afternoon of December 18th there was a burglary at the residence of Daniel Gadd in the course of which were stolen — among other items — a television set, a U. S. Coast Guard jacket, an extension cord for a razor, and a watch. In the course of investigating this burglary, Officer William Daley of the Pennsylvania State Police discovered distinctive v-shaped tread marks in the snow which he theorized had been made by the burglar. He also learned that a station wagon with wood panelling had been seen near the Gadd residence on the day of the burglary.</p>
    <p id="b721-4" data-blocks='[["BL_721.4",721,[182,1854,1148,472]]]'>While in his home on the evening of December 28th, the Birsic caretaker heard the burglar alarm recently installed at the nearby trailer go off. The caretaker immediately- telephoned the State Police in Mercer and told Officer Edward Lancaster of the incident; while he was on the telephone he saw a dark station wagon coming from the direction of the Birsic trailer pass his house. He told the officer he was going to follow the car and hung up.</p>
    <p id="b722-3" data-blocks='[["BL_722.3",722,[274,303,1154,912]]]'>
      <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>Officer Lancaster promptly began to drive toward the Birsic trailer; he soon reached the point on Route 19 where the dirt road which adjoins the Birsic property meets the highway. He there saw a station wagon with wood panelling on the sides and followed closely by another car about to pull off the dirt road onto Route 19. At this point the officer was aware not only that the caretaker was going to follow the suspicious car on this apparently little-used road, but that earlier in the day he had read a notice on the barracks bulletin board indicating that Officer Daley was looking for a station wagon with wood panelling in connection with his burglary investigations. The notice, however, actually described the station wagon with wood panelling as red, a late model, and either a Chrysler or a Plymouth. The station wagon observed by the officer on December 28th was a blue 1968 Mercury.</p>
    <p id="b722-4" data-blocks='[["BL_722.4",722,[272,1235,1153,693]]]'>As the station wagon pulled onto Route 19, Officer Lancaster halted it and was then told by the driver of the second car that he was the caretaker who had just called the State Police. The driver of the station wagon identified himself as Albert Andrew Lasch. However, he was unable to produce a driver’s license and admitted that his operating privileges were under suspension in Pennsylvania. Subsequently the officer learned by radioing the barracks that Lasch had had multiple convictions for driving without a license; he therefore arrested Lasch, took him into custody, and had him arraigned for the misdemeanor of driving a motor vehicle more than once while under suspension.</p>
    <p id="b722-5" data-blocks='[["BL_722.5",722,[270,1964,1150,366]],["BL_723.1",723,[167,302,1147,579]]]'>Meanwhile Officer Daley, who had investigated the previous burglary at the Birsic trailer, proceeded to the site of the trailer where he found footprints in the snow and mud, each with a v-shaped tread which seemed identical to what he had seen in the snow at the site of the Gadd burglary. He also discovered that, although the door handle was in a locked position, the door of the <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>trailer could be popped open by a hard bump with the shoulder and that the burglar alarm would only go off when the door was open. Nothing, however, appeared to be missing. Subsequently the officer advised Lasch of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and the latter stated that he understood them and that he was willing to answer questions. He also gave the officer permission to examine his shoes, which were muddy and had a v-shaped tread matching the footprints discovered that night at the Birsic trailer and previously at the Gadd residence; a search warrant was later obtained for the shoes.</p>
    <p id="b723-4" data-blocks='[["BL_723.4",723,[157,914,1154,1179]]]'>Subsequently warrants were also obtained to search both the station wagon and Lasch’s residence. Among the items found in the car were tool boxes and a power saw which Speir and Melhorn respectively identified as those that had been taken from their trucks. The search of Lasch’s residence revealed a dining room table, dining room chairs, lamps, pots and pans, and an electric sweeper all subsequently identified as items taken in the first Birsic burglary, and a television set, U. S. Coast Guard jacket, and extension cord for an electric razor each subsequently identified as those taken in the Gadd burglary. In addition, a watch had been stolen from the Gadd home. While Lasch was being fingerprinted, Officer Daley asked to see the watch he was wearing and copied the serial numbers. Although Lasch told the officer that he had purchased the watch from a jewelry store in Sharon, the serial numbers matched those of a watch purchased by Gadd from a jewelry store in Grove City. Subsequently, when Officer Daley asked Lasch for the watch pursuant to a search warrant, the latter insisted that the officer had never returned it to him; the watch was never recovered.</p>

He was additionally <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>charged in a fifth bill of indictment with operating a motor vehicle while his Pennsylvania driver’s license was under suspension, a misdemeanor because not a first offense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Pursuant to a motion by the district attorney under Rule 219(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure and over the timely objection of Lasch, the trial court consolidated the five indictments into a single trial. Before the consolidated case was submitted to the jury, the judge dismissed the charges of burglary and larceny with regard to Melhorn’s truck; subsequently the jury acquitted Lasch of burglary and larceny with regard to Speir’s truck. Lasch was ultimately convicted of burglary, larceny, and receiving stolen goods in connection with the Gadd and initial Birsic break-ins, of attempted burglary in connection with the second Birsic break-in, and of receiving stolen goods in connection with both the Melhorn and Speir thefts; in addition, he was convicted of driving while under suspension. He was sentenced to two and a half to six years imprisonment on each of the burglary convictions and to lesser or suspended terms for the other convictions, all sentences to be served concurrently. Lasch filed an appeal in the Superior Court which later affirmed the judgments of sentence in a unanimous per curiam order, <a href="/pa-super/229/0708-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="229 Pa.

But this laudable interest in judicial economy must be weighed against the need to minimize the prejudice that can be caused a defendant required to defend <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>against separate crimes in a single trial. The relevant rules and cases provide standards for the striking of the necessary balance between these sometimes competing judicial interests, but each case must be independently decided on the basis of the inter-relationship of the charges sought to be consolidated or severed and the nature of the evidence available to prove them.</p>

The charge of driving while under suspension, however, is just as clearly not an offense of the “same or similar character” as burglary, nor do I think that it was based upon the same act or transaction as the burglaries or connected with them as part of a common scheme or plan. Even if the driving charge was technically misconsolidated with the burglary charges, however, such consolidation was in no way prejudicial, and therefore <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>harmless. Appellant stipulated at trial that his license was suspended when he was arrested on December 28th, in effect pleading guilty to the charge. Certainly in view of this incontrovertible proof, the burglary evidence could not be said to prejudice him with regard to the driving charge, nor would the driving charge be of the nature likely to prejudice the jury against him with regard to the burglary charges.

But although the law is zealous to protect the defendant, .who must be presumed innocent of the crime with which he is charged, from prejudgment, it is also concerned that the prosecution not be precluded from introducing legitimate evidence that is relevant to the judgment to be made with regard to the offense actually being tried. Therefore, it is equally well-established that where evidence of other crimes has an independent relevance to the crime being tried — where it tends to prove such elements as motive, intent, absence of mistake or accident, a common scheme, plan or design embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to prove the others, or the identity of the person charged with the crime being tried —it is admissible for such limited purpose. <em>Commonwealth v.

Since there is no record of any motion to sever the separate counts of the Birsic indictment, any objection to this joinder has been waived. It is clear, nevertheless, that the two Birsic burglaries satisfy the “other crimes” test. The trial court properly charged that the mere fact that property from the first Birsic burglary was found in the possession of appellant two months later would not in itself be sufficient to create an inference that he was the thief, since the stealing was not sufficiently recent. But appellant’s possession, together with the evidence that placed him at the scene of an apparent second burglary or attempted burglary at the trailer, would be sufficient to create such an inference and point toward his identity as the original thief. Similarly, evidence that appellant possessed property stolen during the first burglary would tend to show criminal intent with regard to his presence on December 28th. Cf. <em>Bradley v.

The <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>record shows not only that the evidence relating to each offense was relatively simple and direct, but that as far as possible each was presented separately to the jury as if it were a separate case; the judge gave clear instructions as to the elements of each offense.

In his dissent in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>supra, Mr. Justice Roberts, joined by Mr. Justice Nix and Mr. Justice Manderino, has argued, however, that judicial discretion should be limited to “situations where the offenses involved were similar enough to meet the ‘other crimes’ test, or where such offenses arose out of the same transaction, occurrence, or episode.” On the other hand, where the defendant “is charged with , . . separate and distinct offenses, so dissimilar that it would be prejudicial error to admit evidence of one offense at a separate trial of the other,” he would follow the American Bar Association Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance and allow the defendant “on timely motion, an absolute right to severance of the offenses.” <a href="/pa/453/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="453 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="577587" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0187-01">453 Pa. at 204</a>, 307 A.2d at 273.

It might be argued that, since the burglary of homes covered by the Birsic and Gadd indictments and the burglary of trucks covered by the Melhorn and Speir indictments reveal different <em>modi operandi, </em>the evidence points to the existence of not one but two common schemes carried out between November 1st and December 28th. But, given the fact of common possession of goods stolen in all of the earlier burglaries and presence at the scene of the apparent attempted burglary on December 28th, it seems less artificial and more logical to regard the whole as evidence of a single scheme to steal from homes and trusts.</p>

This included not only the evidence of his presence at the alleged second burglary of the Birsic trailer, but the evidence of the distinctive v-shaped tread marks in the snow at both the Gadd residence and the Birsic trailer which matched the shoes appellant was wearing when he was arrested on the evening of December 28th and pointed both to his identity as the burglar on December 18th and to his criminal intent on December 28th. Cf. <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>State, </em><a href="/ind/135/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="135 Ind. 38" data-case-ids="1408064" data-case-paths="/ind/135/0038-01">135 Ind. 38</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20N.E.%20817" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="34 N.E. 817">34 N.E. 817</a> (1893). The evidence relating to the car is more tenuous, and some of it is capable of more than one interpretation. A husband and wife who were neighbors of Gadd testified that they saw a late model — 1970-1972 — red Chrysler or Plymouth station wagon with a wooden stripe in the vicinity of the Gadd residence on the afternoon of the burglary, and the husband further testified that he saw it enter the Gadd driveway. The car that appellant was driving on the evening of December 28th was a station wagon with wood panelling, but it was a blue 1968 Mercury; appellant’s employer had acquired it in November and allowed appellant to use it overnight as well as in connection with his work in home improvement. The wife also identified the driver as a man of about appellant’s age and wearing an orange cap, although she did not specifically identify appellant; appellant was wearing an orange cap when he was arrested. This evidence is plainly of the sort found to be in itself insufficient to meet the “other crimes’’ test in <em>Commonwealth v. Peterson, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/453/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="453 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="577587" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0187-01">453 Pa. at 198-99, n. 1</a>, 307 A.2d at 270, n. 1.
