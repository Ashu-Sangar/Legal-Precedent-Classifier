      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>and was therefore condemned. The property was also posted as condemned on June 4, 1970. The notice informed the owners that they had thirty days in which to remedy the condition or to appeal the condemnation order to the courts. If the owners failed to take action, then the City would proceed to demolish the building. See Act of May 13, 1915, P.L. 297, as amended, 53 P.S. § 25094. The Ca-plans did nothing.</p>

(hereinafter Keystone) became the equitable owner of the property. Keystone was at the time of the agreement of purchase fully aware that the property was condemned and subject to demolition by the City. Keystone did nothing towards correcting the dangerous condition and on March 12, 1971, it received a letter from the City indicating the City was preparing to demolish the building.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On March 25, 1971, Keystone applied for <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>and was issued a permit to seal the building. The legal effect of the sealing, which was subsequently carried out, was to stay the City’s right to demolish the building for six months during which time Keystone would be allowed to make the necessary repairs to remedy the dangerous condition. The sealing was approved by the City on August 24, 1971. During the six months that followed, Keystone did nothing further to repair the building.</p>

Keystone received the notice indirectly because it was not the legal title holder,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> but it is unclear from the record and the trial court’s findings whether it received it prior to or subsequent to demolition. But our analysis, <em>infra, </em>will show that whether the notice was actually received before or after demolition is not here relevant.

Additionally, Keystone has never made a claim that it did not receive nor understand any of the notices. Further, Keystone allowed a tenant to rent the building on a short-term lease for “dead” storage, while it was sealed. Moreover, a witness for Keystone testified that it intended to make repairs when it obtained a tenant. Presumably this meant when Keystone obtained a long-term tenant since <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>no repairs were made while the short-term tenant occupied the building.</p>
    <p id="b753-4" data-blocks='[["BL_753.4",753,[193,414,1148,1402]]]'>On November 15, 1972, Keystone filed a complaint in equity seeking to compel the City to restore the building or to pay Keystone the value of the building. After an evidentiary hearing, the chancellor entered an adjudication and decree nisi dismissing the complaint and denying Keystone any relief. He ruled that the City had fully complied with the Act of 1915, supra, when it served the condemnation notice of June 4, 1970, on the then owners of the building. He ruled the notice of October 16, 1972, was mere surplusage and conferred no additional rights on Keystone. He reasoned the sealing permit granted to Keystone in March, 1971 effectuated a temporary stay which lapsed after the expiration of six months and since Keystone failed to make the necessary repairs during the six-month period, the City had the right to raze the building in accordance with the June 4, 1970 condemnation notice. Keystone filed exceptions to this adjudication and decree which were subsequently dismissed by a court en banc. Keystone then filed an appeal in the Commonwealth Court and that court reversed the decree entered in the trial court and remanded the record to the trial court for the purpose of providing appropriate relief to Keystone. <em>Keystone Commercial Properties, Inc. v.

This is an inappropriate application of the unclean hands doctrine. That doctrine is a basis for a court of equity to refuse affirmative relief to either a petitioner or respondent. It is not a basis for a court of equity to grant affirmative relief. <em>Fantony v. Fantony, </em>

    <p id="b754-5" data-blocks='[["BL_754.5",754,[272,809,1158,1022]]]'>First, Keystone argues the City should be es-topped from asserting that Keystone did not obtain an additional thirty days grace period before demolition could be carried out because of the October 16, 1972 notice. Essential to such a theory is a showing of reliance. <em>Stratford Arms, Inc. v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/429/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="429 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="1913536" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0132-01">429 Pa. 132</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20325" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="239 A.2d 325">239 A.2d 325</a> (1968). And see 28 Am.Jur. 2d Estoppel and Waiver § 27. Assuming Keystone received the notice subsequent to actual demolition, it had nothing on which to rely. Assuming Keystone received notice prior to demolition, a review of the record indicates that no such reliance was established by Keystone. After receiving the October 16, 1972 notice, Keystone did nothing. Arguably doing nothing could under other circumstances be viewed as establishing reliance. But, under the circumstances of this case, where Keystone did nothing to remedy the dangerous condition for almost two years, it is obvious to us that no actual reliance existed. Thus, Keystone’s first theory is without merit.</p>
    <p id="b754-6" data-blocks='[["BL_754.6",754,[260,1862,1156,478]],["BL_755.1",755,[178,313,1155,687]]]'>Second, Keystone argues that the October 16, 1972 notice granted it thirty additional days in which to remedy the condition, without regard to the efficacy of the June 4, 1970 notice in October and November of 1972. This theory assumes Keystone received the October 16, 1972 notice prior to actual demolition. But even assuming that fact as true, we do not see any reason for allowing such a notice, absent reliance, to confer on Keystone greater rights. The second notice was mere surplusage <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>under the circumstances. The reasoning of the Commonwealth Court in <em>Bridge Cafe, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, </em>16 Pa.Cmwlth. 58, <a href="/citations/?q=329%20A.2d%20332" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="329 A.2d 332">329 A.2d 332</a> (1974), is worthy of application here. In that case a licensee argued that although the Board could have issued a citation without sending any notice to the licensee, because it did notify the licensee, the Board was required to conduct an independent investigation not otherwise required. The court rejected the argument because no reason existed to support such a position. Further, the court stated that the notice did not prejudice the licensee. Likewise, the October 16, 1972 notice here did not prejudice Keystone because it never relied on it.</p>
    <p id="b755-4" data-blocks='[["BL_755.4",755,[172,1039,1147,691]]]'>Third, Keystone argues that the June 4, 1970 notice was no longer effective to provide it with notice of the impending demolition. For purposes of this theory, it is irrelevant whether Keystone received the notice prior to or subsequent to the demolition. Clearly, the statute and ordinance require notice to a property owner thirty days prior to demolition. Thus, unless the June 4, 1970 notice remained effective, Keystone should prevail. However, an analysis of the purposes of notice and the type of situation in which a notice of condemnation and demolition becomes ineffective clearly establishes that the June 4, 1970 notice remained effective under the circumstances of this case.</p>

During this period of time, no repairs were made. Rather, when the City sent a letter to Keystone concerning preparations to demolish, Keystone utilized a six-month grace period, granted when the City allowed it to seal the building, to stay demolition. During the grace period, rather than remedy the condition which is the reason why the six-month grace period is given, Keystone did nothing towards repairing the dangerous condition.</p>
    <p id="b756-7" data-blocks='[["BL_756.7",756,[247,1693,1161,425]]]'>Under these circumstances, Keystone was afforded ample opportunity to remedy the condition.

Keystone purchased the property more than thirty days following the June 4, 1970 notice. Thus, Keystone could not appeal the condemnation order under the terms of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b757-4" data-blocks='[["BL_757.4",757,[170,537,1152,1628]]]'>But Keystone knew and understood the building was condemned when it purchased the property. It also knew that the previous owners had not appealed the condemnation order. Another purpose of the thirty-day limitation is to give finality to a condemnation order. Thus, Keystone purchased a property knowing that unless repairs were made, the property had been finally adjudicated in proper proceedings a danger to public safety, and, therefore, immediately subject to demolition. From the time of purchase until demolition, no repairs of any type which could possibly serve as a factual basis to require a reversal of the prior adjudication were made. Keystone had no reason to expect notice prior to demolition because the facts serving as the basis for the adjudication had not changed. Further, Keystone supplied no facts or information concerning repairs to the City, nor did the City know of such facts, which would create any doubt in the minds of City officials as to their right to rely on the finalized order. Whether, in a case where repairs made during a delay between the expiration of the thirty-day period and actual demolition, this Court would require the property owner to so inform City officials or whether the City would be required to carry out an investigation to determine if repairs were made, need not be decided here. In this case, no repairs were made and Keystone and the City knew it. Where, in fact nothing is done to remedy the condition, the City is entitled to rely on and act in accordance with a condemnation order which has been finalized by a fair procedure which afforded ample protection to the property’s owners.</p>

Since Keystone does not argue that it did not receive any of the notices involved, for the sake of clarity we shall treat the notices as having been sent to Keystone.</p>

In affirming the district court, the Appeals Court for the District of Columbia expressed no view on whether the owner was entitled to a new hearing. That court limited its determination to the failure to give notice. But, the Appeals Court stated numerous times that the owner attempted to restore the building and indicated that the agency knew of the attempt. <em>Miles </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em><a href="/us-app-dc/166/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="166 U.S. App. D.C. 235" data-case-ids="3688164" data-case-paths="/us-app-dc/166/0235-01">166 U.S.App.D.C. 235</a>, <a href="/f2d/510/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="510 F.2d 188" data-case-ids="146940,3688164" data-case-paths="/f2d/510/0188-01,/us-app-dc/166/0235-01">510 F.2d 188</a> (1975).</p>

The issue of whether notice should be required where repairs are made but the appropriate agency does not know of them, either because it did not again inspect the building or because the owner failed to inform the agency, was not before the court. The agency in <em>Miles </em>did know of the repairs. In the instant case, even if we were to require the City to determine if repairs are made during a delay rather than require the owner to inform the City, the determination would be irrelevant since, in fact, no repairs were made.</p>
