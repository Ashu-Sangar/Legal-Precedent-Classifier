The original vote indicated that Mr. Yoney, appellee, received a plurality of 158 votes over his nearest rival, Mr. Jones, appellant. This appeal results from the refusal of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County to grant appellant’s request that all of the ballot boxes in the county be impounded, opened and recanvassed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

To understand this issue, it is first necessary to set forth chronologically the events that preceded the filing of the instant appeal. As has been stated, the election was held on May 20, 1975. On June 6, 1975, the County Board provisionally certi-. fied the returns for the Democratic nominee for the office of County Treasurer, indicating that Mr. Yoney had a plurality of 158 votes over Mr. Jones, his nearest opponent. On June 4, 1975, two days before this certification, petitions were filed on behalf of Mr. Jones requesting the opening of 16 ballot boxes and the recounting of the ballots therein. Recount Boards were appointed and their reports of the recount of the 16 ballot boxes were <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>filed on June 25, 1975.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Subsequently, on June 30, 1975, counsel on behalf of Mr. Jones, filed a petition to open all of the ballot boxes within the county which had not been previously opened and in the alternative requested that 28 boxes, specifically referred to in their petition, be opened. Yoney responded by filing preliminary objections. On July 10, 1975, the court en banc entered a per curiam Opinion and Order sustaining the preliminary objections as to the request to open all of the remaining boxes throughout the county, but because of certain “special circumstances” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> did consider the request pertaining <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>to the 28 boxes. On August 1, 1975, appellant filed a second petition requesting that all of the remaining ballot boxes be opened. This petition was denied by an Order entered on August 4, 1975. It is purportedly the Order of August 4, 1975, from which appellant has filed this appeal (September 3,1975).</p>
    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.6",298,[230,640,1153,421]]]'>The basis for the Motion to Quash is that a Final Order on the request to open all remaining boxes was entered by the court en banc on July 10, 1975, and therefore the instant appeal was, in fact, filed 55 days after that Order had been entered. Thus, the pivotal question in this dispute is when did the court enter a Final Order denying appellant’s request that the remaining ballot boxes within the county be reopened and recounted.</p>

I, § 101 et seq., as amended, 25 P.S. § 2601 et seq., reflects a clear intention of the Legislature to expeditiously dispose of objections and to provide for prompt certification of the vote. The integrity of the election process requires immediate resolution of disputes that prevent certification. This is particularly true in Primary Elections where the results must be fi<a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>nalized in sufficient time to enable the election machinery to be readied for the General Election.

No objection has been raised with reference to that request. In response to the petition filed on June 30, 1975, Mr. Yoney filed preliminary objections asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the request was untimely. The court en banc determined that the petition was filed pursuant to section 1407(a) of the Election Code, <em>supra, </em>25 P.S. § 3157(a), and determined that appellant had failed to comply with the time provisions provided for within that section.

It will be noted that because all 3 positions for the office of County Commissioner were on the ballot, our county commissioners could not sit as the return board and instead 3 judges of our court (Sweet, P. J., DiSalle and Gladden, JJ.) were designated to act as such board. It appears that during the computation and canvassing, Judge Sweet, presumably acting as a member of the return board, was called upon by the clerks and election officers to make certain rulings and decisions with respect to the count. He admittedly made these decisions on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis without consulting either of the other two judicial members of the return board and without reducing his decisions to writing or making any memorandum or notation thereof. It was apparently during this process that the sealed general returns were corrected by and at the direction of Judge Sweet without the opening of the applicable box.</blockquote>

It goes on to say ‘But in every other case the county board shall forthwith cause the ballot box of the district to be opened and the vote therein to be recounted in the presence of attorneys, watchers, and candidates interested.’ As noted, Section 1407(a) provides that any person aggrieved by any order or decision of any county board may appeal therefrom within 2 days after such order or decision shall have been made to the court of common pleas, whether such order or decision was reduced to writing or not. In answer to this apparent bar, Mr. Jones says <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>that he was not aware that the correction or alteration of the sealed return sheets were being made.

The Decree of July 10th was a final Order disposing of the petition then before the court. While the court provided for a further consideration of the request pertaining to the 28 boxes it was clearly a definitive and final Order as to the request to open the remaining boxes. Thus, the Decree terminated the litigation as to this issue and was therefore appealable. <em>Hudock et al. </em>v. <em>Donegal Mutual Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/438/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="438 Pa. 272" data-case-ids="1929273" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0272-01">438 Pa. 272</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=262%20A.2d%20668" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="262 A.2d 668">262 A.2d 668</a> (1970).</p>
