    <p id="b169-7" data-blocks='[["BL_169.7",169,[183,958,1146,857]]]'>On January 17, 1974, appellant, Gregory Tate, accepted an offer for a negotiated plea to murder in the second degree. The sentence agreed to was seven to twenty years imprisonment. Believing the case to be one of murder in the first degree, Judge Theodore B. Smith refused to accept the plea. The case was returned to the calendar judge who assigned the case to Judge Joseph L. McGlynn for trial the following day. At trial, appellant waived a jury trial and the prosecutor certified that the murder charge rose no higher than murder in the second degree. Defense counsel then agreed to stipulate to virtually all of the prosecution’s evidence. Appellant was found guilty of murder in the second degree and sentenced to a term of seven to twenty years imprisonment. Assisted by new counsel, appellant now brings this direct appeal.</p>
    <p id="b169-8" data-blocks='[["BL_169.8",169,[185,1855,1147,475]],["BL_170.1",170,[231,282,1154,425]]]'>Appellant contends that since the defense stipulated to the prosecution’s evidence his trial was, in reality, a guilty plea hearing. Such being the case, appellant argues that the judgment of sentence should be reversed and a new trial awarded because there was no on the record demonstration that his decision to plead guilty was voluntarily and knowingly made. <em>Commonwealth v. Davis, </em><a href="/pa/457/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="457 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="478521" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0194-01">457 Pa. 194</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20103" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="322 A.2d 103">322 A.2d 103</a> (1974), considered the issue presented here. In <em>Davis, </em>the defense stipulated to <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>evidence which placed the defendant at the scene of the crime and named him as a participant. We said that this was, in fact, a stipulation of guilt which should have been surrounded by safeguards similar to those attending the entry of a guilty plea. <em>See </em>Pa.Rules of Crim.Procedure 319(a). The record must establish that a defendant’s decision to stipulate to facts amounting to a guilty plea was knowing and understanding.</p>
