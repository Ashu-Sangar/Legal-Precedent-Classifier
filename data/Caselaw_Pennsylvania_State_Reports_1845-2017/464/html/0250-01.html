Grello, was found guilty following a jury trial on September 10, 1973, of aggravated assault and battery, and burglary. At trial petitioner testified that he was intoxicated at the time of the incident for which he was convicted. He requested a jury instruction that he be acquitted of the burglary charge if his intoxication rendered him unable to form the specific intent necessary for burglary. This request was refused. Petitioner’s counsel also excepted to the trial court’s refusal to allow a hearing into the possible prejudicial effect of certain photographic evidence which had been used for pretrial identification purposes. Petitioner filed a motion for new trial raising these two issues. The motion was denied and petitioner was sentenced to four to eight years imprisonment, sentence to run concurrently with a sentence of three to nine years imposed in a separate matter by the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas in 1973. The Superior Court affirmed without opinion on February 6,1975. On April 1,1975, petitioner sought re-argument before the Superior Court on the basis of our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Graves, </em><a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">461 Pa. 118</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">334 A. 2d 661</a> (1975). This request was denied by the Superior <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>Court on April 3, 1975, and petitioner now asks that we grant an allowance of appeal to consider the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

      <em>Graves, <a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">supra,</a> </em>is directly on point. The trial court, relying on <em>Commonwealth v.

Of course, as with all other evidence, the jury is free to disbelieve the testimony concerning intoxication. <em>Commonwealth v. Rose, </em><a href="/pa/463/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="463 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1708024" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0264-01">463 Pa. 264</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="463 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1708024" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0264-01">344 A.2d 824</a> (1975). The refusal to so charge, however, had the effect of allowing the jury to convict petitioner even if one of the elements of the crime was absent. Therefore, a new trial as to the charge of burglary is required.</p>

The conviction of that offense therefore need not be disturbed. The case must be remanded however for resentencing on that conviction without reference to the burglary conviction.</p>

Even if the use of intoxication as an excuse for criminal responsibility survives, it should not be given retroactive application. <em>See Linkletter v.
