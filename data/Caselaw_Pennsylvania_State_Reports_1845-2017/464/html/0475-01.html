Kistler, Inc., commenced this action in equity seeking to enforce a restrictive covenant in a written employment contract between itself and its employee, appellant William J. O’Brien. On May 14, 1974, the Court of Common Pleas issued a Decree Nisi enjoining appellant from engaging in selling or servicing fire equipment within a 50 mile radius. Appellant’s exceptions were dismissed by the court en banc and a Final Decree granting relief was entered. , This appeal followed.</p>

O’Brien (O’Brien) was contacted by representatives of Kistler with respect to O’Brien’s possible employment with their company. No decision was made at that time and the matter was left open for further discussion. Subsequently, some time in the late Winter or early Spring of 1970, Kistler again solicited O’Brien and after various negotiations relating to wages, duties, insurance benefits and other terms of employment but not including any mention of a restrictive covenant, it was agreed that O’Brien would leave his present employer and work for Kistler. O’Brien gave his then employer two weeks notice and began to work for Kistler on May 11,1970.</p>

    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[186,429,1145,966]]]'>Appellant asserts that the covenant is unenforceable because it lacks consideration. It is his position that the negotiations prior to May 11th constituted a complete and binding oral contract for which the consideration was the employment itself. Thus he argues that the employment as consideration was not available to support the subsequent written restrictive covenant. Moreover, he contends that the entering into an agreement containing a restrictive covenant was not a factor considered in arriving at the oral agreement of employment. It was not until O’Brien had commenced work and inquired about his Blue Cross benefit forms that he was requested by a clerk to sign the “Employment Contract” supposedly in accordance with the general practice of the firm. It is particularly significant that Kistler, who was then operating a sole proprietorship and personally participated in the final negotiations, never discussed this requirement.</p>

There are some jurisdictions that hold that where the employment is at will, a subsequent agreement containing a covenant not to compete will be upheld where the employment is continued in reliance upon the covenant not to compete.
