Frickert and Samuel R. Deiter’s two sons, appellants James A. Deiter and William A. Deiter, are also parties to the agreement and are referred to as the “key employees” of the corporation.

Paragraph 4 provides that, upon the death of one shareholder, his estate must sell and the corporation must buy his shares. It further provides that, upon the death of the surviving shareholder, his estate must sell his shares to the three “key employees” equally. The agreement contains no provision concerning an inter vivos transfer of shares by the surviving shareholder.</p>

No specific performance by the estate of Samuel R. Deiter is sought.</p>

The Court concludes that the shareholders’ restrictive agreement contains an inherent “ambiguity” because it fails to allude to the possibility of an inter vivos transfer of shares by the surviving shareholder. This omission does not result in ambiguity; it is merely indicative of the apparent fact that the parties did not anticipate such an eventuality. As the Court quite correctly points out, the “manifest intentions” of the parties are clear: they wished to create an equal right of purchase among the three “key employees.” If the parties’ intentions are <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>clear, I fail to see how the contract may be referred to as “ambiguous.”</p>
