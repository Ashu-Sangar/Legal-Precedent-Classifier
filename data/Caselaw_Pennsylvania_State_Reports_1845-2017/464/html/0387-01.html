    <p id="b555-4" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[175,638,1149,1399]]]'>Section 301(a) of the Act purports to abolish tort liability for pain and suffering. So far so good. If the Act stopped at this point, I would agree with the position of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Roberts. But the Act does not. It goes on to make an exception for cases involving death, serious and permanent injury, certain impairments, and where medical expenses exceed $750. Thus the Act continues to recognize pain and suffering as a substantive loss but limits the situations in which an injury is deemed serious enough to justify an award for it. I submit that this is proscribed by Art. Ill, Section 18. This constitutional provision speaks to the amount to be recovered for “injuries” and the phrase has been interpreted to mean legally cognizable injury. See <em>Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., </em><a href="/pa/263/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="263 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="1047476" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0158-01">263 Pa. 158</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.%20238" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="106 A. 238">106 A. 238</a> (1919). Accordingly, if the Legislature removes the legal recognition of a certain injury by abolishing the cause of action completely, there would be no violation of Art. Ill, Section 18. However, where the injury is still recognized such as in the Pennsylvania No-Fault Act, and the Legislature changes the amount of compensation recoverable therefor, such as in the No-Fault Act and in the workmen’s compensation cases, then Art. Ill, Section 18, does apply. The fact that the standard of liability is changed does not affect the fact that the injury is still legally cognizable.</p>

I agree with the rationale of <em>Sherwood, supra, </em>but do not find it controlling in the case at bar. In <em>Sherwood, </em>the legislature eliminated a cause of action, while in the instant case they have limited the amount recoverable in certain automobile tort actions. The No-Fault Bill does not allow a person with less than $750.00 in medical bills to sue for pain and suffering. Is this not a limitation of recovery prohibited under <em>Article III, Section 18, of the Pennsylvania Constitution ?</em>

I see no rational reason to conclude that a person who has $750.00 in medical bills has suffered so much more than a person with $749.00 in medical bills that the former may sue, while the latter may not. No-Fault will be a source of a tremendous potential for abuse, unnecessary and protracted medical services, inflated charges for medical care, and the discrimination between those able to secure proper medical care and those not as fortunate.</p>

It is also beyond question that a legislature can create new causes of action. While recognizing these powers, the dissenters implicitly suggest that where they are exercised simultaneously and the new remedy provides less coverage than the former, Article III, Section 18 of the Constitution is necessarily violated. With this assumption, I cannot agree.</p>

It is equally apparent that the legislature also determined the need for a right of recovery for selected classes of individuals. The mere fact that these two objectives were achieved in the same piece of legislation does not justify the conclusion suggested by the dissenters, that this is merely a limitation of a right to recovery which is prohibited under Article III, Section 18.</p>

Whenever a cause of action is replaced by a newly created statutory remedy which is not co-extensive or more comprehensive, it could be argued, under their reasoning, that such action would constitute a limitation on the recovery of the former common law cause of action. Such a view would completely stifle progress and severely curtail the right of a legislature to <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>meet changing conditions and current needs.

Yet, it is contended that this proposition does not prevent the abolition of a cause of action. The difference may make sense in a parlor word game but not in constitutional law. These opinions in effect claim that a citizen who suffers damages in the amount of $100,000 cannot have the damages limited by legislation to $50,000 (a maximum dollar amount), but can have the damages limited to zero dollars because “nothing” does not constitute a maximum dollar limitation but something else.
