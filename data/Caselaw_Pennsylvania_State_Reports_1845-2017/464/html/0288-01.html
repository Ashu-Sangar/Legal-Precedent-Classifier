Shoyer entered May 24, 1973.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> After the entry of the Order of Judge Shoyer, appellants Staud, Ra-below, Lundy, and Manchel appealed to this Court. By Memorandum Opinion filed November 26, 1973, the cause was remanded for further proceedings before a <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>Special Disciplinary Court that had been convened by the then President Judge Donald D. Jamieson to dispose of certain categories of alleged unethical behavior. After the entry of the Order of the Special Disciplinary Court, the matter is again before this Court.</p>
    <p id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[224,602,1146,735]]]'>Voluminous pleadings have been filed in the matter before us and oral argument has been heard. The most recent petition is the request of Mr. Stewart, Special Counsel, that the appeals be remanded to the appropriate courts below. Mr. Stewart asserts that if this Court is disposed to remand the matter to the lower court, he will request those courts to vacate the Disciplinary Orders from which these appeals have been taken. In response, counsel for the lawyer-appellants argues the need for a definitive resolution of the issues raised. These appek lants also charged that they have improperly been caused to sustain substantial loss as a result of these proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.5",433,[220,1370,1146,624]]]'>In our judgment, if the Special Counsel is permitted to carry out his stated intention and if the courts below accede to his request, the matter will be resolved and no purpose would be served by further exploration of the cause. Moreover, if lawyer-appellants are correct in their assertion that they were wrongly caused to sustain damages, their remedy is to be sought in another proceeding. This was not an action in tort to recover damages but rather simply a question as to the validity of the Orders of Suspension. The withdrawal of the Orders of Suspension would necessarily moot all issues involved.</p>

The prior pleading requested that this Court terminate the appeals based on a theory of mootness. In that pleading, Special Counsel averred that he would withdraw his cross-appeal docketed at No. 608 January Term, 1974 if the Court acted favorably upon the Motion to Terminate. While the subsequent Petition to Remand failed to specifically suggest a disposition of the cross-appeal at No. 608, it is implicitly apparent that Special Counsel intended for this appeal to be withdrawn in the event of favorable action by this Court. We have allowed withdrawal to be without prejudice in the event that the courts below reject the requests to rescind the earlier Orders.</p>
