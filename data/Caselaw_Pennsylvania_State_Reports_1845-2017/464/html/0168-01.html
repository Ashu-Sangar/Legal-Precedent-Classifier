      <em>trowski </em>refused to allow amendment of a motion to strike a nominating petition to cure a failure to specify the signatures attacked after expiration of the time allowed for filing objections to such petitions. In <em>Williams, </em>a petition to set aside a nominating petition was filed on September 12, the last day on which such petitions were permitted. However, it was not presented to any judge for action, as required by statute, until September 24, immediately after an amended petition was filed. Because the statute required that hearings on such petitions be conducted not later than September 16 and final determinations be made not later than September 21, the court of appeals held that the district court was powerless to act when the petition was presented to the court on September 24. It also held that the petition was barred by failure of the plaintiff to prosecute it with due diligence. Finally, the court noted that the petition, as originally filed, was defective because it failed to set forth specifically the plaintiff’s objections. It then held, relying on <em>Pietrowski, </em>that the amendment of the petition could not cure the defect because the amendment was filed too late.</p>

It hardly needs to be added that if the court had set aside the petition the Republican primary election, which in that event would have been required by 18 V.I.C. § 359 to be held on October 4th, could not actually have been held.

This provides the exclusive measure of whether the aggregate tax burden of the subdivision is “excessive or unreasonable” within the meaning of section 6. Similarly, section 8 of the Act limits the rates which may be imposed as to certain types of taxes. As to those types of tax, that section provides the exclusive measure of what constitutes an “excessive or unreasonable” tax within the meaning of section 6.</p>

Even in such cases, we believe that section 8 provides a valuable starting point. A tax may be outside of the class governed by section 8 but sufficiently similar to a member of that class to support the conclusion that a rate entirely disproportionate to the rates specified by section 8 for the similar tax would be “excessive and unreasonable.” Before reaching such a conclusion, a court would need to consider carefully any differences (e. g., in economic impact of the tax, ability of the class of taxpayers to pay, relation of other taxes imposed on the class of taxpayers to the cost of services rendered to them, etc.) suggested by the taxing authority, giving great weight to the judgment of the municipal officials as to the significance of those differences.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_41" id="ref_footnote_1_41">41</a> Nevertheless, should the court so conclude, section 6 would prohibit the imposition of that tax at that rate.</p>

If, for example, the General Assembly, now or in the past, has levied a tax similar to that in question, this would provide some indication of a rate which is <em>not </em>considered “excessive or unreasonable.” The examples given in this opinion are not exclusive, for there may be other sources which will cast light upon what constitutes an “excessive or unreasonable” rate of tax.

As to the general expenses, a maximum limit on the permissible amount was imposed, and a limitation on permissible indebtedness accomplished the same effect with regard to debt service costs.

        <em>State Bd. of Undertakers </em>v. <em>Joseph Sekula Funeral Homes, Inc., </em>supra, is instructive on a related point. In that case the board had revoked the license of a corporation to engage in undertaking. On appeal, the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County reversed, holding that the statutory provision relied upon by the board had been repealed. The Funeral Directors Association of Philadelphia then intervened and obtained a rehearing in the court of common pleas, which, however, adhered to its initial decision. This Court held that the association and its members had no standing to appeal from the order of the court of common pleas. So far as can be told from the opinion the corporation in question did not operate in Philadelphia, so that the members of the association would suffer no competitive injury from its continuance in business. However, the determination that a rule <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>which formerly restricted the class of potential competitors had been repealed probably would result in increased competition. Nevertheless, it was unnecessary for the Court to consider whether this probability of increased competition gave the association standing. This was so because the crucial question is whether the person claiming to be “aggrieved” is harmed by the <em>action </em>which he challenges. The legal grounds on which that action is based are generally irrelevant to this question.</p>

The Commission granted a reduction, but not as large a reduction as sought by appellant. On appeal from the Commission’s order, this Court, by a sharply divided vote, held that appellant’s only “legal right” under the Milk Control Act was to a “reasonable return.” Because appellant did not contend that the price set would prevent' it from earning a “reasonable return,” the Court held that appellant had no standing to appeal from the order.

The plaintiff in this case was a school offering training to aspiring beauticians, who were thereby enabled to satisfy the educational requirements for a state license. In 1959 the General Assembly added to the qualifications for licensing previously in force a requirement that the applicant have completed a tenth grade education or its equivalent. Plaintiff contended that this increased standard for licensing beauticians deprived it of property without due process of law because it removed persons without a tenth grade education from the potential clientele of the school, thereby making the business less valuable. This Court held that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the legislation. Among the reasons offered for this conclusion was that appellant had no property interest in the statutory requirement that beauticians complete education of the sort offered by the plaintiff. Consequently, the addition of a further educational requirement did not impair any property interest of appellant even if it did result in a reduction in the number of students who would enroll in the school to satisfy the licensing requirements. Thus, in the absence of any “property right” of appellant, there was no taking of property without due process of law.</p>

The principle involved in this case is that a trustee may not assert against his cestuis his interest in continuation of a trust in order to continue his employment as trustee.

And for at least four decades this Court has consistently ruled that a person “aggrieved” by an order or other action of an administrative agency is one who has a direct, substantial, immediate and pecuniary interest in the action taken by the administrative body.

Whether any <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>other type of interest would be so envisioned, especially in a tax enactment, is a question the Court need not now reach.</p>

First, the specific statute involved would be viewed as granting standing to taxpayers whose nonpecuniary interests are affected by an ordinance. The breadth and nature of such interests are not before the Court for consideration. Second, by <em>dictum </em>the entire body of administrative law would be altered. I think a more acceptable way of altering the body of law would be on a case by case basis wherein the interest asserted by a plaintiff could be considered in light of the interests which the administrative body is required to consider in making its determinations.

Sutherland, </em><a href="/pa/459/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="311" data-cite="459 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="481003" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0177-01">459 Pa. 177</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="312" data-cite="459 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="481003" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0177-01">327 A.2d 623</a> (1974). That case involved the interest of a senator in confirming or rejecting gubernatorial appointments. Mr. Justice Roberts states that the case eliminates the pecuniary requirement by implication. The opinion did not discuss standing. The case did not involve an administrative body, nor a delegation of power to an elected body. The policy considerations in allowing standing in such a case without a showing of pecuniary interest are vastly different than a case involving an appeal from an order of an elected administrative body enacting a tax ordinance.</p>
