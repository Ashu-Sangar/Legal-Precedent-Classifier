Registration of the stock in his name and in his recent possession gaye rise to a presumption sufficient to establish <em>prima facie </em>ownership in the estate.

We indicated in <em>Donsavage Estate, swpra, </em>that where endorsement of the certificate in blank is coupled with possession, the transfer is <em>prima facie </em>valid for the purpose of rendering the donee’s interest not adverse to that of decedent. Such a showing is not necessarily sufficient to conclusively establish a gift by requisite proof but will permit the testimony to be heard. <em>Cf. Thomas v.

When Mr. Miller was hospitalized several months before his death, Mr. Reeser assisted him in taking care of his affairs and visited him daily. Seven weeks before Mr. Miller died, he gave up possession of the stock certificate to Mr. Reeser, who had possession at Mr. Miller’s death. Shortly before death, Mr. Miller endorsed the certificate naming no transferee and authorizing the sale of the stock.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
      <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>Mr. Stauffer, the treasurer of the Bank of Pennsylvania, testified that Mr. Reeser brought the certificate to the bank two days before decedent’s death and instructed Mr. Stauffer to use the proceeds from the sale to purchase a certificate of deposit for fifty thousand dollars in the joint names of decedent and Mr. Reeser and to place the remaining several thousand dollars in decedent’s own checking account. Appellee argues that the resulting inference that explanatory words accompanied the transfer to Mr. Reeser defeats the presumption of a <em>prima facie </em>gift because in earlier cases this Court explained that where the parties are not strangers but are more intimate, <em>in the absence of proof of explanatory words accompanying the voluntary delivery </em>an intention to give may be presumed. <em>Chappie’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/332/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="332 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1186577" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0168-01">332 Pa. 168</a>, 170, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20719" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 A.2d 719">2 A.2d 719</a> <em>(1938); Weaver v.

Here, any such explanatory words would be consistent with a presumption of an intention to give. Mr. Reeser’s testimony was competent in full and ought not to have been excluded from the factfinder’s consideration. It still remains to be determined whether, accepting the testimony, there was sufficient evidence which might have supported a finding of a valid gift.</p>

It received no instructions from Mr. Miller directly. No certificate was purchased or even authorized by Mr. Miller to be purchased in joint names prior to death. The Bank was not authorized to do anything with the proceeds and properly held them in escrow. Decedent’s sudden death precluded completion of a gift, if such was intended. The court below therefore was correct in sustaining objections to the account and directing the appellant to file a supplemental inventory including the proceeds as an asset of the estate.</p>
