The appellant contends, however, that the divorce was fraudulently obtained in that Robert concealed from the Ohio court Betty’s known mental incompetence, that this would serve to vitiate the decree in Ohio, and that therefore the decree is not entitled to full faith and credit. Robert responds that the issue of the validity of the divorce decree has been settled adversely to Betty by the same court that entered the divorce decree, and that its <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>reaffirmance of the decree is itself entitled to full faith and credit.

A hearing upon this petition was fixed for February 16, 1973. On February 9, however, the lawyer for appellant mailed to the clerk of the Knox County court a praecipe to discontinue the action to set aside the divorce decree for the reason that Robert was then residing in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. The record shows that this praecipe was received by the clerk of court and marked “filed” on February 15, 1973. The scheduled hearing was held nevertheless on the next day, and, when the petitioner failed to appeal, the Knox County court granted Robert’s motion for dismissal of the petition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The text of the decree is reproduced in the margin.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

In an effort to show that the order of dismissal is not entitled to recognition, appellant argues that her voluntary discontinuance of the action to set aside the divorce decree terminated that action on the date the praecipe to discontinue was filed (February 15, 1973); that the Ohio court either intentionally ignored the praecipe or was not made aware of it, but that in either event the parties to the proceeding were no longer properly before the Ohio court on February 16, 1973; and that the order of dismissal for want of prosecution entered that day was a nullity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

It is true that the full faith and credit clause does not require that we give recognition to a judgment rendered without jurisdiction or without notice and a fair opportunity to be heard; indeed, due process of law mandates that we not do so. See <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em><a href="/us/357/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="357 U.S. 235" data-case-ids="6162253" data-case-paths="/us/357/0235-01">357 U.S. 235</a>, <a href="/us/357/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="357 U.S. 235" data-case-ids="6162253" data-case-paths="/us/357/0235-01">78 S.Ct. 1228</a>, <a href="/us/357/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="357 U.S. 235" data-case-ids="6162253" data-case-paths="/us/357/0235-01">2 L.Ed.2d 1283</a> (1958); Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 104 and the comment thereto (1971). When, however, the court of another state has purported to act on the merits of a case, its jurisdiction to do so and the regularity of its proceedings are presumptively valid. See <em>Williams v. North Carolina, </em><a href="/us/325/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="325 U.S. 226" data-case-ids="6156053" data-case-paths="/us/325/0226-01">325 U.S. 226</a>, <a href="/us/325/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="325 U.S. 226" data-case-ids="6156053" data-case-paths="/us/325/0226-01">65 S.Ct. 1092</a>, <a href="/us/325/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="325 U.S. 226" data-case-ids="6156053" data-case-paths="/us/325/0226-01">89 L.Ed. 1577</a> (1944). In the case at bar appellant has failed to carry her burden of showing that the proceedings in connection with her petition to set aside the divorce were irregular in any manner. It is clear that appellant had notice of the February 16 hearing on the petition, and the opportunity to be present. As the court below observed, there is “no indication that plaintiff’s praecipe [to discontinue] was not considered <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>by the Ohio court in issuing its order of February 16, 1973,” nor has the appellant cited “authority or evidence indicating that the Court of Common Pleas of Knox County acted contrary to the Ohio law.” No appeal was taken from that court’s February 16 order, entitled “judgment decree”, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>and it stands as a final judgment or decree of an Ohio court of record. As such, it must be accorded full faith and credit. It follows that under ordinary principles of <em>res </em>judicata<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> appellant may not again litigate in our courts the question of fraudulent procurement of the divorce decree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

Rule 41(A)(1) of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure provides that, subject to certain exceptions not here relevant, “an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (a) by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before the commencement of trial unless a counterclaim which cannot remain pending for independent adjudication by the court has been served by the defendant, or (b) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action. Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of a dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court, an action based on or including the same claim.”</p>

It is, of course, a well-settled principle of res <em>judicata </em>that a final personal judgment on the merits in favor of a defendant bars a subsequent action on the same claim by the plaintiff against the defendant. Restatement (Second) of Judgments § § 45, 48, and 48.1 (Tentative Draft No. 1, 1973); Restatement of Judgments §§ 48-54 (1942). Moreover, the resolution of an issue in a valid, final judgment is conclusive in a subsequent action upon another claim between the same parties. The latter rule has been known traditionally as the rule of “collateral estoppel”. See, generally, Restatement of Judgments §§ 68-72 (1943). The proposed Restatement (Second) of Judgments, however, speaks in terms of “issue preclusion”. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments §§ 68, 68.1 (Tentative Draft No. 1,1973).</p>

Appellant has not cited and our research has not disclosed any Ohio cases in which the res <em>judicata </em>effect of Rule 41(b) dismissal has been determined, and the case law interpreting Federal Rule 41(b), upon which the Ohio rule was based, is not entirely clear.

Even had the divorce decree not been challenged and upheld by the courts of Ohio, a collateral attack upon it by a plaintiff in the courts of this Commonwealth would not normally be entertained. Although the full faith and credit clause does not require a sister State to give a greater, more conclusive or more final effect to a foreign judgment or decree than would be given it by the courts of the rendering State, see the Act of June 25, 1948, <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>note 4 <em>supra, </em><a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201738" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="28 U.S.C. § 1738">28 U.S.C. § 1738</a>; and Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 115 and Comment <em>b </em>thereto (1971), principles of interstate comity would indicate abstention by Pennsylvania courts in favor of the courts of the rendering State, in light of their special competence to pass upon the validity of the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of that State. Thus a party seeking relief in our courts on the basis of asserted invalidity (other than jurisdictional) of the judicial proceedings of another State should normally be relegated to the courts of that State for the establishment of the invalidity.</p>
