His post-trial motions were denied and consecutive sentences of six to twenty years imprisonment for murder and. three and one-half to seven years imprisonment for assault were imposed.

In brief, that evidence was that the appellant, without any apparent provocation, stabbed two men who had been drinking together in the Phone Booth Bar in the City of Philadelphia. One of the men died, but the other survived and at trial positively identified appellant as his assailant and as the killer of his friend.</p>

    <p id="b409-5" data-blocks='[["BL_409.5",409,[216,949,1148,1346]]]'>The first issue presented is whether a particular answer given by an investigating detective to a question asked was so prejudicial that it deprived appellant of a fair trial. The testimony complained of occurred at the end of the following colloquy: “Q. [by the assistant district attorney] And when had your attempts to arrest Mr. McFadden commenced? A. [by Detective White] Started with the night of the incident when our interview led us to believe that he was a suspect in a homicide, we attempted to locate him at several addresses we had for him. Q. How many different addresses did you check in attempting to find him? A. I believe about three, sir. Q. And what basis were you using to locate Mr. McFadden, A. <em>Addresses from our records.” </em>(emphasis added). Defense counsel objected at this point and the last answer was stricken from the record. The court, however, refused to grant a mistrial. Appellant earnestly argues that the reference to “records” could only have been interpreted by the jury to mean that he had a previous criminal record; and that such testimony was prejudicial because it could be taken by the jury to be substantive evidence of appellant’s guilt of the crimes for which he was then being tried. We are not persuaded of the validity of this argument when the stricken answer is viewed in its proper factual and legal context.</p>

The argument was made, as here, that the reference to such photographs permitted the jury to infer that the defendant had a prior criminal record. Although in that case we held the references to have been improper and prejudicial, thus warranting a new trial, we noted the following caveats:</p>

We hold that after the reference to a photograph the controlling question is whether or not a juror could reasonably infer from the facts presented that the accused had engaged in prior criminal activity. A mere passing reference to photographs from which a reasonable inference of prior criminal activity cannot properly be drawn does not invalidate the proceedings since there has been no prejudice as a result of the reference; so too, where it appears on the face of the record that there is an explanation of the police possession of the photograph unrelated to any inference of prior criminal activity.” <em>Id. </em>at 181,<a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20373" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="292 A.2d 373">292 A.2d at 375</a>.</blockquote>

Since the terms “files” and “records” are almost synonymous, it would appear that <em>Groce </em>is directly in point. There is, however, a factor present in this case which was not present in <em>Groce. </em>In Allen, as quoted above, we stated that reversal would not be warranted “where it appears on the face of the record that there is an explanation of the police possession of the photograph unrelated to any inference of prior criminal activity.” Such other “explanation” is present in the record in the instant case as to the meaning of the term “records”. During cross-examination of Detective White, defense counsel pursued a line of questioning concerning when the police search for McFadden began. In response to one such question, the detective answered as follows: “What I am saying is, we were looking for Mr. McFadden from the time we discovered he was a suspect. <em>During the course of our investigation we received fresh inputs as to new locations and new addresses. </em>We checked each of these out as the investigation progressed. That is what I am saying, sir.” (emphasis added). This explanation concerning addresses was repeated on redirect examination of Detective White, as follows: “Q. Mr. White, do I understand in the course of your investigation according to your responses to Mr. Reif’s questions, you received fresh input regarding various locations where Mr. McFadden might be found? A. Yes, sir. Q. And as a result of this fresh input you checked these addresses; is that correct, sir? A. That’s correct. Yes, sir.” In its opinion explaining its denial of appellant’s post-trial motions, the court below stated that “any notion that the information was gleaned from files of defendant’s prior criminal conduct was completely dispelled by the detective’s explanation that they were the result of ‘fresh inputs’ developed during the course of this investigation.” <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>From our reading of the record we are satisfied that this conclusion was fully warranted.

Craft, </em><a href="/pa/455/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="455 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="582157" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0616-01">455 Pa. 616</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20213" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="317 A.2d 213">317 A.2d 213</a> (1974); cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b412-4" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[235,533,1166,1288]]]'>The other argument advanced by appellant is also without merit. He contends that he was denied a fair trial because he was “coerced” into not taking the stand in his own defense because of a fear that he would be subject to impeachment through the introduction into evidence of his prior convictions. This apprehension may or may not have been justified. The record is of course silent on the matter since the defendant did not take the stand. His argument of duress is thus entirely speculative. Looking to the merits of the argument, however, it was but recently rejected by this Court in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Bighum, </em><a href="/pa/452/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="452 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="575369" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0554-01">452 Pa. 554</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=307%20A.2d%20255" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="307 A.2d 255">307 A.2d 255</a> (1973).
