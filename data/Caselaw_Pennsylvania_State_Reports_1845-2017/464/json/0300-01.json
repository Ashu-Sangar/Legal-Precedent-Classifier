        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nIn November 1944, Dr. Stephen Tracy (settlor) established a revocable inter vivos trust. It provided that income be paid to settlor and his wife for the remainder of their lives; after their death, the income was to be paid, in equal shares, to settlor\u2019s children, Margaret Tracy Ritteman and Stephen Tracy, Jr. Upon the death of either child, \u201cthe share of such child shall be paid over to his or her issue per stirpes.\u201d The question presented in this case is whether the natural daughter of Stephen Tracy, Jr. (Stephen Jr.), who was adopted by one unrelated to settlor in 1951, is entitled to share in the distribution to the \u201cissue\u201d of Stephen Jr. The orphans\u2019 court concluded that she is entitled to share in that distribution and this appeal ensued. We affirm.\nMost of the facts in this case were stipulated. A daughter Stephanie (the appellee) was born to Stephen Jr., and his then wife, Cora Hepburn Tracy, on December 25, 1938. Stephen Jr. and Cora were divorced on August 21, 1942, and Cora took custody of Stephanie. On January 9, 1943, Stephen Jr. married his second wife, Thelma Budd Tracy. On November 28, 1944, settlor executed the deed of trust now before us. Stephen Tracy IV (appellant) was born to Stephen Jr. and Thelma on December 28, 1945. Stephanie\u2019s mother Cora married her second husband, Harlow Culbertson on May 30,1946.\nOn April 14, 1949, settlor was declared incompetent and a guardian was appointed for his estate. From at least this time until his death on February 22, 1956, he lacked the capacity validly to amend or revoke the deed of trust. On June 21, 1951, Stephanie was adopted by her stepfather, Harlow Culbertson, with the consent of Stephen Jr. All life estates in the half of the trust allotted to the issue of Stephen Jr. terminated with his death on March 14, 1972.\nThe corporate fiduciary filed an account and requested instructions whether, by reason of Stephanie\u2019s adoption, she was precluded from taking under the trust as \u201cissue\u201d of Stephen Jr. Stephanie (now, by marriage, Stephanie Kerns) appeared before the orphans\u2019 court to assert her right to participate in the distribution and Stephen IV, the only other child of Stephen Jr., appeared to oppose her participation.\nThe orphans\u2019 court received, subject to an objection concerning its relevance, testimony from Stephanie and her mother regarding Stephanie\u2019s relationship with the settlor, her grandfather. The orphans\u2019 court concluded that this evidence was inadmissible because irrelevant and therefore disregarded it. Nevertheless, we believe that we may consider certain facts as admitted. At various times, even after her parents were divorced in 1942 and prior to the execution of the deed of trust in 1945, Stephanie received Christmas and birthday gifts from settlor. From 1942 to 1945 settlor paid the tuition for Stephanie\u2019s attendance at nursery and elementary school. During the period between the divorce of Stephanie\u2019s parents and the execution of the deed of trust, settlor entertained Stephanie as a visitor in his home from 10 to 12 times per year. While at their summer home in the summers of 1944, 1945, and 1946, settlor and his wife frequently picked up Stephanie at her family\u2019s nearby cottage for visits with them.\nThe orphans\u2019 court concluded, without reference to this evidence of an affectionate relationship between Stephanie and her grandfather, that the provision for the \u201cissue\u201d of Stephen Jr. clearly and unambiguously included Stephanie, notwithstanding her adoption by Harlow Culbertson in 1951. From the decree directing that she be permitted to share in the distribution of the portion of the corpus allocated to such \u201cissue\u201d Stephen IV appeals, urging that only he is entitled to take under that provision of the deed of trust.\nThe principles applicable to the construction of trust instruments are essentially the same as those used in the construction of wills. The intent of the settlor, if not contrary to law, must prevail. Canons of construction may be applied if the intent of the settlor is otherwise unclear. However, as we said in Chambers\u2019 Estate, 438 Pa. 22, 24, 263 A.2d 746, 747 (1970):\n\u201c [A] rtificial rules of testamentary construction have been legislatively and judicially created merely to aid in what is always the primary goal \u2014 to ascertain and to give effect to the testamentary purposes of the testator. Therefore, where the testator\u2019s actual intent can be ascertained, such intent must prevail over any artificially-deduced \u2018intent\u2019 which the rules of construction might dictate.\u201d\nThe pertinent provision of the deed of trust provides that, after the death of the settlor and his wife, Stephen Jr. was to receive one-half of the trust income. At his death, his share \u201cshall be paid over to his issue per stirpes.\u201d Had settlor, his wife, and Stephen Jr. all died before Stephanie\u2019s adoption in 1951, there would be no question that she would have been entitled to participate in this distribution as the daughter of Stephen Jr. The terms of the trust instrument clearly identify Stephanie as one of the objects of settlor\u2019s bounty. It is unlikely that settlor would have desired to exclude Stephanie from benefits under the trust merely because his son gave his consent to her adoption by her stepfather. Absent any evidence of an intent to exclude Stephanie because of an unanticipated adoption, and given the clear evidence in the trust instrument of an intent to include her, we are not prepared to apply legal rules of construction to thwart settlor\u2019s intent. Our conclusion is reinforced by the basic equality of treatment adopted by settlor for his descendents of the same generation.\nIn Taylor Estate, 357 Pa. 120, 53 A.2d 136 (1947), a testimony trust was established providing income for life to the testatrix\u2019 brother. Upon the death of the brother, the corpus was to be distributed among his \u201cissue.\u201d The brother had five children, two of whom predeceased him. Of the two children who predeceased the brother, each left a child. One of these grandchildren of testatrix\u2019 brother was adopted, before the death of the brother, by a person unrelated to testatrix or her brother. When the brother died, the question arose whether this grandchild, adopted \u201cout\u201d of the family of testatrix\u2019 brother, was entitled to participate in the distribution as \u201cissue\u201d of the brother. This Court held that the adoptee was entitled to share in the distribution notwithstanding his adoption by a stranger to his! grandfather\u2019s blood.\nWe find that settlor\u2019s intent was to include Stephanie as \u201cissue\u201d of Stephen Jr. Further, to the extent that legal principles are needed to construe this deed of trust, we find Taylor Estate to be persuasive authority for including Stephanie in the trust distribution.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nJONES, C. J., filed a concurring opinion.\nNIX, J., concurs in the result.\n. See Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(3), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3) (Supp.1975).\n. The deed of trust was amended on February 13, 1945. The terms of the amendment\u2019 are not material here.\n. Stephen IV offered no evidence designed to illuminate the intent of the settlor, relying solely upon what he regarded as the proper construction of the words of the instrument.\n. Before the orphans\u2019 court rendered its adjudication, Stephanie submitted a request for findings on these facts in accordance with her evidence at the hearing. Stephen filed a response to the request for findings stating that he had no objection to the requested findings \u201cexcept for relevancy.\u201d We therefore conclude that these facts are undisputed, the disagreement between the parties being confined to their legal significance.\n. Because the question presented in this case involves construing a deed of trust executed in 1944 and amended in 1945, the evidence of Stephanie\u2019s relationship to settlor was largely confined to the period prior to and immediately surrounding the execution of that instrument.\n. In re Girard Corn Exchange Bank, 418 Pa. 112, 115 n. 4, 208 A. 2d 857, 859 n. 4 (1965); Pew Trust Estate, 411 Pa. 96, 106-97, 191 A.2d 399, 405 (1963); see Erny Trust, 415 Pa. 8, 202 A.2d 30 (1964).\n. E. g., Thomas Estate, 457 Pa. 546, 551-52, 327 A.2d 31, 34 (1974); Pew Trust Estate, 411 Pa. 96, 106-07, 191 A.2d 399, 405 (1963), and authorities cited by those cases.\n. The function of canons of construction is well stated in 5 American Law of Property \u00a7 21.2, at 129 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952):\n\u201cWhen the construction process goes into operation to give preciseness of meaning to language that is not clear and unequivocal, the basic search is for the intention of the transfer- or. By hypothesis, however, he has not manifested his intention with respect to the particular difficulty. Thus, the search for the intention of the transferor must of necessity be changed to a search for the intention it is reasonable to attribute to the average transferor with respect to the particular situation. A rule of construction which may be established as a guide to the interpretation of a donative transaction is nothing more than the formulation of the intention it is thought reasonable to attribute to a transferor in giving preciseness of meaning to language he has employed.\u201d",

        "text": "JONES, Chief Justice\n(concurring).\nI feel compelled to concur in the result reached today by the majority but solely on the basis that the law governing the rights of adopted children at the time the settlor executed the instant deed of trust mandates this re-suit. See Wills Act of 1917, June 7, P.L. 403, \u00a7 16, 20 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 227, 228.\nThe settlor executed the inter vivos trust in 1944 making himself and his wife life tenants. The Wills Act of 1917 did not specifically excluded adopted children from sharing in the estate of their natural parents whereas the Intestate Act of 1917, June 7, P.L. 429, \u00a7 16(b), 20 P.S. \u00a7 102, made clear that \u201cadopted persons shall not be entitled to inherit or take from or through their natural parents, grandparents, or collateral relatives. . . . (See Cave\u2019s Estate, 326 Pa. 358, 366, 192 A. 460, 464 (1937) for a complete interpretation of that latter provision.)\nThis Court in Taylor Estate, 357 Pa. 120, 53 A.2d 136 (1947), construing a testamentary trust posing the same problem as we face today, decided in favor of the adopted child, stating:\n\u201cIt remains but to be said that in [sic] absence of statute directing a different construction, the fact of adoption does not change the claimant\u2019s description as issue of [the life tenant of the trust] whether being construed as made before or after the adoption. We are fortified in this conclusion by the fact that Section 16(b) of Intestate Act of 1917 expressly provided that an adopted person was not to be entitled to take from or through his natural relatives, whereas Section 16(b) of the Wills Act of 1917 makes no such exclusionary provision.\u201d\n357 Pa. at 124-125, 53 A.2d at 138-9. Accord, In re Buffington\u2019s Trust, 26 Pa.D. & C.2d 551, 10 Chest. 328 (1963); In re Price\u2019s Estate, 54 Berks 67 (1962).\nWere this present case one involving a like situation to be construed under the Wills Act of 1947, April 24, P.L. 89, \u00a7 14, 20 P.S. \u00a7 180.14(6), however, Stephanie Tracy Kerns would be precluded from taking any share of her natural father\u2019s estate by virtue of her adoption prior to the death of the settlor. The Act reads as follows:\n\u201cAdopted children. In construing a will making a devise or bequest to a person or persons described by relationship to the testator or to another, any person adopted before the death of the testator shall be considered the child of his adopting parent or parents and not the child of his natural parents . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added).\nFor the reasons set forth above, I concur in the result.\n. The trust was amended once in 1945.\n. Repealed by Acts 1972, June 30, P.L. 508, No. 164, \u00a7 3, effective July 1, 1972. See 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2514(7).
