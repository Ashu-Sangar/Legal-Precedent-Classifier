        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellee the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association of Reading and Berks County filed a claim against the estate of decedent Jacob L. Hain for the unpaid balance of a pledge made by decedent to appellee\u2019s swimming pool construction fund. The Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County determined that decedent had contracted to contribute $100,000, and the court awarded appellee the unpaid balance of $94,399.38. This appeal ensued. Two issues are presented for our determination: (1) whether appellants lack standing to bring this appeal; and (2) whether the orphans\u2019 court erred in honoring appellee\u2019s claim against the estate. We conclude that appellants do have standing, and affirm.\nAppellee asserts that appellants, as executors, lack standing to challenge the decree of the orphans\u2019 court. Appellant Mary McQuay Hain, decedent\u2019s widow, elected to take against the will, and she and appellant American Bank and Trust Company of Pennsylvania are both executors and residuary trustees under the will. However, the exceptions to the May 16, 1974, decree of the orphans\u2019 court were filed by appellants, only in their capacity as executors.\nThe right to appeal a decree of the orphans\u2019 court is conferred by section 792 of the Decedents, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 792 (Supp. 1975), which provides in pertinent part: Unless an executor has been surcharged or has been ordered to distribute more than the admitted balance in the estate, the executor is not a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d by the final order or decree of the orphans\u2019 court. The executor is merely a holder of the estate\u2019s assets for the purpose of administration and distribution and is not adversely affected by a decision of the orphans\u2019 court directing the distribution of those assets. Musser\u2019s Estate, 341 Pa. 1, 17 A.2d 411 (1941); Kennedy\u2019s Estate, 328 Pa. 193, 194 A. 901 (1937); Reese\u2019s Estate, 317 Pa. 473, 177 A. 792 (1935); Hand\u2019s Estate, 288 Pa. 569, 136 A. 864 (1927).\n\u201cAny party in interest who is aggrieved by a final order or decree of the orphans\u2019 court division, or a fiduciary whose estate or trust is so aggrieved, may appeal therefrom to the proper appellate court. \u201d\nAppellants were not adversely affected by the decree of the orphans\u2019 court in their capacity as executors. However, they were directly affected, and are \u201cparties aggrieved,\u201d in their capacity as residuary trustees under the will and, in the case of Mary McQuay Hain, in her individual capacity as a spouse who has elected to take against the will. When a party has erroneously challenged an order or decree of the orphans\u2019 court as executor but properly could have proceeded in some other capacity, the party is entitled to retain the benefit of the appeal in the proper capacity. Keffalas Estate, 426 Pa. 432, 233 A.2d 248 (1967); Stachnick Estate, 376 Pa. 592, 103 A.2d 765 (1954); Holben\u2019s Estate, 299 Pa. 348, 149 A. 598 (1930); Deakyne Estate, 166 Pa.Super. 527, 72 A.2d 616 (1950); Follansbee Estate, 161 Pa.Super. 31, 53 A.2d 864 (1947); Cheponis Estate, 148 Pa.Super. 515, 25 A.2d 779 (1942). Although appellants may lack standing to appeal in their capacity as executors, they do have standing in their other capacities. We must therefore reach the merits of the appeal.\nClaims against a decedent\u2019s estate must be established by clear, direct, and convincing evidence. Moore Estate, 439 Pa. 578, 266 A.2d 641 (1970); Nicolazzo Estate, 414 Pa. 186, 199 A.2d 455 (1964); Gadola Estate, 410 Pa. 250, 188 A.2d 744 (1963); Secary Estate, 407 Pa. 162, 180 A.2d 572 (1962). Whether the required standard of proof has been met is a question of law and is therefore a proper issue for independent determination by this Court. Moore Estate, supra; Nicolazzo Estate, supra; Stafford v. Reed, 363 Pa. 405, 70 A.2d 345 (1950). However, such a review does not amount to a trial de novo of all factual matters. The appellate court must accord great weight to the findings of fact of the trial court, which saw and heard the witnesses. Billinger Estate, 451 Pa. 77, 301 A.2d 795 (1973); Dart Estate, 426 Pa. 296, 232 A.2d 724 (1967); Cameron Estate, 388 Pa. 25, 130 A.2d 173 (1957); Miller\u2019s Estate, 279 Pa. 30, 123 A. 646 (1924). Those findings of fact are conclusive if there is sufficient evidence to support them and if they are not based on a capricious disbelief of the witnesses. Dart Estate, supra; Mooney\u2019s Estate, 328 Pa. 273, 194 A. 893 (1937). See also Heiney Estate, 455 Pa. 574, 318 A.2d 700 (1974); Billinger Estate, supra; Mintz Trust, 444 Pa. 189, 282 A.2d 295 (1971).\nOn February 25, 1970, decedent attended a meeting of appellee\u2019s executive committee to consider plans for the construction of a swimming facility. The committee had instructed its architects to design a project which could be completed for $700,000, but the lowest bid received, which included only a \u201croughed-in\u201d locker room and spectators\u2019 gallery, totalled $800,000. The committee concluded that an expenditure in excess of $700,000 could not be justified and discussed elimination of the locker room and spectators\u2019 gallery as a probable alternative. At that point decedent made the statement which is the subject of this litigation.\nAppellee presented four witnesses who attended the February 25, 1970 meeting. Two of the witnesses quoted decedent as saying that he would \u201cguarantee\u201d the additional $100,000. Another witness testified that decedent had said that he would be \u201cresponsible\u201d for the $100,000. The last witness testified that he recalled decedent \u201csaying something to the effect\u201d that decedent \u201cwould see to it that another $100,000 was raised.\u201d\nSeveral months after the meeting, decedent and an official of appellee discussed decedent\u2019s pledge. Decedent assured this official that the money would be paid and made no suggestion that his obligation was in any way conditional. Moreover, decedent made two payments toward the $100,000 pledge. One such payment of $600.62 was made in January, 1971, and the other totalling $5,-000, was made in January, 1972, just a few months before his death in April, 1972.\nThe orphans\u2019 court found: (1) that decedent\u2019s statement constituted an offer to give $100,000 to appellee if appellee would construct the pool facility with the roughed-in locker room and spectators\u2019 gallery areas; (2) that the offer was accepted by appellee; and (3) that appellee completed its obligations by contracting on March 12, 1970, for construction of the pool facility in accordance with the conditions attached to decedent\u2019s offer. The pool was constructed and completed in 1971.\nAppellants emphasize that appellee\u2019s witnesses used different words in recounting what decedent said at the meeting and that the testimony has several possible interpretations. Decedent might have obligated himself merely to lead a more vigorous fund raising drive. Alternatively, if decedent did assume personal financial responsibility, his obligation might have been contingent upon the inability of appellee to raise the necessary funds. Appellants argue that appellee failed as a matter of law to meet its burden of proof because of these alternative interpretations.\nWe find appellants\u2019 arguments to be unpersuasive. The testimony fully supports the finding of the orphans\u2019 court that decedent communicated to the people present at the February 25, 1970, meeting that he would give appellee $100,000 of his own funds if appellee would build the pool facility as decedent stipulated. Appellants did not, upon cross-examination, make any reference either to the use by the witnesses of different words to describe decedent\u2019s offer, or, more important, to any ambiguity in the meaning of the offer made by decedent at the meeting. Decedent\u2019s subsequent payments are further evidence of a definite offer to supply the necessary funds. The orphans\u2019 court, which had the benefit of observing the witnesses, was justified in concluding that appellee established its claim by \u201cclear, direct, and convincing evidence.\u201d\nDecree affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nJONES, C. J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. The award was made by nisi decree dated May 16, 1974. Appellees, as executors under decedent\u2019s will, filed exceptions. On August 30, 1974, the orphans\u2019 court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the decree absolutely.\n. See Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. II, \u00a7 202, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3) (Supp. 1975).\n. This issue was raised but was not decided by the orphans\u2019 court.\n. The language in this section is identical to the language of the statute which it replaced, the Act of August 10, 1951, P.L. 1163, art. VII, \u00a7 771 (formerly codified as 20 P.S. \u00a7 2080.771 (1964) repealed by \u00a7 3 of the Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508, which enacted the Decedents, Estates and Fiduciaries Code).\n. This case is therefore distinguishable from those which involved a stale claim or a claim which was not made to decedent during his lifetime. See Nicolazzo Estate, supra.\n. Decedent was a co-chairman of the fund raising committee for the pool project.",

They used words such as \u201cguarantee,\u201d \u201cbe responsible for,\u201d or \u201csee to it that another $100,000 was raised.\u201d This type of language does not clearly reflect an unconditional promise to give. The more likely interpretation is that if needed he would see that the $100,000 was obtained in some way. At best, the language is subject equally to both interpretations and does not satisfy the burden of being clear, direct and convincing evidence of an offer to give $100,000. Under these circumstances, recovery by appellee required proof that the $100,000 was never obtained from any source.",
