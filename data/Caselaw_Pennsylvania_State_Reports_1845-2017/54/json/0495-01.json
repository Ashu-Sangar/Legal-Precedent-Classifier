        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nWoodward, C. J.\nThe defendant\u2019s points on the trial below, and the argument here, may be reduced to this single proposition \u2014that'inasmuch as any plaintiff who sues for an injury resulting in the death of another, is only entitled to recover an indemnity for pecuniary losses, and inasmuch as a widowed mother has no legal right to the services of a minor son, therefore the measure of her damages is only reasonable compensation for nursing and medical attendance of the deceased.\nThis proposition ignores the Acts of Assembly utterly, and if they are put aside, a shorter method would be that the common law gave no action for the death of another, and therefore the mother could not recover at all. It is not quite logical to concede liability for nursing and medical attendance, as a sequence of an argument that goes to prove the action will not lie.\nThe answer to the argument is the Act of 26th April 1855, Purd. 754, which declares that the \u201c persons entitled to recover damages for any injury causing death 'shall be the husband, widow, children or parents of the deceased, and no other relative.\u201d\nNow, here is no limitation of damages to nursing and medical attendance. The legislature did not undertake to define the damages, and yet the power of a widowed mother to recover damages for the injury causing the death of her son is expressly given. \"What damages ? Such as a court and jury, in view of all circumstances, should consider reasonable. If this was not what the legislature meant, their meaning is past finding out. Both parents are grouped among the persons entitled to recover damages, and by necessary implication the same damages, or damages estimated by a common standard; If the father could recover for loss of the son\u2019s services, which is a conceded point, the legislature have imparted the same capacity to the mother; and she may showr what they were worth to her, as if she had acquired right to them by arrangement and contract, if not by law, and of course how much she was pecuniarily injured by his untimely taking off.\nThis far the legislature have compelled us to go. We keep step with them^and limit the mother\u2019s right to a case of death and not of maiming, because they have changed the rule of the common law no further than this. Where the injury does not result in death, we decided at the present term, in \u2019Railway Co. v. Stutler, ante p. 375, that the mother has no right of action for-loss of a son\u2019s services, but where it does result in death we sustain the action by virtue of the Act of Assembly. For the discrepancy of these rules we are not responsible.\nNursing and medical attendance before the death, and funeral expenses afterward, are proper elements of estimate, but the value' of services lost is equally legitimate since the statute. There was therefore no error in negativing the points; and\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "The Pennsylvania Railroad Company versus Bantom.\n1. The Act of April 26th 1855, expressly gives the widowed mother power to recover damages for the death of a child, by negligence; the damages are not limited to nursing and medical attendance, but are such as a court and jury under all the circumstances shall consider reasonable.\n2. Both parents are entitled to recover damages, estimated by a common standard.\n8. The mother may show what the services of a child were worth to her, as if she had acquired right to them by contract.\n4. Nursing, medical attendance and funeral expenses, are proper elements of estimate, but the value of services lost is equally legitimate since the statute.\nMarch 7th 1867.\nBefore Woodward, C. J., Thompson, Strong and Agnew, JJ. Read, J., sick.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery county.\nThe action was by Maria Bantom against the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.\nThe declaration alleged that the plaintiff was a widow, that her son, Lewis T. Bantom, between thirteen and fourteen years of age, crossing the railroad in a wagon, was struck by the engine and died from the injuries he received, and that the accident was the result of negligence on the part of the agents of the defendants. It further alleged that the plaintiff was engaged in the purchase and sale of milk and cream, that her son assisted her in the business, and that his services were of great value to her.\nMay 13th 1867,\nThe1 plea was Not guilty.\nThe evidence was, that on the evening of the 19th of January 1865, Lewis and another boy were in a dearborn wagon, passing along a public road near Athensville, Montgomery county, and in crossing the railroad the wagon was struck by the engine, and Lewis received injuries from which he died a few days thereafter.\nThe defendant submitted, amongst others, the following points:\n3. Even if the action could be maintained, the plaintiff is entitled to recover nothing but compensation for the pecuniary loss she sustained by the death of her son.\n4. The extent of such damage is a reasonable compensation for nursing and medical attendance of the deceased.\n5. The mother is not entitled to the services of her son, and nothing can be allowed in this action for the loss of such services.\nThe court filed no charge, but their answers to the points were, \u201c We decline to answer as requested.\u201d\nThe jury found a verdict of $1748 for the plaintiff. The errors assigned were the answers to the points.\nW. Darlington, for plaintiff in error,\ncited Penna. Railroad Co. v. Kelly, 7 Casey 372; Same v. Zebe, 9 Id. 318; Same v.
