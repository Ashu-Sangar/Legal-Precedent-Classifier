This was of course irregular. It is probable the judgment was intended to have been given against the garnishees, and not against the defendant; and if there was in fact no other finding of the jury than a verdict on the 2d plea, it may be that there was nothing in the way of a judgment against the garnishees. If the issue rendered by the 2d plea was immaterial, a verdict upon it amounted to nothing. The plea should have been met by a demurrer, and the plea of payment disposed of in the regular way. If the issue joined upon that had been determined in favor of the plaintiffs, they would have been entitled to a judgment against the garnishees. But as the record stands, the judgment that was given is erroneous.\nJudgment reversed and the record remitted, with directions to proceed, &c.",

The jury found for the defendant. The court entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Held, to be error.\n2. If the 2d plea was immaterial, a- verdict on it amounted to nothing. It should have been met by a demurrer and the plea of payment disposed of in the usual way.\nFebruary 19th 1867.\nBefore Woodward, O., J., Thompson and Strong, JJ. Bead, J., sick. Agnew, J., at Nisi Prius.\nError to the District Court of Philadelphia.\nThis was an attachment-execution, issued May 10th 1864, by The Commercial Mutual Insurance Company against Osborn Conrad, on a judgment for $676.50, recovered March 11th 1859, on a note for $600.

S. Winebrenner, D. Smith, Jr., and George F. Thomas, who shall be empowered to make settlement and employ the solicitor of the company to make collectionsthat this resolution gave the committee power to settle the defendant\u2019s claim, and that in the succeeding January the directors, of whom the committee were three, signed an agreement, that in consideration of the defendant having received no value for the note on which judgment had been obtained, \u201c we, the late directors, do hereby agree that if he will pay 10 per cent, of the amount of said note we will receive it as full satisfaction for said judgmentthat in pursuance of the agreement the defendant tendered \u201c $60, being 10 per cent, of the amount of the note,\u201d to the treasurer of the company, and afterwards to the solicitor of the company, both of whom declined to receive it, and that afterwards he paid that amount to D. Smith, Jr., one of the committee-, who gave him a receipt therefor in full settlement \u201c of the judgment-debt and notes, satisfaction to be entered on the record as soon as the costs can be adjusted ;\u201d and that afterwards, on the 16th of June 1864, he paid into court all the costs, and thereby became entitled to have satisfaction entered on the judgment, &c.\nFebruary 25th 1867,\nOn the 24th of January 1866, there was a verdict for defendant.
