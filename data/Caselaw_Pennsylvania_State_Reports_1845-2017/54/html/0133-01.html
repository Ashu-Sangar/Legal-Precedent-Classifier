First, then, was <em>this </em>her property ? Was it purchased with her separate means? The consideration for this West Philadelphia ¡property, over the encumbrances, was $2533.34. This sum was satisfied by a mortgage on the property, executed by Mrs. Hazlett and her husband for $1500, payable in one year; a note of Powell, Hazlett &amp; Co. for $1000, and the balance, $33.34, Mr. Caldwell, the conveyancer, thinks was paid in money, but cannot remember. He says, however, that it was settled at the time. About this small balance the counsel have said nothing, and I need not, therefore, pause in respect of it, but will pass to the note for $1000. Was <em>this </em>Mrs. Hazlett’s separate property? Does it appear from the evidence that the firm by which it was <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>drawn owed her this money at the time ? One of the members of the firm, Mr. Lyon, tells you it did. He says, that in the fall preceding the purchase of the West Philadelphia property, Mrs. Hazlett deposited with the firm the sum of §1400, on call, to remain until she could find a piece of property into which to put it. And it seems to be entirely clear, and I believe is undisputed, that she received at the time the witness refers to — the fall of 1859 — the sum of §1428.57, from the administrator of her grandfather’s estate. It appears thus, that she haid the money to deposit if she chose so to use it. * * * If you are satisfied from the evidence that the note was hers, given on account of her money as before stated, then she must have credit for it, and it is a payment on the West Philadelphia property by her, to this extent. — The mortgage given Mr. Purcell went into the hands of Mr. Chadwick, and was paid the next spring. Was <em>this </em>paid with money shown to belong to Mrs. Hazlett ? Mr. Chadwick says a short time before the mortgage became due he called on Mrs. Hazlett to know whether she would meet it at maturity ; that she said she did not expect to be called on for it at the time, but would apply to the administrator of her grandfather’s estate to advance her money for the purpose. It appears from the testimony of the administrator, and from her letter to him, and his reply, that she did immediately apply to him for money, on account of her interest in the estate he represented, for this specific purpose (as she had told Mr. Chadwick she would), and that he furnished her §1485 on the 27th day of March 1861, very soon after Mr. Chadwick’s visit to her. And Mr. Lathrop, a member of the firm of Powell, Hazlett &amp; Co., testifies that on the same day on which this money was so furnished her by the administrator, she deposited with the said firm a sum precisely corresponding in amount with that which she had so received — §1485. Out of this deposit, Mr. Lathrop says he paid Mr. Chadwick §1082.50 on the mortgage in question; that this §1082.50 was the proper money of Mrs. Hazlett, does not seem to be questioned by the plaintiff.</p>

This took place, he says, about the 1st of April. Next, we find that on the 29th of April, according to the testimony of the administrator, Mrs. Hazlett received a further payment on account of her interest in her grandfather’s estate,of about §500. Mr. Chadwick says, that in the latter part of April, about the time she received this money, she sent for him, and informed him she had left the §500 and interest due him with the firm, Avhere the former amount had been deposited, directing him to call there and get his money ; that he did so, and it was paid to him.

There is no <em>direct </em>evidence that she deposited the money just then received from the administrator, with the firm. But you will look carefully at the circumstances shown, and if they fully satisfy your minds that the balance on the mortgage was paid with money thus received from her grandfather’s estate, this will he sufficient to sustain the position of the defendant in this particular. It must he borne in mind that when called upon by Mr. Chadwick, the holder of the mortgage, for payments; she referred to her interest in her grandfather’s estate as the source to which she looked for means to satisfy her obligation. That we find her immediately applying to the administrator for money for this specific purpose; that the administrator advanced her $1485, an amount insufficient to discharge the debt; that it was immediately deposited with the firm of Powell, Hazlett &amp; Co.; that Mr. Chadwick was informed by her of this fact, and sent there to receive $1082.-50 on account; that he was requested to wait upon her for a time for the balance ; that soon thereafter she received a further sum of $500 from the administrator ; and that at about the same time, she informed Mr. Chadwick that she was prepared to pay the balance (being within a very few dollars of the amount which she had just received), directed him to call on the firm where the former sum had been deposited, and receive his money; that he called, and this balance was paid him, as the previous sum had been.</p>

To this extent the purchase-money may be treated as unsatisfied. The only actual payment made on the farm, in addition to the transfer of the West Philadelphia prpperty, was the $1500 paid in cash. Whose money was this ? Does the evidence show it to have been <em>Mrs. Hazlett’s, </em>and not her husband’s ? That she had it in her possession, and gave it to Mr. Paschall, the conveyancer.for Erskine, and that her husband was not present, these circumstances of themselves would be unimportant. Eor if no more appeared the presumption would be, as I have before said, that the money was Mr. Hazlett’s, and that she was merely his agent. Then what more does appear ?

The title was in her name and if her money had bought it her <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>husband had no estate in the land that his creditors could seize and sell, and the plaintiff, of course, took nothing by the sheriff’s deed. This was a question of fact which was for the jury upon the evidence, and all the proofs were so admirably summed up and presented to them by the learned judge as to leave the parties no ground of complaint and nothing for us to discuss. We cannot perceive any error in either the principles of law stated for the guidance of the jury or in the judicial comments upon the effect of the proofs. We dismiss all the errors assigned upon the charge, therefore, without farther observation.</p>
    <p id="b139-6" data-blocks='[["BL_139.6",139,[223,865,1157,764]]]'>There is a bill of exceptions to the correspondence between Mr. Hutchinson and Mrs. Hazlett. Several letters of Mr. Hutchinson, who acted as her agent at Pittsburg in collecting and sending her moneys, and one letter of hers to him,-were admitted, and we think, properly. Holding married women to a strict account of the source from whence they derive moneys to invest in business or real estate, they must be permitted to explain the ordinary means of derivation, and what is more natural evidence than correspondence with a business agent ? These letters bore such a relation to the fact under investigation as to be admissible upon the rule of <em>res gestee. </em>They were a legitimate and very satisfactory mode of accounting for Mrs. Hazlett’s capacity to buy valuable real estate, and to loan money to men in business, and they furnished the plaintiff’ with such information of her resources as enable him to contradict her upon the main fact in controversy, if successful contradiction were possible. We do not think any rule of evidence recognised in adjudged cases was violated by the admission of the letters.</p>
