Thomas, who shall be empowered to make settlement and employ the solicitor of the company to make collectionsthat this resolution gave the committee power to settle the defendant’s claim, and that in the succeeding January the directors, of whom the committee were three, signed an agreement, that in consideration of the defendant having received no value for the note on which judgment had <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>been obtained, “ we, the late directors, do hereby agree that if he will pay 10 per cent, of the amount of said note we will receive it as full satisfaction for said judgmentthat in pursuance of the agreement the defendant tendered “ $60, being 10 per cent, of the amount of the note,” to the treasurer of the company, and afterwards to the solicitor of the company, both of whom declined to receive it, and that afterwards he paid that amount to D.

This was of course irregular. It is probable the judgment was intended to have been given against the garnishees, and not against the defendant; and if there was in fact no other finding of the jury than a verdict on the 2d plea, it may be that there was nothing in the way of a judgment against the garnishees. If the issue rendered by the 2d plea was immaterial, a verdict upon it amounted to nothing. The plea should have been met by a demurrer, and the plea of payment disposed of in the regular way. If the issue joined upon that had been determined in favor of the plaintiffs, they would have been entitled to a judgment against the garnishees. But as the record stands, the judgment that was given is erroneous.</p>
