      <em>“ </em>It was contended on the trial that the payment, of the purchase-money, without the conveyance of the legal title, was not sufficient to constitute Neel an innocent purchaser without notice.

And this doctrine has prevailed ever since: see 8 S. <em>&amp; R. 498; </em>12 Id. 378; <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Whart.%20432" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Whart. 432">1 Wh. 432</a> ; <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%2029" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Watts 29">10 Watts 29</a> ; and numerous other later cases.”</p>

The rule laid down in that case is sufficiently broad and comprehensive to cover the case now under consideration, although the facts are not exactly the same. In that, only part of the purchase-money was paid before notice, while in this the whole was paid. In that case the plaintiff had only an equitable title, in this the defendants have a legal title. In that the party sought to be ousted had been in possession about fifteen years, while in this the possession has been uninterrupted for more than thirty years. The payment of the whole of the purchase-money in this case, before notice, certainly adds great force to the rule thus laid down, and I can perceive no reason why a <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>naked legal title, when the holder has been guilty of gross negligence by which the other party was induced to buy and pay his money, should be any more available than an equitable title. Both should stand on the same footing, and be subject to the same rules in our courts, where, in the administration of justice, law and equity are blended together. And this position is fully sustained by Mr. Justice Rogers in Bellas <em>v. </em>McCarty, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%2025" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Watts 25">10 Watts 25</a>.</p>

      <em>“ </em>But it contended that because Kennedy’s deed was recorded before Neel’s, the latter is to be postponed, and his equity disregarded. It has been held in several cases that where there are two deeds of conveyance, of different dates, from the same grantor to different persons, neither of which is recorded within six months, that which is first recorded will take priority. But possession of the land by the grantee is equivalent to recording his deed: Lightner <em>v. </em>Mooney, <a href="/watts/10/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="10 Watts 407" data-case-ids="1850993" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0407-01">10 Watts 407</a>. This ruf -must undoubtedly receive a rational construction and application. I cannot conceive what legitimate bearing the recording of either of these deeds can have on this case. Kennedy’s deed was recorded before Neel’s, it is true, but as the jury have found, not until after Neel had paid the whole of the purchase-money. Neel might have recorded his article of agreement when it was executed, but what benefit would that have been to Kennedy, who had paid his purchase-money, if indeed he ever paid it, at the date of his deed ? I take it our recording acts were intended to give notice to all concerned as to the ownership of land, so that the public authorities may assess and collect the necessary taxes, and that pui’chasers may understand the character of the titles they are to receive, or may be notified that their title is defective before they shall have paid all the purchase-money. Thus, if A. sells and conveys a tract of land to B., receives a portion of the consideration in hand, and takes bonds and a mortgage for the residue, payable in instalments, and B. neglects to record his deed within six months, and A. sells the same land to C., who pays his purchase-money and records his deed with’i s¡x months, his title is preferred to B.’s, because by B.’s laches in not placing his deed on record C. was induced to buy and pay his money, and by promptly recording his deed B. may set up the deed to C. as a defence to an action for the residue of the purchase-money, and recover back what has been paid, so the taking possession by C. under his deed would serve the same purpose as recording it, by giving notice that he claimed the land; and if C., the second purchaser, owed any portion of the purchase-money when B. recorded his deed, he could in like manner defend as to that portion remaining unpaid. But under the authority of Youst <em>v. </em>Martin and the other cases hereinbefore referred tr, I apprehend <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>,B. would not be permitted to recover the land from C. without reimbursing what had been paid by him before he had received notice of his title.</p>

Kennedy’s deed is dated the 13th of March 1832, at which time the receipt for the purchase-money is dated. There were no deferred payments. It was not recorded till December 24th 1834. Of course the recording of Neel’s article of agreement, or deed, if he had one, would have been of no sort of benefit to Kennedy, in the way of defence to an action for deferred payments. He was, therefore, in no way injured by Neel’s neglect. On the other hand, Neel purchased on the 26th of February 1834, wrent into possession on the 1st of April, and paid the whole of the consideration before he had any notice of Kennedy’s title. And now, if that title is to prevail, Neel will lose this valuable body of coal, without any want of care, caution or good faith on 1 ■ part, but entirely through the negligence of Kennedy, who will be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong, to the great damage of an innocent purchaser.

The main point in the case has been treated by both sides as raised by the judgment of the court on the fourth reserved question, namely, the effect of the possession and improvement of the plaintiff’s husband, as against a prior deed of his grantor, in part for the land embraced in his purchase, of which he had no notice ; not recorded within six months, but recorded before his deed.</p>

The plaintiff seeks to avert the effect of this by relying on a purchase, payment of the purchase-money, possession and improvements made in ignorance of the defendant’s prior deed, and contends that for these reasons her title is best, although recorded last.</p>

Such a conveyance from Clark the defendants have. It is a conveyance to their grantor of all the coal in the land, tested by the doctrine of the cases referred to, excepting only a reservation to the grantor for fuel for himself. We have therefore, first, a grant by Clark by deed of the coal to Kennedy ; and secondly, a sale and deed of the land containing it to Neel the plaintiff’s <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>and conveyance of the coal to Kennedy. The ordinary effect of a deed gives seisin of lands, “ <em>cujus est solum, ejus usque ad caelum.” </em>It would carry all the minerals to an indefinite extent downwards under the land as well as the surface. There is therefore a deed to one party for the coal in the land by a party who owned both land and coal, and a subsequent deed generally, and without reservation to another of the land. The subjects of these grants until severed formed a unit; after, they were distinct parts or separate properties, as much so as the divided portions of what was once a single tract of land. The effect of these conveyances we are required to determine.</p>

Had he been first on record his title would have unquestionably prevailed over that of Kennedy, under which the defendants claim, unless there had been notice before payment of the purchase-money of its existence. The counsel for the defendant in error, to meet the difficulty which they must encounter from the recording act cited, contend that the conveyance to Kennedy by Clark was not boná fide and for a valuable consideration; and secondly, that the purchase by Neel, made in ignorance of a prior conveyance of any part of the property, the payment of the purchase-money, possession taken and improvements made, were equivalent in their effect to recording his title, and so satisfied the terms of the statutes.</p>

The deed of Clark to Kennedy is dated 13th March 1832, and recites the consideration to be $10, and in the body of the deed the receipt of it is acknowledged. In the argument of the defendant in error, it is claimed that this acknowledgment is no evidence of payment. Granting that the payment of a consideration is necessary to give effect to a deed of bargain and sale, as was said in Boardman <em>v. </em>Dean, 10 Casey 252, is not such an acknowledgment evidence against a subsequent purchaser from the grantor who made it ? In Lloyd <em>v. </em>Lynch, 4 Casey 419, this point is expressly ruled against the defendant in error. It was there held that the receipt in a deed was good against the grantor, and all who derive title <em>subsequently </em>from him, but <em>no </em>evidence against a stranger, or one who derived title previously from the grantor. I need not stop to inquire how far this is without exception as to strangers; even those who might contend against the doctrine to that extent, <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>will admit its accuracy as to parties and privies. The other cases referred to of Coxe <em>v. </em>Sartwell, 9 Harris 480, Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Young, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Whart.%20482" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="1 Whart. 482">1 Wh. 482</a>, and Bolton <em>v. </em>Johns, 5 Barr 151, in no way impugn the qualification as to the effect of the receipt upon a subsequent purchaser from a grantor who had previously conveyed, but virtually support it. The position of the defendant in error, as to the effect of the receipt in the deed, as these parties stand, is not sustained. Nor can we hold the consideration to be nominal merely, and therefore to be presumed not to have been paid. In 1832 the coal was undoubtedly considered of little value at that place. We see that the fee simple of the five acres and allowance at the foot of the hill, and located along the Pennsylvania Canal, brought only $89.. Besides, it appears that the right to coal was to be a condition of the purchase of the five acres, which was intended as a site for salt-works; and thus was the value of the five acres enhanced.</p>
    <p id="b19-5" data-blocks='[["BL_19.6",19,[276,1097,1160,1329]],["BL_20.1",20,[278,403,1159,417]]]'>Is the second position assumed by the defendants’ counsel sufficient to avert the consequences of the priority of recording the deed to Kennedy ? The learned judge thought the facts embodied in the position were sufficient. Payment of purchase-money, and possession with improvements made, are not regarded by the terms of the statute quoted, as savings in favor of a subsequent purchaser. The plain teaching of the act is, that in order to be first in right against a prior purchaser’s deed, the- subsequent purchaser must be first in time on the record. We have many decisions to this effect in our books, such as Lightner <em>v. </em>Mooney, <a href="/watts/10/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="10 Watts 407" data-case-ids="1850993" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0407-01">10 Watts 407</a>; Poth <em>v. </em>Anstatt, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 307" data-case-ids="1856425" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0307-01">4 W. &amp; S. 307</a>: Ebner <em>v. </em>Goundie, 5 Id. 49; Hetherington <em>v. </em>Clark, 6 Casey 393 ; Souder <em>v. </em>Morrow, 9 Id. 85, in which Lowrie, C. J. said, “Purchasers ought to know that they have only a conditional title dependent on the honesty of their vendors, so long as they neglect to record their deeds. They are not safe, merely because of the neglect of a former purchaser to record within six months, and there being no subsequent deed to oppose them, but because among several deceived purchasers they are first to obey the law.” Nor does the possession by the subsequent purchaser and the making of improvements alter the case, or change the necessity for recording the deed to render the title effective against the first purchaser’s deed if recorded first. This is clearly shown by some of the cases already cited, and .especially in Goundie <em>v. </em>The Northampton Water Company, 7 Barr 233, Mott <em>v. </em>Clark, 9 Id. 405, and Ebner <em>v. </em>Goundie, 5 W. &amp; S. <em><a href="/citations/?q=2%20Jones%20102" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="2 Jones 102">supra.</a> </em>It is therefore evident the defendant in error is not protected by force of the second position, and that her possession by or under her husband, and improvements made, will not avail against the first deed first recorded. No equitable ground-or aspect has been presented to modify or change this result in this argument. The plaintiff’s grantor, it is <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>not claimed, was induced by any positive acts of those under whom the defendants claim, to invest her money in this property; if a loss, therefore, is to ensue under these circumstances, it is the consequence of supineness in not obeying the requirements of the statute, to have deeds on record earlier'. It is no answer that his contract might not sooner have entitled him to it. He should have made a contract that would have entitled him ; if he did not, he voluntarily risked the consequence of the faithlessness or dishonesty of his vendor, and his recourse would be against him on his covenants for title.</p>

In the one case, the first grant is dead as against a subsequent one with livery of seisin. In the other it is not so absolutely, but contingently dependent on the last deed being first recorded.</p>
