Young himself testified that the plaintiff brought the place to his notice, and he went to see it, but did not like it, abandoned all idea of buying it, and so informed the plaintiff about January 1865; that afterwards he was induced by-friends whom he was visiting in the neighborhood to look at it, and commenced a negotiation with the defendant which resulted in his buying it for $14,500. During the negotiation the defendant said he ought to have $15,000 because he would have to pay commissions; Young told him he would not, that Mr. Cummins had nothing to do with the sale, that he did not know Cummins in the transaction. He also testified, “I say now I was not induced to purchase the property by Mr. Cummins * * * I negotiated with Mr. Earp, and bought the place from him; I was not influenced by Mr. Cummins at all in making this purchase.”</p>

If anybody could tell how he bought, in consequence of what cause, <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>Young himself was the proper witness, and he swore, “I was not influenced by Mr. Cummins at all in making this purchase.

    <p id="b397-6" data-blocks='[["BL_397.6",397,[155,599,1156,1119]]]'>Now, a real estate broker is the agent of the vendor. There must be an employment to constitute him an agent, and his service as such, however slight, must be the efficient cause of the sale. If a mere introduction of the property to the notice of the buyer effects the sale, the broker earns his commission. An advertisement or any other service is enough if it be the immediate and efficient cause of the bargain. But if the services of the broker, whatever they be, fail to accomplish a sale, and several months after the proposed purchaser has decided not to buy, he is induced by other persons to reconsider his resolution, and then makes the purchase as the consequence of such secondary or supervening influence, the broker has no right to a commission. In a certain sense it may be true that the purchase was in consequence of the broker’s advertisement; but for that, the purchaser may never have looked at the property, nor entertained a thought of buying it, but the evidence in this case shows that it was at least due to another so distinct and separate a cause, that it was a mistake to permit the broker to recover. The simple answer to his demand was, that if the evidence was believed he did not cause the sale, that is, his agency was not the immediate and efficient cause of the sale, and law regards only proximate and not remote causes. In the language of Lord Bacon, “ it were infinite for the law to judge the cause of causes and their impulsions one of another, therefore it contenteth itself with the immediate cause, and judgeth of acts by that without looking to any further degree. <em>In jure non remota causa sed próxima spectatur.”</em>
