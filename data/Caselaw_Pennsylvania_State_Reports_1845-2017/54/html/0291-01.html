If it did, and lasted up until performance or offer of performance by the defendants, they had a right to demand it. The offer to furnish coal, therefore, on the basis of the contract, including the advance freight and toll, if any existed, was, if made and refused, a sufficient compliance on the part of the defendants, and if the plaintiffs did not choose to take coal, the fault is theirs, and they cannot recover damages if the offer was made in good faith. So in regard to the demand for-the coal in 1863 by the plaintiffs. If they declined to take them after an offer <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>made in July 1862, which we have said was within the terms of the contract, so far as the demand for increased tolls and freight was concerned, their demand in 1863 goes for nothing. These offers to perform, if I recollect aright, refer exclusively to 3000 tons, on which the advance in freights was applicable, and not to the residue of the first 1000 tons, to which it did not apply.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.6",297,[181,682,1158,720]]]'>“ 4. If the defendants are to be excused on account of the destruction occasioned by the flood, and tendered compliance as' soon thereafter as possible, we have said that, as to the 3000 tons, if that was the extent of the tender or offer on the terms of the contract as to advance freight and tolls, it will be a defence against the plaintiffs so far. But what excuse have they for nondelivery of the 437 tons undelivered of the first 1000 tons to be delivered ? No offer was made of that as I remember. It was to be delivered at $3.43, no matter what increase in the expenses of transportation occurred. As the defendants asserted their determination to adhere to the contract they must perform or offer to perform it in all its parts. If I am right in supposing that there was no delivery or offer to deliver this coal, the plaintiffs will be entitled to damages for its non-delivery, and that will be the difference between the price agreed to be paid for it and what the plaintiffs had to pay for coal to supply its place, and interest.</p>

I have thought of this, and, although it is not clear of difficulty, yet I am of opinion that the contract allows us to interpret it as separable for the purpose of performance. The first 1000, as distinctly designated in the contract, is to be delivered at a fixed and certain price, under all circumstances of possible compliance — payments in the order fixed by the contract,— and was to be monthly — and if an advance had taken place, as it did on the remainder of the coal, the accounts in regard to the first 1000 tons would have designated it as distinctly as if under a distinct contract.</p>

As the defendants claimed to adhere to the contract — performance for these reasons, it seems to me, became separable, and that the case is not within the rule suggested by the plaintiffs’ counsel; and I think the justice of the case requires us so to treat it. Nothing was said by the plaintiffs about want of an offer of entire compliance by the defendants— the difficulty seems to have been in regard to the increased cost of coal on account of the advance in freights and tolls, they seeming to rely on the law as they assert it, that the act of God did not apply to excuse the performance of the contract, and could furnish no grounds for the advance in freights and tolls. Under <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>the circumstances a recovery may be had for the deficiency in the performance as to this 437, if not for the 3000 tons, it not having been delivered, if it was not offered to be delivered.

The Lehigh Coal and Navigation works, therefore, became an indispensable and all-important link in their chain of transportation; a fact well known to all their customers, as well as the quality of their coal and the mines from which it was taken. Of course all contracts made with the defendants were made in full view of these facts.
