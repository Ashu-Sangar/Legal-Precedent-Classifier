These facts, together with the execution of policies, the preliminary proofs and appraisement of loss, are admitted, and about these facts no dispute exists. The question of the case is the principle of adjustment to be adopted between these defendants, who are general insurers against loss by fire of all the property described and embraced within the limits of the Southwark Foundry; and the special or specific policies insuring portions of the same property within parts of the buildings, and on portions of property designed for special use, such as the erecting - shop, machinery and materials for the United States steamer Chattanooga, in said buildings, and within the area of foundry property. The defendant companies claim to have each paid its due proportion of the loss, based upon an apportionment which requires the specific policies to pay the full amount of loss on the property covered by them, and the excess not so covered by the amount of such insurances only. Under this system of adjustment, each company paid the plaintiffs $1911.78 in full, as they allege, of the sum of the whole loss which they claim they are liable for. These amounts were specially receipted by plain tills, with a reservation of a right to press their claim against the companies respectively for a larger amount, based upon the system of adjustment adopted by them, which you have seen is materially variant from that of the defendants. By this system the plaintiffs would be entitled to $3029.37 from each of the defendants, less the amount of an appraisement of property, which we do not consider to have been covered by their policies, to wit, gas-pipes and fixtures and the like.</p>

If they had all been general policies, they would have been liable to contribute rateably if all solvent. Why should there be a difference when a part is covered by specific policies, and also covered by the general policies ? It is a case of double insurance of the part so covered, and a more favorable risk than a general policy on the whole. This is demonstrable by the rate of premium. The general policies get 2 per cent., and the special, 1|-. The latter should get the higher premium if they are not entitled to contribution from the former.

That condition is in these words: “ If, at the happening of any fire, the assured shall have insurance under a floating policy or policies, not specific, but covering goods generally in various places, not designated, and yet within limits which include the property herein insured, such policy, as between the assured and this company, shall be considered as covering any excess of sound value of the subject insured beyond the amount covered by the specific insurances thereon; and to determine the amount for which this company is liable in case of loss, such floating policy shall be considered an insurance on the property to the extent of such excess.”</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.6",284,[291,941,1152,469]]]'>Each of the companies sued in these cases insured to the plaintiffs on stock, tools, steam-engines, &amp;c., contained in buildings on a lot of ground (describing it) known as the Southwark Foundry. Another company had previously taken a risk on machinery manufactured, unmanufactured and materials for the same, in one of the buildings on the lot known as the erecting-shop. The plaintiffs also obtained other insurance on the subject of insurance in the defendants’ policies, and also obtained policies from still other companies on the machinery made, and being made and intended for the steamer Chattanooga, contained in the various buildings, but chiefly in the building known as the erecting-shop.</p>
    <p id="b284-6" data-blocks='[["BL_284.7",284,[291,1409,1152,1026]],["BL_285.1",285,[182,405,1153,1027]]]'>A loss having occurred, the defendants contend that in adjusting it between the several insurers, the specific policies, namely, those that cover specially part of the property insured, must be first exhausted, and that their policies not being insurances of stock, &amp;c., in any one building, but in all the buildings upon the lot known as the Southwark Foundry, cover only the excess of sound value remaining after deducting from the entire loss the amount of the specific policies. If this is so, it is because of the seventh condition of their contract above quoted. But that condition, as we understand it, contains no such restriction of the generality of their engagement. It certainly does not in express terms. The condition is exceedingly obscure, and it is difficult to determine, satisfactorily, what was intended by it. One would think it easy enough to frame a clause restricting the general liability of a contract of insurance to a limited liability for so much only as might not be covered by a specific insurance of part of the subject. If it was designed that in case any one of the buildings or goods in any one of the buildings of the Southwark Foundry should be insured by other underwriters whose policy might not cover the whole subject insured by these defendants, then only so much should be insured by the defendants as to cover the loss beyond the sum thus insured by others, it should have been clearly expressed. And if the defendants have left the existence of such a design doubtful by using obscure language, they <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>ought not to complain if they be held to that construction of their language which is most unfavorable to them. In regard to this condition many questions may be asked which it is impossible to answer with certainty. What is a floating policy ? Is it defined in the condition ? If so, it is a policy larger than either of those which these defendants issued, for the limits within which the goods insured by it do <em>include </em>the property insured by the defendants. Or is it a policy on goods generally, without any designation of the place where they may be ? If so, the policies of the defendants are not floating policies, for they are designatory of place. Other questions might be asked, but we are not called upon to determine what the condition does mean. It is enough if it does not exempt the defendants from a liability which would exist without it. It seems quite evident that when the defendants spoke of floating policies, they referred to some other policies than their own. They are spoken of as distinct, and it is <em>such </em>floating policies of other underwriters that are to be considered as insurance upon the property to the extent of the sound value of the subject insured — beyond the amount covered by the specific insurances thereon. We do not feel warranted, therefore, in holding that the seventh condition of the defendants’ policies confine <em>their </em>liability to the excess of loss above that covered by what are called specific insurances. The court then was not in fault in the instruction given to the jury.</p>
