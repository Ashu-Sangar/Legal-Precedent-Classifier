A statement of the trusts is not important to the understanding of the case. Dr. Wistar subsequently twice took the benefit of the insolvent laws, and after the appointment of several assignees, who were relieved from their appointment, the present accountant, in March 1852, succeeded as assignee, and all the estate of Dr. Wistar including that under the conveyance to Davis passed to him.</p>

This does not include the trouble of the accountant connected with the raising of money to pay taxes, with which to redeem the lands twice sold at treasm-er’s sale. To accomplish this he was compelled to borrow upon the street, wherever he could get the money, upon his own paper, which was renewed from time to time, making payments on account, and being subjected to protest. In addition to his other trouble, accountant twice visited Clinton county in this state, where the lands were situate, for the purpose of attending to the redemption of the property, and to the general interests of the estate connected therewith, each visit occupying nine or ten days. In this connection the fact must not be overlooked that to the accountant the estate is in a great measure, if not wholly, indebted for an increase of $2000 obtained for the land, over and above the price for which Potts had agreed to sell the same. The accountant’s connection with the Wistar assignments, of which there were three, began in 1852. The Clinton county lands were entirely unproductive; there was nothing, therefore, out of which the accountant could compensate himself during all the years intervening from 1852 to the date of the sale of the land in 1863. These facts establish, we think, a claim on the part of the accountant of an allowance beyond the 5 per cent, fixed by Mr. Townsend for these services, running through a' period of ten or eleven years, full of vexation and trouble ; these were matters of which he had no personal knowledge, and to which his testimony does not apply. If, therefore, we add a further sum of 2|- per cent., making the entire compensation 7J per cent., we think we no more than allow to the assignee his just and reasonable commissions.

Upon the facts reported, the auditor dealt lightly with the accountant, but his opportunity of judging of the whole case as it appeared before him gives weight to his conclusion that it is not a case where forfeiture should be exacted as a penalty. But he does report that the accountant kept no fair or usual account with the estate, was wanting in care in the preservation and production of the paper's and vouchers belonging to the estate, and that he claimed payment for the same sums twice in the same account, viz., a note of $570, money sent to pay taxes, and then a receipt for $473.60, paid for taxes out of this money; next a note of $714 money lent, and then for taxes $483.23, and two due-hills, $30 and $75, paid out of the same money. Under these circumstances, the court erred, we think, in adding $600 to the commissions, and that amount is therefore added to the balance found against the accountant, making it $1274.86, which he is decreed to pay, together with the costs of these appeals.</p>
