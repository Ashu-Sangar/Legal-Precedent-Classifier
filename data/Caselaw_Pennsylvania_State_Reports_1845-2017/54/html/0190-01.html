This was clearly the intention of the Miners-ville club, of which the plaintiff was a member, and to which he paid his subscription. He was drafted, and was obliged to pay $1000 for a substitute, and he now claims $300 for this substitute, which sum it is agreed must have been paid to him if he had gone himself, or to a volunteer provided for him.</p>
