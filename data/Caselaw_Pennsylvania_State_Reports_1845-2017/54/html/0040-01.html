The latter were entirely ignorant of the practice in trials by jury, and particularly in the <em>viva voce </em>examination and cross-examination of witnesses in open court, a branch of the practice requiring a thorough schooling and great practical skill and acuteness. A strong example of this occurred in the trial of the Directors of the British Bank, when the Attorney-General, Sir Richard Bethell (now Lord Westbury), the acknowledged leader of the equity bar, substituted Sir Frederick Thesiger, of the common-law bar, to perform a duty which devolved on him as representing the Crown in all criminal cases.

The nuisance complained of is not the existence of the mill, nor its immediate operation. The mill, as at present used, is not driven by the water of the stream. Its motive power is steam. The complaint is, that chemicals and other foreign and offensive matter is discharged into the stream, at the defendant’s works, of such character and in such quantity as to render the water of the stream on the lands of the complainant unfit for household uses, and for other purposes to which it was applied by the complainant. The existence of the defendant’s mill, or the discharge of dyeing materials or drugs into the stream on the defendant’s lands, constitutes no injury to the complainants if their usufructuary right to the stream is not interfered with. The defendants have a right to use the water upon their own soil in such manner as they may deem for their interest, provided they discharge it upon the soil of the complainants, in its accustomed channel, pure and unpolluted. They can, therefore, acquire no right by prescription until they show that the acts which are claimed to constitute the adverse user, injured the complainants and gave to them, or those under'whom they claim title, a right of action. The very ground of title, by adverse enjoyment, is that the party against whom it is set up has so long permitted the adverse enjoyment, and failed to vindicate his rights, that the presumption of a grant is raised. But there can be no such presumption, and, con<a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>sequently, no title by adverse enjoyment, where no violation of a right is shown to exist. Thus, where an action is brought for overflowing the plaintiff’s land by backwater from the defendants’ mill-dam, it establishes no title by adverse enjoyment to prove that the defendant’s mill has been in existence over twenty years, or that the dam has been in existence for that period. The question is not how high the dam is, but how high the water has been held, whether it has been held for twenty years so high as to affect the land of the plaintiff as injuriously as it did at the time of the action brought.</p>
