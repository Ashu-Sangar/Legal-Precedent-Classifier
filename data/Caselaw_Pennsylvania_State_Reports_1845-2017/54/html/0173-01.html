It is, however, supposed, that because Pennypaeker’s original judgment was for the purchase-money of the property, and was entered upon a bond and warrant of attorney, stating that fact, which appeared on the record, as stated by the auditor, that this is equal to a recorded mortgage, and that its lien cannot be lost, although not revived within five years. It has been assimilated to the case of an unrecorded mortgage, of <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>which a judgment-creditor had notice, but Britton’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20172" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="9 Wright 172">9 Wright 172</a>, shows clearly that mortgages have very different properties from judgments. “ They are in form defeasible sales, and in substance, grants of specific security, or interests in land for the purpose of security: Ejectment may be maintained by a mortgagee or he may hold possession on the footing of ownership, and with all its incidents.” An unrecorded mortgage with notine to a subsequent mortgagee or purchaser or judgment-creditor retains its priority, but can it be said that a bond and warrant of attorney with notice to a subsequent judgment-creditor can make the judgment entered on it afterwards a prior lien ?</p>
