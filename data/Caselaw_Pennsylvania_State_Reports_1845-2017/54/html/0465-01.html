The prayer of the petition is, that the said assignees shall be decreed to pay to the petitioner the balance in their hands, for distribution between herself, as administratrix of said William Page, and the legal representatives of Samuel Potter, if, upon an equitable settlement of the accounts of the said partners, anything shall be found to be due to the legal representatives of said Potter.</p>

The last-named sum of $179.-20 was received from the estate of Pragers &amp; Co., debtors of Potter &amp; Page. The respondents claim that the money in their hands is the property of the creditors of Potter &amp; Page, or their legal representatives, to whom the said dividends were set apart; that said creditors have never been paid, nor does any presumption of law exist of payment, and that as trustees of said creditors they are liable to them, and not to the legal representatives of Potter &amp; Page, or either of them.

Drysdale’s Appeal, 2 Harris 534, decides, that after a lapse of more than twenty years, the law will presume debts to have been paid, and the trust executed so far as respects the creditors.

The assignment having been made fifty-five years since, we think that no question can be fairly raised against the legal presumption of the payment of the creditors of Potter &amp; Page, in the absence of any proof to the contrary. The presumptions of the law are satisfied nearly three times over, and with the legal conclusions of payment thus established, why should this resulting trust not be carried into effect, and the assignors, or those who have succeeded to their rights, be put in possession of that which remains of the assigned estate ? An assignment for the benefit of creditors, has for its object the payment of the debts of' the assignor. If the debts have been paid in fact, or in law, why longer maintain a trust in the hands of the assignee which is practically a dead trust ? It is much more equitable that that which remains of the estate should revert to the assignor, than to permit a naked trustee to take to himself the perpetual enjoyment or absolute ownership of property to which he has no possible claim, except as a stakeholder, to hold until the right of ownership has been established. It is contended by the respondents that they are trustees for the creditors, to whom the dividends have been awarded, and not for the assignors, claiming that the parting of the money in the hands of the assignee, for payment to creditors on account of their demands, is such a divestiture of ownership of the assignor, and such a vesting of property in the creditor as to put an end to the relation of trustee and <em>cestui que trust, </em>between the assignor and assignee, as to the portion of the .fund so divided and set apart. But this is, we think, begging the question, nor do we concur in the proposition as above stated. It may be conceded that if dividends of assigned property are paid boná, fide after notice and without objection, such payments would be conclusive on all parties in interest. But that the mere declaration of the assignee having the exclusive control of the fund, that he awards certain portions <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>of it to persons claiming to be creditors, should operate as an effectual bar against all claims which the assignor may make to the same in the hands of the assignee, we do not assent to as a sound legal ¡proposition. Why should the assignor not be allowed to claim a return to himself of dividends if made in mistake to one not a creditor, or if he show a release of claim of the creditor, to whom a dividend had been awarded, where the question is exclusively between himself and the assignee, can the assignee in either case set up successfully in resistance of such demand, his award of the fund to be appropriated to the payment of a creditor’s claim? We think that he cannot. In Power <em>v. </em>Hollinan, cited above, the court say that after the assignment, the assignor had an interest, and if he waited for a considerable length of time, and the creditors did not proceed, he should be restored to his estate. After such a lapse of time as occurred in this case, the debts would be presumed to have been paid. The assignment was made in 1810, and the decision of the Supreme Court was reached in 1834. Judge Rogers says: ‘ That these claims would not be barred by the Act of Limitation may be admitted, but we cannot agree that lapse of time will not raise a presumption of payment. No steps were taken by the creditors in relation to the fund ; hence,’ he says, {the presumption arises that the debts have been paid, or that some satisfactory arrangement has been made by the assignor.’ The doctrine of presumptions has been held to apply as between assignees and creditors, so that lapse of time may raise the presumption of an execution of a trust, for creditors, and let in other parties, interested in the trust estate, whose rights accrue after creditors are satisfied: Mellish’s Estate, 1 Pars. 482. No length of time bars a direct trust; but to constructive trusts, as those arising by implication of law, the doctrine does not apply; Beekford <em>v. </em>Wade, 17 Yesey 97; and in Ex parte Heathfield, 8 Taunt. 408, which was under an act for the relief of insolvent debtors, an assignee having been appointed, the court, after the lapse of forty years, refused an application for the appointment of a new assignee, and for an account of the insolvent’s estate. With much greater force does a presumption of payment apply as against a single debt, of a specialty, than against a qualified or implied trust. In this case no such answer is attempted to be set up, on the contrary, the respondents admit the possession of the assigned fund, and bring into court an account stated of the same. But it is supposed that the principles laid down in Thomas Latimer’s Estate, 2 Ashmead 520, stand in the way of our making a disposition of the fund held by the respondents, such as we have suggested it would be proper for us to make. We do not so understand the ruling in Latimer’s Estate. That was an application on the part of a substituted assignee, to have awarded <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>to him certain dividends set apart to several creditors of the assignor by a former assignee, for the purpose of making payment of such dividends to the creditors to whom they had been awarded, or if unclaimed by them, for general distribution among the other creditors of the assignor. A period of thirty-one and of twenty-two years had intervened between the making of the first and second dividends and the claim of the substituted assignees. The question there was in an essential particular different from that which is raised by the petition and answer before us. Judge King states that difference with great clearness and in a very few words. He says the objection of the claim of general creditors is the simple one, that the property of one man ought not without the assent of the owner to be taken and given to another. The rights of creditors as between themselves and the assignee become fixed by a dividend made by mutual agreement, in which all have for many years acquiesced, and such dividends vest an exclusive right in each creditor as against other creditors to his ascertained proportion of the assets. From the time that dividends of an assigned estate are declared, the assignee holds them for the creditor to whom they are set apart, and in Latimer’s Estate a claim was made to give that which became primd facie the property of one creditor, by award of the assignee, to other persons who happened also to be creditors of the assignor. This is all that Judge King decided could not be done. The .question was reserved by him as to whether the creditors whose dividends remained in the hands of the assignee, could assert their right to the fund after the lapse of so many years, or whether it was barred by lapse of time, and whether the trust as to them would in law be regarded as executed. The petitioner, however, bases her application upon another ground, namely, the passage of-an Act of Assembly on the 16th day of April 1866, by the legislature of Pennsylvania, which after reciting in the preamble the fact of the fund being in the hands of the company as assignees, and that .from lapse of time the debts of Potter &amp; Page are legally presumed to have been paid, and that the legal representatives of the assignors have become entitled to said funds, enacts that said company are authorized, empowered and directed, to pay the balance of said assigned estate in their possession, to the petitioner, and to the legal representatives of Samuel Potter, if upon an adjustment of the accounts of Potter &amp; Page, anything shall be found to be due to the estate of Potter. This act of the legislature is imperative in its directions to the respondents, who by the’same authority are empowered to hold this as a trust of a like character, and is to be regarded, if of any validity whatever, in the light of a legislative command to the respondents, to hand over the trust funds in their possession to those to <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>whom, according to the recital contained in the preamble to the act, they rightfully belong.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b470-6" data-blocks='[["BL_470.6",470,[259,506,1152,897]]]'>“ In Latimer’s Estate it is said that nothing short of legislation can work such a result as was sought to be accomplished in that case, namely, to give the dividends belonging to certain creditors to other creditors of an assigned estate, which under the British bankrupt system, by Act of Parliament, was directed to be done, but such acts were prospective not retrospective in their operation. The Act of April 16th 1866 requires the performance of that which has much more of legal difficulty connected with it than acts like that of 6 Geo. 4, e. 16, § 110, which required three years to elapse before unclaimed dividends could be divided among creditors. The Act of 1866 is in the nature of a legislative decree, which attempts to adjudicate on rights that had become fixed, and therefore is to be regarded of no value in the determination of the question before us. But guided by principles which we think warrant the court in making the decree prayed for, we will be prepared on the adjustment of the accounts between Potter and Page, to make the necessary order for the entering of such decrees, and for carrying the same into effect, unless cause be hereafter shown to the contrary on a settlement of the account of the respondents, appointed assignee in the place of Paschall Hollingsworth, resigned.”</p>
