As we conceive, Taylor took this deed to keep the property for Jordan, and never evinced any other intention until he made his will on the 28th day of February 1859, devising the reversionary interest to his own children, and not until the will was made public by probate would Jordan have any notice, actual or constructive, that Taylor intended to defraud him out of his patrimony, and retain his property after his mother’s death. Until then Jordan had no right to institute proceedings to collect the money, and had no reason for applying to a court of law or equity to rescind a deed which was doing him no injury, and which he had a right to expect, would never be brought up in judgment against him.

He stayed in Pennsylvania to study medicine, and in 1838-39 undertook to attend lectures in Philadelphia, but had fallen into grossly intemperate habits, had wasted the moneys furnished him by his uncle, Edward Siter, who was his guardian, and was endeavoring to sell his expectant interest in the trust-fund created by the above deed of his father. On the 3d January 1839, Mr. Edward Siter wrote a letter to his sister, Mrs. Taylor, which brought her husband to Philadelphia to look after the boy, and he was found in the lock-up at the end of a gross debauch. Taylor took him to West Chester, and there in Mr. Lewis’s office, on the 12th January 1839, in consideration of $300 and other good causes, Jordan sold and transferred to Hiram Taylor his whole interest and expectancy in the trust-fund to accrue to him at the death of his mother, under the deed above referred to. He then went home with his step-father to Maryland, and after residing some time in his family, married and settled in Maryland, where he still continues to reside. Taylor, by his will made in 1859, devised this fund to the grandchildren of himself and wife, but after the death of his wife, in 1862, an auditor was appointed on the application of Andrew M.

Yet they did not rule the case upon these grounds, but taking all the circumstances into view they decided that the deed created the relation of trustee and <em>cestui que trust </em>between Taylor and Jordan, and they proceeded to state an account between them as such, and to decree the fund to Jordan less the proper costs and charges of the trustees.</p>

He must have affirmed or disaffirmed it. He could not repudiate and claim under it both in the same suit. And if he had gone for rescinding it, and had convinced the court that it was a catching bargain that ought not to be enforced against him, still he would have encountered that principle of equity that refuses relief to stale demands, and which requires conscience, good faith and reasonable diligence in parties complainant. In Roberts <em>v. </em>Tunstall, 4 Hare 262, the Vice-Chancellor assumed that the deed in question there might have been impeached on both grounds assumed against it if the transaction had been of recent occurrence, but on the authority of several cases refused to interpose <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>after eighteen years’ delay to sue, and declared that the principle of the decisions is that after so great delay the injured party must be held to have waived his right to relief — a principle which presupposes a right to set aside the transaction independently of that fact.</p>

He was <em>sui juris, </em>and could have sued for the rescission of his deed any time after he made it in 1839. The fact that the expectant estate was suspended, as to his right of enjoyment, upon the life of his mother, would not have prevented his clearing and protecting his title. Indeed, good faith required him to impeach Taylor’s title in his lifetime, whilst he was alive to defend it, and not to lie by till his will was made and the rights of legatees had attached. Nor was there any defect of jurisdiction, for it is shown that the courts of Maryland had full chancery powers, and our courts had them as early as 1840. And even by the Act of 16th June 1836, equity powers were conferred upon this court in the city of Philadelphia to determine “ rights of property or money claimed by two or more persons in the hands or possession of a person claiming no right of property therein.”</p>

Who shall decide that they do not establish the point ? No doubt a jury would have found the trust upon such evidence, for there is a naturalness, a verisimilitude about the facts as pointing to that conclusion which would commend them to the understandings of plain men. Taylor did just what most fathers would do to save the son’s patrimony, he took it into his own keeping, and hence a jury would almost inevitably infer he took it and kept it for the son. And if <em>taken </em>with that intent — if once fixed as trust, his subsequent act in devising it to his grandchildren could not divest him of his liability as trustee, nor Jordan of his rights as a <em>cestui que trust.</em>

Can we say there was no evidence to lead rational minds to the conviction of a trust ? Upon our avowed principles of judging can we say <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>there was flagrant mistake in this finding ? All primfi facie presumptions are in favor of the decree. Who alleges error must prove it. The auditor and the judge placed themselves upon all the circumstances, they overlooked nóne, they extenuated none, distorted none, and they wrote down what the voice of those circumstances spoke to their ears. Where is the evidence that proves their mistake ? It is to be found only in the unqualified terms of the deed, but if an unqualified grant was necessary to the preservation of the estate, that circumstance is accounted for. Whatever the favor with which a deed from a son to a step-father should be viewed as a family arrangement, it surely ought to have only the operation intended by the parties, and what the parties intended is the general question in the case, which having been found as it has been, we see no grounds upon which we can reverse the finding. We take the record as establishing a matter of fact, upon adequate evidence, and no hesitating doubts of ours as to-the existence of that fact can prevail against such a record.</p>
    <p id="b485-6" data-blocks='[["BL_485.6",485,[186,1155,1153,643]]]'>The trust being found, the imputed laches go for nothing, because the time to call for its execution could not arrive till the mother’s death. If it be said that Taylor’s will was notice to Jordan of an adverse claim to his estate, there were only three years between the date of the will and the institution of proceedings to recover the estate, and no actual disposition of it during that interval under the will, for the life estate did not fall in till 1862. There was nothing in this delay to postpone Jordan’s right. Indeed the moment the trust is established the principles alluded to in the early part of this opinion as to backwardness in asserting rights in equity have no such application, as they would have to a question of rescission of the deed. It is not for the trustee to complain that his <em>cestui que trust </em>was not more vigilant, especially in view of the promptness with which he acted when the life estate had expired.</p>
    <p id="b485-7" data-blocks='[["BL_485.7",485,[190,1799,1149,204]]]'>What remains of this case relates to the figures of the account. We think the auditor gave satisfactory reasons for not making larger allowances to Taylor, and that the court gave good reasons for the modifications they made in the auditor’s statement of the account.</p>
