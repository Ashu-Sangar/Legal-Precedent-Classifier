It appears on its face to be an absolute mortgage in the common form to secure money loaned, as if the said Sarah Kean had loaned me, or I had, at some time or in some way, owed the said Kean the sum of $800. Yet such, in fact, is not the truth; the <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>said mortgage was not given to secure any indebtedness whatever existing, at any time, between me and the said Sarah Kean, as none whatever, of any kind or at any time, existed. That the said Sarah Kean never did, nor did any person for her, ever give me, or any other person, any value or forbearance in any shape or form for the said mortgage. I never owed the said Sarah Kean the value of a cent in money, duty, service or other valuable thing of any kind or description. That I gave the mortgage, however, is nevertheless true; but, under the circumstances, as follows: At the date of said mortgage I resided with my father, the late John Stoddart, Esq. I resided with him all my life, until his death, which took place January 23d 1857. I always loved my father with an intensity of afféction, and his influence over me was of a nature so powerful that I never ventured to decline doing anything he desired me to do. I trusted in him with unreserved confidence and obedience. About the time of the date of the mortgage my father called me to him, at home, and told me he wanted me to give Sarah Kean a mortgage on my house in Logan street. He was then very old, and his mind seemed troubled and uneasy. He said something might be coming to Sarah Kean from the estate of Mary Harman; that she might have left her something, and he was anxious to secure her in getting it, if such was the case; and he wanted me to give the mortgage for that purpose and for nothing else. The impression it made on my mind, and as I understood it, was, that Mary Harman had left Sarah Kean something by will, and that father was anxious, for some reason, to help or secure her in getting it, and wanted me to give the mortgage for that purpose. The fact is, Mary Harman died intestate, in this county, in 1849, but I did not know that fact till quite recently. I had never given a mortgage before, nor have I ever given one since. I did not know what a mortgage was, nor the effect of it. I did not read the mortgage, nor was it read to me. I did not presume to question his motive in asking me to give the mortgage, nor do I now. I was too anxious to gratify him in all things, believing then, as I believe now, that he had a proper motive, at that time, in -asking me to give the mortgage. I gave it to him without hesitation, in pursuance of his'request, without questioning him about it, and entirely and solely on the information he thus gave me, and without any consideration whatever other than his mere request. I did not receive a particle of value or benefit, or forbearance for myself or for any other person, from any person for the said mortgage. After the mortgage was signed my father took it. I did not know what he did with it. I did not deliver it to Sarah Kean; he may have done so. I had never had a word with her on the subject, nor was she present at any time with us. I did not know her in the matter; I did it all for my <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>father, and for him only. It is now about seventeen years since the death of said Mary Harman, and during all the time that has elapsed neither the said Sarah Kean in her lifetime, nor her legal representatives since her death, have taken any proceeding, legal or otherwise, to ascertain whether the said Sarah Kean had any interest in the estate of said Mary Harman. I am informed and believe that the said Mary Harman left no property whatever in which the said Sarah Kean had any interest, and that said Sarah Kean was neither heir, next of kin nor creditor of said Mary Harman, nor in any way interested in her estate. I now aver, that said mortgage was given on my father’s mistake, in supposing that said Kean had an interest in the estate of said Harman, which could be secured by the said mortgage. I am advised by my counsel that the mortgage was at most cautionary only, and that if any consideration ever existed for it, the same has utterly and entirely failed, and will have failed until said plaintiff shall have established the fact that said Kean had an interest in the estate of said Harman, to be secured by said mortgage.”</p>
