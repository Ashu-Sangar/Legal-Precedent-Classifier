These were bills in equity, the first by the trustees in a corporation mortgage, asking us to decree a sale of the mortgaged premises which they had power to make without our decree ; the other, a suit by bondholders to compel the trustees to sell the premises for non-payment of interest on the bonds. We declined jurisdiction in both cases, in Ashurst’s, because our equity powers did not extend to such a case as the bill presented; in.Bradley’s, because no part of the principal debt was due, and no power of sale was contained in the mortgage for failure to pay interest, but another and independent remedy for that default. The defect of jurisdiction pointed out in Ashurst’s case has since been remedied by statute, but what had the ruling in either of these cases to do with an action at law upon the <em>bond </em>of the corporation ? This was an action of debt on bonds, and if there was a breach of condition, the fact that a mortgage had been given as security for the debt with trusts and covenants, which a court of equity would control and enforce in a proper case, afforded not a shadow of defence. The bond was the principal debt, the mortgage the incidental security. Remedies peculiar to each exist, both in law and equity, but they do not clash and destroy each other, they co-exist.</p>
