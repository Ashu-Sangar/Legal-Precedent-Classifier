Mr. and Mrs. Boyd lived in this city during that summer, he getting his meals at Bloodgood’s Hotel, but passing <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>the nights with his wife at her brother’s house, where she then boarded. In November 1859, he again went to Cuba, leaving her and her son here, with orders upon his agents here for the means of her support. In July 1860, he returned to this city and very shortly after this a difficulty arose between him and his wife which must have been of a serious character, as during that summer he did not sleep at the house where his wife boarded, and on the 7th of November 1860, a deed of separation was executed by them and a trustee appointed.</p>
    <p id="b115-5" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[214,819,1152,472]]]'>This instrument in its recital speaks of “ domestic confidence and reciprocal affections existing no more,” and all its provisions look to an entire and permanent separation of the husband and wife, and a permanent provision for the wife, by the conveyance of certain real and personal estate to the trustee absolutely. There is also the usual provision for her living separate and apart as if she were a <em>feme sole, </em>and that he shall not visit her without her consent. He is not to be liable for her debts, or for alimony, and she covenants not to claim any right or title to any real or personal estate of which said Isaac Boyd may be seised or possessed, or any part thereof.</p>
    <p id="b115-6" data-blocks='[["BL_115.6",115,[214,1292,1152,258]]]'>On the 25th May 1861, her brother, William Murray, became the trustee in this deed in the place of Mr. Eardman. A correspondence took place between Mr. and Mrs. Boyd between the execution of the deed and the substitution of her brother as her trustee, commenced by her, but which has no effect upon the questions in this ease.</p>
    <p id="b115-7" data-blocks='[["BL_115.7",115,[213,1549,1155,899]]]'>It appears that from the 7th of November 1860 until his death, in August 1863, he was only three or four times at Mr. Murray’s [house], where his wife lived, and not at all in 1863. There is an effort, however, to show a reconciliation in 1861, based upon his passing one night in his wife’s room at her brother’s house. The evidence as to the time when this took place, whether before or after the deed of separation, is neither clear nor satisfactory. The auditor says, “ After the execution of the articles of separation, it does not appear that he saw his wife for a period of six weeks; in fact it is not clear that he saw her until after his return from Cuba, a period of over six months, and only three or four times in all after their execution. The real difficulty in the case, both of fact and of law, arises upon the second point. The evidence shows that the testator visited his wife once or twice each year after the separation, except the year 1863, in which he died'; also that he corresponded with her several times, the last letter dated May 1st 1861; also that he passed one night in her chamber after the execution of the articles of separation. The evidence of this, however, is not as positive as might be. Do these acts, without more, constitute in law a violation of the articles of separation ?”</p>

    <p id="b116-6" data-blocks='[["BL_116.6",116,[288,599,1151,470]]]'>“ With the consent of his wife, the testator could commit any of the acts proven against him and not violate the covenants just quoted. There is no evidence whatever that she objected to any of said acts, or that the slightest coercion was used by the testator,. Her consent can fairly be inferred. Mr. Gowen appealed to the doctrine of reconciliation in support of the position that the articles of separation were abrogated, but upon an examination of the numerous authorities cited, I am satisfied that a manifest intention of the parties to live together again as man and wife must be shown, and the evidence in this case does not show any such intention.”</p>
    <p id="b116-7" data-blocks='[["BL_116.7",116,[287,1069,1151,634]]]'>This is a correct statement of the law ; and the conduct of both parties shows clearly there was no reconciliation, and no determination or wish or desire to live together again as man and wife. The wife acted under the deed of separation, and has always received the income of the real estate and all the personal estate up to the present time. The theory of reconciliation, waiver or abandonment, would have invalidated this deed, but she has never evinced any wish or intention to act upon this view of the question. So, after seeing her husband but three or four times in two years, she never sees him at all during the year in which he died. She believed the separation was complete and the deed inviolate, and it is clear the testator so thought and acted. The acts of both parties showed that both believed they were as completely separated as two persons could be who were still in strict law man and wife.</p>
