If she accepts this provision made for her, she cannot be heard to assert a claim repugnant to the terms of the very will from which she derives a benefit, and until she makes her election, how are we to know what her purpose in this regard is ? She cannot accept this legacy of two thousand five hundred dollars, and then contest the validity of the will with respect to the bonds. It is only by putting herself in opposition to the entire will, so far as her own interests are concerned, that she can have any standing to contest any part of it. If she takes under the will, she takes whatever benefits it confers, along with all the disadvantages which may result. If, on the other hand, she takes against the will, in such case, she is not concluded by any of its terms.

The contest was with the widow, and with her only, and it related to the disposition which the testator had made of his estate.

In this finding the learned court below has concurred, and has confirmed the auditor’s report.

In 1861, the mother and sisters of the decedent by a deed dated March 20, 1861, formally conveyed to him the fee-simple title of all of them to this farm containing one hundred and thirteen acres or thereabouts. This deed was given in evidence by the appellant, and it recited an agreement between the widow and heirs of Jacob Eshelman, deceased, that John Eshelman, one of them, should take the farm at twelve thousand dollars, deducting therefrom two sums of $705.61 and $2,884.79§, respectively, charged on the land in favor of the widows of John Moltz and Jacob Moltz. One third of the balance of said valuation money was to be charged on the land for the use of the widow of Jacob Eshelman, during her life, and the principal to be paid at her death. The deed further recited that, in consideration of the payment of $799.58 to each of his sisters, and of the further sum of $2,808.20 at the death of their mother, the land was conveyed to John Eshelman. The deed contained the usual acknowledgment of the receipt of $799.58 paid to each of the sisters, and a release of all claims by the widow and sisters to the land. A release was also given in evidence dated Juno 16, 1866, after the death of the widow, of all claims to the sum of $400.46, being the share of each in the dower charge of the widow, who had then died. There was no proof of the actual payment of any money at the time the deed and release were given, and outside the testimony of the interested witnesses, which is rejected from the present consideration, there is no proof of the actual payment of any of the money due the sisters at any time. There is no question of the statute of limitations, or the presumption of payment, arising in the cause, because the decedent, in the most solemn and absolute manner possible, not only admitted and acknowledged his indebtedness to his sisters, but he expressly declared in his will the fact of <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>his indebtedness to each of them, stated the amount due to each, and positively directed his executor to pay the several amounts mentioned to each of them within two years after his death; and, in addition to this, he formally executed bonds to each of his sisters for the amounts due to them, respectively, payable on April 1,1888, with two per cent annual interest, and directed his executor to deliver the bonds after his death.</p>

I said, ‘ I guess not.’ Then he said, ‘ I have easy terms to buy it.’ He said the agreement between him and his sisters was that they were to leave their shares in the farm. He told me they were getting equal shares; that he was to pay them what he got. That was all at that time.....He told me once or twice while I lived on the little farm, when we settled, that he was getting in his money to pay off his sisters’ interest; and he told me once or twice afterwards, when he got money from me, that he wanted it for <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>that purpose. This last conversation was four or five years after I had gone off the little farm.” Jacob C. Wolf, a brother of John Eshelman’s first wife, said: “ Several times I had conversation with John Eshelman about owing his sisters, in 1881 and 1882 and thereabouts. He had my money, borrowed money from me; and at first I was not particular about a judgment note or anything of that kind, and after it got up a little way 1 told him I would like to have a judgment note. He said he would not give a judgment note to any person. He said he had money from other people, and he said he had his sisters’ money, and they had no notes, and he said, if his word was no good, paper was no good. The last time he spoke to me about this was in 1883.....He said he owed his sisters, and had their money without notes.” Mrs. Catharine Bixler said: “I had a conversation with John and his wife. She said when she wanted to have anything fixed up in the house he said, wait until he has the sisters paid out, then he will live, too, like others. . . . The conversation was about ten years ago,” (1878.) Jacob Stouffer said: “In March, 1883, John Eshelman and I were going to the bank at Harrisburg. I indorsed for John. Coming home he got to telling me in regard to his confidence in regard with his sisters. He also told me that when he settled up his pappy’s estate that his sisters gave a release without any papers, and he told me that he wanted to use a part of this money for some of the sisters.....He told me he would sell the large farm, and pay off his sisters.” As John Eshelman died in October, 1885, this conversation occurred about two years before his death. David Eichelberger said : “ When we butchered at Lantz’s, I talked to him about fixing up his farm. I was there, Mr. Lantz, and John Eshelman. He (John) came there during the day. I asked why he did not fix up his buildings ; that they would sell better. , He said he owed his sisters too much money; he couldn’t fix it.”</p>

It was very evident that he was in the habit of borrowing money, and had use for it constantly. He owed a number of notes for quite considerable amounts at the time of his death, and the presumption of payment of his debts to his sisters is thereby much weakened. Against the manifest weight of the testimony on this subject, his declaration to the scrivener, that he did not owe his sisters, is of but little consequence. He might not have desired to admit the fact of so much indebtedness to one who is not shown to have been upon any particular" terms of intimacy with him.

The auditor has found that the bonds were given for full consideration, and no error in that finding has been clearly shown.
