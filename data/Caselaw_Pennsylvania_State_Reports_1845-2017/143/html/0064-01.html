The party had supper, and both before and after there was much drinking. McManus, the prisoner, called early in the evening. The party became noisy, to such an extent that Cora Campbell said she would leave. McManus persuaded her to go to his rooms at 419 Lombard street, about two blocks away, where he lived with a mistress, Amanda Cross. The prisoner, as he and witnesses in his behalf testified, had been drinking for several days, and had joined in the drinking at Cora Campbell’s place. After reaching his rooms, he and Cora Campbell and Amanda Cross had more beer. In a short time, Cora Campbell became uneasy about the party of men and the noise at her house, and at her suggestion the prisoner went with a message to one of the inmates. The prisoner not returning to his own home in a reasonable time, Amanda Cross, at the suggestion of Cora Campbell, went after him. She rapped at the Stampers street house, called the prisoner out, and, telling him that Cora Campbell was sick, they started for their own home. This was a little before nine o’clock.</p>

On reaching their home, they found Cora Campbell lying on the floor, sick, when the prisoner gave her a drink of the whiskey, and, as was stated, drank the rest himself. He then took off his coat, shoes and stockings, threw himself on the bed, and fell asleep. He was aroused afterward, Cora Campbell insisting that either he or Amanda Cross should <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>accompany her to her house. The prisoner slipped on a pair of cloth house-shoes, and without stockings, hat or coat, went with her. Amanda Cross went also, but apparently without his knowledge. They reached the house of Cora Campbell about ten o’clock. There the prisoner had more beer, and turning about discovered Amanda Cross, and said to her “ Get out of here; go home.” The prisoner and Amanda Cross left about the same time. The testimony of the commonwealth tended to show that McGinnis then went out also, but may have gone out at another door. At all events, in a few moments, as the commonwealth’s testimony tended to show, the prisoner, with his shoes in his hand, came up with McGinnis and Amanda Cross at the corner of Third street, where they had an altercation. McGinnis knocked the prisoner down. Amanda Cross helped him up, and then fled. Immediately afterward the prisoner fired two shots at McGinnis, one of which killed him.</p>

To this he responded kindly and sensibly and reasonably, — let it make either in his favor or against him that he obeyed such a summons, and proceeded down Third street as far as Lombard [where he bethought himself that there might, in view of the condition of the person at his home, be need of a little whiskey for this woman, as I understand it.]3 He, accordingly, went to the nearest place and bought a half pint of whiskey, which he took to the house, found Cora very sick, and as soon, I suppose, as she was in a condition to swallow, gave her some of the whiskey, and, as Amanda Cross says, drank the rest.</p>

Cora Campbell went in first; McManus followed, but when Amanda Cross attempted to enter, according to her own statement and the statement of Troyard, she did not get further than the door, for McManus barred the way and peremptorily told her to return home. It seems, however, that he either did not immediately accompany her, or that she did not immediately obey, for he found time to take another half tumbler of beer, which was given him by Cora Campbell. He then went out of the side door into the yard, where Amanda had preceded him, and we have no direct proof of where they went afterwards, or when. I did not quite understand whether the side door of the house led into a small <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>alley between the barber shop and that house, but it seems that the door opened into a yard.</p>

Some of the witnesses in the house, one at any rate, said that McGinnis went out with them, all three talking together, and so the defendant declares, and so says Amanda Cross; but Troyard, who seemed to me to be a very truthful, consistent and fair witness, declared positively that McGinnis was not in that room, and did not go out with them, but was in the front room, and if he did go out did not go through the yard, he, Troyard, having been, if I recollect aright, at the steps into the yard for some little time. I am not sure about that; but, at all events, his testimony is that McGinnis did not come out of that room or go out into the side yard.</p>

Agreeably to the commonwealth’s evidence, Amanda is found alone in Third street immediately after this occurrence; I mean to say, without McManus. She was. found on Third street with a man in her company, who was McGinnis, he being within the line of view. This is all for the jury, and I merely state what the witnesses said on either side, and what seem to be the necessary inferences; and it is for the jury to say whether they believe the witnesses who state those facts, and whether they draw the inferences which those facts seem to warrant. Amanda is found on Third street, some thirty or forty feet from the corner, in company with McGinnis, McMapus not being there; and they were talking pleasantly enough, except that, according to Mannen’s statement, who overheard the conversation, or something of it rather, — he did not hear all, as they were talking in rather a low tone, — he said, “ You are a liar.” Mannen opened the window to listen, and they then moved further towards Stampers street, from which they were not separated by any great distance, probably by some sixty feet, and moved on and on until they came to the pavement of, as it is called, the candy store, which was in the same house as the barber shop, and finally reached a large tree on the curbstone in front of the barber shop, and still proceeding further, went northward along the line of Third street until they <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>came within three feet of Stampers alley or Stampers street, which, you recollect, continued to be Stampers street after it crossed the line of the pavement of Third street, so that Stampers street had a right to this corner, small street though it was, as much as Third street. There was a corner there; so it might be called the corner of Stampers street, as it might be called the corner of Third street, as that corner was one and the same corner. The cartway of Stampers street traversed the pavement of Third street, and reached the point which was the corner of both streets, the comer where both streets met. There, says Mannen, they disappeared from his view, and the next thing he saw was the woman going up Third street, when she came into sight again, and also McManus coming upon the scene, and also McGinnis who had re-appeared. That is to say, Mannen did not say he re-appeared, but he says in the course of his examination that he went out of view, and that he was again in view.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b95-5" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[195,1252,1173,660]]]'>Now, it is easy to perceive that McManus might have shifted his position a little during the time that intervened, when Mannen speaks of having seen him, and the time when Mannen speaks of his having re-appeared, because during that time occurred the flight of Amanda and the high words which led to the shooting, and his departure after Amanda and his return. So that, on that small pavement, twelve feet wide by five or six in length across, these men no doubt shifted their position this way and that. He saw then McGinnis on this pavement and he saw McManus on this pavement, and he saw McManus fire at McGinnis and he saw McGinnis retreat a few feet until coming behind the line of the houses he spoke of, he could no longer be seen, and there his testimony closed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b95-6" data-blocks='[["BL_95.5",95,[198,1919,1174,503]],["BL_96.1",96,[269,387,1171,441]]]'>Now, as it seems to me, in proof of this there is a cotemporaneous witness, the barber Koch, who, chronologically, comes next to the front. He heard the loud words, the angry words between McManus and McGinnis, of which we have no definite account, which aroused his interest, and he climbed on the hydrant and looked over the fence, and there he saw McManus and McGinnis ; McGinnis, as he says, on the southeast corner, and McManus on the northeast corner. He, Koch, says on the southeast comer of Stampers alley, and McManus on the northeast comer of Third street; but the southeast comer of <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>Stampers alley, as I have already said, is also the corner of Third street, because the two streets coincide there and form an angle. He therefore places definitely McManus on the north side of the street, and McGinnis on the south side of the street, with the alley between them, or the street between them; I mean Stampers street; except that McManus by this time was leaving McGinnis and going across the street to the north, with the design of proceeding up Third street towards Pine.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b96-6" data-blocks='[["BL_96.4",96,[268,847,1177,1629]]]'>Now, it is said that there is there a material discrepancy between Mannen’s statement and Koch’s statement. It is certain that in many respects they coincide. They coincide that Mc-Manus and McGinnis were there together; visible or invisible, Mannen is not wrong when he says that McManus and Mc-Ginnis were there together. They do not differ in Amanda being with McGinnis, and they agree as to the shots, which is a capital fact, though of course not necessarily conclusive; that they were fired by McManus at McGinnis, and that the result was the infliction of the wound which appears to have been mortal. But it is said that they differ as to place, and that they differ as to the- possibility of McGinnis being where he could be seen by Mannen at the time of the shooting. At first, I was inclined to think that such must be the case. It is for the jury to say whether it is so or not. But when I came to look closely at the evidence and to see that Mannen places Amanda and Mc-Ginnis three feet from Stampers alley, from the corner of Stampers alley and Third street, and that what Koch says is that it was on bis corner, it did not appear to me that that was necessarily a contradiction, because the corner from his point of view was Stampers street, and from the other man’s point of view it would be Third street, but those two corners would be one and the same place. And, though it is true that when McGinnis fell, retreating to this position, falling back, he was three feet, half the length of a man or a little more than half the length of a man inside of Stampers street, yet it might still be that when he was shot at he was sufficiently far out, half way across twelve feet, or nine feet from where he finally lay, and so within the view of Mannen. The jury will judge whether those statements corroborate or contradict each other. As to some of the points I think it is not denied that there is corroboration and agreement.] 4</p>

When Koch first looked out, McManus, who had apparently been on the same side of the street as McGinnis,—and I believe it is not denied that they were there,—was crossing the alley to go away. Koch had heard the woman scream, and we know from another witness that this woman was Amanda, and that she fled—“ flew wildly,” to use Mr. Naulty’s words, up the street, as if afraid of being pursued, and we know from Naulty, as well as from Koch, that McManus made a move after her; before he got half across the street, more than half across the street, with this purpose apparently in his mind, he is accosted by McGinnis, who says to him, you recollect the words, “ Come back to me, Johnny;” “Come back to me, Johnny,” andas McManus still went away, “ Damn it, J ohnny, come back to me ; ” and then McManus halted and wheeled around, and did come back to McGinnis. Why he did I do not know. It may be simply because McGinnis asked him; it may be because he saw that Amanda had gone too far to be easily overtaken; it may be because—and little things will sometimes determine a man <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>even at critical moments — because he was in his bare feet, and it was not pleasant on that February night to run at anything like speed up the street without shoes and stockings. From whatever cause, he did turn around and go back towards McGinnis, and that in no very pleasant frame of mind, for the first words he spoke were words of great bitterness when viewed in the light of what followed. He said, “You will fool with my girl, will you ? ” [and repeated the remark, thus showing the motive that was actuating him, the motive being, apparently, jealousy of this woman with whom he lived, and that he believed McGinnis was, or was endeavoring to be, too intimate with her.]6 Then followed the threat, or, what was something more than a threat, for, as the result showed, it was the declaration of a purpose, “ I will settle you,” or “ I will fix you,” and then finally came the shot, which may or may not have taken effect, and the second shot. But, whether the first had taken effect or not, it showed that the purpose with which he shot was persistent, and gave emphasis to the natural inference that in shooting he meant to kill. These shots were both seen from up the street by Mr. Naulty, and I believe there is no denial of them, nor would it be easy to contest the natural inference to be drawn from that of a persistent intention to take life.....</p>

And, finally, manslaughter, as I have already told you, is the taking of human life where, owing to the provocation arising, and the hot blood produced, the presumption of malice is repudiated, and the man is supposed to be acting under the influence of passion, which temporarily displaces his judgment and leaves him a mere slave of impulse, and where, though still criminal, he is not to be taxed with murder.</p>

The accused must have formed the design to take life before firing the shot which caused death. I speak of the ease before you. It is not, however, requisite that the homicidal purpose shall have existed for weeks, for days, or even for hours before it was carried into effect. If a man resolves to take life, and accomplishes the design with a blow or pistol shot, he may be a murderer in the first degree, however brief the interval between the resolve and the act by which it is carried into effect. It has been justly said that thought is swift, and that a vindictive man may require little time to form a design to take life, and less to execute his purpose. But it is also true that the shortness of the time is an argument against premeditation, and should be considered in determining whether the crime was premeditated. I will add to this one other principle, and then I think I shall have covered the ground; and that is, while taking life with a deadly weapon is evidence of an intent to kill, and gives rise to the natural inference that the man designed to accomplish the act, it is not enough to constitute murder in the first degree, unless there are other circumstances in the case besides <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>the mere act of killing, to justify the belief that the intent to kill was premeditated and deliberate.

But, taking Mc-Manus’s account of what he drank on election day, I would not suppose that there could be much difficulty as to which category he should be placed in, for he said that on that day six boxes of beer, containing two dozen bottles each, one hundred and forty-four bottles in all, had been disposed of in a few hours by himself and seven or eight others. When further interrogated he said twelve or fourteen. He finally said, as I recollect, between eight and fourteen; he declined, however, to be at all precise. He said this had not interfered with his electioneering or disturbed materially his head; that he drank afterwards in various places in the Fifth ward, and finally wound up at another club; and when asked as to the effect upon himself, as I understood his answer, either then or at any other time, he said as to that time that he was intoxicated, and avoided the use of the word “ drunk.” He did not say, what easily might have been said, that he was carried home, or could not walk home, or that he was in the condition that such an enormous quantity of liquor might be supposed to produce.

I have no doubt that he was under the influence of liquor more or less; perhaps that might be true of many evenings in his life, some we certainly know; but whether he was in the full sense of the term “ drunk,” and so drunk that his mind was no longer capable of acting consciously or regulating the actions of his body; whether anything which he did amiss, and he certainly did a deed that was amiss, was due to a disorder of the mind produced by liquor or was produced by his own vindictiveness arising under what he felt as gross provocation, — that seems to me to be a test which the jury may fairly apply and one of which he could not complain.

The theory of the commonwealth was that the killing was done from jealousy; and under these circumstances, the conduct of the prisoner an hour previous, in putting a pistol to her head, had a bearing on his state of mind towards her, and therefore, on the existence of the supposed motive for the killing. For such purpose it was clearly admissible.</p>

The evidence as to the history of the transaction was, as the learned judge said, at first harmonious, then divergent, and finally contradictory. The jury, as has been often said, were bound to reconcile the discrepancies, if it could reasonably be done; and the judge aided them in the performance of that duty by a review of the evidence in general terms and with substantial accuracy, making suggestions fairly warranted by the evidence, to show the jury how it might be reconciled in some parts, and the difficulty of doing so in others. Nothing but hypercriticism can find any error in this part of the charge.</p>

However accurately and carefully stated in their connection and applied to the case under discussion, they may, when taken as detached sentences and applied to different circumstances, convey erroneous ideas, especially to unlearned jurors. For example, the prisoner’s fourth point was that “Before the jury, in this case, can convict of murder of-the first degree, they must find that the prisoner acted upon as clear and premeditated a motive as he who kills by poison or by lying in wait.” This is said to be taken from the language of this court, though the case is not given, which is a very unsatisfactory mode of citing authority. It may be there are cases in which this would be a correct statement of the law; but, separated from its context and applied to the present case of shooting at a street corner, and answered by a simple affirmation, it would be dangerously liable to convey to the jury the idea that a prolonged premeditation, such as is necessarily involved in killing by poison or lying in wait, was essential to the case they had in hand. The learned judge told the jury that the design and the resolve to. kill must be formed before the shot was fired; that no specific time was requisite to make premeditation; the time might be short, but that shortness of time was an argument against premeditation; and that the jury must be satisfied from the evidence that premeditation and the deliberate intent were there, not merely when the shot was fired, but were there previously. This was all the prisoner was entitled to ask. He had no right to dictate the language of the- court. To convey the proper idea to the jury, language often must vary with the circumstances of the particular case. Neither under the act of March 31, 1860, or otherwise, has the prisoner a right to have answers to his points in any set form. <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>The statute, § 58, provides that “ it shall be the duty of the court to answer the same fully; ” and this is the measure, not only of the court’s duty, but of the prisoner’s right.

This was an accurate and carefully considered answer to the point, and is entirely in harmony with Kane v.

That is to say, in the language of the constitution, they were to determine “ the law and the facts, as in other cases,” under the advice and direction of the court; they were to look to the court for the best evidence of the law, just as they look to the witnesses for the best evidence of the facts. Thus interpreted and thus administered, this seeming paradox in our criminal law becomes intelligible. A judge who instructs a jury, in a criminal case, that they may disregard the law as laid down by the court, errs as widely as the judge who gives them a binding instruction upon the law. It is the duty of the jury to take the best evidence of the law, as it is to take the best evidence of the facts. When they refuse to do either, they disregard their duty and their oaths.</p>

The point should in my opinion, have been answered with an unqualified negative. The jury are not judges of the law in any case, civil or criminal. Neither at common law, nor under the constitution of Pennsylvania, is the determination of the law any part of their duty or their right. The notion is of modern growth, and arises undoubtedly from a perversion of the history and results of the celebrated contest over the right to return a general verdict, especially in cases of libel, which ended in Fox’s Bill, 32 Geo. III., c. 60.</p>

But the distinction between questions of law and fact, and the tribunals for their decision respectively, lies at the foundation of our juridical system, and there was no time when it did not exist. The rule, ad questionem facti non respondent judiees, ad questionem juris non. respondent juratores, was an ancient maxim in the days of Coke: Coke Litt., 155 a; 8 Rep. 155 a; 9 Rep. 13 a; and Mr. Bigelow, treating of the class of cases raising questions of law, or some question of fact properly belonging to the court to decide, quotes the case of the Archbishop of Canterbury v. Abbot of Battel Abbey, 1 Rotul. 143, tempore Stephen, which “ turned upon a question of law, and was decided (without appointment of a trial term) just as a modern case of the kind would be decided, by a submission of the point of law in the question to the determination of the court, and not to some test imposed by the parties: ” Hist, of Procedure <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>in England during the Norman Period, by M. M. Bigelow, р. 286. Nor was there any distinction in respect to the merely incidental way in which juries passed upon matters of law, between civil and criminal cases. They might return a general or a special verdict in either, but they early sought to escape the obligation of giving a general verdict, because it subjected them to the risk of an attaint; and Coke says, “ Some justices did rule over the recognitors to give a precise or direct verdict without finding the special matter: ” 2 Coke Inst., 422. To relieve juries from this burden, the statute of Westminster 2d, с. 30, enacted: “ Quod Justieiarii ad assisas capiend’ assignati, non compellant juratores dicere prsecise si sit disseisina vel non, d-ummodo dicere voluorint veritatem facti, et petere aux-ilium Justic.; ” and, commenting upon this section, Coke says, “ In the end it hath been resolved that in all actions, real, personal and mixed, and upon all issues joined, general or special, the jury might find the matter of fact pertinent,.....and thereupon pray the discretion of the court for the law; and this the jurors might do at the common law, not only in cases between party and party, whereof this Act putteth an example of the Assise, but also in pleas of the crown: ” 2 Coke Inst., 425.</p>

The period of transition was long and changes slow. It was clearly and justly felt that juries, as judges of the law in any but an incidental way, were an anomaly in the system, and perhaps those who endeavored to do away with it claimed too much. Safety was thought to reside in the retention by jirries of the right to give general verdicts. In view of the constant and notorious failure of justice in certain classes of cases, by the occasional perversity and the frequent cowardice of juries, <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>it may be doubted whether it would not have produced better results to have enlarged the power of judges to compel special verdicts.

The alleged libel being in writing, its terms were not in dispute and naturally fell to the court to pass upon, as other writings did; and the intent, libellous or otherwise, being claimed as a legal inference, there was nothing left in dispute but the fact of publication and the truth of the innuendo. Accordingly, the juries in the Dean of St. Asaph’s Case, and the King v. Withers, 3 Term R. 428, were confined to these two points; and it was to counteract these rulings of Buller and Mansfield and Kenyon, (though it cannot be disputed that they were in accordance with long settled practice,) and to secure, in libel as in other cases, the right of the jury to find a general verdict upon the whole matter in issue, that the act of 32 Geo. III., c. 60, was passed. The text of that famous statute is worth quoting to show how little foundation it affords for the superstructure that is sought to be built upon it.

Section seven of article IX., relating to" liberty of the press, was originally reported to the convention by the committee to draft a proposed constitution, on December 21, 1789, in the following form: “ That the printing presses shall be free to every person who undertakes to examine the proceedings of the legislature, or any branch of government, 'and no law shall ever be made restraining the right thereof. The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the most invaluable rights of man, and every citizen may freely speak, write and print, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty: ” Proceedings of the Convention, p. 162, Harrisburg, 1825. This was reported from committee of the whole, on February 5, 1790, in the same form (dropping only the word “most” before the word “invaluable”), but with the addition: “But upon indictments for the publication of papers investigating the conduct of individuals in their public capacity, or of those applying or canvassing for office, the truth of the facts may be given in evidence in justification upon the general issue: ” Idem, 174. On February 22d, this section being under consideration, Mr. Addison offered, as a substitute for the sentence last quoted, “ In prosecutions for libels, their truth or design may he given in evidence on the general issue, and their nature and tendency, whether proper for public information or only for private ridicule or malice, be determined by the jury.” To this an amendment, offered by Mr. McKean, to add “ under the directions of the court as in other cases ” was adopted almost unanimously, the vote being fifty-six to three, but the substitute itself received a bare majority, thirty-two to twenty-seven; the strong minority being in favor of restricting the truth as a justification, to cases of publications upon the conduct of persons in their public capacity, or of candidates for office: Idem, 220-222.

No such possible construction seems to have been apprehended until suggested by McKean, and the practically unanimous vote on his motion to add “under the direction of the court as in other cases,” shows the feeling of the convention on this subject. McKean was at that time one of the foremost personages of the commonwealth, perhaps its best trained lawyer. He had studied in the Temple, and was familiar with the details of the legal controversy between Buller and Mansfield, on the one side, and Erskine, on the other, before Fox took it up as a matter of politics; and he knew, as Lewis and Wilson and Ross and Sitgreaves and Addison and Findley and other leaders of the convention knew, that the contest was not for any control by the jury as judges of the law, — even Junius hardly ventured to put his denunciations of Mansfield in that form, — but for the right of applying the law to the facts and pronouncing the result by a general verdict. And such was the understanding of the convention, as it was of parliament two years later, and such the natural meaning of the language on which they finally settled to express their purpose. It puts beyond question the right to return a general verdict, nothing more. To cut the sentence <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>in two, and say the jury are “ to determine the law,” is not only to pervert the meaning, but to nullify the other command that they are to determine “ under the direction of the court.” What- they are to determine is, “ the law and the facts as in other cases,” that is, the law as given to them by the court, and the facts as shown by the evidence. They are bound to take the law from the court; but, so taking it, they have the right to apply it to the facts as they may find them to be proved, and to announce the result of the whole, by a general verdict of guilty or not guilty. Any other construction would be totally at variance with the fundamental principles of our system of jurisprudence and with our settled and uncontested practice. It has never been claimed that the jury are to determine what evidence is admissible, or what witnesses competent ; yet, if they are judges of the law, they should decide these often most important law points in a case. So as to the sufficiency of an indictment. Again; the jury have a right to return a special verdict even in a criminal case: Dowman’s Case, 9 Rep. 12 b.; 2 Coke Inst., 425; Hargrave’s note to Coke Litt., 155 b. It is admitted that they must decide the facts, and if they are judges of the law then it is their duty to decide it, and they cannot transfer that duty to the court. The prisoner might demand -his right that they should exercise their full functions; but all the authorities are to the contrary, and if the finding of facts can be separated from the conclusion of law, the latter will be decided by the judges by their own views. “When a jury find the matter committed to their charge at large, and further conclude against law, the verdict is good and the conclusion ill: ” Heydon’s Case, 4 Rep. 42 b. “ The office of twelve men is no other than to inquire of matters of fact, and not to adjudge what the law is, for that is the office of the court and not of the jury; and if they find the matter of fact at large and further say that thereupon the law is so, where in truth the law is not so, the judges shall adjudge according to the matter of fact, and not according to the conelusion of the jury: ” Townsend’s Case, Plowden, 114 b.

The language of Chief Justice Shabswood was, however, less guarded than was usual with that eminent jurist; and, following State v. Croteau, <a href="/vt/23/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="23 Vt. 14" data-case-ids="4424717" data-case-paths="/vt/23/0014-01">23 Vt. 14</a>, he dismisses the perfectly clear and substantial distinction between power and right with a brevity that is scarcely consistent with the weight of the subject. “ The distinction between power and right,” he says, “ whatever may be its value in ethics, in law is very shadowy and unsubstantial. He who has legal power to do anything has the legal right. No court should give a binding instruction to a jury which they are powerless to enforce by granting a new trial if it should be disregarded.” It is somewhat remarkable that the Chief Justice should assume, as is so commonly done by counsel, that the jury will construe the law more favorably for the prisoner than the court would. It is only such a construction, too favorable to the prisoner, that the court is powerless to remedy by a new trial; and that lack of power arises, not because the jury’s legal power is the same as a legal right, but because, for reasons of general policy, one verdict of acquittal is a final and irreversible termination of the case. If legal power means legal right, then a jury has a right to acquit any prisoner without regard to either law or evidence; for their power to do so is beyond question, and they cannot be held to any accountability though they follow the maxim of Lynch law, that the murdered man deserved to die anyhow, and therefore his murderer should not be punished, even though he no longer seeks refuge behind the thin veil of transitory insanity that began when the shot was fired and ended when it had killed its man. Whether the distinction between power and right be shadowy and unsubstantial in practice, or not, it is clear and vital, and I must repudiate such a confusion of logical as well as moral ideas. A jury may disregard the evidence, but no judge has ever said it had the legal right to do so; and if the disregard is of the weight of the evidence favorable to the prisoner, the court sets aside the verdict without hesitation; and even this court, though it does not pass upon the weight of evidence, does examine its sufficiency and may on that ground reverse without a new venire.

As was suggested by the learned judge at the trial of the case in hand, the jury had the legal power to find murder of the first degree without regard to the element of premeditation, but no judge would contend that they had the legal right to do so; and, if the evidence of premeditation was below the legal standard, determined by the court as matter of law, not only would the trial court set aside the verdict, but this court would be bound to review the evidence and determine if the legal elements of murder of the first degree existed in the case. Such powers and such duties in the courts are absolutely inconsistent with the right of the jury to be in any sense judges of the law.</p>

Alexander Addison was one of the staunchest asserters of the rights of juries in the constitutional convention, and was one of the, minority of three who voted against McKean’s amendment to insert the words “under the direction of the court as in other cases; ” but when, three years later, he presided in the Oyer and Terminer of Washington county, he laid down the law in these precise and forcible terms : “ Whether the facts are so or so, it lies with you to determine, according as you believe the testimony. Supposing them so or so, whether they amount to murder or manslaughter, is a question of law for the court to determine. You may find, according as you believe or disbelieve the facts, and comparing the facts with the rules of law, that the prisoner is guilty or not guilty (of murder), or guilty of manslaughter; or, you may find the facts specially, without drawing any conclusion of guilt or innocence, leaving it to the court to pronounce the construction which the law puts on the facts found; but you cannot but at the peril of violation of duty, believing the facts, say that they are not what the law declares them to be; for this would be taking upon you to make the law, which is the province of the legislature, or to construe the law, which is the province of the court: ” Pennsylvania v. Bell, Add., 160. And in Commonwealth v. Sherry, an indictment for murder growing out of the <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>riots of 1844, removed by certiorari from the Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia and tried in the Nisi Prius in April, 1845, Justice Rogers charged the jury as follows: “You are, it is true, judges in a criminal case in one sense of both law and fact; for your verdict as in civil cases, must pass on law and fact together. If you acquit, you interpose a final bar to a second prosecution.....The popular impression is that this power .... arises from a right on the jury’s part to decide the law as well as the facts, according to their own sense of right. But it arises from no such thing. It rests upon a fundamental principle of the common law that no man can twice be put in jeopardy for the same offence.....It is important for you to keep this distinction in mind, remembering that, while you have the physical power by an acquittal to discharge a defendant from further prosecution, you have no moral power to do so against the law laid down by the court. The sanctity of your conclusions, in case of an acquittal, arises, not from any inherent dominion on your part over the law, but from the principle that no man shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offence, a principle that attaches equal sanctity to an acquittal produced by a blunder of the clerk, or an error of the attorney general.....You will see, from these considerations, the great importance of the preservation, in criminal as well as in civil cases, of the maxim that the law belongs to the court, and the facts to the jury. My duty is therefore to charge you, that while you will in this case form your own judgment of the facts, you will receive the law as it is given to you by the court:” Wharton on Homicide, App., 721. To the same effect, though less explicitly developed, are the rulings by Sergeant, J., of this court, in Commonwealth v. Van Sickle, Brightly, 73; and by Gibson, C. J., in Commonwealth v. Harman, <a href="/pa/4/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="4 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="401909" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0269-01">4 Pa. 269</a>. And this also seems to have been the later and better considered opinion of Judge Baldwin whose charge in United States v. Wilson, Bald. 99, is commonly quoted as authority on the other side. See his charge in United States v. Shive, Bald. 512. I do not understand that the case of Kane v. Commonwealth was intended to overrule or conflict with these decisions; and, notwithstanding the latitude of the language of the opinion, the real point decided did not go beyond the affirmation of the right to an instruction that “ the jury are <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>the judges of the law and the fact.” In the present case, it will be observed that the instruction asked was that the jury-are “ judges of the law <em>as well as </em>of the fact,” that is, of each, not merely of the joint result of both. For myself, I think even the formula that the jury are judges of the law and the fact, objectionable, as tending to convey to the jury a wrong idea. The language of the constitution is that the jury shall have the right to determine the law and the facts, under the direction of the court. This is the accurate formula, and it means only that they have the right to determine the joint result of the law and the facts by a general verdict. This is the form which ought to be used when instruction on the subject is asked, and it ought to be accompanied by explicit instruction that the jury are not judges of the law, in all cases where there is any apparent danger that the jury will arrogate to themselves such function.</p>

    <p id="b120-7" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[242,1257,1167,146]]]'>1. That the jury never were judges of the law in any case, civil or criminal, except incidentally as involved in the mixed determination of law and fact by a general verdict.</p>

Even if it could be conceded that they may have been so in primitive times, their right certainly ceased after the introduction of bills of exception and the granting of new trials, and admittedly has not existed in civil cases for centuries.</p>
    <p id="b120-9" data-blocks='[["BL_120.7",120,[236,1614,1173,552]]]'>3. That there was not originally, nor is now, any distinction in this respect between civil and criminal cases, the true rule as to both being that “ the immediate and direct right of deciding upon questions of law is entrusted to the judges; in a jury, it is only incidental: ” Hargrave’s note to Coke Litt., 155 b. The idea of a difference in the rights and functions of juries in civil and criminal cases, as to the determination of the law, arose from a misconception of the controversy over the right to give a general verdict, and was an error for which there is no respectable English authority, and which the best American authorities have overwhelmingly disapproved.</p>

That, even if the jury had originally had such right in criminal cases, it was an anomaly, belonging to the period when jurors were selected from the vicinage, because of their knowledge of the case, and, like its congener, has changed and disappeared, because totally inconsistent with the functions of courts <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>and juries as now understood, with sound reason and with common sense. And such change, if change it be, has the sanction of the constitutional provision that the jury shall determine “under the direction of the court,” of the legislative provisions for bills of exception, the review of the evidence in cases of murder, etc., etc., and of the long-settled and incontestable power of courts to decide questions of evidence, to set aside verdicts and grant new trials, without limit except when controlled by the ancient maxim of the common law, embodied in our constitutional declaration of rights, that no man shall be twice vexed for the same offence.</p>

The opinion of the court by Hall, J., is the only serious attempt that I have been able to find, to support the dogma for which it is now mainly responsible, and with great respect for that eminent jurist it appears to me that his whole argument is based on the confusion of the right to determine the law with the right to render a general verdict. A careful examination of all the authorities cited by him, and they include everything which the most learned and diligent research could discover, shows that they only go so far as to sustain the right of the jury, not to be judges of or to determine the law, but only to <em>apply </em>it through a general verdict. The dissenting opinion of Bennett, J., in the same case, displays equal learning and sounder reasoning. It is a storehouse of information on the subject, and has anticipated everything that can be said upon it. A masterly analysis and review by Chief Justice Shaw will also be found in Commonwealth v.
