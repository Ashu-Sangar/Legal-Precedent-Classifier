Believing the signature of James Long to said note [to be genuine], the plaintiff accepted said note in payment, and delivered to James Hunter, as agent for defendant, the said promissory note of defendant. Plaintiff afterwards discovered, and now avers, that the signature purporting to be that of James Long to the note, so offered and received in payment, was a forgery, and consequently the said note was-void, and the plaintiff has not received from said defendant, or from any other person, payment of the whole or any part of the aforesaid promissory note of defendant.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[233,956,1179,1435]]]'>The evidence tending to prove that defendant made the note consisted of his own admissions, made to the president and cashier of the plaintiff on several occasions. The latter testified, in substance, that, ten days or two weeks before the note matured, defendant came into the bank, handed him a notice which had been addressed to place of payment, etc., and asked to see the note. It was handed to him. After looking at it said turning it over he said, “ That is all right.” A few days afterwards, defendant and Mr. Lucas called in relation to forming a syndicate to buy up the indebtedness of John and James Hunter, etc. During the conversation, as they were about leaving, “ I asked Mr. Field the question, I said: ‘ By the way, Mr. Field, that note that you came here and inspected, was the signature of that forged or good ? ’ Mr. Field replied that that signature was all right, and that the note was all right.” Dr. Hughes, president of the bank, testified that, a week or two after James Hunter fled, Mr. Lucas and defendant “came to the bank, wanting us to join in a plan to pay the debts of Mr. Hunter; and before going out Mr. Park asked him if that note of his was all right, genuine. He replied that it was, after some hesitation.” In short, the testimony was ample to warrant the jury in finding that the signature of the maker of the note in suit was genuine, and also that possession of it was fraudulently obtained by James Hunter in the manner above stated; but the learned judge, being of opinion that the evidence was insufficient to justify a verdict in favor of plaintiff, ordered a judgment of nonsuit, and afterwards refused to take it off. In that, we think, there was error.</p>

If there is any evidence, beyond a mere scintilla, which alone would justify an inference of the disputed facts on which his right to recover depends, it must be submitted to the jury: Hill v.

Upon a motion to nonsuit, the defendant is considered as admitting every fact which the evidence tends to prove, including such inferences of fact as a jury may lawfully draw from it: Miller v.

The inconvenience, if any, is one to which the holder has exposed himself, arising, perhaps, from his own carelessness.....In this, all the authorities to which I refer generally agree. But the question recurs, is the failure to indemnify in bar of the action, or, is it a prerequisite merely to the execution to enforce payment of the judgment ? In the absence of all direct authority, in this state at least, I incline to the latter view of the case. However the law may be, as to suit brought to recover on a lost note, (and I see no reason why there should be any difference,) <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>we are of opinion that, when the note is lost after the commencement of the action, it is no objection to the rendition of j ndgment.
