He was corroborated by the testimony of his wife as to a conversation between the plaintiff and defendant, in her presence, sometime in the spring of 1888, soon after the plaintiff, as was alleged, first discovered the mistake; and somewhat by the testimony of other witnesses as to admissions and declarations made by the defendant. Francis Moyer, the surveyor and scrivener, testified, as to the survey for the division of the land, that the two pieces were 'to be as nearly equal as he could make them, and that it was the purpose, the one to take one piece, and the other the other piece’; that when the parties came to him they had agreed upon the terms, and had appraised the buildings on the eastern purpart at $1,800, which he called the “ rausgeldt ” or boot-money. The defendant testified that there was no mistake in the matter of the $1,300, the appraised value pf the farm buildings; that the division of the land was not made to equalize the value of the respective portions, and that the $1,300 was the “ over-money ” agreed upon as the difference between the values of the two purparts, with the buildings on the plaintiff’s tract. The written agreement, under seal, between the plaintiff and defendant, dated October 30, 1888, was put in evidence, showing, inter alia, that the plaintiff agreed to retain and keep the eastern purpart with the farm buildings thereon, and the defendant the western purpart, with certain growing and cut timber on the eastern part, and certain privileges of egress and ingress for the purpose of ditching and laying pipes, etc., etc.; “ the said William H. Reed further agrees to pay unto the said Josiah F. Horn the sum of thirteen hundred dollars, lawful money, etc., as follows: two hundred and fifty dollars down and the balance or remaining ten hundred and fifty dollars, at or upon the first day of April 1884.” It was further shown that the $250 dollars hand <em>money </em>was paid, that the plaintiff and defendant exchanged deeds for their respective portions on December 8, 1883, and that after-wards the note given for $1,050 was paid off and discharged.</p>

They also owned, as joint owners, the stock upon that farm, farming utensils, crops they had raised. In the month of October, 1883, they determined between themselves to divide this farm; and, as they have both' said, sent for a survejmr, with the view of having a division line run so as to equally divide it in quantity; that is, that each part after being divided should, as near as possible, contain the same number of acres. The surveyor came and ran the line. These parties made a division of the farming utensils and the stock and some of the crops, perhaps all of them; indeed everything, all, as I understand it, of the personal property that they owned. Having done that, they went to the scrivener, Squire Moyer, who was also the surveyor, and on the thirtieth day of October, 1883, had him reduce to writing their final contract or agreement. By that written contract the line of division was fixed. There are some stipulations as to the quantity [of timber] that the one holding the west half was to have off the piece called the east half. So, in relation to the laying of pipe for taking water on the western part. I believe I am correct in that division. And in that agreement it is stipulated that Peed should pay to Horn $1,300.</p>

I have said to you that this written agreement is plain in its terms and easily understood. The presumption is that when parties have been in negotiation and finally reduce to writing their contract, all their prior negotiations are merged in that contract. [And where the paper is plain, unambiguous, the party alleging mistake must show, by clear, certain, unambiguous evidence, that the mistake was made.] 5 If this were not the rule of law, there would be but little use in reducing contracts to writing.</p>

      <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>The plaintiff alleges that his mistake grew out of the fact that he and, as he alleges, Horn, took the whole value of the buildings upon that property, agreed to their valuation, as the amount which he was to pay Horn, when, in point of fact, they were both mistaken, and that all he should have paid was $650, the one half of the value of the buildings. The plaintiff’s allegation, as you know, is that they had divided the land, and by the terms of their agreement had equalized the value of the two properties, without regard to the buildings, between themselves, and the only thing left after that was to value the buildings ; and that the amount at which they should fix the valuation of the buildings, should be added to the eastern part, or old place, and that should be worth that much more than the other. Now, if such was the understanding between both these parties, and they had divided everything except the buildings, equally according to their own arrangement and understanding, and they then simply valued the buildings on the old place; or, if they intended to make an equal division of the properties, of course there would be to pay, by the party accepting the part where the old buildings were, simply the one half of the valuation of it.</p>

Because, they must both have been mistaken before this plaintiff can recover. My recollection is, that the plaintiff says that when the two parties met the next day, or within a few days after they had fixed the value on the buildings, Horn said to him he wouldn’t take the new place but he would take it if the defendant took the old place; that Horn would take the new place if he, Reed, would take the old place and pay Horn $1,300. Horn says that the $1,300, was to be the difference between the two places; that he was to receive the $1,300. Whatever may have been the conversations between these parties, prior to the time when they came to a final agreement when it was agreed which should take the old place and which the western place, were merged in this final arrangement they made. So that your attention must be directed to what these parties did agree to, when Reed agreed to take the old place and Horn the new one. Were they then both of the mind, that the party who took the old place was to take the buildings, and <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>that the buildings were to be valued simply at $1,800, as the property of the two owners ? If they were both of that mind at the time, then there was a mistake made, because each owned one half of these buildings. If, on the other hand, the agreement and understanding was that Reed was to pay $1,800, as the difference between these two properties, and there was no mistake on the part of both, then the plaintiff cannot recover. What did Reed understand, and what did Horn understand as to their respective rights? Did they enter into the valuation of these old buildings, with the view to determine what they were worth, and that the difference should be paid by the one who took the old place, — the difference in value of the places after adding the value of the buildings to it — while they fixed no value on the farms, but meaning that the old place should be worth as much more than the new place as the buildings were valued by them? If they intended that, and that was the basis of their contract, then clearly there was a mistake when Reed paid the $1,300. Horn says there was no mistake on his part, and that he was to receive the $1,300.] 4.....</p>

They first divided their farming implements, live stock, and all other personal property, each taking by agreement a moiety thereof in value. With the aid of a surveyor, they then <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>agreed upon a line dividing the land, as they intended, into two purparts containing each about the same number of acres, and estimated by them at the same value per acre, exclusive of the buildings, all of which were on the eastern purpart. With the view, as the jury found, of compensating the one to whom the western purpart might be allotted, for his interest in the buildings on the eastern purpart, they undertook to determiue their value; and, after each marking on paper the sum he considered them worth, they compared notes and afterwards agreed upon one thousand three hundred dollars as the fair value of the buildings. Having thus settled the location of the division line, the value of the buildings, and arranged minor matters, as to timber leave, etc., it was finally agreed that plaintiff should take, in severalty, the purpart on which the improvements were, and defendant should take the other. They then went to a justice of the peace, and executed the agreement which was given in evidence. Instead of evidencing a purpose to make an equal division of the land, both as to quality and value, coupled with compensation in money to the defendant, for his interest in the building on the purpart allotted to plaintiff, the agreement provides that the latter shall pay for the former one thousand three hundred dollars; and the money was afterwards paid. It then occurred to the plaintiff that in carrying out the purpose they had in view, throughout their negotiations and in everything that was done in dividing the land and appraising the buildings, a mutual mistake had occurred, whereby he had paid to his brother-in-law six hundred and fifty dollars more than he should have paid according to the basis on which the partition was actually made, or rather intended to be made. Failing to convince the defendant that equality of partition as to quantity and value of the land, irrespective of buildings, coupled with compensation in money for his interest in those improvements, did not mean that he was entitled to a full half of the land, in quantity and value, and the whole valuation money of the buildings besides, instead of one half thereof, the plaintiff brought this suit to recover the six hundred and fifty dollars which he alleges was erroneously paid by mutual mistake.</p>

The learned judge who presided and exercised the function of a chancellor in this case was doubtless satisfied that the evidence adduced by the plaintiff was of that character. He accordingly submitted the testimony to the jury in a clear and comprehensive charge, in which they were accurately and adequately instructed as to their duties, and as to the kind and degree of evidence that was required to prove the alleged mutual mistake and justify a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The verdict establishes the plaintiff’s version of the controlling facts. A careful examination of the evidence satisfies =us that the ease was rightly submitted to the jury, and that their verdict was fully warranted. No chancellor with the case before him, on a bill to reform the clause in the written agreement requiring the payment of one thousand three hundred dollars, instead of six hundred and fifty dollars, by plaintiff to defendant, would upon such evidence hesitate to make a decree reforming the instrument. That, we take it, is the true test of the plaintiff’s right to recover. Nothing that appears to have occurred since the making of the agreement, can be successfully urged as ground of estoppel.</p>

There is no merit in the complaint that the learned judge did not explain what is meant by the words “ clear, precise, and indubitable,” as applied to the evidence. If defendant desired any explanation of these words, he should have requested it in his sixth point, wherein he employs the same words for the same purpose. He doubtless regarded that point as sufficiently plain for the jury to understand, and it was affirmed in his own words, viz.: “Before the executed contract, in this case, can be reformed, changed, or altered by parol testimony, the plaintiff must satisfy the court, by evidence that is clear, precise, and indubitable, that there was a mutual mistake at the time of making the contract.” The plaintiff did thus satisfy the court, as well as the jury, that there was a mutual mistake, as alleged by him, and that under it the money in controversy was paid. The evidence of that fact was, in all respects, quite sufficient.</p>
