The account filed by the trustee shows that, in the exercise of his discretion, interest has accumulated amounting to over <em>$5,000. </em>The corpus of the trust, including the farm to be purchased by the trustee, is nearly #50,000. As these accumulations may continue during the lifetime of Spencer, it is difficult to determine what proportions they may in time assume. Whether these accumulations shall continue is not in the discretion of the trustee, for, if he finds the interest is more than sufficient to supply the necessities of Spencer, he is bound, under the direction in the will, to invest the balance. Where the effect of the provision is to swell the estate, the form of the language is unimportant: McKee’s App., <a href="/pa/96/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="96 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="494617" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0285-01">96 Pa. 285</a>; Mitcheson’s Est., 11 W.

A direction which, if obeyed, results in an accumulation, is “a settlement or disposition of property for the accumulation of rents, issues, interest or profits.” This accumulation is not protected by any exception in the statute. The act allows accumulations, only during the minority of a person who would, for the time being, if of full age, be entitled to the income so directed to accumulate: Washington’s Est., <a href="/pa/75/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="75 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1036620" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0102-01">75 Pa. 102</a>; McKee’s App., <a href="/pa/96/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="96 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="494646" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0277-01">96 Pa. 277</a>; Carson’s App., <a href="/pa/99/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="99 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="446168" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0325-01">99 Pa. 325</a>; Grim’s App., <a href="/pa/109/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="109 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="542287" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0391-01">109 Pa. 391</a>.

The act is positive and sweeping in its terms, and leaves no room for such an exception. A discretionary power to accumulate for the lifetime of the cestui que trust, violates the statute as clearly as any direction freed from all discretion in the trustee. While the Supreme Court of our state, so far as we can ascertain, has not passed upon this question, the intimations given in Eberly’s App., <a href="/pa/110/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="110 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="543765" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0095-01">110 Pa. 95</a>, indicate that such trusts, providing for accumulations, are in violation of the statute of 1853.

There, nothing vested in the. children for seven years; the trustee could withhold all the income during that period. Here, we have, in the first direction, a bequest of a moiety of the estate to Spencer; then a direction to pay him the income only; and the income not expended is his, for it is to be invested for his benefit, and there is no bequest over of any accumulations. The entire income is for Spencer; the manner of its enjoyment alone is limited. The income now accumulated, in the hands of the trustee, is not needed to enable him to discharge the duties of the trust. The corpus consists of mortgages, judgments and cash, yielding a comparatively certain and uniform income. In this respect, the case is similar to McKee’s Appeal, supra, and unlike Eberly’s App., <a href="/pa/110/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="110 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="543765" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0095-01">110 Pa. 95</a>, where the accumulations might have been required to carry out the purposes of the trust.</p>

By omitting the provision for accumulations in the will, there remains the direction to pay the income to Spencer. The testator did not mean to die intestate as to any part of his estate, for he directs that 'the surplus income shall be invested for Spencer’s benefit. After the death of the cestui que trust, he gives the “ moiety of my estate which I have given in trust ” to the appointee of James. There is no attempt to dispose of any accumulations of the moiety given in trust, after Spencer’s death. There was no need for such disposition over, for the testator intended the entire income for Spencer’s use. The income and interest must be paid to Spencer, because the act directs they shall go to and be received by' such person as would have been entitled thereto if such accumulation had not been directed: Stille’s App., 4 W.

But the primary question was whether any vested estate, as to either principal or income, was given to Spencer B. Hibbs. it is clear that there was not, as to the principal, for at Spencer’s death James was empowered to dispose of it by his will; while, as to the income, James was given entire discretion whether to pay it to Spencer or not; and accumulated income would follow the corpus of the estate and go to the person or persons designated in the last will of James: Barger’s App., <a href="/pa/100/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="100 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="498473" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0239-01">100 Pa. 239</a>; <em>Brown </em>v.

Assuming that the intention of the testator was to create a spendthrift trust, is such a trust within the purview of the act of April 18, 1853 ? Does that act destroy the entire purpose of such trusts, by striking down the discretion of the trustee, and requiring him at the end of the year to disburse such accumulation of income as he may have received, possibly to the direct injury, financially and morally, of the cestui que trust ? Again; in most cases of trust-estates, there should be a reserve fund to meet emergencies and unforeseen contingencies, and its accumulation from income is not necessarily in conflict with the statute. The question depends upon the nature of the trust property and the duties of the trustee: Eberly’s App., <a href="/pa/110/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="110 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="543765" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0095-01">110 Pa. 95</a>.

    <p id="b248-9" data-blocks='[["BL_248.8",248,[264,1764,1171,659]]]'>There are two classes of cases in which the question of accumulations has been raised in this court since the passage of the act of 1853; <em>(a) </em>that in which the manifest purpose of the testator was to add such accumulations permanently to, and make them take the destination of the original trust-estate: Washington’s Est., <a href="/pa/75/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="75 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1036620" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0102-01">75 Pa. 102</a>; McKee’s App., <a href="/pa/96/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="96 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="494646" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0277-01">96 Pa. 277</a>; Carson’s App., <a href="/pa/99/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="99 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="446168" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0325-01">99 Pa. 325</a>; Grim’s App., <a href="/pa/109/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="109 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="542287" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0391-01">109 Pa. 391</a>; and (5), that in which the accumulations were intended to be temporary, and in the interest of judicious management: Eberly’s App., <a href="/pa/110/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="110 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="543765" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0095-01">110 Pa. 95</a>. The first came plainly within the prohibition of the statute; the second did not. The purpose of the statute was to prevent permanent accumulations; not to interfere with judicious management.</p>

      <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>The present case falls within the second class. The whole income is given in trust, and must be used for the benefit of Spencer B. Hibbs; but, as the “testator appears to have foreboded the thriftless ” character of the beneficiary, he substituted the discretion of a trustee as to the manner of its use. The power vested in this trustee, to withhold and invest part of the income, must be so construed, if possible, as to make it operative. It does not in terms nor by necessary implication require permanent accumulations. As already seen, the whole income arising during the trust must be used for Spencer’s benefit. In common prudence a contingent fund should be provided in anticipation of decrease of income, sickness and the like; and the natural inference is that the discretion was vested in tire trustee with this view. The accumulation was to be temporary, and in the interest of judicious management. The record does not show that the amount, already set apart, is unreasonable in the circumstances, and we cannot assume that the trustee has abused his discretion.</p>
