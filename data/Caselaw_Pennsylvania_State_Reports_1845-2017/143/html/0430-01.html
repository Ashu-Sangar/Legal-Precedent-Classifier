For the establishment of the grade of 1871 there was no right of action: O’Connor v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/18/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="18 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="969159" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0187-01">18 Pa. 187</a>; Philadelphia v.

Therefore, the statute of limitations could not begin to run from that date. But the constitution of 1874, article XVI., § 8, gave a right to the owners to have compensation for property injured, as well as for property taken by municipal and other corporations in the construction or enlargement of their works. The right of action which this section gives is clearly for the actual establishment of the grade on the land. The general rule is that the cause of action arises when the injury is complete, and this has been uniformly applied to the taking of property for public use, from the case of Schuylkill Nav. Co. v. Thoburn, 7 S. &amp; R. 411, down to the present day: Volkmar St., <a href="/pa/124/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="124 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="563080" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0320-01">124 Pa. 320</a>; Whitaker v.

The cases which were governed by a different rule were exceptions, such as those arising under § 27 of the consolidatiou act of February 2, 1854, which in express terms gave damages for a change of grade regulations: Plan 166, opinion filed herewith, ante 414. There is nothing in the constitutional provision which indicates an intent to depart from the general rule under which, in the present case, the cause of action could not arise until the actual cutting down of the ground in 1887.</p>
