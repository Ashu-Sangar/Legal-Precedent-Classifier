Our offer of the Lancaster county records was made to rebut the proof that Balser Geehr of Berks county was a brother of Joseph Gehr, the father of Baltzer Gehr of Crawford county. The question is, whether the facts shown by those records do not so fit in with the facts testified to by Baltzer Gehr and other witnesses for the plaintiffs, as to make it probable that they are parts of the same family history, and that the Paul, Andrew and John Gehr of the records, who were the sons of John Gehr, Sr., are the same Paul, Andrew and John that, as Baltzer Gehr testified, were his father’s brothers; from which it would follow that his father could not be a brother of Balser Geehr of Berks county, who was the son of Conrad Geehr.</p>

That this is the case, is shown by a remarkable number of facts and circumstances, embodied in the records, which completely agree with the facts sworn to by the plaintiffs’ witnesses, and make every member of the family fit into his proper place. These coincident facts completely supply every <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>requisite which the law prescribes as necessary to show identity. Certain facts embodied in the offer, which have come to light since the trial of Sitler v.

Gehr, as to the identity of the Paul Gehr who died in 1773, by their correspondence with the statement of Baltzer Gehr, that his father had lived on his brother Paul’s farm. An examination of the cases cited in Sailor v.

This was not denied by the appellants, but we were urged to re-examine and re-consider those rulings with a view to a different judgment. In view of the importance of the interests, as well as the legal principles involved, I have examined that case with more than usual care, with a disposition to modify our rulings if found erroneous. Notwithstanding the zeal and ability with which the matter has again been called to our attention, I have been unable to find anything to shake our former views of the law of that ease. We do not deem it necessary now to re-enter upon its discussion. It would be in a great measure a repetition of what was there said.</p>

Gehr, the principle by which it must be decided was ruled in that case. I do not understand the offer to be more .than an attempt to show, that in a churchyard within two miles of Hamburg there is a tombstone, on which is inscribed th.e name of Margaret Croll, wife of Michael Croll, with a record of her age and death. Who this Margaret Croll was, the inscription does not inform us; but we are asked to infer from the similarity of name, and that alone, that she was a sister of Philip Gehr. I do not find any evidence in the case that Philip Gehr had a sister Margaret. Be that as it may, it appears by the testimony of Joseph Kutz that Joseph had two sisters, and that one of them married a man named Michael Croll, and the other married a Bast. But the same witness distinctly said that he did not know the first name of either sister. Jonas Kohler had testified that a Mrs. Croll, named Margaret, who was the wife of a Michael Croll, was buried in the Smoke Church in 1832. This offer was to prove the inscription on a tombstone of a Margaret Croll, who was not buried at the Smoke Church, but who was buried at St. John’s Church, two and a half miles from the Smoke Church. I do not see that this evidence would have damaged the plaintiffs’ case, had it been admitted. It might possibly have confused the jury, and we think was properly rejected. It involved at most a mere identity of name; and, as was said in Sitler,v. Gehr, “it would work great injustice if rights of property, after a great length of time, were allowed to depend upon mere identity of name. A prima-facie case thus submitted to a jury might be extremely difficult, if not impossible to disprove. I know of no case in which mere identity of name has been held sufficient, after the great lapse of time which exists here.” This principle was sufficiently discussed in Sitler v. Gehr, and I do not propose to add to it beyond the citation of the following additional authorities as bearing upon it: 1 Whart. on Ev., § 656; 1 Greenl.
