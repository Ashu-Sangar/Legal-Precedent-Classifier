His lot had a frontage on said street of seventy-five feet, and a depth of one hundred and twenty-five feet. A hotel building was erected on the eastern side of the lot, occupying about forty-two feet of the front on Centre street. The North Mahanoy creek ran through the lot on the western side of the hotel building. Throughout the whole length of the plaintiff’s lot, a wall eight or ten feet high had been built on each side of the creek, and the western wall of the hotel building was in part set upon the eastern creek-wall. The creek was covered over with planking laid upon the walls referred to, so as to make the whole surface of the plaintiff’s lot available for use. About 1880, the plaintiff built a water closet upon the planking over the creek, adjoining the west side of his hotel building, cut away the planks beneath the seat of the water-closet, so that excrement would fall down to the creek, and placed a communicating door between the water closet and <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>the wash room in the hotel building.- The water closet was removed in 1885.

The waste matter produced in the manufacture, consisting of pitchy and oily substances, impregnated with the smell of gas, was at first discharged into the creek and allowed to float down through the plaintiff’s premises. About 1880, the plaintiff having complained that his house was in this manner filled with the odor of gas, the defendant laid a line of pipe along the creek,'to a point below the plaintiff’s house, to carry off the waste. After some time the pipes became obstructed or out of order, and the waste leaked out at the joints and was again carried by the water to the plaintiff’s premises. The plaintiff again complained, and the defendant then turned the waste matter into a pit dug upon its own premises. Testimony for the plaintiff, however, tended to prove that the waste still found its way to the stream, and thus filled the atmosphere in and about the house of the plaintiff with offensive odors.</p>

The charter of the company is in evidence before you showing that they had the authority of the state for the manufacture of gas, but that this will relieve them from responsibility to a private party who is injured is not the law. The charter does not go to that extent. Under the law, and now particularly under our constitution, consequential damages may be recovered from any person or corporation who injures the property or destroys the property of another. There can be no taking of property, and no injury to property, without making compensation on the part of the corporation, although it may be armed with the authority of the state for the business which it follows. And a man’s property may be as effectually destroyed by rendering it uninhabitable, destroyed for the purpose for which he desires to use it by rendering it uninhabitable, as it would be to take hold of it and tear it down. In the one case, the act is direct, it is a taking of the property actually; in the other, the damages are consequential, — in consequence of the act on the part of the defendant charged with the offence. We have it laid down by the very highest legal authority that that which is authorized by the legislature, within the strict scope of the power given, cannot be a public nuisance. They could not be indicted for exercising the powers vested in them by the state. But it may be a private nuisance, and the legislative grant is no protection against a private action for damages resulting therefrom.] 1</p>

The claim made here on the part of the plaintiff is for what are called vindictive damages. It is alleged that the conduct of the defendant was such as to require a jury to impose more than what would be mere compensation, to give an additional amount so as to punish the defendant. It will be for you to determine, if you find for the plaintiff, what his damages shall be, how you will assess them. It has been said, in cases of this kind, that a mere invasion of a right would be sufficient to authorize nominal damages, damages that would be less than compensation; that has been decided in a number of cases.] 4.....</p>

To make the defendant liable in this action, it was incumbent on the plaintiff to show that the alleged injury was the result of negligence. The manufacture of gas by the defendant corporation is a lawful business, and the emission of gases and smells, as a necessary result of it, cannot be declared a private nuisance, when the business is conducted without negligence. By its charter, the company is exempted from liability for anything which necessarily results from the performance of its corporate duty and the exercise of its rights: Wood on Nuisances; §§ 758, 755, 757; Commonwealth v. Reed, <a href="/pa/34/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="34 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="418002" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0275-01">34 Pa. 275</a>: Penna. Coal Co. v.

If he had not done so, who can say that odors so volatile as those complained of in this case, would not have escaped long before they reached his building ? Such being the circumstances, he cut a hole through the plank covering, erected a water closet, and cut a communication between it and the hotel, so that any odors coming from the creek could pass into and through his house without obstruction. These facts clearly raised the question of contributory negligence. There is no doctrine better settled than that contributory negligence will defeat a right of action: Railroad v. Norton, <a href="/pa/24/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="24 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="9505026" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0465-01">24 Pa. 465</a>.</p>

Y. -; s. c. <a href="/citations/?q=44%20Hun%20271" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="44 Hun 271">44 Hun 271</a>. If the doctrine of that case is correct, there was clear error in the charge on the subject of the measure of damages. There was not a particle of testimony as to the rental value of plaintiff’s hotel. Moreover, loss of profits from transient custom at the hotel is too uncertain and remote to serve as a basis of damages. Nor was it proper to submit to the jury the question as to the extent of such losses, when the plaintiff himself was wholly unable to tell their amount. And it was error to permit the jury to give exemplary damages, as there was no evidence of any wanton, vexatious or oppressive conduct on the part of the defendant.</p>

The testimony the admission of which is complained of in the twenty-second and twenty-eighth assignments was hearsay. And in permitting the plaintiff to prove injury to his buildings erected after the commencement of the suit, the court virtually' allowed the introduction of a new cause of action. Those buildings had no existence when the suit was brought, nor until after issue joined. An injury to them could not then have constituted any part of the cause of action. Nor could the record of this suit be pleaded in bar, if the defendant were hereafter to be sued on account of these buildings, as there is nothing on the record to show that the verdict covers any such injury.</p>

The defendant is a private, not a public corporation, being invested with the right of eminent domain only to a limited extent, to wit, for the purpose of laying pipes, etc., in streets and highways; and it has no more right to create and maintain a nuisance than an individual engaged in manufacturing gas would have.

L. 95, was intended to obviate the necessity of bringing a second action to recover any damages suffered between the commencement and the trial of the suit. The notice which it provides for, is a substitute for a second action. Having given such notice, the plaintiff would be precluded by the recovery in this case from hereafter suing for damages to his new erections. Those buildings were erected upon the premises described in the narr, and the admission of testimony relating to them was therefore not the introduction of a new cause of action. The plaintiff had a right to erect them notwithstanding the pendency of the suit, and in a second action for damages suffered after the institution of the present suit, any injury to them would be admissible. Evidence of such injury was properly received under the notice, which took the place of another action.</p>

If the ordinary processes of manufacture are employed and conducted in the ordinary manner, equity will not restrain the prosecution of the business; but, if the company neglects to make use of the ordinary processes or the ordinary precautions, and harm is thereby done to others, the negligence will justify intervention by a court of equity to restrain its continuance, and sustain an action at law for the recovery of damages by the injured party. The right of action in such cases grows, not out of the exercise of its corporate franchises by the company, but out of the negligence of which it is guilty in the mannér of conducting its business. Artificial persons are bound equally with natural persons by the maxim, sic utere tuo ut alienum non tedas, and are liable in like manner to those who may be injured by their neglect to observe its requirements : Pottstown Gas Co. v.

He alleges that the waste from the works is turned into the North Mahanoy creek, a small stream which passes the gas works and crosses his own lot, and that by reason of the smell of gas arising from the waste his house is filled at times with offensive odors, affecting injuriously the health of himself and family and the comfort of his guests. The defendant denies that the unwholesome odors, noticeable at times in the plaintiff’s house, are due to waste in the stream or are the odors of gas, and asserts that they are due to the presence of slaughter houses and privies along the stream, by which its waters are loaded with impurities, and to the defective arrangement of the privies connected with the plaintiff’s hotel and stables. The defendant further denies that any appreciable injury has been sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the odors complained of, whatever may be their source.</p>
    <p id="b314-6" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[270,1190,1171,402]]]'>Two questions are thus raised for consideration : first, is the defendant guilty of negligence in the management of the business of producing gas ?

Carnegie,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> that a loss in the selling or rental valúe of real estate by reason of the establishment of a lawful but undesirable business in the vicinity, does not give a cause of action. A licensed hotel or a livery stable, a saloon or a meat market, and many other kinds of business are calculated to affect the' desirability of a neighborhood as a place .of residence, and consequently to depreciate the value of adjoining property, but the owners of such property are without legal remedy for their loss. Nor will the fact that the business of the adjoining owner is a source of some personal discomfort and annoyance, give a right of action, so long as the business is lawful and conducted in a lawful manner. There must be substantial injury done, and the act or negligence complained of <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>must be the cause of the injury. If, therefore, the jury find that the defendant has been guilty of negligence in the care of its waste, and that the plaintiff has suffered a substantial loss as the result of tire presence of the waste in the stream, then a cause of action has been established and compensation should be made for the loss sustained.</p>
    <p id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[202,697,1166,1161]]]'>What is that loss ? The burden of showing its nature and extent is on the plaintiff. If sickness of himself or other members of his family is alleged, the character and duration of the sickness should be shown, and the expenses or suffering incident to it, and the fact that it was caused by the presence of the odor arising from the waste should be made to appear. If loss of business is alleged, this should be shown with the like degree of certainty. The facts from which the jury may determine whether there has been a loss of custom at the hotel, due to the presence of the odor of the waste, and how great that loss has been, should be shown. It is not enough for the plaintiff, after having shown that a few transients went elsewhere for a night or failed to return to his hotel on their next visit to Mahanoy City, to guess that Ids loss of profits due to this single cause would reach eight hundred dollars per annum. If he has any knowledge of what his income was during the six years preceding the bringing of this suit, whether there was a falling off in its amount, and what that falling off was, he should lay the facts before the jury. If he does not know the facts or does not choose to disclose them, he cannot substitute a mere conjecture. Absolute accuracy is not required, but such facts as fairly lead to a conclusion and guide the jury in fixing the amount of his loss from this cause, should be laid before them.</p>

This subject was brought to the attention of the learned judge by the plaintiff’s third point, which asked that the jury be instructed that “ In determining this question, you may take into consideration whether or not the injury complained of was continued after the beginning of the present suit; the fact that an injunction was issued by the court to restrain the defendant, and whether or not said injunction was violated by the defendant.” The fact that the defendant continued the negligent practice complained of after the suit was brought, was, if shown, a proper subject for consideration in determining whether exemplary <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>damages should be awarded or not. But the equity case was pending and undecided when this case was tried. The plaintiff had a right to go into equity in order to restrain, and to go into a court of law to recover damages for the negligent manner of dealing with the waste of the gas works ; but the fact that an action at law was pending would not help a chancellor in reaching a proper conclusion, nor would the fact that a bill was pending in equity be of any service to a jury in settling the damages which should be awarded to the plaintiff. Equally without significance was the fact that an application for an attachment was pending in the equity case. The application is the act of the plaintiff. When it is heard and determined, the defendant, if found guilty, will be punished for the contempt in the court whose mandate he has disregarded. But the jury in this case have no right to inquire “ whether or not said injunction was violated by the defendant,” and punish it for such violation by imposing exemplary damages upon it. It is not the violation of an order of a court of equity, but some act of wantonness directed toward the plaintiff, that must be found by the jury as a basis for the imposition of exemplary damages. If this was not so, it might happen that the court whose process it is charged has been violated, might on full hearing acquit the defendant of the alleged contempt, and discharge the rule for the attachment; while, in the meantime, a jury sitting in another court may have convicted and punished him for the offence which a chancellor after full investigation finds that he did not commit.</p>
