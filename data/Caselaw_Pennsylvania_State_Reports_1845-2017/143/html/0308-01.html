Reber, who died on August 27, 1887, was called for audit, when Elizabeth Reber, the widow of the testator, proved for allowance out of the estate in the executor’s hands, a note, not under seal, made by the testator January 27, 1873, as follows:</p>

In the court’s opinion, this note should not pay interest during the testator’s lifetime. True, the presumption is that the interest on a note is payable from the time it demands interest, in ordinary cases. Between husband and wife it is otherwise. In such cases, the presumption of law is that they lived off such interest, and that they consumed it from year to year; and this presumption may be rebutted only by showing that the husband and wife lived apart, each upon his or her own income.</p>

    <p id="b334-7" data-blocks='[["BL_334.7",334,[274,1110,1168,345]]]'>The sole question in this case is whether appellant, as a creditor of her deceased husband’s estate, is entitled to interest on the amount of her claim evidenced by his note of January 27, 1873, in which he promises “ to pay to my wife Elizabeth, or order, the sum of seventeen hundred and twenty-five dollars on demand, with lawful interest from this date until paid; without defalcation, value received.”</p>
    <p id="b334-8" data-blocks='[["BL_334.8",334,[268,1467,1174,807]]]'>There was no question as to the genuineness of the note, nor any allegation, even, that any part thereof, either principal or interest, had ever been paid or in any way satisfied. The learned judge appears to have thought, however, that no interest should be allowed until after the death of the maker, because, between husband and wife, as he expressed it, “the presumption of law is that they lived off such interest and consumed it from year to year; and this presumption can only be rebutted by showing that husband and wife lived apart, each on his or her own income.” He evidently misapplied the principle of presumption which sometimes arises from an entirely different state of facts. In the case of an express, written promise to pay interest, etc., such as we have in this case, the principle he intended to invoke can never become applicable, except under special qualifying circumstances which must, of course, be shown by competent evidence.</p>
