While the owner of the coal, as the owner, as well as by virtue of the reservation in his deed, has the right to mine and take out the coal, yet in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, it is his duty to leave sufficient supports for the surface. It is not a question of careful mining or of negligent mining, but whether the supports which are left are sufficient to maintain the surface. Or, to put the principle in another way, it is held that the owner of the underlying coal owes a duty to the owner of the overlying surface, of sufficient support. Therefore, if by reason of his taking out the coal, or if by reason of his failure to put proper supports in the place of the coal which is taken out, the surface subsides and the owner of- the surface suffers injury, he is entitled to recover such damages as he may have sustained, and this in the absence, too, of any contract to that effect.</p>

We negative that proposition; because, as we understand the law, the right of action for any injury which may have occurred to the surface by reason of insufficient support, did not accrue until the injury took place, and therefore, there could have been no right of action in anybody until this twentieth of October, 1883; and then the right of action was in the person or persons to whom the duty of support to the surface was owing.</p>
