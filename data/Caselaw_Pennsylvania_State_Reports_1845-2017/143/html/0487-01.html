The question arising in this case is important, touching the right to and value of the easement which the plaintiff claims has been violated by the defendants. This easement is in itself a very valuable property, in a pecuniary point of view, worth doubtless many thousands of dollars to the plaintiff owner, and the property No. 908 Chestnut street would sell for an amount proportionately less on account of being subject to said restrictions the right to which in the plaintiff constitutes the easement. And, although there is no evidence as to the value of the said property, No. 908, yet it may be assumed that, when said Louis E. Eridenberg bought said property in the year 1875 for §27,500, subject to mortgages for §45,000, he gave much less than said property would have sold for if it <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>had been free of said restrictions. The said restrictions, if enforced, are of great value in another sense to the dominant lot, the restricted space affording light and air to workmen, through a large number of windows in the west wall of said Orne’s storehouse. The use of said space is not merely a convenience, but it is necessary to the enjoyment of the plaintiff’s premises. The right, however, to the easement in this case which has been violated, depends in nowise on its utility, or even necessity, but upon a contract, having originated in a grant (as above recited) from E. S. Burd, who necessarily paid for the easement by an allowance or deduction from the consideration for which he conveyed said property, No. 908 Chestnut street, to said Thomas C. Rockhill, his heirs and assigns.</p>

It is stated above that if said restrictions created by said Burd in his grant to Rockhill, his heirs and assigns, etc., are valid and subsisting restrictions, then that said long frame building and said bulk-window and the Clinton frame building are manifest violations thereof; and that the permitted use of said brick building on Sansom street for any other purpose than that of a stable and coach-house, without the owner plaintiff’s consent, is also a violation thereof. The master now submits that the said restrictions are valid and subsisting restrictions, entitling the owner of the property, No. 906 Chestnut street, to the interference of a court of equity by injunction to restrain the continuance of such violations. As to the right of the owner plaintiff to the benefit and advantage of said restrictions, and of the liability of said defendants, trustees, and their land to bear the burden of the restrictions, there can be no dispute.....</p>

Rockhill, his heirs and assigns.] 8 By the terms of the grant they were made expressly operative upon the assigns of said Rockhill. They, therefore, ran with the land, because the liability to conform to said restrictions passed to the assignees of the land, No. 908; and so the easement, or right to take advantage of said restrictions, reserved by said grantor Burd, ran with his other land adjoining on the east, for the benefit of which the easement was created, because it passed to the successive assignees of said other land.

The statute of limitations bars the plaintiff’s right to prohibit a use of the Sansom-street stable, for purposes other than those of a stable and coach-house. The premises are no longer used as a concert- and drinking-saloon; they are now occupied by the Edison Light Company as an office. But the injunction is against the right to use the building for any other purpose than that of a stable and coach-house. As early as 1859 or 1860, Clinton, a former owner, converted this stable into a brush factory, and used it for that purpose until his removal in 1870. The building does not appear to have been used as a stable for thirty years. We submit that all right to restrict the use of this building, within the terms of the original conditions, is barred by the statute. There has been a continuous adverse user' for other purposes, sufficient, under the most strict construction of the statute, to bar any right to complain, even in a court of common law.</p>

The plaintiff is barred by his laches from demanding equitable relief concerning the uses and structures complained of. All the structures complained of were erected long prior to the filing of the bill. It is averred in the answers, and is to be taken as true, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that they were all erected twenty-one years prior to 1875. The plaintiff’s building was erected many years before the bill was filed. He saw, and could not fail to see the structures through his western windows. He could not enter or leave his own building, without seeing the bulk-window in front of the Chestnut-street store. He permitted years to elapse without making objection, and in the meantime new rights had accrued. A chancellor does not interfere, even if the fact of injury be established, by way of injunction, certainly not by way of mandatory injunction; where there is a remedy at law, and after the plaintiff has slept upon his rights for a much shorter time: German R.

The character of the locality in which the premises are situated has changed to such an extent that the restrictions, or many of them, imposed in 1825, are no longer operative. To require that the defendants shall now erect on the rear of their lot nothing but privies, milk-houses, and bath-houses, would be to require that they should maintain vacant a space originally designated for securing light and air for a residence long since, demolished. The plaintiff is not suing at common law for a breach of covenant. He is demanding the assistance of a chancellor, and be may not expect it unless he show a grievance not adequately redressible by a court of common law. Relief by the enforcement of restrictive conditions has been refused repeatedly by a court of equity, where, by reason of a change in the character of the locality, it appeared that the attempt of the plaintiff to enforce the covenant was unreasonable: Page v.

Upon the affirmative allegation of the defendants that the restrictions are obsolete, the reasons for them being gone, and the uses of the properties and neighborhood radically changed, requiring proof by the defendants, no evidence was offered. It is not true in fact. The grantor in the deed manifested in the most positive way his intention to create, secure, and continue these restrictions, for the benefit of the future improvement of his lot. Their value was, not only to secure light and air to the adjoining property, but to lessen the risk of fire and annoyance from many uses to which the prohibited structures might be devoted: Yeaton’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=105%20Pa.%20127" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="105 Pa. 127">105 Pa. 127</a>.

    <p id="b524-7" data-blocks='[["BL_524.6",524,[263,612,1169,502]]]'>This was a bill filed in the court below to restrain the defendants, who are the appellants here, from continuing to maintain certain erections on the premises 908 Chestnut street, Philadelphia, upon the ground that they were erected in violation of certain building restrictions imposed upon said property by Edward Shippen Burd, when he sold and conveyed it to Thomas C. Rockhill in 1825. The title to the adjoining or Burd property has been vested by numerous mesne conveyances in the plaintiff, and the Rockhill property is now owned by the appellants as testamentary trustees.</p>
    <p id="b524-8" data-blocks='[["BL_524.7",524,[262,1123,1169,706]]]'>The three principal matters complained of in the bill are: (a) A stable and coach-house on Sansom street; (b) a bulk window on Chestnut street; and (c) two frame buildings between the Chestnut-street front building, and the back buildings on Sansom street. The court sustained the bill, and awarded the injunction prayed for. As to the stable, the injunction merely prohibited its use “ for any purpose whatever, except that of a stable and coach-house.” It could not have been any broader, for the reservation expressly permitted its erection, nor did the reservation limit its use or occupancy further than may be implied from the designation of the building as a “ stable and coach-house.” As to the other buildings, the injunction was mandatory, and the decree is broad enough to require their destruction.</p>
    <p id="b524-9" data-blocks='[["BL_524.8",524,[262,1837,1171,401]]]'>The answer avers that the erections complained of are the same that existed on the premises when the defendants’ testator first viewed and bought the premises in 1875, and had then existed for more than twenty-one years previously. There is no finding by the master which essentially contradicts the answer in this respect. Exact dates are not very material, in our view of the case, as it is undisputed that all the structures were there many years before this bill was filed.</p>

He might have brought his action at law, or he might, as he did, file his bill. By adopting the latter remedy he submitted his case to the conscience of a chancellor, who will or will not enforce a mere <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>legal right, as the equities of the case demand. A chancellor does not, and ought not to interfere by way of mandatory injunction, even though the injury be clearly established, where there has been long-continued delay in asserting the right, and a remedy exists at law. The plaintiff had only to look out of his side windows to see the erections in the yard, and the bulk window on Chestnut street was plainly before him every day as he entered and left his own store. It must not be forgotten that the defendants did not put up the offending building; nor did their testator. He found them there when he purchased the property, and may well have supposed that the restrictions were no longer in force. Be that as it may, the fact remains that the plaintiff was guilty of very gross laches in enforcing his rights. If there is anything well settled in equity, it is that a chancellor will not extend the aid of an injunction where the party has slept for a long time upon his rights, j Authorities might be cited without number, were it necessary. I shall refer to a few only.</p>
    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[229,1306,1167,145]]]'>I find the law upon this subject nowhere better expressed than in 2 High on Inj., 1159. It covers the present ease so fully that I give the extract at some length:</p>
    <blockquote id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[230,1459,1168,962]],["BL_526.1",526,[255,385,1170,605]]]'>“ In considering applications for relief by injunction against the breach of restrictive covenants contained in conveyances of real property, the courts require due diligence upon the part of the plaintiff seeking the relief, and laches or acquiesence on his part in the violation of the restrictive covenant will ordinarily defeat his application. Indeed, equity requires the utmost diligence in this class of cases upon the part of him who invokes its preventive aid, and a slight degree of acquiesence is sufficient to defeat the application, since every relaxation which plaintiff permits in allowing erections to be made in violation of the covenant amounts pro tanto to a disaffirmance of the obligation. Where, therefore, plaintiff lies by for a period of four or five months, permitting defendants to go on with their erections in disregard of the covenant, he will be denied relief by injunction; and where a vendor of real property takes from each of several purchasers a covenant that he will leave unbuilt a certain portion of the premises conveyed, he will not be permitted to enjoin a breach of this covenant by one of the purchasers, when he has permitted prior purchasers to violate <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>it without taking proceedings against them, And, generally, whenever plaintiff stands idly by, and permits the erection complained of to be made, and expenses to be incurred therein, without objecting, his application for the aid of a court of equity comes too late, and will not be entertained. Thus, where purchasers of real estate have bought upon condition that they are to use the land for a specific purpose, and none other, they will not be restrained from using it for other purposes when "plaintiff has permitted them to go on without objection, and to incur large expenses in the work proposed, no sufficient excuse being shown for the delay in invoking the aid of equity.”</blockquote>

Were it necessary to go further, a strong argument might be made against awarding the injunction by reason of the changed circumstances. When Mr. Burd conveyed this property to Mr. Rockhill, in 1825, he lived in the old mansion at the southwest corner of Ninth and Chestnut streets. The lot was over one hundred feet in front, and extended back, with a stable on the Sansom-street front. The house had wings on each' side, receding somewhat from the front line of the main building. It was natural that he should restrict the building on Chestnut street, to the line of his wings, and the erection of high buildings in the rear, yet he permitted the erection of a stable and coach-house on the rear of the lot similar to his own. After Mr. Burd’s death, the whole scene was changed. The old Burd mansion was demolished, and a row of stores now occupy its site. There is nothing to show that the erections on 908 interfere in any sensible degree with plaintiff’s enjoyment of light and air. The stable has not been used for many years as such ; it is now used as an office by the Edison Light Company. The location <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>is no longer a residential neighborhood, and a stable there would be far more objectionable than its present use, even if it could now be rented for that purpose. This entire change of circumstances and surroundings might well make a chancellor hesitate ere he applied the strong arm of an injunction. There is a line of well-decided eases which hold that such changes in the neighborhood, the character of the improvements, and the purposes to which they are applied, are sufficient to justify a chancellor in refusing an injunction to restrain violations of building restrictions.
