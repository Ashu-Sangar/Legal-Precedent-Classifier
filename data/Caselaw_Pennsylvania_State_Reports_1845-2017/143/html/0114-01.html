Griffith, a practising physician, testified for the plaintiff that on July 28, 1885, he was walking up Tenth street below Washington Avenue, and, hearing a child scream, turned and saw the child between the fore legs of one of the horses drawing a beer wagon. The team was following the street-railway track on a descend<a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>ing grade, and was moving at a fast trot. The driver was sitting with his hands in his lap and his head down, the witness being of the opinion he was asleep, “and in no condition to drive in a dangerous place.” The witness shouted to the driver, and rushed to get the child, which was being turned about by the fore legs of the horse. As the driver checked up the horses, the witness reached for the child, when the latter received a blow from the horse’s hind foot and was thrown before the front wheel of the wagon. The wheel, running along the railway track, struck the child’s head just under the ear, and would have crushed it had not the witness snatched it away.</p>

The oculist, Dr. Randall, testified that there was atrophy of the optic nerve of the right eye, and that the sight was substantially lost. Upon statements made to him by the parents of the child as to the facts of the injury, and in response to a hypothetical question including as a fact the statement of a fracture of the skull, the oculist expressed his opinion that the injuries received in the accident would account for the defective condition of the eye. Other expert witnesses, as well as Dr. Randall, testified to the opinion that the defective eyesight was not congenital. There was no testimony tending to show that there was a fracture of the child’s skull.</p>

There was some confusion about the account which was given by the driver, and it may be that it was more or less affected by his imperfect knowledge of the language. What he said, substantially as I understand it, was, that he was going down Tenth street slowly; that he was not asleep; that he saw the child "with other children playing upon the right-hand side of the street; that they ran across onto the left-hand side; that he pulled up and he hallooed to them; that he pulled up his horses and came to a stop; that this little girl started to run to the other side of the street, and in an effort to pick up something that she had dropped, or for some other purpose, got under the feet of the horse and was injured. If there was no negligence on the part of the driver, or if there was negligence, and these injuries were caused solely and only because of the fact that the child herself ran under the horse’s feet, the verdict should be for the defendant.</p>

The permanent injury which is alleged is the loss of the sight of her right eye. There was some reference in the testimony to injuries in her stomach, but I do not understand that they were pressed very strongly, or that the evidence is very clear, but that is a question for you. It is asserted that because of these injuries the child has lost the use of her right eye.</p>

In response to the hypothetical question which was put to him, his answer substantially was, that the injuries received in this accident could account for this loss of sight. It is my duty to call your attention to the fact that when this hypothetical question was put, there was included in it, as a fact presented to him, the statement of a fracture of the skull, and, based upon the facts presented, he gave that testimony. I recall nothing in the evidence to show that the child’s skull was fractured. Dr. Schweinitz says that the injuries were the most likely cause of the loss of sight, and Dr. Jackson, a witness produced by the defendant, who had not examined the child, but who had heard the testimony as to her injuries and the condition as given by Dr. Randall, says that the loss of sight may have been caused by a disease, from over-use of the eye, from studying in an improper light, or, it might have been congenital or from some fault; it might arise suddenly, or from a local injury; and he went on to testify that in the latter event it would not be likely to develop for several months. I understood Dr. Randall to say that this injury to the eye might develop slowly, after the expiration of some months, and that as to whether it would develop after years, was an uncertain question.</p>

It is alleged that the accident was the result of the negligent driving of the team. There was evidence that at the time of the occurrence the driver was asleep, and that the team was on a descending grade and going at a rapid gait. The child when discovered was upon her feet and being turned around between the fore legs of one of the horses, but before she could be rescued she was thrown down and struck by one wheel of the wagon and sustained injuries from which she has never recovered, including the loss of the sight of one eye. The negligence and the accident were, under the evidence, closely connected, and to the ordinary observer inseparable. The inference that the former caused the latter is not a strained one, but a reasonable and natural result of the testimony. Aside from the statement of the driver, whose account of the affair was incoherent and confused, there was nothing to indicate that the child ran hastily or impulsively under the horses or the wagon, and certainly there is no presumption that she did so. Besides, a child four years old cannot be held responsible for contributory negligence. We cannot assume that she was a trespasser, or that her actions were negligent and rash, merely because her evidence fails to explain how she became involved in the peril in which she was discovered. In the absence of testimony on this point, the reasonable inference is that she was run over while crossing or playing in the streets ; and when, as here, it affirmatively appears that the driver was asleep and the heavy team and wagon were moving down grade at a rapid gait, it is a question for the jury whether the negligence of the defendant caused the injuries.</p>

Connell, <a href="/pa/88/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="88 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="1061239" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0520-01">88 Pa. 520</a>, cited by the appellant, it was held that there was no defect in the car, or <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>neglect in its management, and that the company was not responsible for injuries received by a child from his sudden and unexpected attempt to mount the front platform of the car while the driver, who was also conductor, was on the rear platform and could not have foreseen or guarded against the <em>act; </em>but Mr. Justice Gordon, in delivering the opinion of the court, said; “ It is not a case of mere negligence on the child’s part, as if it had been run over whilst crossing or playing in the street: that would raise a question very different from the one in hand.” In Lombard Ry. Co. v. Steinhart, <a href="/pennyp/2/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="2 Pennyp. 358" data-case-ids="218982" data-case-paths="/pennyp/2/0358-01">2 Penny. 358</a>, substantially the same questions were raised that we are invited to consider in this case, and they were decided against the company. There is a striking resemblance between the company’s sixth point in the case cited, and the appellant’s third point in the case under consideration. In Lombard Ry. Co. v. Steinhart, <a href="/pennyp/2/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="2 Pennyp. 358" data-case-ids="218982" data-case-paths="/pennyp/2/0358-01">supra,</a> the plaintiff recovered a verdict in the court below, and in affirming the judgment this court said: “ The main question, then, was whether the negligence of the railway company caused the injury. While some of the evidence was conflicting, yet there was amply sufficient, if believed, to justify the jury in finding it as a fact. There was evidence that the driver of the car was intoxicated, and driving at a rapid rate of speed, without giving that attention to the observance of any object on the track which his duty required.”</p>
    <p id="b145-4" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[185,1613,1167,592]]]'>There was no exception taken in the court below to the admission of evidence that the loss of sight was attributable to the accident, nor was the court requested to withdraw it from the jury. It is now suggested and argued that the testimony on this point was insufficient to justify an inference that the defect of" vision was the result of the casualty, and we are requested to convict the court below of error, because there was not an unsolicited instruction to that effect. It is an unusual request, but as we think the testimony of the experts required the jury to determine whether the loss of sight was one of the disabilities caused by the accident, we dismiss it without further comment.</p>
