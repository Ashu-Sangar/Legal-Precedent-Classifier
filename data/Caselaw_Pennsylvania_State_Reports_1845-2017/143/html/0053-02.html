Now, gentlemen of the jury, that is a pure question of law, and not free from difficulty to my mind, but it is our duty to follow in the line, we think, that the Supreme Court has indicated in reference to this subject. We take it to be law that, at the time Mr. Lauth accepted these drafts, he having accepted them alone, without any other manager signing them with, him, he has made himself liable to pay those drafts. He, as a manager of that association, in order to avoid a general liability for the debts of that association, was required to see that all the provisions and regulations of that act of assembly were duly and reasonably complied with. If he did not so see that these regulations were complied with, whether he was manager or not, he would be individually liable for the debts of the association. When it makes a contract, that is, for which the association would be liable, this act is specific in its declarations that when an amount exceeds five hundred dollars the instrument of liability, or cause of liability, or purpose of liability, must be reduced to writing and signed by two of the managers; otherwise the act of assembly in its intent makes them individually responsible.]4</p>

The first is, that the business of the association shall be conducted in an orderly way; that the members of the association, who may not be managers, may be protected from the carelessness or bad management of any one member of the association; and, as a guaranty of the act of the association, that it has entered into it in good faith for the benefit of the association, or the members of the association, at least two of the managers shall agree that it is a proper act for the association to engage in, and thus fix the liability of the association so as to bind the <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>association itself and the association’s property. Mr. Lauth, being a member of this association and a manager of it, was bound to know what the provisions of this act of assembly were. He could not escape by alleging that he did not know, because he must avail himself, in the management of that business, of the provisions of the act of assembly, or else be liable as a general partner. The second reason is, that if -there is a manager of the association who incurs a liability which is not incurred according to the provisions of this fifth section of this act of assembly, to an amount which exceeds five hundred dollars, in order that the persons to whom that debt is due may not be defeated from recovering that with which he may have parted to one supposed to have authority, except on a promise to pay, because that might be a fraud upon that person, so that if the association was not liable he would have a remedy against the individual who accepted the drafts, therefore it was the duty of Mr. Lauth to see that the association was made properly liable, otherwise he is made liable by this act of assembly in his individual capacity.</p>

It was merely intended to enact that no liability should bind the association without the prescribed formalities.

    <p id="b85-5" data-blocks='[["BL_85.4",85,[205,508,1175,137]]]'>There is no question that the plaintiffs are bona-fide holders for value of these drafts, and their right to recover against some one is therefore undoubted.</p>
    <p id="b85-6" data-blocks='[["BL_85.5",85,[204,661,1176,817]]]'>1. Under the plain and unambiguous language of § 5, act of June 2, 1874, P. L. 271, and the equally plain decisions of this court, these acceptances, being for amounts exceeding $500, not having been signed by two managers of the association, are not binding upon it: Pittsb. Melt. Co. v. Reese, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20Pa.%20855" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="118 Pa. 855">118 Pa. 855</a>. The restriction of the doctrine of ultra vires, referred to in the appellant’s argument, is not applicable to cases arising under the act of 1874. The doctrine of ultra vires is not founded upon any positive statute, but is the creation of the courts, as is also the restriction of that doctrine to which appellant’s counsel refer. There is no analogy between that doctrine and the positive statutory provision above cited. The position that contracts informally made by limited partnership associations are binding upon them, if carried into execution by the other party, has been overruled by this court: Walker v. Brewing Co., <a href="/pa/131/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="131 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="810308" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0546-01">131 Pa. 546</a>.</p>
    <p id="b85-7" data-blocks='[["BL_85.6",85,[201,1485,1178,919]]]'>2. That Lauth himself is personally liable, is plain both from the express wording of the statute and upon principle. Its plain and obvious meaning is that if any manager attempts to bind the company for a liability exceeding $500, without writing, signed by at least two managers, the company shall not be bound, but the person so attempting to bind it shall be personally liable. This is the only construction which will give effect to the entire language of the section. But, on general principles, the defendant is liable, having attempted to bind his principal beyond the extent of the authority delegated to him: Story on Agency, 264; Evans on Agency, 301; Parsons on Contracts, 67; Kroeger v. Pitcairn, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20Pa.%20317" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="101 Pa. 317">101 Pa. 317</a>; Hampton v. Speckenagle, 9 S. &amp; R. 212; Layng v.

    <p id="b86-6" data-blocks='[["BL_86.5",86,[257,447,1188,1115]]]'>The plaintiff is the indorsee of a draft drawn by E. S. Wheeler &amp; Co., on the Howard Rolling-Mill Company, Limited, payable to their own order. The drawee is a joint-stock association or limited partnership, organized under the act of June 2, 1874. An acceptance was written across the face of the draft, and executed in the name of the drawee, “ per Bernard Lauth, Chairman.” The plaintiff seeks to charge Lauth personally with the amount of the draft, alleging that his execution of the acceptance was not enough to bind the company, and a judgment against him was recovered in the court below. The ground of the recovery is found in the following provision of the fifth section of the act of 1874: “No debt shall be contracted or liability incurred for said association except by one or more of the said managers, and no liability for an amount exceeding five hundred dollars except against the person incurring it shall bind said association, unless reduced to writing and signed by at least two managers.” The signing of the acceptance, “per Bernard Lauth, Chairman,” was treated as an attempt to bind the company for a debt exceeding five hundred dollars contrary to the provision above quoted, which imposed no liability on the company, but rendered him personally liable for the amount of the draft.</p>
    <p id="b86-7" data-blocks='[["BL_86.6",86,[254,1581,1184,867]],["BL_87.1",87,[190,397,1171,1007]]]'>The first question presented by these facts relates to the duty to inquire resting on the purchaser of a bill or note. When a note is offered, the bank or other party to whom it is presented is bound to take notice of the instrument, and to know whether it is negotiable. Notice must also be taken of the maker or drawee, and whether such maker or drawee is a private person, a firm, a corporation, or an unincorporated association. The purchaser must also know, at his peril, what is necessary 'to constitute an acceptance or an indorsement, and, in the case of an artificial person, who is the proper person to bind it. When this draft was presented at the counter of the plaintiff for discount, it came from E. S. Wheeler &amp; Co., who were drawers, payees, and indorsers. Their indorsement was an affirmance that the acceptance was properly executed, and an engagement that the drawee would pay, or they would do so for it: Chitty on Bills, 266; Wood’s Byles on Bills, 156. If the acceptance was not sufficient to bind the company, be<a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>cause not made as required by law, it was an unaccepted bill, which the purchaser could only take on the credit of the drawer and indorser: Byles on Bills, 168. Strangers dealing with a limited partnership or joint-stock association, organized under the act of 1874, are bound by the limitations imposed upon it by the act. This was distinctly ruled in Pittsburgh Melting Co. v. Reese, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20Pa.%20855" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="118 Pa. 855">118 Pa. 855</a>. The bank was bound to know, therefore, what was necessary to a valid acceptance by the Howard Rolling-Mill Company, Limited. It discounted this draft with knowledge that it was not accepted by the company until two managers had signed the acceptance on its behalf, and is in no position to complain that it was misled by Lauth, whatever ground of complaint it may have against its indorsers, from whom it derived its title. What the acceptance lacked, as the plaintiff alleges, was the name of another manager. If it had intended to rely on the responsibility of the drawee, it should have returned the draft that the acceptance might have been completed, but, as it did not do this, it is fair to presume that it was satisfied to take the draft on the credit of the drawers and indorsers.</p>
    <p id="b87-5" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[188,1423,1171,1016]],["BL_88.1",88,[284,397,1173,760]]]'>But, if this position could be regarded as doubtful, the defendant had a right to go to the jury on the question of fact. He denied that he desired or intended to bind the company by his signature to the acceptance. He testified that, although a manager and chairman of the board of managers, he was not engaged in the active business of the company; that Bancroft, who brought the draft to him, and told him that it would be protested and the credit of the company injured, unless it was accepted that day, was “the head man” in the management and direction of the business, and was also a manager. In regard to the signing of the acceptance, he testified: “ I was under the impression they needed two signers, and I signed as one of them.” Again, speaking of the same subject, he said: “I see I signed it across the draft, but I thought he (Bancroft) was to go and sign his name also.” He did just what it was necessary to do, as he understood it. He signed as one of the two managers needed, expecting Bancroft would sigh as the other. If Bancroft had done so, then the acceptance would have borne the names of two managers, and Lauth’s act in signing first would have imposed no personal liability. The forgetfulness <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>of Bancroft in enclosing the draft before the acceptance was completed, cannot be held to change the character of Lauth’s act, and render him liable as a matter of law. His liability depends on the fact which he so stoutly denies. If he made use of this draft as the means of incurring a debt in the name of the company, and binding the company for its payment by his single act of acceptance on its behalf, then it may be that the plaintiff has a just cause of action against him. But, if he signed, as he testifies that he did, so that his name should be one of the two that were needed, then, instead of disregarding, he was complying with the law; and, if the acceptance was not completed by the other manager, before sending the draft away, we do not see how Lauth can be charged with the whole debt because of the neglect, intentional or unintentional, of his fellow-manager to complete the acceptance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>
