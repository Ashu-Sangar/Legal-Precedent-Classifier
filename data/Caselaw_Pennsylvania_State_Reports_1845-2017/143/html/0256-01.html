Testimony for the defendant tended to show that when Frederick on the day named, demanded payment of the ten per cent, the defendant refused to pay, saying that he had subscribed to works to be erected in the borough of Auburn, and that the location of the works outside the borough limits absolved him from the obligation of his subscription ; that the conversation then drifted to other topics, and after talking for about three quarters of an hour on other matters, Frederici said to the defendant: “ Doctor, give me $50,” to which the defendant replied, “ Certainly; ” and thereupon <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>he wrote a cheek for $50 in favor of Frederici, and handed it to him.

Frederici testified for the plaintiff that he thought the defendant understood the request for $50 to be made in pursuance of the prior demand for the payment of ten per cent of the subscription, and gave the cheek as a payment on the subscription. The check was turned over to the secretary of the company by Frederici, who obtained from the secretary a receipt to the defendant for $50, as paid on account of his subscription. This receipt Frederici kept in his possession until after the commencement of the present action, when he offered it to the defendant who refused to accept it. There was some evidence for the plaintiff that the check for $50 was drawn in favor of the treasurer of the company.

The first question raised in the case is as to the legal liability of the defendant, Dr. Shultz, inasmuch as the works were not located in the borough of Auburn, but outside. This is an undisputed fact in this case. We gave this question the best consideration we were able to daring the progress of the trial. Taking into view the subscription list itself, which stipulates that the subscriptions are to a nut and bolt manufactory in the borough of Auburn, followed, as it was, by the letters patent, which created a corporation containing the same stipulation, that the business of the corporation was to be carried on in the borough of Auburn, we will instruct you, for the present at least, that the defendant would not be bound by his subscription if the works were located elsewhere. If they were located outside the borough <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>of Auburn, it would be in tbe face of tbe terms of tbe contract; and if this were all the evidence in the case upon this question, we would affirm the first point of the defendant, namely, “ That the defendant subscribed for the erection of a nut and bolt manufactory in the borough of Auburn; and, as a portion of the subscribers changed the place for the erection of the same outside of the borough of Auburn and in the township of West Brunswick, and erected the said manufactory there, the plaintiff cannot recover, and the verdict of the jury should be in favor of the defendant.” We would affirm that, if all the facts were embodied in that point. . The other stockholders, outside of Dr. Shultz, could not change the terms of the contract, by locating the manufactory elsewhere, and at the same time bind Dr. Shultz to his subscription, unless Dr. Shultz consented to it, unless he ratified it in some way.] 5 There are other facts given in evidence than those stated in the point, however, which bear upon that question, and which you will have to pass upon.</p>

The court, in giving judgment, said: ‘ The plaintiffs rely on an express contract, and they are bound to prove it as they allege it. Here, the proof is of an engagement to pay assessments for making a turnpike in a certain specified direction, and of the making a turnpike in a different direction. The defendant may truly say, Non hsee in foedera veni. He was not bound by the application of the directors to the legislature for the alteration of the course of the road, nor by the consent of the corporation thereto. Much fraud might be put in practice under a contrary decision.’ ” [The case is analogous to the one in hand, and we will therefore say to you, that if the evidence shows that this defendant subscribed his stock to a nut and bolt manufactory in the borough of Auburn, the letters patent, following the contract en<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>tered into by the defendant here, stipulating that the place of business was to be in the borough of Auburn, and the fact not being disputed that the manufactory was not erected in the borough of Auburn, but outside the borough, in the township of West Brunswick, the defendant would not be bound by his subscription, if this was the whole evidence in the case. But the other evidence in the case is also for your consideration.] 6</p>

[It is claimed here that this defendant by his conduct waived that right and rendered himself liable to this company for the amount of his assessments, although it should appear that he would not have been bound by his contract if he had chosen not to be. There has been considerable evidence presented to you upon that point. That he withdrew from this corporation, from the organization, before the charter was obtained, and that he had a right to withdraw from it at any time before the charter was actually issued, we understand is the position of his counsel.

There is no direct evidence here of his giving notice to the corporation or board of directors that he did withdraw his subscription. There is evidence that he refused to pay the assessments upon the ground of the change of location, and that this was communicated to perhaps two of the board of directors. It is held as a rule that, where a member of a board of directors is authorized to call upon a party in reference to the business of the corporation, what is said to him, any notice given to him, would be notice to the board of directors. It was the business of the corporation on which he went for the purpose of seeing the other party. There is some evidence that the defendant refused to pay his subscription upon the ground that the site had been changed, but the directors all swear, or most of them, that no communication was ever received from the defendant withdrawing his subscription <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>to the contract which we have read to you, or refusing to be bound by that contract because the works were not located in the borough of Auburn. However, there is some evidence here of his withdrawal. If so, under the very recent decision of our Supreme Court, there is a time, and that is the general rule of law, within which the withdrawal may be made. If the organization had been effected, if the proper steps had been taken in the matter, the defendant was -not at liberty to withdraw his subscription, particularly when action had been taken by the company with reference to his subscription, obligations entered into, contracts made, under the belief that he was a subscriber and would pay his stock.</p>

Until this time the whole scheme is inchoate, and the subscriber may withdraw. That is a question to be determined by the jury.

The point was not made in the court below, but on the contrary Jhe company requested the court to charge the jury: “ That if the defendant failed to give notice to the company of his intention to withdraw from the same before the fifth day of April, A. D. 1887, when the articles of incorporation were ready to file with the secretary of the commonwealth, his subscription to pay became absolute and binding upon him.” This point was a plain concession by the company that the time of the notice of an intention to withdraw from it, was material, and that the question whether the notice was given before the fifth of April was for the jury. An unqualified affirmance of the point was refused expressly on the ground that it left out of view the action of the stockholders, in changing the location of the plant without the consent of the appellee; but the learned judge, in answering the point, charged that a withdrawal after the fifth of April'would not excuse him from paying his subscription. So far as the request pertained to the submission of the question whether the appellee gave notice before the fifth of April of his intention to withdraw from the company, it was complied with. After this request and the answer there<a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>to, the complaint of the appellant that the question was submitted without evidence, will not be considered.

Until this is done, a subscription to the articles is a mere proposition to take the number of shares specified of the capital stock of the company thereafter to be formed, and is not a binding promise to pay. The obligation is inchoate merely, and can never become of force unless the corporation goes into effect in the mode pointed out by the statute: ” Thompson’s Liability of Stockholders, § 120.

It appears that the company has built its manufactory in an adjoining township, and carries on its business there, and it is conceded that it will not erect a manufactory in the borough of Auburn, as proposed in the subscription and charter. In the face of this showing and con<a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>cession can the corporation enforce payment of the subscription ? The obvious inducement to the subscription was the establishment of a manufacturing plant in the borough of Auburn, and that was its plainly declared purpose. It would be in direct violation of the terms of his contract, and unconscionable, to compel the subscriber to pay for the erection of a like plant in another locality. The selection of a site within the borough limits was within the power of the corporation under the subscription and charter, but it was not authorized by either to locate its manufactory in an adjoining township, and to require its objecting subscribers to pay for it. A material change in the route of a railway company has been held sufficient to discharge a subscriber: Thompson’s Liability of Stockholders, § 188, and cases cited. It is involved in the nature of a subscription to the stock of a company to construct a road from one place to another, that the termini are part of the contract, and if the company procure an act of assembly altering the termini of the road, the subscriptions are no longer binding: Plankroad Co. v.

So, in our case, when the corporation erected its manufactory in an adjoining township without the consent of the appellee, he had the right to consider the enterprise to which he had bound himself as abandoned and his contract at an end. As he has neither expressly nor impliedly waived this defence, we think he may rely on it as a sufficient answer to this action. The specifications of error are dismissed and</p>
