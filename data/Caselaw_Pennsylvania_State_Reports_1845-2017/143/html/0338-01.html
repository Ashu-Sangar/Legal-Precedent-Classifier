No controversy exists but that the defendant agreed, on the tenth day of November, 1885, to insure the property of the plaintiffs for the term of three years. The policy is in evidence. This policy contains certain conditions and stipulations with reference to notice to the insurer of encumbrances that may: be against the property, and requirements with reference to notice, and proofs of loss. The dwelling-house and certain personal property were destroyed by fire on the thirtieth day of October, 1888. The defendants admit by their affidavit of defence that notice of this loss was given to them. Within a few days after the fire, the defendants received from the plaintiffs what they, the plaintiffs, called their <em>proofs </em>of loss. The company notified the plaintiffs that they were insufficient, and declined to recognize them, and called attention to the respects in which they were insufficient. The plaintiffs wrote for these proofs, and they were returned to them, and finally, on the thirteenth of December, 1888, additional proofs were sent. These proofs -were received by the defendants. .They made no further communication to the plaintiffs with reference to the proofs, but retained them in their possession. [Subsequently, in February, they directed their agent to come on here for the purpose of settling this loss. He went upon the premises, had an interview with the plaintiffs, and after some discussion they agreed upon the sum of $1,520.10. The plaintiffs say that this was a compromise. They say that the defendants’ agent came there, saying that he came for the purpose of compromising their claim. Judge Russell, when he is called upon the stand, testifies as to his conversation with the agent of the defendants, and also uses the word “ compromise ” as the one that was used in this connection. And another witness, F. E. Jayne, who was present at this interview with Judge Russell, also uses <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>the word “ compromise ” in speaking of it. The agent himself says that he went there for the purpose of adjusting the loss, and that he adjusted it at the sum of $1,520.10.] 3</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b368-4" data-blocks='[["BL_368.4",368,[256,534,1172,1474]]]'>[They certainly had a right to accept these proofs of loss as sufficient, and to act upon them and adjust the loss. After having received and retained these papers, when they sent their agent, in the middle of February, to meet these plaintiffs and adjust this loss, and to agree upon the amount that should be paid to the plaintiffs, it was an acceptance of the former proofs of loss as a sufficient compliance with the conditions of the contract.] 4 [If this was a compromise of the claim in-controversy between these parties, and the agent had authority to make such a compromise, as a part of that compromise he had the authority to agree that the money should be paid promptly. It might be one of the considerations for the abatement, from the amount claimed upon the policy, that prompt payment should be made of the amount agreed upon. And if, in the exercise of this authority, they came together and agreed upon the terms of compromise and the amount that should be paid, and when it should be paid, and that transaction was ended in that respect, it could not be defeated by the subsequent signing of a paper, unless it was a clear relinquishment of the plaintiffs’ claim that had already been established and agreed upon. Did the agent of the defendants, under their directions, on the twentieth of February, come there to see the plaintiffs, and to adjust their loss? Did he meet these plaintiffs, and did they then agree upon a sum which was to be paid in satisfaction of this loss, and did the agent of the defendants agree that it should be paid promptly ? If they accepted the former proofs of loss as sufficient for their action in adjusting this loss, we do not think that after it was all over, new proofs of loss could be taken to defeat the rights of the plaintiffs.] 5</p>

The policy contains a provision that no action can be maintained unless brought within six months of the date of the loss. That would take it to the thirtieth or thirty-first of April, 1889. If the defendants’ theory is correct about this proof of loss that was signed on the twentieth of February, an action could not be brought until ninety days after the twentieth of February, which would be- about the twentieth of May. So that the plaintiffs could <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>not maintain an action brought after the thirtieth of April, and they could not maintain an action brought before the twentieth of May. If the claim of the defendants in this respect is true, the plaintiffs could not maintain any action at all, but this last paper which they call a proof of loss is an absolute bar to any action that could be brought by the plaintiffs. <em>We </em>do not think that it can be so considered. We do not think that under the circumstances, if the matter admits reasonably and fairly of another construction, it should'be so considered. We think you have a right to inquire whether the paper called proofs of loss, signed on the twentieth of February, was not rather a paper drawn for the purpose of making the assertion of the plaintiffs agree with the act of the defendant in respect to the abatement; that is, to make the proofs of loss agree with the amount of the claim as adjusted, and whether this was not the sole and only purpose of the paper at that time. If such was the fact, we do not think that this action is prematurely brought. We do not think that the plaintiffs are placed in a position where they have absolutely waived all right to recover, or to maintain any action whatever against the defendants.</p>

While the proposition of law is generally correct, the proposition of fact, in the latter part of this point, Ave cannot affirm. This proof of loss was not in existence, at all, at the time of the adjustment, according to the testimony of the witnesses, but was something that was signed after the parties had consummated their agreement of settlement. The only proofs of loss existing at the time this agreement was made were the proofs that were made <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>in December and November, and three months had expired since the filing of those proofs before this action was brought.

The insured cannot make evidence for himself; otherwise, the insurer would be entirely at the mercy of an unscrupulous man who might easily double the actual amount of his loss. Commonwealth Ins. Co. v. Sennett, <a href="/pa/41/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="41 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="480030" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0161-01">41 Pa. 161</a>, is very similar to the present one. In that case, the court below permitted the schedule, statements, and affidavits of the plaintiffs, relative to their loss, to be read, not only to prove compliance with the conditions of the policy as to preliminary proofs, but as prima facie evidence of the goods lost, as to quality and quantity, but not as to value; Held, to be error; for, there being nothing in <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>the policy making these papers evidence per se, they were not evidence of the goods lost, and should not have been read to the jury.

The fact that the loss has been adjusted by the insurers, does not necessarily entitle the assured to recover that amount. The adjustment of itself- merely amounts to an admission, on the part of the insurer, that the sum-fixed is due if the insured is entitled to have anything under the policy, and does not estop the insurer from setting up fraud on the part of the assured, or a breach of any of the conditions of the policy that operates to defeat the insurer’s liability: Wood on Fire Insurance, § 456.

The learned court did not fairly submit the effect of the proofs of loss of February 20, 1889, to the jury. When the plaintiffs gave that statement to the defendant, they expressly stipulated that “ all former proofs made by us are null and void.” There were therefore no other proofs in existence. By the terms of the policy, the defendant was not required to pay the amount agreed upon until ninety days thereafter; the suit was therefore brought prematurely, and cannot be maintained: Camberling v.

The main and about the only contested matter in this case, in the court below, was that relating to the question of compromise. No specific form is requisite to an adjustment. To render it binding it must be intended and understood by the parties to a policy to be absolute and final. An insurance company is bound by the acts of its adjuster, and by all that he does in relation to the adjustment and settlement of a loss, so far as he acts within the scope of his authority or employment, or apparent authority. Apparent authority seems to be the test. “ The same rules apply to insurance companies as apply in the case of individuals, and a person who is clothed with power to act for them at all, is treated as clothed with authority to bind them as to all matters within the scope of his real or apparent authority.....It is enough if the act is within the scope of the apparent power: <em>” </em>Wood on Fire Insurance, 2d ed., § 408. And “ when an insurance company, after a loss, has adjusted the claim therefor, and has agreed to pay a certain sum in liquidation of the claim, it cannot, in an action setting forth such facts, object that the action was not brought within the time limited in the policy: ” Wood on Fire Insurance, 2d ed., 450.</p>

If the loss is adjusted at a less sum than the property was insured for; or, in other words, if there was a compromise and a promise, there is a consideration for the promise, and the company is concluded from setting up any breach of the conditions of the policy by the insured in defence: Wood on Fire Insurance, 2d ed., § 482. A compromise, fairly entered into, discharges the original cause of action, which cannot be recurred to by either party: Berks Turnpike Co. v. Hendel, 11 S. &amp; R. 123; and the settlement of an existing controversy is a good consideration for an agreement of compromise: Cham<a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>berlain v.

McKelvey, Add. 56. In the case at bar, the amended proofs of loss returned December 13, 1888, relate back to the original proofs furnished on November 20th. Hence, the ninety days before bringing suit would expire on February 20, 1889, the very day the adjuster appeared and settled, promising that the money would be paid in two weeks. The agent, therefore, did not make any waivers, or change any of the conditions of the policy, except so far as he had authority or apparent authority to do.</p>

In plaintiffs’ declaration or statement of claim, the policy of insurance, loss by fire, proofs and amended proofs of loss, offer to furnish any other information that might be requested, etc., are fully set forth as inducement to the alleged compromise and promise to pay. After reciting all these, and averring that “ no other or further complaint was made, nor information asked by said defendant from said plaintiffs, in relation to the circumstances of the fire aforesaid, or the loss and damage thereby suffered,” the plaintiffs further aver that “ on or about the first day of February, 1889, the said defendant,"by its duly authorized agent, W. M. Melchert, came to and upon the premises .... where the fire occurred, and where the loss and damage to said plaintiffs was suffered, and then and there compromised, adjusted and settled with said plaintiffs their claim of $1,683.21 for the sum of $1,520.10, under an agreement with said plaintiffs that said sum should be paid them by defendant within a week or ten days thereafter, in full satisfaction of their claim for their loss and damage aforesaid.” In its affidavit of defence, the.. company alleges that in February, 1889, another or third, - “ proof of loss was asked for by it through its agent W. M. Melchert, and one was executed and given by said plaintiffs to said agent of said defendant, wherein the amount of said plaintiffs’ claim from said defendant as set forth was $1,520.10,” etc., but it denies that Melchert, either in behalf of the com<a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>pany or of laimself, compromised, adjusted and settled with the plaintiffs as alleged in their statement.</p>
    <p id="b375-4" data-blocks='[["BL_375.4",375,[219,486,1173,915]]]'>As a witness on behalf of the defendant, Melchert testified on the trial, that he was then and had been for over five years in the employ of the company as its special agent and adjuster; that as such he visited the premises of the plaintiffs in February, 1889, “ for the purpose of adjusting the loss and investigating the circumstances.” In answer to the question: “ State whether or not you adjusted the loss with them that day,” his reply was, “ I did.” He further testified, in substance, that after the loss had been adjusted, the plaintiffs in his presence executed a proof of loss which he forwarded to the company within twenty-four hours thereafter. The plaintiffs both testified on the trial fully and circumstantially to the facts connected with the compromise and settlement of their loss by Melchert as agent of the company, in February, 1889, substantially as averred in their statement of claim above quoted. They both denied that they then signed an additional proof of loss, but admitted signing a paper containing, as they were informed, the terms of settlement made with Melchert:</p>

That question was fairly submitted to the jury and found in favor of the plaintiffs. That finding of fact was conclusive against the defendant, and virtually disposed of every ground of defence based on conditions contained in the policy. “ Where an insurance company, after a loss, has adjusted the claim therefor, and has agreed to pay a certain sum in liquidation of the claim, it cannot, in an action setting forth such facts, object that the action was not brought within the time limited in the policy. In such a case, the action is not upon the policy, but upon the agreement to pay. Neither, in such case, can it set up a breach of warranty or of any of the conditions of the policy in defence, for adjusting the loss and promising to pay it is a waiver of all breaches on the part of the assured, and of all defences which might have been made except for such waiver. A breach of warranty or of any condition in the policy must be insisted on when the claim is made, and before an agreement to pay the loss has been made: ” 2 Wood on Insurance, § 450. In other words, after an adjust<a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>ment or compromise of the claim it is too late to impale the plaintiffs on any of the sharp conditions sometimes found in policies of insurance.</p>
