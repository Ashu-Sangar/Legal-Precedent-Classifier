Nothing in the “ written obligation ” of July 29, 1858, bound the defendant to do more than was imposed upon it by its charter. The ordinances the defendant bound itself to obey were such only as could be validly and legally enacted by the councils, and to those it was in any event subjected. If the obligation bound the defendant to do more than was required by its charter, it was not enforceable. The ordinance of May 5, 1858, gave to the defendant the consent of councils to use the streets; but the defendant’s charter came from the sovereign which prescribed the terms of the grant. No right was given to any other body to alter these terms. The sole power given was to say whether the grant should or should not be enjoyed upon the conditions the legislative body had prescribed, and not upon any other conditions. The point involved in these propositions has been too frequently decided by this court to be considered as open or as capable of discussion: Pittsburgh’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="115 Pa. 4" data-case-ids="551670" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0004-01">115 Pa. 4</a>; Faust v.

In this last case it was said, Strong, J.: “ But it is said councils may pass ordinances inconsistent with the exercise of the corporate rights of the defendants, and restrictive of their chartered privileges; and that an agreement to observe such ordinances would be a consent to give up their <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>powers. To this I answer, this is supposing a legal impossibility. The councils can pass no such ordinances. They have no such power, and their legislative authority can be enlarged by no agreement.” Moreover, the proper authorities of the city never in fact exercised the power to order a new pavement, even if it were vested with it. Such power could be exercised only by virtue of and under an ordinance of councils. Councils are a legislative not an executive body; and it is essential to legislation that it shall have the assent of the mayor. The resolution of councils of May 6, 1886, ordering a new pavement to be substituted for an old one, was not legislation and amounted to nothing. And the ordinance of December 12, 1881, under which the power was claimed to have been exercised, was applicable only to the paving of streets not already paved.</p>

L. 35, are those under which the application of the defendant, based on the affidavit of the president of the company, was made for a change of venue. The first question is, to whom must it appear by affidavit that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had ? Surely, the answer is, to the court before whom the application is made. If a change of venue is to be granted, without any discretion in the case, merely upon the presentation of the affidavit, then every whim, every fancy, even every desire for delay in a cause, could be taken advantage of. The act requires more than the mere making of the affidavit. It means that the statements set forth shall be true; that the truth shall appear to the court, and, further, that by reason thereof a fair and impartial trial cannot be had. . The matter is clearly within the discretionary power -of the court. Under the interpretation given by the defendant, the court is deprived of any discretion whatever. Yet, under § 2, the change of venue is to be ordered if the court or the judge shall be “satisfied of the truth of the facts alleged.” Even though the facts may be true, in the belief of the parties concerned, it must further appear to the satisfaction of the court that local prejudice exists, and that by reason thereof a fair and impartial trial cannot be had.</p>

The “written obligation” of July 29, 1858, of the Girard College railway company, was offered in evidence as part of the res gestae, and not as constituting any basis of claim on the part of the city larger or more extensive than the company’s charter. It was the voluntary act of the company’s stockholders, and it bound the company to “ observe and be subject to all ordinances of said city in reference to passenger railways now in force or hereafter to be passed.” It stood unchallenged from 1858 to 1891. But, above all and beyond all is the plain provision of the charter of the Girard College company, subjecting it to the ordinance of July 7, 1857; and the ninth section of that ordinance expressly provides: “ Any passenger-railroad company which is now or may be hereafter incorporated in the city of Philadelphia, shall, by their proper officer or officers who shall sign the same, file in the office of the city solicitor a written obligation to comply with the provisions of this ordinance.” Thus, the corporate agreement was filed because the charter required it to be. But, even without the charter provision, it is submitted the agreement binds the company. Speaking of councils granting assent to the occupancy of streets, Mr. Justice Sterrett, in Pittsburgh’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="115 Pa. 4" data-case-ids="551670" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0004-01">115 Pa. 4</a>, says: “ They have no right to couple their assent with any restriction not imposed by the act, unless the company agrees to accept the same and be bound thereby; and even then, the conditions or restrictions, so accepted by the company, must harmonize and in no wise conflict with the provisions of the act.” The question would seem to be ruled by Pittsb. etc. Ry.

The first the company was undoubtedly bound to observe. The second has no bearing, except as part of the res gestee, showing how the company secured the councils’ consent, and explaining the filing of the corporate agreement. The third was introduced, not to show any additional obligation on the company, but to prove that the first paving of the street was not done by the company; and its effect is shown in this court in Philadelphia v. Evans, <a href="/pa/139/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="139 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="11252134" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0483-01">139 Pa. 483</a>.

Hence, the admission in evidence of the agreement of July 29, 1888, did not in this case prejudice the defendant, even if it was not binding. Moreover, the company admits that it is bound by the ordinance of July 7, 1857, but objects merely that the learned judge told the jury that the company was bound by the act of assembly and by the corporate agreement. That it is bound there is no dispute; whether bound only by legislative enactment, or by the act and the corporate agreement both, it is submitted makes no difference.</p>

One of the assignments, the eleventh, raises the point that the defendant cannot be required to re-pave Ninth street from curb to curb, a point that has not been made for years. There never has been any doubt as to the duty to keep in repair the entire roadway from curb to curb. Numerous authorities sustain the proposition; there are none to controvert it. In Philadelphia the question has been decided several times: Philadelphia etc. Ry. Co. v. Philadelphia, 2 W. N. 639; Thirteenth St. Ry. Co. v. Philadelphia, 13 W. N. 487; Campbell v.

The city’s contention is, not that it can at defendant’s expense “ repave these streets whenever and as often as the councils shall see fit to adopt a new style of paving,” but that, having finally and for all time abandoned cobblestone pavements, following the lead of all large cities, and having adopted Belgian block, asphalt, and vitrified-brick pavements, the best the world knows, it has a right to require the railway companies to replace on their streets the antiquated and worn-out cobblestone pavement, by a modern, more durable and better pavement. This is the whole of the city’s contention. The defendant’s counsel do not show an appreciation of the fact that the ordinance of 1857 is written in the company’s charter by the act of incorporation, and insist on treating the city’s action as an experiment, citing the act of April 11, 1868, as protecting them. That act was a general act; and if a repeal of prior legislation <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>beneficial to the city was intended by it, it utterly failed to accomplish that object, as there was nothing in its title to give notice: Pierie v.

The city authorities, having determined that it was necessary to repave that portion of Ninth street, and claiming that appellant company, under its charter and contract obligations, was bound to do the work at its own expense, notified it to do so. The company denied its obligation, and refused to re-pave. The city then advertised for bids, awarded the contract to the lowest bidder, and the work was done at the cost of and was paid for by the city. There was no question as to the amount of the claim. The sole contention was in regard to appellant’s liability, and that depended on the questions of law and fact involved.

It was executed and filed pursuant to the unanimous direction of the stockholders,„and has stood unchallenged from 1858 until this contention arose. But, as we shall see presently, that agreement has little if any effect on the liability of the company, so far as the matter involved in this contention is concerned. It is a mistake to suppose that, if that agreement can be repudiated, the company is at liberty to ignore the provisions of the ordinance of December 12, 1881, forbidding the paving, with cobble or rubble, except between tracks of railways, etc.</p>

As will appear by an examination of that case, its facts are wholly unlike those of the present case. Among other things, councils in that case undertook, as a condition of their assent, to deprive gas companies of the right of appeal expressly given them by the act under which they were incorporated. That was attempted by making councils themselves a court of last resort, and exacting a bond in large amount binding them to submit to that self-constituted tribunal. The animus of this and other conditions, clearly violative of the corporate rights of the companies and ultra vires, was so apparent that the companies affected thereby refused to submit. They declined to recognize any such usurpation of authority, and entered into no agreement. Referring to the unreasonable and unlawful character of the conditions imposed in that case, we held that councils had no right to couple their assent with any condition or restriction not imposed by the act, unless the gas company agreed to accept the same and be bound thereby; and even then the conditions or restrictions so accepted by the company must harmonize and in nowise conflict with the provisions of the act incorporating such companies. The case before us is very different. As we shall presently see, the terms of the agreement are not in conflict with the provisions of defendant company’s <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>charter. They are neither unlawful nor unreasonable. A meeting of the stockholders was called for the purpose of considering the ordinance. They agreed to accept its provisions, and authorized their officers to execute the agreement. It was accordingly executed and filed.</p>

The eighth section of the company’s charter provided “ that the said railway company shall not be permitted to use or occupy any of the streets of the said city of Pittsburgh, or streets of said boroughs, for the purposes of their railway, until the consent of the councils of said city and boroughs is first thereto had by ordinance duly passed.” The consent of both boroughs was given upon certain terms expressed in ordinances passed by them respectively. That of Birmingham was given in the following words: “ Said railway company, in addition to other requirements of the charter, shall keep Carson street in perpetual good order and repair, from curb to curb, its whole length, from the time of the acceptance of this ordinance.” That of South Pittsburgh was as follows: “ And provided, also, that said railway company shall keep said Carson street in a good and sufficient state of repair, from curb to curb, to the satisfaction of the committee on streets, .... and also keep said Carson street in a reasonable sanitary condition.” The company having refused to remove from Carson street the dirt that accumulated by reason of its ordinary use as a thoroughfare, the court, in an action brought by the borough to recover the cost of cleaning the street, held that “the duties of defendants below arise, not only from the act of assembly, but also from their contract with the plaintiffs, the borough authorities, without whose consent they could not have used and occupied Carson street: ” Pittsb. etc. Ry.

Certainly, not by the company itself, but by the municipal authorities. As a general rule, it is their special province to determine when re-paving is needed, and how it shall be done, whether with same kind of material as before, or with a different and better material. It was never intended to transfer the duty of determining these matters, or either of <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>them, from the municipal authorities to any one else. The proposition that, because cobblestone was the kind of pavement ordinarily in use when defendant company was chartered, it is in no event bound to re-pave with any other and more expensive kind of material, etc., is wholly untenable. It cannot be entertained for a moment. It was never contemplated that the railway company would continue to exist and perform its corporate functions in a cobblestone age. It was called into being with the view of progress. The duties specified in its charter were imposed with reference to the changes and improved methods of street paving which experience might sanction as superior to and more economical than old methods. In other words, the company is bound to keep pace with the progress of the age in which it continues to exercise its corporate functions. The city authorities have just as much right to require it to re-pave at its own expense with a new, better, and more expensive kind of pavement as they have to cause other streets to be re-paved, in like manner, at the public expense.’</p>
