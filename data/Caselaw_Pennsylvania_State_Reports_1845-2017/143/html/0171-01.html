You have heard the testimony on the part of the witnesses ; some letters that it is alleged she wrote and which were identified, and it seems from the uncontradicted testimony that she did write letters to Bodey &amp; Livingston, and you will say whether that is any evidence, or sufficient evidence, together with the other facts and circumstances in this case, for you to say that this material was furnished for the improvement of her separate estate, with her knowledge and consent. If it was so furnished with her knowledge and consent, and was used in the property, and was reasonably necessary for the improvement of her separate estate, she would be hable.

It is an admitted fact in this case, that the contract for the building of this house was in writing, and was between L. W. Kitzelman and A. M.

Thackara; and hence it is absolutely necessary, in order for you to find a verdict for the plaintiffs, that you find that the contract with Kitzelman for the building of the house was either made personally by Mrs. Thackara, or in her name by her authority; and it is my duty to say to you, gentlemen, that there is no evidence of any contract in her name, for the contract is in the name of A.

It is true, as I have already stated, that if the contract were made -with the husband, and there was nothing else in the case, he could not bind the wife and could not subject her property to this lien; but you are to take all the evidence in this case and determine what the contract was. If the contract was made by the husband, and the wife assented to it and had knowledge of the materials being furnished, if they were furnished with her assent, and were reasonably necessary for the construction of this house, for the improvement of her separate estate, and were so used, you would have a right to say that the plaintiffs should be compensated and paid for the bill which they claim before you, if you find that it is correct in charge. Of course they could not recover unless the bill is a fair charge, such as is in accordance with the ruling rates in the neighborhood where these materials were furnished.11</p>

No proof was submitted by the plaintiffs that Mrs. Thackara directed or authorized the construction of the house. The most that can be urged is, that after the house was under roof she appeared there, taking the same interest in the progress of the work as any wife should and is expected to take in a dwelling-house erected by her husband for their home. This did not amount to a direction or an authority. For, as she did not contract to build the house, but her husband did, she might well be presumed to believe that the contractor was dealing with her husband on his personal re<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>sponsibility. And it is clear that the wife’s property is not subject to a lien for work done and materials furnished in its improvement or repair, upon a contract with a husband, unless it is made with her authority: Dearie v. Martin, <a href="/citations/?q=78%20Pa.%2057" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="78 Pa. 57">78 Pa. 57</a>; § 6, act of April 11, 1848, P. L. 536; Berger v.

A claim against a wife for the improvement or repair of her separate estate is but constructively within the proviso of the sixth section of the act of 1848, and a plaintiff who seeks to charge her estate must bring his case within some of the exceptions of said-act: Finley’s App., <a href="/pa/67/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="67 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="1022607" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0453-01">67 Pa. 453</a>. In that case, Justice Ag-nbw said: “If a married woman’s estate can be swept away by such a confession, she is unprotected by the stringent provisions of the act of 1848, which protect her from liability against encumbrances upon her estate, unless her written consent be first had.” Reasoning from analogy, if a married woman is not liable for necessaries, nor for a debt contracted in the improvement of her separate estate, where the husband contracts the debt either personally or jointly with his wife, then it would seem that a wife’s real estate should not be liable on a lien for materials furnished through a contract made with the husband: Heugh v.

    <p id="b205-9" data-blocks='[["BL_205.9",205,[225,1151,1171,1269]],["BL_206.1",206,[258,395,1171,452]]]'>It appears that the written contract of July 15, 1887, with Kitzelman, for the erection of the building on land conveyed to the defendant Mrs. Thackara about two months before, was made in the name of and executed by Lieut. Thackara, without his wife joining therein. It was claimed by the plaintiffs, and evidence was introduced tending to prove that Mrs. Thackara assented to the contract, which was in fact made by her husband on her behalf and for her benefit; that the materials were furnished with her knowledge and consent; that they were reasonably necessary for the improvement of her separate estate, and were used for that purpose; that Mrs. Thackara was frequently upon the premises, during the progress of the work, giving directions as to the materials that were being furnished by the plaintiffs, and also as to the manner of construction ; in short, that she understandingly acted as though she herself, and not her husband, was one of the parties to the written contract. Without undertaking to review the evidence tending to prove the plaintiff’s contention that the contract was made for Mrs. Thackara and fully adopted by her, reference may be made to the proof that she examined the plans for the building, watched the progress of the work, visited the plaintiff’s mill, urged them to push on the work, etc. In her letter to them, of November 1, 1887, she wrote: “ The wood sent so far is excellent and greatly admired, but .... please push these parts and the doors through as soon as possible and <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>greatly oblige.” Again, in her letter of November 29, 1887 : .... “We want Mr. Kitzelman to put on seven carpenters, but he says you will not keep them in work. With a few lines from you saying you will send the wood fast and constantly, I can urge him on.” The evidence was abundantly sufficient to warrant the jury in finding the facts as claimed by the plaintiffs. It was fairly submitted, in a clear and correct charge, and the verdict must be accepted as a finding of all the facts necessary to entitle the plaintiffs to recover. .</p>
    <p id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[254,854,1172,501]]]'>In view of the facts established by the verdict, there was no error in the rulings complained of in the first three specifications of error; nor was there any error in charging as recited in the fourth specification, “that a husband cannot, by making a contract like this, charge his wife’s property, unless it appears that the materials were furnished with her knowledge and consent. If she assented to the contract made by her husband in this respect, ... if she knowingly received the goods, assented to the application of the goods to her property, she is bound by the contract.”</p>
    <p id="b206-7" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[254,1364,1171,296]]]'>There was no error in the answer of the learned judge to either of the defendant’s points, and hence the remaining specifications of error are not sustained.
