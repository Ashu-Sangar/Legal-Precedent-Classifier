As was held in that case, the only connection between the owner and the sub-contractor being through and by means of the contract between the owner and the principal contractor, the sub-contractor is chargeable with notice of all its terms and stipulations, and is bound thereby. He cannot have the benefit of the builder’s contract without accepting its conditions. While the language of the contract in that case differs from that employed in the agreement before us, we have no doubt the parties intended to provide against the filing of liens; and while they have not done so in express terms, we think that by fair intendment the words used necessarily include both liens and personal liabilities. The owner is not to “ be answerable or accountable.....in any manner ” for any of the materials, etc. If this is not an implied covenant against filing liens, then the owner is “ answerable or accountable ” in at least one mode or manner; not liable in person, it is true, but in property, which is equally efficacious. Again, in the second clause, the inhibition is: “Neither shall there be any legal or lawful claim against the contractor in any manner, from any source whatever, for work or materials.” An observance of this provision would have excluded the conditions on which alone the right to file a lien is based. We cannot say there was any error in the rulings complained of, and therefore</p>
