The defendants, it appeared, assuming that they were no longer tenants, disclaimed all sole responsibility in the matter; while the plaintiffs, holding that the defendants were still in possession, refrained from doing anything, for fear that any action by them might be considered as an acceptance of the property, and thereby relieve the defendants from the payment of rent under the agreement of April 1, 1885.</p>

Clayton, Esq., one of the said plaintiffs and the administrator of the estate of the decedent, they had under protest bought the manure then in the yard on the premises afterwards occupied by them, in order to prevent it being sold off the said premises, and paid for the same $120, its appraised value. Claiming that the administrator had no right to sell the manure as stated, nor the heirs, the plaintiffs, to receive their proportion of the value thereof, they invoked the rule that “ he who asks equity must first do equity,” and urged that they be not surcharged with the value of the manure sold by them, the said sale being made, as they alleged, to reimburse themselves partially for the loss of $120 paid by them for manure sold by the administrator as aforesaid, without, as they contended, any authority or right.</p>

This- may admit of some question, but whether it ended on that day or on the sixth day of March, 1888, when the remittitur from the Supreme Court was filed, is immaterial in this view of the case, since the defendants admit their liability up to March 31, 1888; and such a liability may be properly inferred from the terms of their agreement.</p>

They are to pay an annual rent, and it was to be computed from a fixed period, but the duration of their tenancy was for an indefinite period of time. It depended upon a contingency. Such a lease is regarded as <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>a lease from year to year: Lesley v.

If their tenancy ran from April to April, then the termination of the controversy over the will merely indicated the year within which this tenancy would cease. If this is so, the current year for which rent was payable always terminated on the thirty-first day of March of each year, whether the contingency happened or not. The tenant might quit, however, at the end of any current year, provided the contingency upon which his tenancy depended, happened during that year. He was not required to give notice of his intention to quit: Cook v.

Here the tenancy depended upon the conclusion of the controversy over the will. The master finds that this terminated on the twentieth day of April, 1887. If he is in error as to this date, it certainly ended some time before April 1, 1888. The contingency upon which the tenancy depended had therefore happened between April 1, 1887, and April 1, 1888, and if we are right, the tenant was entitled to terminate the tenancy at the end of that current year. This ended on the thirty-first day of March, 1888, and on that day the tenants left the premises. It was a surrender at the end of the term, and not a surrender during the term. If notice of their intention to leave was necessary, it was given on the twenty-fourth day of December, 1887. [If, as tenants of the plaintiffs, they had sub-let any portion of the premises, it was a letting in excess of their own estates, and was void as to those whose estates it infringed upon.] 7</p>

If the lease created a tenancy for years, and fixed the limit of the year, then the same limit as to the year continued, if the tenants held over. The duration of the lease would be as definite as the amount of rent. If, then, the lease is to be regarded as a lease from year to year, and it required the year to be computed from April 1, 1885, it would end March 31st of the following year, and so on, from year to year, until it terminated, and the liability of the tenant for rent would cease at that point of time, in one of these years.</p>

The proper construction of the paper of April 1, 1885, is that the agreement should end with the will contest, if the will should be sustained, but if the will should not be sustained, the agreement should continue until distribution under the intestate law. However, the parties being tenants in common by descent, or coparceners, the defendants are liable to account for rents during their exclusive possession, independently of the agreement. Bills for such accounts were entertained long before the statute of 4 Anne, Roberts’ Dig., *48, which gave the right to an account as between tenants in common: 4 Kent Com., 365; Lorimer v.

We have the exclusive possession obtained by the agreement; the making of leases by the defendants after the alleged ending of the agreement; the continued holding of exclusive possession; the waste and the failure to surrender to the other heirs the estates they had before the agreement was made: See Sailer v.

There can be no pretence for the contention that the term of the defendants, under the agreement of April 1, 1885, continued until April 1, 1889. The plaintiffs cannot deny that it had ended at least when they instituted their action of ejectment on May 11, 1887, nor when they commenced the proceedings in partition on the following day. It is not easy to see how such an agreement could be extended or renewed by implication. The occasion for such agreement had gone by, the controversy over the alleged will having ended. If so continued, however, it would then be subject to termination by either party at any time, as it was neither in form nor in substance a lease, and hence all the argument of the appellants about the defendants holding over as tenants goes for naught.</p>

But, supposing that the relation of landlord and tenant did exist, the defendants would clearly have a right to quit on the first day of the April next after the termination of the contest over the will, as, if tenants at all, they were tenants from year to year, and the year ended on April 1st: Lesley v. Randolph, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20R.%20123" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="4 R. 123">4 R. 123</a>; Thomas v. Wright, 9 S. &amp; R. 87; Jackson &amp; G., L. and T., § 357. There is no warrant for the conclusion that the litigation over the will ended on April 20,1887. The will was the subject of controversy in the ejectment suit, which was not finally disposed of till March 6, 1888: McCay v. Clayton, <a href="/pa/119/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="119 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="558091" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0133-01">119 Pa. 133</a>. Having taken the precaution to give the other heirs three months’ previous notice of their intention to quit, there was then nothing to prevent the defendants from quitting on April 1, 1888. As they left on March 31, 1888, less than a month after the litigation over the will ended, they complied substantially with even the master’s requirement that they must leave immediately at the end of the litigation.</p>

By their written notice given in December, 1887, the defendants surrendered their rights under the agreement. Having done so, how could they retake those rights and lease the premises, or any part thereof, to third persons for another year, so <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>as to bind the other heirs ? There can be but one answer. Anything that John might do after the surrender would not affect the rights and estates of his co-heirs, in the absence of other authority from them. As the court below says, the continuance of the sub-letting by John, who was the only heir that appears to have had anything to do with it, was simply void as to the estates of the heirs who did not agree to it. Nor could it affect Emma, who was no party to the holding over. Moreover, the sub-tenants occupied but a small portion of the farms, and hence any holding over could relate only to the parts so occupied.</p>

They admit that they obtained possession of those lands, and so held them until April 1, 1888, by virtue of that agreement ; and the finding of the master that their possession continued until April 1, 1889, must, in the absence of manifest error, be assumed to be the fact. The admission of appellees that their tenants continued in possession of part of the premises, in itself justifies the finding. 'The possession of these tenants was their possession; they could not subject the appellants to the risk, delay, and expense of litigation in turning the tenants out. In contemplation of the agreement, and in good faith, they were bound to restore possession as fully as they had received it by virtue of that agreement. Having obtained exclusive possession by virtue of the agreement, they must account for the whole period of that possession. Had they taken possession without the consent of the appellants, they must now have accounted. When the will was set aside, they became tenants in common, and liability to account for the use of their co-tenants’ share of the land so used became an incident. It is therefore immaterial whether their exclusive possession was with or without the consent of the appellants: they were equally liable to account. The rental value of the premises having been ascertained by the, agreement between the parties, and there being no evidence of change since, that <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>may be justly assumed as the standard of value for the whole period of exclusive occupancy.</p>
