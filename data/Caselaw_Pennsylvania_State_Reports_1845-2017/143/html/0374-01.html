The absence of the railroad company’s seal is immaterial, as the act of its attorneys in signing for it, and the act of its directors in formally ratifying the agreement and award, have made the agreement for all purposes mutual: Corson v. Mulvany, <a href="/pa/49/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="49 Pa. 88" data-case-ids="998504" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0088-01">49 Pa. 88</a>; Smith’s App., <a href="/pa/69/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="69 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1026415" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0474-01">69 Pa. 474</a>. (5) The doctrine of accord and satisfaction has no legitimate place in this case. It is the case of a substituted agreement, which defeats the action upon the original liability’" Good v.

(c) And the absence of a technical satisfaction by reason of the plaintiff’s refusal to accept the tender, cannot avail him, because of the equitable considerations that apply: Very v.

It was also contended that the defendant had been guilty of laches; but its defence was raised by special plea filed October 12, 1886, less than three years after the date of the agreement. As to another objection, that the arbitrators were not authorized to direct the payment of taxes by the plaintiff, we reply that this was only one way of fixing the price, and, moreover, the resolution and the tender made did not exact this.</p>

Taken in its most favorable light for the defendant, the agreement of November 7, 1883, was a contract for the sale of real estate, at a price to be fixed by persons named. So considering it, the defendant could recover no more than nominal damages, in an action for its breach, without showing that the value of the land exceeded the price: Hennershotz v.

The defendant has done nothing to enforce the contract, and at the time of the trial of this case the limitation of § 6, act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 532, had closed down.

It was further agreed that the price, when paid, should operate as a release of all claims of every character which the owner could make, from the location of the road to the date of the purchase. The defendant further gave in evidence proof that a valuation was subsequently made by the persons named; that the defendant thereupon tendered payment of the amount of the valuation, together with a deed for execution, and also proper releases of liens; but that the plaintiff positively refused either to receive the money, or to execute any deed for the premises, or to obtain any release of liens. He also gave notice that he would not be bound by the valuation of the appraisers, because they had not given him as much as he wanted. In short, he simply violated his contract, and then proceeded to try his action to recover damages, in entire disregard of his agreement.</p>

No reason was given by the court for this ruling, and, no opinion having been filed, we are not informed as to what the reasons were. As we are not able to take that view of the contract between the parties, we would have been glad to know upon what grounds the learned court proceeded in rejecting the agreement altogether. It is a perfectly lawful contract, which the parties were' entirely competent to make. It was carried into effect by the appraisers having made the valuation in question; it was never revoked by the plaintiff, and the defendant tendered full compliance with its terms. Why was not the plaintiff bound to perform it on his part ? It is contended by the learned counsel for the appellee that the only remedies available to the defendant under it, would be by a bill for specific performance, or an action to recover damages for its breach, and that at most it can be considered <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>as an accord and satisfaction, but void as a defence, because there was no satisfaction. But these propositions do not meet the question. The agreement is set up by the defendant to prevent the recovery of damages, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Why is it not a defence ? It is no answer to say that the defendant might have filed a bill for specific performance, or might have brought an action to recover damages for its breach. The defendant has done nothing of that kind. It has simply asked that the plaintiff shall be held to his contract. No bill for specific performance has been filed, and the rules which pertain to that kind of remedy have no place in the discussion. The same is true as to the action to recover damages for breach of the contract. No such action has been brought, and the consideration of that subject is not pertinent. The question simply is, shall the plaintiff be permitted to recover damages for a consequential injury to his land, and also keep the laud, when he agreed with the defendant that he would release the damages if the defendant would pay him for the land a price to be fixed by persons agreed upon, and the defendant has offered to pay the price and tendered the money for it? Why should he be permitted to do this in violation of his contract ?</p>

Swank, <a href="/pa/105/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="105 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="454270" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0555-01">105 Pa. 555</a>, we sustained such a contract, and compelled the owner to abide by it, although it was not by any means so precise and specific as this one, and contained no express provision releasing damages ; and although, also, in that case the land of the owner was taken, whereas here it is not. We held there that “ an agreement between a landowner and a railroad company to sell the latter a right of way across the premises of the former, covers all damages, of whatsoever sort, suffered by the landowner, all for which lie is legally entitled to compensation.” In the present case, there is an express provision in the contract that the payment of the price shall release “ all claims of every character that the owner could make.” It cannot be that the owner shall be permitted to refuse payment of the price, and then say, “ The price has not been paid, and therefore I am not bound.” Moreover, in this case no land is taken by the defendant. If the plaintiff chooses, he can keep his land, all of it, but it can<a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>not be tolerated that he shall both keep his land and recover damages contrary to his agreement besides; and therefore it is that the refusal of the wife to join in the deed for the land is of no possible consequence. The only result of such refusal is that a conveyance of the land cannot be compelled without a tender of the whole price for a deed signed by the husband alone. But here there is no question of compelling a conveyance of the land. The defendant is not obliged to have such a conveyance in order to make out its defence. The only question is, shall the plaintiff keep his contract ? We know of no reason why he should not. If he choose to break his contract, and refuse to receive what he agreed he would receive for his land, with a release of his consequential damages, he can keep his land, but he cannot keep his land and recover the damages both. There is no question of accord and satisfaction in the case, and a discussion of that question is without relevancy.</p>
