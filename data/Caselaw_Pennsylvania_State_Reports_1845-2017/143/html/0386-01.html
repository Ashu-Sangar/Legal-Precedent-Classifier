Two days before the ceremony, she went with the testator’s daughter, at the testators’ request, to the office of these accountants, who were the legal advisers of the testator, and she there executed the settlement. The paper was in formal shape, and set apart fifteen thousand dollars, in the hands of the accountants, in trust to secure the payment of an annuity to the claimant of six hundred dollars, commencing at the decedent’s death. It was accompanied by a schedule of the decedent’s property which desig<a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>nated the several investments and included a piece of real estate valued at nine thousand dollars, and it showed a total of $118,800.

Perhaps the duty of an ordinary counsel, who had been engaged by the husband, would have been discharged when he had read over to the wife the items which constituted the estate of the husband and the provisions which made up the settlement, because he might have assumed that neither party was ignorant of the law. But it will scarcely be said that any lawyer, engaged by the wife, would have stopped at the reading of these papers, and ended his responsibility when he was satisfied they were in due form. These accountants, however, stood as close to the widow as if they had been her attorneys, for they were her trustees. They knew that she was bartering an absolute interest of thirty-six thousand dollars in cash, and a life-interest in real estate, for an income of fifty dollars per month; and, certainly, if they chose to refrain from advising her as to her legal rights, or even from asking her if she had made a single calculation, they might at least have assured themselves that she had received advice elsewhere. They were bound to this by the persuasive fact that they were the paid advisers of the husband; that they had advised him as to the provisions of the settlement, and had actually drafted its provisions; and that, just so far as the interest of the husband could be said to be opposed to the interest of the wife, they, as the representatives of the husband, were, in a very understandable sense, antagonists of the claimant.</p>

With this preconceived misunderstanding of its meaning, she listened to the reading of an instrument which is as •remarkable as the will for the extent of its verbiage, and gathered from it, if she gathered anything at all, that she was to receive six hundred dollars per annum, exactly the amount of the gift which her husband had told her she would receive. A single word from her own trustees would have dispelled the delusion, or rather have unearthed the treachery; and the trustees remained silent. Their defence was, that, as advisers of their own client, they were not called upon to represent also the interest of the party with whom he dealt. This is ordinarily true ; but it is not true where the other party is in a relation of the closest dependency upon that client, and certainly not, where she is the beneficiary of a trust which they have accepted as her trustees.</p>

Two days before that event, the decedent called upon her physician, as he had done previously, and expressed the greatest anxiety that the claimant should sign a paper, the object of which he said was to settle money upon her to avoid a dispute in case of his death. On that day, the doctor gave his consent, which he. had heretofore refused, to the execution of the business, provided it could be dispatched in an hour, his hesitancy having arisen from his knowledge of the claimant’s nervous condition.

The son-in-law positively refused to move in the matter; but afterwards, he met the decedent and claimant at their own house; and the claimant, then stating that her husband had promised to retain a codicil to his will by which she would be given one third of his estate, and that nothing therein would be changed without the son’s consent, requested the witness to examine the will for himself. Accordingly, the witness repaired with the decedent to-the office of these accountants, and was shown the codicil revoking the marriage settlement and granting the thirds. He objected that the codicil could be annulled and the settlement thereby reinstated. The reply of the decedent, in the presence and hearing of the accountants, was that he would not revoke it, and that the instrument should be at all times open to the witness’s inspection. When the witness afterward reported to the claimant that he had read the codicil in question, and found it to be as represented, the decedent renewed his assurance to his wife in the most solemn and unqualified terms, that he would never revoke what he had there promised ; and asked whether in return she would forego the legal proceedings which she had threatened.

The accountant’s case is not aided by the circumstance that the vehicle of the promise was selected on account of its easy adaptability to fraud. The oath of one witness was sufficient to make out the undertaking, but in reality there were three witnesses.

She was informed by testator of the preparation of the deed of marriage settlement, and two days prior to the marriage, at his request, accompanied the wife of one of his sons to the office of his conveyancers, where a written statement of his entire estate, real and personal, prepared by the conveyancers, was submitted and read to her, after which the deed of settlement was also read to her in the presence of testator and his daughter-in-law; and, in reply to the inquiry of the scrivener whether she had any questions to ask concerning the deed, claimant replied she had not, and that she understood and was fully satisfied with it. She then, together with testator, executed the deed, in the presence of disinterested witnesses, and acknowledged it before a notary, who carefully observed the time-honored formula. Thus, every requirement of the law seems to be complied with. A full disclosure was made to the intended wife, and every opportunity afforded her, either to obtain information as to the nature and character of the instrument she came prepared to execute, or object to its execution, if ignorant of its contents or deceived as to its purpose and object. She was not illiterate : Shea’s App., <a href="/pa/121/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="121 Pa. 302" data-case-ids="561298" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0302-01">121 Pa. 302</a>; but intelligent and well educated. She was not young and inexperienced, but of mature years and acquainted with marital'duties and rights. She was a free agent, of sound mind, and fully capable of protecting herself. Nor was she under duress or constraint. The deed of settlement, although of great length, is in the usual form adopted by careful and accomplished conveyancers; and its preamble, in clear and perspicuous language, easily comprehended by a person of even ordinary intelligence, specified the terms and objects of the agreement entered into between the parties. That it was fully understood by the claimant, we think there can be no doubt. And from her necessitous circumstances it is not wholly improbable she was content, assured of the maintenance and comforts afforded by her future husband’s wealth during his lifetime, and the secured annuity of six hundred dollars for her life after his death, to relinquish all further claim upon his estate.</p>

There is no concealment, bat, on the contrary, ample disclosure. The conveyancers who prepared the deed, and therein selected by the parties as their trustees, acted with fairness, candor and good faith. As already stated, one of their number prepared the schedule of property and deed, and read both to the intended wife, and, with perfect honesty and integrity as a wholly impartial and disinterested business man, inquired if she understood and was satisfied with it. We cannot conceive he was bound to do more. He then saw the claimant for the first time, but knew her errand to his office. And there is no evidence that either he, or his copartner, had the slightest intimation or knowledge of any deceit or misrepresentation by testator, to accomplish the execution of the deed by his intended wife. Under the facts shown, the law presumes the claimant fully understood the contents of the deed, and willingly executed it; and the conveyancer, who read to her the deed, might well from her acts and declarations reach the same conclusion.</p>

But we do not understand this formed any part of their duties. They were trustees both for testator during his life, and for his intended wife only in the event of her surviving him. Their duties as trustees for them did not commence till then. And furthermore, the trust was only as to the fifteen thousand dollars set apart to pay her annuity.

This testimony is not shown to be unworthy of belief, nor are the conclusions of fact shown to be unsupported by evidence.

In 1886, or early in 1887, having discovered the imposition practiced by her husband, whereby she was induced to execute the deed of marriage settlement, she consulted counsel with a view to institute legal proceedings to annul the deed. In consequence of notice from counsel of his wife’s intention, testator sought the intervention of a son-in-law, who seems to have been the confidant of all his domestic troubles, and invoked his aid to secure a reconciliation. His mediation resulted in the assurance and promise by testator to his wife that, if she would be<a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>come reconciled and withdraw the threatened iitigation, he would not destroy or alter in any manner the codicil of 1885, without first informing her and his son-in-law. Upon the faith of this promise and undertaking, testator’s wife withdrew from her contemplated legal proceedings, and, confiding in the promise made by her husband, continued upon amicable relations with him until his death on June 23, 1888. The subsequent action of testator, however, proved that little reliance could be placed upon his promise, and verified the statement by his wife to him during the negotiations for a settlement before referred to, that “ You played a trick on me, and if you will in one instance you will in another.” For, upon his death, it was discovered that on October 28, 1887, he had executed a further codicil, whereby he revoked the prior codicils of October, 1884, and August, 1885, thus reinstating the provisions of the deed of marriage settlement, and giving her an additional annuity of six hundred dollars per annum during life, which he magnanimously provided should cease upon her re-marriage.</p>

There was a valid contract, upon sufficient consideration, to treat the marriage settlement as void, and to maintain unrevoked a codicil to the will giving the wife one third of the testator’s personal estate. The settlement of a family difficulty and dispute was held a sufficient consideration for a promise, such as this, in Burkholder’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=105%20Pa.%2036" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="105 Pa. 36">105 Pa. 36</a>.

Mr. Kesler was advanced in years, had already accumulated a fortune, and had a family by a former marriage; while Mrs. Davidson was lifted out of poverty and comfortably provided for by it. Persons, situated as they were, do not usually act from mere impulse, or contract without consideration; and the court below has accordingly found that “ Every requirement of the law seems to have been complied with in the execution of this contract. A full <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>disclosure was made to the intended wife, and every opportunity afforded her, either to obtain information as to the nature and character of the instrument she came prepared to execute, or object to its execution, if ignorant of its contents or deceived as to its purpose and object. She was not illiterate, but intelligent, and well educated. She was not young and inexperienced, but of mature years, and acquainted with marital duties and rights. She was a free agent, of sound mind, and fully capable of protecting herself. Nor was she under any restraint. The deed of settlement, although of great length, is in the usual form adopted by careful and accomplished conveyancers, and its preamble, in clear and perspicuous language, easily comprehended by a person of even ordinary intelligence, specified the terms and objects of the agreement entered into between the parties. That it was understood by the claimant, we think there is no doubt. And from her necessitous circumstances it is not wholly improbable she was content, assured of the maintenance and comforts afforded by her future husband’s wealth during his lifetime, and the secured annuity of six hundred dollars for her life after his death, to relinquish all further claim upon his estate.”</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[272,1446,1175,960]],["BL_431.1",431,[211,385,1166,252]]]'>It is impossible to understand how, consistently with these 'facts, Mr. Kesler can be found to have practised a fraud upon his intended wife in the execution of this contract. In his senile garrulity he may have made statements to his son-in-law which had better have been left unsaid; but, when brought face to face with his wife, he distinctly averred, and she did not deny, that she had never asked him any questions in regard to the agreement, and that he had made the settlement “to protect his family; that she might jump over the traces; that he fully intended if she proved a faithful, good wife, — he only had this to protect himself and his family, — if she proved to be what he thought she was, and what she had now turned out to be, he would have given her at the same time one third.” But, whatever may have been his original intention, in view of the findings of the court below that Mrs. Davidson, knowing her rights and fully informed of the situation, deliberately and in writing released all her interest in her deceased husband’s estate in consideration of the provision made for her by this agreement, and was content, <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>it is incredible that a fraud should have, in fact, been practised on her. Even assuming that the facts are as claimed by her counsel, the quantum of proof adduced is not sufficient to modify the agreement; they were not proved by two witnesses or their equivalent: Thomas v. Loose, <a href="/pa/114/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="114 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="549986" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0035-01">114 Pa. 35</a>.</p>
    <p id="b431-5" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[211,642,1173,1727]]]'>The agreement must be considered as having embodied the real intention of the parties at its date, and therefore conclusive of their rights. Was there a valid revocation of it ? It will be conceded that there must have been a meritorious or valuable consideration for such revocation: Stickney v. Borman, <a href="/pa/2/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="2 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="951293" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0067-01">2 Pa. 67</a>: and it is very clear that neither of these existed here. The sole inducement was the doing of that which Mrs. Kesler was legally bound to do. She had voluntarily estranged herself from her husband, because of her dissatisfaction with the ante-nuptial contract; there is no pretence that she had any other cause of complaint. If, as has been shown, that was a valid and binding contract, the estrangement was without justification; it was a wanton abuse of the marital relation for mercenary purposes, and reconcilement was her duty. Public policy forbids that the performance of such duty may be made the subject of barter and sale. The law fixes and regulates the marital relation on public considerations, and will not allow the parties to discard and renew it for money. Thus, in Robert v. Frisby, <a href="/tex/38/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="38 Tex. 219" data-case-ids="1171507" data-case-paths="/tex/38/0219-01">38 Tex. 219</a>, the Supreme Court held that the husband is not legally bound by a post-nuptial contract in which he hires his wife to live with him. The same principle was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Tennessee, in Copeland v. Boaz, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Baxt.%20223" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="9 Baxt. 223">9 Baxt. 223</a>. And Mr. Justice Allen, of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, well said: “ It is as much against public policy to restore interrupted conjugal relations, as it is to continue them without interruption for the same consideration. The right of condonation is not exercised for the sake of justice to the injured party, or with regard to the rights of others or the interests of the public, when it is sold for money, and the law cannot recognize such a consideration: ” Merrill v. Peaslee, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20Mass.%20460" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="149 Mass. 460">149 Mass. 460</a>. There are no cases, in conflict with this view, decided by this court. It was not involved in Burkholder’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="105 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="454222" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0031-01">105 Pa. 31</a>, upon which the court below relied.</p>

The answer to this is that she was not prejudiced by that act; the question involved there has been raised here, and has been shown to be without merit. Mrs. Kesler is therefore not in a position to claim the aid of a court of equity, and the decree of the court below must be reversed.</p>
