At a meeting on March 8th, nominations were made for the office of directors; at another meeting on March 9th, articles of association and by-laws were adopted; and at a meeting on March 10th, the members of the board of directors were elected. The defendant was present at the meetings of March 8th and March 9th. At one or the other of these meetings, he handed to Mr. Gray, the acting chairman, who caused it to be read publicly, the following notice in writing: “ For reasons satisfactory to myself, I hereby withdraw my subscription to the proposed Muncy Traction Engine company, and forbid the use of my name in connection with the same for any purpose whatever.” On March 27, 1886, the application for a charter of incorporation was prepared and filed, and on April 16th, letters patent issued.</p>

If there was nothing else here, there would be nothing but to find the interest, and that would be the end of the case.

That is the principal point of the defence in this case. And whether or not he had the right to do this thing at the time he did do it, is the real question that will determine whether the plaintiff will be entitled to recover in this case.</p>

They went about with subscription papers, and among others who were active was the defendant in this case. They solicited subscriptions for the purpose of erecting a corporation, and at that time they hoped to establish a company with a capital of fifty thousand dollars, with shares at one hundred dollars each. Numerous subscriptions were made, but it was discovered by the projectors that they could not raise fifty thousand dollars, and it was changed to thirty thousand dollars; and a new paper was gotten up similar to the original, except it changed the capital stock from fifty to thirty thousand, and the par value from one hundred to fifty dollars; and the persons who signed the first were asked to sign the second, and many did, <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>perhaps all. Among others, this defendant signed the second paper. Meetings were held from time to time of the persons interested in the matter. They were not stockholders yet. They were all projectors of the company, persons interested in getting it np. Meetings were held from time to time to discuss the probability of the success of the enterprise, and to give encouragement to it, and to increase the subscriptions. At these meetings officers for the time being were elected; Mr. Gray, temporary chairman, and Mr. Schuyler acting as secretary. Minutes were kept, and they have boon put in evidence. These meetings, so far as the minutes show, were all held in the early part of March of the same year. The fourth of March, 1886, is said to be the first meeting. All this matter about the first and second papers had taken place before the fourth of March. Perhaps all the subscribers were not there. We have no date until the fourth of March; another meeting on the 8th, another on the 9th, and another on the 10th; and these four meetings represent all the minutes that we have, so far as they were given in evidence. At some of these meetings, this defendant was present. It was at a meeting held by the projectors of the company that he sent to the chairman a letter which was in substance as follows: “ For reasons satisfactory to myself, I hereby withdraw my subscription to the proposed Muncy Traction Engine Company, and forbid the use of my name in connection with the same for any purpose whatever.” This paper was received by the chairman at a meeting, and he read the notice and left the paper lying on the table in front of him, where it remained for some time. What meeting that was, or when held, we have no definite knowledge. Some witnesses testified it was before the preliminary organization. When was the preliminary organization ? Of it there is no definite date given. The next thing we know of this company, an application is made for a charter, and the articles of association, which they are required by law to file, were signed on the twenty-seventh of March, 1886. There we have another date. Now, at that time they were certainly organized, because they gave the names of their directors, and they had organized by that time. Just how long before that they had, we have no definite information.</p>

Was it before they had perfected their organization, so they were ready to make application to the governor? If they had not perfected their organization before the twenty-seventh of March, that is the date you will go by. Was this withdrawal sent in before that time? If that was the time they were ready to file their application, if the withdrawal was before that time, DeLa Green had a perfect right to do it, no matter what his reasons were, and not only he, but any person. The .right did not belong to any particular person. The important question in the formation of a corporation of this kind is, when the association was ready to file their articles with the secretary of the commonwealth. Until this time, the whole scheme is inchoate, and a subscriber may withdraw. That leaves just that question to be determined by you.] 1 [If this defendant withdrew his name by a paper in writing that was read to the meeting as testified to, and that was before they were ready to file their papers in the-secretary of the commonwealth’s office, then the plaintiff cannot recover. But if they were ready, then he could not withdraw, except for fraud, of which there is no evidence in this case, or perhaps some other reasons. If he filed his withdrawal before that time, the plaintiff cannot recover.] 2 If afterward, they can recover. That, it seems, is the only point in this ease.</p>
