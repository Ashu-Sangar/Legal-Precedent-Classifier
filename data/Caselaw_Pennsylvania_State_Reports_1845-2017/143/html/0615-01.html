By his will, duly admitted to probate, he bequeathed his entire estate to his widow, Jane E. Wengerd, and appointing her his executrix. Before his death, he had received the sum of $200 on account of his distributive share under the will of John Wengerd, Sr., and that amount appeared to have been about a proportionate share of the money in hand available for the payment of legacies at that time. The remainder of the legacy bequeathed to him was unpaid at his death. Subsequently, by consent of all parties interested, there was paid to his widow $100, for the purpose of defraying her husband’s funeral expenses, such payment not to be to the prejrrdice of any of the interests involved. The widow of John Wengerd, Jr., claimed the unpaid balance of the legacy, in his favor, as his executrix and sole legatee; while his surviving brother and sister, Harry and Catharine Wengerd, claimed it under the will of John Wengerd, Sr., asserting that it vested subject to be divested upon the contingency of the death of the legatee before payment.</p>

In Muller’s Est., 19 W. N. 320, the direction in the will was to pay the legacy “ immediately ” after the decease of the testator. In the will of Wengerd, the provision is that “ in case of the death of any of said children of my son David, before the payment to them of their said share, then to be divided between the survivors.” It was not immediately payable on the death of the testator. In Haverstick’s Appeal, supra, it was provided that should any of them die before the distribution of the estate without heirs, then the part allotted to such shall be divided equally among the others named. So that the present case and that of Haverstick’s Appeal may be distinguished from that of Muller’s Estate. Again ; the latter decision is by the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia, and not therefore controlling.</p>

The bequest is plainly a vested one, capable of being divested by the death of the legatee prior to payment, and such a contingency may lawfully be attached to a legacy: Haverstick’s App., <a href="/pa/103/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="103 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="449095" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0394-01">103 Pa. 394</a>.

The facts alleged in the second assignment of error were not found by the auditor and court, and they were not asked to find them. Nor are they all true. There is no justification for the point made in the assignment. The executors had a year to settle the estate in, and they were progressing as rapidly as possible. Were they bound to anticipate that John Wengerd, Jr., was to die within the year, and hasten to pay over to him his share of the estate before the purchase money of the realty was due and collectible, in the face of the provision in the will that the division into three shares should be made after sale of the real estate, payment of debts, and ascertainment of expenses of administration ?</p>

And, if it vested at the death of the testator, was it divested by the accident of John’s death before the full and final distribution of his grandfather’s estate ? That the executors regarded his interest as vested is clear from the fact that they paid him two hundred dollars on account of it; and it is equally clear, had the distribution been made, as it might well have been, prior to John’s death, he would have been entitled to the share. The testator had no debts. With the exception of- a house and lot, his estate not otherwise dis<a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>posed of consisted of cash securities and money which could readily have been distributed almost immediately after his death.

    <p id="b645-5" data-blocks='[["BL_645.4",645,[194,703,1163,859]]]'>In considering the nice question whether a legacy is vested or contingent, regard must always be had to the position of the parties. In construing a will, where the bequest is ambiguous, the inclinations of the courts are always towards vesting the legacies: Coggins’ App., <a href="/pa/124/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="124 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="563106" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0010-01">124 Pa. 10</a>. The presumption that a legacy was intended to be vested, applies with far greater force, where a testator is making provision for a child or a grandchild, than where the gift is to a stranger or to a collateral relative, as in Haverstick’s App., <a href="/pa/103/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="103 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="449095" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0394-01">103 Pa. 394</a>. It would be straining a point to hold that this testator intended that his grandchild should be deprived of his share, though he should die leaving a child or children, by the mere accident of his death the day before the money was distributed. This would enable an executor, under some circumstances, absolutely to defeat the will of his testator, by withholding or refusing distribution for a certain period. We cannot assume that this testator intended to lodge such a power in the hands of the executor of his will.</p>

Wilson, 2 Ash. 178, has uniformly been that a bequest of personal property relates to the time of the testator’s death, unless a contrary intent is clearly indicated in the will. “ If any immediate legacy is given without specifying a time for payment, and is given over in case the legatee dies before it becomes payable, the word, payable, can only have reference to the death of the testator:” Jarman on Wills, 809; and the same learned author says, in volume 3 of the same work, page 612: “ Executory gifts over, in the event of legatees dying before receiving their legacies, have given rise to much litigation. Actual receipt may be delayed by so many different causes that the court is unwilling to impute to the testator an intention to make that a condition of the legacy, and thus indefinitely postpone the absolute vesting of it.” In Rammell v. Gillow, 15 Law J. Ch. 35, where the will directed that the fund should go in equal shares to testator’s children when they should attain twenty-one <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>years of age, but, in the event of the decease of any of said children before they should have received or become possessors of their share, said share was to go to their children, it was held that those who had attained the age of twenty-one took vested interests', even though they died before receiving the money. In Hutchin v. Mannington, 1 Ves. Jr. 366, there was a gift over, if the legatee should die before he may have received it; and Lord Thurlow said: “ I am to compute what time would be sufficient to enable these parties to receive their legacies. It is. all too uncertain. Suppose we have given real estate in the manner you specify. It is clear that it will neither depend on the caprice of the trustee to sell, for that would be contrary to all common sense, nor upon his dilatoriness. In some way it may be sold immediately; but I should not inquire when a real estate might have been sold with all possible diligence, for it might be the very next day, or that very evening, and therefore the court always, in such a case, considers it as sold the moment the testator is dead; for, where there is a trust, that is always considered here as done which is ordered to be done, and the court cannot measure the time. In this case it is an immeasurable purpose; I can do nothing with it, and it must be considered as vested from the death of the testator.” Martin v. Martin, L. R. 2 Eq. 404; Minors v. Battison, L. R. 1 App. Cas. 428; and many other English cases hold the same doctrine.</p>

The clause in the will was, “ Should any of them die before the distribution of my estate, without heirs, then the part allotted to such shall be divided equally among the others named.” The court held that the word “ heirs ” meant “ children,” and that the appellant was not entitled as heir to the legacy.
