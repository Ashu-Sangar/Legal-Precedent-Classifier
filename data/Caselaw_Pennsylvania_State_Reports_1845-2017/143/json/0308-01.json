        "text": "Opinion,\nMr. Justice Sterrett:\nThe sole question in this case is whether appellant, as a creditor of her deceased husband\u2019s estate, is entitled to interest on the amount of her claim evidenced by his note of January 27, 1873, in which he promises \u201c to pay to my wife Elizabeth, or order, the sum of seventeen hundred and twenty-five dollars on demand, with lawful interest from this date until paid; without defalcation, value received.\u201d\nThere was no question as to the genuineness of the note, nor any allegation, even, that any part thereof, either principal or interest, had ever been paid or in any way satisfied. The learned judge appears to have thought, however, that no interest should be allowed until after the death of the maker, because, between husband and wife, as he expressed it, \u201cthe presumption of law is that they lived off such interest and consumed it from year to year; and this presumption can only be rebutted by showing that husband and wife lived apart, each on his or her own income.\u201d He evidently misapplied the principle of presumption which sometimes arises from an entirely different state of facts. In the case of an express, written promise to pay interest, etc., such as we have in this case, the principle he intended to invoke can never become applicable, except under special qualifying circumstances which must, of course, be shown by competent evidence.\nIt is well settled that when a husband receives and uses his wife\u2019s money with her consent, but without any agreement to pay interest, he will not, as a general rule, be chargeable with interest; but, if be receives the money for her use and appropriates it to his own without permission, there is no reason why in such case he should not pay interest: May v. May, 62 Pa. 213; Hamill\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 363; Hauer\u2019s Est., 140 Pa. 420. When he has expressly agreed in writing to pay interest, his promise, in the absence of competent countervailing evidence, should be the measure of his liability.\nThere was manifest error in not allowing appellant interest from the date of the note, according to the terms of her husband\u2019s contract.\nDecree reversed, with costs to be paid by the appellees ; and record remitted for further proceedings in accordance with tbis opinion.",

    "head_matter": "ESTATE OF THOMAS B. REBER, DECEASED.\nAPPEAL BY ELIZABETH REBER EROM THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT OF BERKS COUNTY.\nArgued March 2, 1891\nDecided October 5, 1891.\n1. On the note of a husband in favor of Ins wife, promising to pay a sum of money on demand, \u201c with interest from this date until paid,\u201d the wife nay recover from her deceased husband\u2019s estate interest from the date of the note, not from the date of the maker\u2019s death only.\n2. In such case, there being an express contract in writing to pay interest, the presumption that the interest was applied from year to year to the family expenses, is inapplicable; and, in the absence of countervailing evidence to the contrary, the contract is the measure of liability.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Clark and Williams, JJ.\nNo. 197 July Term 1890, Sup. Ct.; court below, number and term not shown.\nOn January 7, 1889, the account of Reily L. Fisher, executor of the will of Thomas B. Reber, who died on August 27, 1887, was called for audit, when Elizabeth Reber, the widow of the testator, proved for allowance out of the estate in the executor\u2019s hands, a note, not under seal, made by the testator January 27, 1873, as follows:\n\u201c I promise to pay to my wife Elizabeth, or order, the sum of seventeen hundred and twenty-five dollars on demand, with, lawful interest from this date until paid; without defalcation, value received.\u201d\nOn November 12, 1889, the auditing judge, Schwartz, P. J., filed an adjudication as to said claim as follows :\nThe claim is allowed, with interest from August, 27, 1887, to date, now amounting to $1,950. In the court\u2019s opinion, this note should not pay interest during the testator\u2019s lifetime. True, the presumption is that the interest on a note is payable from the time it demands interest, in ordinary cases. Between husband and wife it is otherwise. In such cases, the presumption of law is that they lived off such interest, and that they consumed it from year to year; and this presumption may be rebutted only by showing that the husband and wife lived apart, each upon his or her own income.\n\u2014A distribution having been reported accordingly, the claimant filed an exception. After argument, the exception was dismissed and the adjudication confirmed. Thereupon, the exceptant took this appeal, specifying that the court erred in not allowing interest upon said note from its date until paid.\nMr F. K. Flood and Mr. Aug. S. Sassaman, for the appellant.\nThat the statute of limitations did not bar the claim, counsel cited: Towers v. Hagner, 3 Wh. 48; McDowell v. Potter, 8 Pa. 189; Hill v. Goodman, 1 Woodw. 207; Peterman v. Mullen, 13 W. N. 13. That the widow could claim out of her husband\u2019s estate: \u00a7 6, act of April 11, 1848, P. L. 536; Mellinger v. Bausman, 45 Pa. 522; Grabill v. Moyer, 45 Pa. 530; Gieker v. Martin, 50 Pa. 138; Hamill\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 363; Bergey\u2019s App., 60 Pa. 408; Lahr\u2019s App., 90 Pa. 507. That interest was payable according to the terms of the contract: Grabill v. Moyer, 45 Pa. 530; Mellinger v. Bausman, 45 Pa. 522; May v. May, 62 Pa. 206; Hamill\u2019s Est., 88 Pa. 368; Coates v. Gerlach, 44 Pa. 43; Morris v. Ziegler, 71 Pa. 450; Shade v. Shade, 5 Clark 493; Williams\u2019s App., 47 Pa. 307.\nMr. Jefferson Snyder, for the appellees, filed no printed brief."
