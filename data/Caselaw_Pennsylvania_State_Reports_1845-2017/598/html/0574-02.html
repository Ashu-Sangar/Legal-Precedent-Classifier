Armed with guns, Appellant and Jackson entered the restaurant before it opened. Appellant herded the employees into the walk-in refrigerator and threatened to kill them if they failed to cooperate. Despite the fact that Appellant wore a ski mask, some of the employees recognized him. In response to being identified by his coworkers, Appellant shot and killed two of them, Mary Louise Figueroa and Eugene Jefferson. Appellant terrorized and threatened two other employees, Renard Mills and Pierre Blassingame, but did not shoot them.

This is true, Appellant insists, because the Commonwealth’s deliberate suppression of the information prevented him from learning of the evidence. Appellant focuses the majority of his initial brief on the standard for a merits assessment of a <em>Brady </em>claim and his argument that he meets this standard. But the law is clear that neither of the statutory exceptions to the timeliness requirement can begin with a discussion of the merits of a <em>Brady </em>claim; rather, Appellant must begin with a discussion of why the instant petition was timely filed. As this Court has explained, the latter inquiry is separate and distinct from the former. <em>See Abu-Jamal, supra </em>at 1268 (noting that the merits of an underlying <em>Brady </em>claim is not relevant to resolving a timeliness issue under either § 9454(b)(1)® or (ii)).</p>

The PCRA court determined that there was no government interference, and that Appellant was not duly diligent, because the record established that Appellant was aware of the existence of the USPS and the PPD files for years before he sought them. We agree. Appellant has never asserted that the prosecution (or anyone else) prevented him from gaining access to these files in the 12 years between the date his direct appeal was decided and the date he ultimately sought the files. The fact that multiple agencies commenced investigations in this case was known to Appellant at the time of trial, at post-verdict proceedings, and on direct appeal, all of which were completed over a decade before Appellant filed the instant petition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Indeed, in 1986, post-verdict counsel described the police department’s separate investigative file, which he asserted that trial counsel had not examined.

Appellant’s reasoning would permit a PCRA petition to be filed <em>at any time, </em>as long as the claim is couched in terms of a <em>Brady </em>violation. But this Court has explicitly held otherwise. <em>See Abu-Jamal, supra </em>at 1268 <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>(concluding that not only must a petitioner assert that “the facts upon which the <em>Brady </em>claim is predicated were not previously known to the petitioner,” but also that they “could not have been ascertained through due diligence”). <em>See also Hawkins, <a href="/pa/598/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="953 A.2d 1248" data-case-ids="3988819,8187406" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0085-01,/a2d/953/1248-01">supra </a></em><a href="/pa/598/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="953 A.2d 1248" data-case-ids="3988819,8187406" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0085-01,/a2d/953/1248-01">at 1253</a> (“Although a <em>Brady </em>violation <em>may </em>fall within the governmental interference exception, the petitioner must plead and prove that the failure to previously raise these claims was the result of interference by government officials, and that the information could not have been obtained earlier with the exercise of due diligence.”) (citation omitted) (emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b645-5" data-blocks='[["BL_645.4",645,[187,912,1151,584]]]'>Because the record reflects that Appellant was aware of the files upon which he now relies several years before he ever sought them, and because Appellant failed to explain why he did not request these files earlier, he did not establish the due diligence required to excuse him from over a decade of inaction. Appellant has not explained why it is that he sought the files in 2004, but failed to do so earlier. Nor does he describe how it was that he was able to acquire the documents in 2004, but could not do so before that date. Appellant has not satisfied either of his claimed exceptions to the PCRA’s timeliness requirement.</p>

This case is complicated by the fact that all of counsels’ files evidently were incomplete, even with respect to items admittedly turned over. Appellant’s trial counsel apparently died sometime in 2002. Before that date, in April 2000, Appellant's counsel for his first PCRA petition filed a motion for discovery, asserting that he had contacted all prior counsel and learned that their files “did not contain any of the evidence provided at trial.’’ Commonwealth's Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit B, Defense Motion for Discovery, at ¶ 1.
