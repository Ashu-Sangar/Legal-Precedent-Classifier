By this ruling, we are hopeful that the news media recognizes that grand jury proceedings are confidential and are to remain so.

The news media should not act as a protective vessel into which criminal communications are channeled and later exonerated at the expense of our judicial system. We are not advocating a broad application of this opinion. We recognize the need for a reporter to rely upon confidential sources in investigating and reporting on criminal activity and on ongoing criminal investigations.

As a matter of statutory interpretation, we recognized that the term “source” as used in the Shield Law does not have a plain meaning, though we adhered to <em>Taylor’s </em>conclusion that “source” included both inanimate objects, such as documents, as well as persons. <em>Hatchard, </em><a href="/pa/516/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="516 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1808614" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0184-01">532 A.2d at 348</a>. Accordingly, the Court looked beyond a plain reading of the words of the statute and considered the Shield Law’s statutory purpose — “to maintain a free flow of information to members of the news media” — for guidance. <em>Id. </em>at 350. Mindful that it was considering the Shield Law within the context of a defamation case (a fact that distinguished <em>Taylor), </em>the <em>Hatchard </em>Court observed that if unpublished information that would not reveal confidential sources could be withheld under the Shield Law by a media defendant in a defamation case, then the Shield Law may be incompatible with other fundamental values protected by the Pennsylvania Constitution, such as an individual’s interest in his or her reputation. <em>Id. </em>at 349. The <em>Hatchard </em>Court therefore concluded that the Legislature did not intend to shield all information that an alleged defamer had prior to the publication of a defamatory statement, but only intended to shield information that could reveal the identity of a confidential source. Thus, we limited <em>Taylor’s </em>broad interpretation of the Shield Law, at least for purposes of libel actions, and held that “unpublished documentary information gathered by a television station is discoverable by a <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>plaintiff in a libel action to the extent that the documentary information does not reveal the identity of a personal source of information or may be redacted to eliminate the revelation of a personal source of information.” <em>Id. </em>at 351. Following <em>Hatchard, </em>a media defendant in a defamation case would not be protected by the Shield Law where the defamation plaintiff seeks information which would not reveal the source’s identity. Although <em>Hatchard </em>narrowed <em>Taylor </em>in the context of libel actions, the core protections of the Shield Law remained steadfast and ironclad-compelled disclosure of the identity, or anything that could expose the identity, of a confidential source was strictly prohibited.</p>

There is cause to look beyond the plain language of the Shield Law when interpreting, for example, the scope of the word “source,” but the Shield Law’s unambiguous text leaves little question as to whether a source’s identity is protected. Our Shield Law jurisprudence has consistently recognized the statute’s absolute protection of a source’s identity from compelled disclosure. For that reason alone, we cannot simply engraft upon the statute an exception which would not only contradict the well-established public policy underlying the Shield Law, but, as importantly, would <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>contravene the statute’s unambiguous text. The Shield Law has been reenacted three times since it was first enacted in 1937, and twice since this Court interpreted its text in <em>Taylor. </em>If the General Assembly disagreed with our interpretation, or wished to establish a crime-fraud exception to the Shield Law, it could easily have done so. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(4) (“[W]hen a court of last resort has construed the language used in a statute, the General Assembly in subsequent statutes on the same subject matter intends the same construction to be placed upon such language.”) The Shield Law provides for one exception, which is not at issue here, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5942(b), and we are not at liberty to create others that the Legislature, in its wisdom, chose not to include in the text of the statute.

It is, in the first instance, a question of policy suited to the legislative branch to align the values of the two potentially “competing” statutes. In addition, we note that hampering the news media in the performance of their essential function would not necessarily remedy or prevent violations of the Grand Jury Act. Only the grand jury participants are bound by the oath of secrecy, and it is their duty, as well as the responsibility of the courts, to uphold the integrity of the grand jury process. As for appellants’ alleged “criminal communication,” because only the individual swearing the oath can violate grand jury secrecy, it is the speaker in appellants’ scenario, and not the listener, who has the capacity to commit a crime.

The county grand jury, empaneled on September 18, 2003, investigated allegations of abuse of county prisoners by Lackawanna County Prison guards, though prisoner abuse was not originally identified as a potential subject for inquiry. The county special prosecutor was appointed after a motion to quash the Lackawanna County Grand Jury presentment, which recommended that criminal charges be filed against prison guards, was filed by one of the guards based on the alleged dissemination of secret grand jury information by the Lackawanna County District Attorney’s Office to appellee Henn. The motion to quash alleged that numerous e-mails were exchanged between Henn and a member of the Lackawanna County District Attorney’s Office which encompassed grand jury information. The motion also averred that Henn met with this member of the District Attorney's office at Farley’s, a local bar, following the prison guard’s grand jury appearance. In addition to the newspaper articles presently at issue before this Court, <em>The Scranton Times-Tribune </em>also published a number of articles authored by Henn on the investigations of the county grand jury. After the special prosecutor submitted his report, the Honorable Terrance R. Nealon, in his capacity as the Supervising Judge of the Lackawanna County Investigating Grand Jury, denied the motion to quash. In his opinion, Judge Nealon recounted the facts surrounding the alleged county grand jury leaks, as well as the alleged statewide grand jury leaks, and, after reviewing the special prosecutor’s report, concluded that the report did not demonstrate that secret matters occurring before the grand jury were divulged to Henn by the prosecution. Noting that Henn voluntarily divulged the identity of her source(s) to the special prosecutor, Judge Nealon determined that the motion to quash did not implicate the Shield Law. Judge Nealon concluded that the report did not establish that an alleged grand jury leak substantially influenced grand jury deliberations and accordingly denied the motion to quash. <em>See In re County Investigating Grand Jury VIII, 2003, </em>No. 03 MISC 140, <a href="/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203985351" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="2005 WL 3985351">2005 WL 3985351</a> (Pa.

Instead, I believe we should hold that a public figure plaintiff who makes a colorable showing that an alleged “unnamed source” may not, in fact, exist should be afforded the remedy of compelled disclosure of the identity of the purported source.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> In such an instance, the constitutional interests in the protection of the plaintiffs reputation should take precedence over the statutorily created confidentiality interest of the alleged defamer. Because the majority reaches a contrary result, I respectfully dissent.</p>

Compelled disclosure here would not affect the trial court's inherent authority to control the course of discovery, and would not necessarily preclude a ruling by the court for in camera inspection by the court prior to disclosure to Appellants. The trial court would then be able to limit the release of the information to Appellants, should the colorable showing of non-existence not be supported upon review.</p>
