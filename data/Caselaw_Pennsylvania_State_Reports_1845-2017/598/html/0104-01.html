Whether, in an issue of first impression, the lower courts disregarded class action procedures and fundamental principles of Pennsylvania contract law by presuming that a class action could be pursued based solely on proof of breach of the named plaintiffs individual express limited warranty contract, as evidence of proof of breach as to all other limited warranty contracts for all the other members of the class?</blockquote>
