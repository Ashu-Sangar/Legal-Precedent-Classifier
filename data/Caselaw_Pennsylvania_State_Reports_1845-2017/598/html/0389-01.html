The real property exception clause imposes liability if an agency causes injury due to negligence in the care, custody, or control of its real property. <em><a href="/pa/574/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="830 A.2d 966" data-case-ids="588036,9099589" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0346-01,/a2d/830/0966-01">Id.,</a> </em>§ 8542(b)(3). The sidewalks exception clause, however, requires proof that, in addition to being negligent, the agency had notice of the dangerous condition and opportunity to remedy the condition, and failed to do so. <em><a href="/pa/574/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="830 A.2d 966" data-case-ids="588036,9099589" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0346-01,/a2d/830/0966-01">Id.,</a> </em>§ 8542(b)(7). Appellees did not assert the sidewalks exception clause here.</p>

The Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers Association filed an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief, wherein it argued § 8542(b)(3) should apply to sidewalks abutting local agency property because such holding is consistent with existing case law and avoids an illogical quirk in the law.</p>

We note <em>Walker </em>presumably made it possible to impose liability for injuries occurring on agency-maintained sidewalks adjacent to state-designated highways, thereby closing the "gap in coverage” that concerned the Commonwealth Court in <em>Sherman.</em>

Appellees alternatively argue the City transformed the sidewalk into a parking lot because it regularly allowed its employees to park vehicles on the sidewalk. Because a "parking lot” is not excluded from real property under § 8542(b)(3), appellees argue the real property exception clause applies. Appellees cite no authority to support the conclusion a “sidewalk” is transformed into a “parking lot” by merely parking an indeterminate number of vehicles on it. Further, the courts below did not find § 8542(b)(3) applied because the City permitted its employees to park on the sidewalk. We do not reach this issue.</p>
