By framing the question of UIM status in terms of whether the tortfeasor’s coverage is insufficient to cover the total injuries rather than whether the tortfeasor’s coverage is less than the coverage provided by the injured’s insurance, the court in <em>Allwein </em>concluded that the MVFRL required UIM insurers to provide excess rather than gap insurance. Indeed, the court in <em>All-wein </em>viewed UIM coverage as always being excess coverage “by its very nature” because “the insurer pays nothing unless and until the tortfeasor’s coverage is exhausted, and then only if damages exceed the tortfeasor’s insurance limits.

She claims that we need not consider the validity of the stacking waiver because stacking does not apply in this case. Appellant argues that the stacking waiver language is limited to policies for which the injured person is an “insured” as defined by Section 1702 of the MVFRL, and thus does not apply to coverage received as a guest passenger. Appellant argues that Donegal, by expanding the definition of “insured” to include guest passengers, has drafted a policy that contra-<a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>diets the statutory language in violation of our decision in <em>Colbert, </em><a href="/pa/572/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="572 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="716438" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0082-01">572 Pa. 82</a>, <a href="/pa/572/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="813 A.2d 747" data-case-ids="716438,9381218" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0082-01,/a2d/813/0747-01">813 A.2d 747</a> (2002).</p>

Like the dissent in the Superior Court <em>en bane </em>decision, Appellant rejects the language of the “Other Insurance” clause of the policy as in conflict with the <em>en bane </em>Superior Court decision in <em>Allwein, </em>holding that the MVFRL requires “excess” rather than “gap” UIM insurance. She notes that the provision for excess coverage additionally facilitates the acknowledged purpose of UIM coverage, which is to compensate the injured. Appellant contends that she is not attempting to collect <em>gratis </em>coverage, but instead is trying to claim the coverage for which she paid premiums for years.

It concluded that the court in <em>Allwein </em>was attempting to prevent the situation where an insured would receive no UIM coverage despite paying premiums for UIM coverage and having injuries that exceeded the coverage provided by the tortfeasor, if the tortfeasor’s liability coverage exceeded the UIM coverage. Donegal contrasts the feared situation in <em>Allwein </em>with this case where Appellant received the benefit of excess insurance when the Appellant received the full amount of the tortfeasor’s liability insurance and the full amount of the Nationwide-UIM policy.

Indeed, Donegal notes that in this case, Appellant actually received more UIM coverage under the Nationwide-UIM policy than she had contracted for under her own UIM policy.

The victim guest passenger in <em>Black </em>claimed $100,000 of liability coverage due to the negligence of the driver of the car insured by the policy and $100,000 of UIM coverage due to the negligence of a second driver, despite the provision in the policy requiring any amount paid under the liability portion of the policy to be deducted from the coverage limit of the UIM coverage. We rejected the argument that the setoff provision violated public policy and instead noted that the insurance company had complied with the MVFRL’s requirement that it offer UIM coverage and observed that there was no provision setting a floor for UIM coverage. Donegal argues that the “Other Insurance” clause in the policy at issue is likewise valid and not against public policy, and indeed, supports the public policy underlying the enactment of the MVFRL: to reduce the spiraling cost of insurance premiums found by the legislature to have been occurring when the MVFRL became law.

We first review the process of UM/UIM recovery under the MVFRL. UM/UIM coverage is triggered when the tortfeasor’s liability coverage is not sufficient to cover the injuries incurred in an accident. Once implicated, the provision of underinsured motorist coverage is governed by Section 1733, <em>supra </em>note 7. As occurred in this case, the “policy covering a motor vehicle occupied by the injured person at the time of the accident” is in first priority (“First Priority UIM policy”), regardless of whether the injured person would otherwise be an “insured” under the policy. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1733(a)(1). In this case, the First Priority policy is Nationwide-UIM, which did not cover all the injuries suffered by Appellant. If the injuries exceed the coverage of the First Priority UIM policy, then the injured person may seek recovery under a “policy covering a motor vehicle not involved in the accident with respect to which the injured person is an insured” (“Second Priority UIM policy”). 75 Pa.C.S. § 1733(a)(2). In this case, the Second Priority UIM policy is the Appellant’s own Donegal-UIM policy.</p>

If the term in Section 1738 is limited by Section 1702, then Section 1738, and the relevant provision relating to the waiver of stacking, does not apply to injuries received as a guest passenger in a vehicle because guest passengers are not “insureds.”</p>

She paid full premiums for $35,000 coverage to protect her in the event that she was injured by an underinsured driver; she now seeks only to recover that amount.

Although not at issue before this Court, the details of Appellant’s policy with Donegal evolved with the changing legislative requirements for vehicle insurance. When Appellant purchased her policy with Donegal in December 1982, the policy was governed by the No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, and provided $100,000 of bodily injury liability coverage and $30,000 of uninsured motorist ("UM”) coverage. Appellant sought to renew her policy in December 1984, and in order to comply with the newly enacted MVFRL, she increased her UM/UIM coverage to equal her liability coverage of $100,000 per accident. In June 1985, she renewed the policy again with the same policy limits. In December 1985, however, Appellant executed a waiver form reducing her UM coverage from $100,000 to $35,000, in accordance with 75 Pa.C.S. § 1734, permitting the reduction of UM coverage below the level of liability coverage. She continued to renew her policy with these limits. At her first renewal following the enactment of Act 6 of 1990 amending the MVFRL, Appellant rejected stacking of UIM and UM coverages. In January 1992, Appellant added another car to her policy but did not change her waiver of stacking. In December 1992, Appellant removed a car from the policy.

We have often emphasized the propriety of the cost-containment policy underlying the enactment of the MVFRL: “ ‘The repeal of the No-Fault Act and the enactment of the MVFRL reflected a legislative concern for the spiraling consumer cost of automobile insurance and the resultant increase in the number of uninsured motorists driving on public highways.’ ” <em>Black, </em>at 580 (quoting <em>Paylor v.

The <em>premiums for an insured who exercises such ivaiver shall be reduced </em>to reflect the different cost of such coverage.”) (emphasis added).
