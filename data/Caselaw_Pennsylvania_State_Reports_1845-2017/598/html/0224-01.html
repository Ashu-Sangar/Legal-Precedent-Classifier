Raymond Graves was born on November 12, 1991, the son of Desiree Graves, with whom appellant had an ongoing relationship for a number of years that included periods of cohabitation. Whether or not Raymond was appellant’s biological child was disputed at trial; however, it was undisputed that appellant’s name appears on Raymond’s birth certificate as his father, that Raymond knew appellant as his father, and that appellant held out Raymond as his biological son. Raymond lived with his mother or his maternal grandmother for the majority of his life, but appellant obtained custody of Raymond in 1997, while Desiree Graves was in a residential treatment program for addictions to cocaine and alcohol. After appellant obtained custody, Raymond was exclusively under his care and control, seeing his mother on only a few occasions before his death.</p>

A neighbor, Clarence Lee, who lived in the second floor rear apartment of the building, often saw Raymond and appellant, and had regular access to their apartment to spray insecticides. According to Lee, the apartment was always neat and clean, but he often noticed that Raymond had dark circles around his eyes and that he “appeared frail.” Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), 11/13/00, at 100, 102-03. At least twice a week during the nine to twelve months leading up to the murder, Lee heard appellant cursing and yelling at Raymond that he had told him time and time again not to do things and to “shut the fuck up.” <em>Id. </em>at 62-88. Lee heard furniture being knocked over or pushed about, the sound of blows, and <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>Raymond crying and pleading with appellant to stop. While Lee never spoke with appellant about what he heard, he did call the police and the Department of Human Services to report the abuse. The police came to investigate, but at the time, they found nothing amiss and they left. <em>Id. </em>at 107-09, 113, 116-23.</p>

Appellant’s brother, Tyrone Powell, lived four blocks from appellant’s mother and saw Raymond frequently. Tyrone noticed that Raymond was frequently bruised or injured, and later said that both he and his mother were “suspicious” of Raymond’s myriad wounds. Less than a month before Raymond was murdered, Tyrone noticed that he had a large knot on his forehead that lasted two to three weeks, as well as a black eye. A week before the murder, Tyrone touched Raymond on his sides and Raymond moaned and said that his sides were sore. Tyrone later stated that the shape of Raymond’s face had actually begun to change from the frequent injuries, and had started to look “like a prizefighter’s face that had been in a lot of fights[,] like someone had been beat[ing] on it a lot.” N.T., 11/13/00, at 70, 79-80, 86-92, 95, 97; N.T., 11/15/00, at 15.</p>

Raymond saw his biological mother only three times between March and November 1997. While Desiree Graves asked appellant to allow her to see Raymond on other occasions, appellant claimed that Raymond was sick or that he did not have time to bring him for a visit. Appellant walked Raymond to school every morning and Raymond’s teacher remembers a polite and friendly child with a nice smile; however, for several weeks before Raymond’s death, he did not attend school. Olivia Gilbert, an acquaintance of appellant’s, saw Raymond several times during the month-long period leading to his death, but appellant would not allow her to see Ray<a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>mond outside of his presence and would not allow Raymond to play with Gilbert’s children. Gilbert testified that at one time, she went to Raymond’s room to talk with him and appellant followed her and did not allow Raymond to speak for himself. Appellant told her that Raymond did not appreciate what appellant was doing for him, that he “always wanted his way,” and that once, when Raymond had asked for a glass of water but then drank very little of it, appellant threw the rest of the water into the six-year-old’s face. When Gilbert asked why, appellant explained that after that incident, Raymond “never did it again.” N.T., 11/13/00, at 157-58. She also noticed that during the month before his death Raymond was always sick, and that the day before he died he had a large lump on his forehead. Appellant told her that Raymond was clumsy and fell a lot.</p>

At some point in the evening of November 20, 1997, appellant called his mother’s house, spoke with his brother, Tyrone, and told him that Raymond had hit his head on the wall and would not wake up. Leaving Raymond at his apartment, appellant then went to his mother’s house and told his mother and brother that he could not wake Raymond up, and that Raymond had been playing when he ran into the wall. Appellant called 911 from his mother’s house.</p>

They arrived to find the building dark and vacant. They were unable to gain entry, but appellant then appeared and approached them. When appellant informed Marshall and Jones that he had summoned them to the house because something was wrong with his son, the officers detected the odor of alcohol on his breath.</p>

From the color of Raymond’s skin, Officer Marshall could immediately tell that he was dead. When asked what had happened, appellant said that Raymond had fallen in the bathtub and hit <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>his head at approximately 9:00 p.m. that night. Marshall saw no head wounds on Raymond, but did observe bruising on his chest and abdomen. When Marshall asked appellant why he waited so long to call 911, appellant did not respond. Raymond was then transported to the Medical College of Philadelphia, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[290,649,1159,722]]]'>The doctor who examined Raymond’s body reported that the bruises observed by Marshall were “suspicious,” and Police Officer William McNeil was summoned to the hospital. Officer McNeil spoke with appellant in the waiting room of the hospital, and appellant told him that Raymond had been running in the house, fell, and hit his head. Appellant said that Raymond was in and out of consciousness after the head injury, and that he tried to perform CPR. Appellant stated that Raymond was still breathing when he put him down to sleep on the couch, and that after putting Raymond down, he went to sleep himself. When he woke, appellant claimed that Raymond had stopped breathing, so he called 911. According to Officer McNeil, appellant’s manner was nervous and distracted.</p>

Appellant said that Raymond would not wake up, so he put cold water in the bathtub and put the child in the tub. When he still did not regain consciousness, appellant gave Raymond mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and then brought him in the living room and placed him on the sofa. When Gilbert asked why appellant did not contact someone or take him to the hospital, appellant stated that “it had happened before” and he had “brought him back.” N.T., 11/13/00, at 152.

Appellant told Dunson that Raymond “wouldn’t shut up,” and that he hit Raymond “all night” to get him to stop crying. N.T., 12/22/97, at 28-29. Appellant told Dunson that “every time [Raymond] would cry, he would beat him. Then he would shut up and he would cry again, then he would beat him some more. Then he would cry again, then he stomped him.” <em>Id. </em>Shortly before leaving, appellant told Dunson, “what’s done is done, fuck it.” N.T., 11/15/00, at 46. Dunson called the police.</p>

A jury trial commenced on October 31, 2000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> At trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Desiree Graves, Gilbert, Tyrone Powell, and Dunson, as well as significant medical testimony. The medical examiner, Dr. Erwin Lieberman, testified that Raymond had “more than ten” fresh injuries, as well as numerous healing injuries and old scars. The new injuries were on the child’s head, chest, collarbone, upper back, lower back, elbows, and mouth, including a recently broken tooth. According to the medical examiner, the head and mouth injuries were caused by blunt force trauma with a relatively padded instrument, such as a hand. Additionally, there was extensive hemorrhaging in Raymond’s thymus gland, which is located high up on the chest, fluid in Raymond’s lungs and traumatic brain injury. The medical examiner explained that the fluid in Raymond’s lungs was caused by a seizure, which was brought on by blows to the head. Dr. Lieberman testified that, during the seizure, Raymond would have exhibited involuntary jerking movements, his eyes would have rolled back in his head, and foam <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>would have come from his nose and mouth due to the water building up in his lungs. Dr. Lieberman testified that the manner of death was multiple blunt force injuries and that the cause of death was homicide. N.T., 11/14/00, p. 23. Dr. Lieberman also stated that the injuries Raymond sustained would have killed not just a small child, but also “an 18-year-old or a 40-year-old.” N.T., 11/14/00, at 54.</p>

The oldest brain injuries were “several months old.” N.T., 11/14/00, at 74. Dr. Rorke testified that there were hemorrhages in Raymond’s eyes, as well as under and along the membranes that cover the brain. Some of the hemorrhages had been present for some time, while there was also acute bleeding in the brain, blood clots, and evidence of oxygen deprivation. Dr. Rorke also testified that fluid in Raymond’s brain was stained with blood, and that there was bleeding in his spinal cord that was several weeks old. She noted that Raymond’s brain displayed evidence of acute oxygen deprivation. Dr. Rorke testified that all the injuries she described were typically secondary to trauma, of a type commonly found in battered and traumatized infants. Although the injuries were not externally apparent, Dr. Rorke added that the older retinal hemorrhaging could have been detected had a doctor looked into Raymond’s eyes. The recent injuries were detectable only during autopsy. <em>Id. </em>at 68</p>

In this case, appellant argues that the final beating that killed Raymond is not such an event, because the medical testimony did not establish that there was a single, specific “killing” blow. According to appellant, his history of abusing Raymond and the myriad acute injuries Raymond suffered actually negates a finding of specific intent to kill, because if appellant “wanted to kill this child it would have been easy for him to do so.” Appellant’s Brief at 28.

The Commonwealth also notes, on the other hand, that the intent to kill can arise in a fraction of a second. <em>See Commonwealth v. Fisher, </em><a href="/pa/564/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="564 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1276743" data-case-paths="/pa/564/0505-01">564 Pa. 505</a>, <a href="/a2d/769/1116-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="769 A.2d 1116" data-case-ids="11114074,11114095,11114143,1276700,1276743,1276745" data-case-paths="/a2d/769/1116-01,/a2d/769/1116-02,/a2d/769/1116-03,/pa/564/0503-01,/pa/564/0505-01,/pa/564/0504-01">769 A.2d 1116</a>, 1124 (2001). Thus, the fact that appellant did not kill the child before the night in question, though he easily could have, does not mean that he lacked an intent to kill Raymond on the night he succeeded. Finally, in response to appellant’s suggestion-that this Court <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>traditionally requires “greater force” in blunt-foree trauma cases to uphold a finding of first-degree murder, the Commonwealth notes that the fact that this Court has held such “greater” facts sufficient in other cases does not mean that allegedly lesser force is insufficient.

The trial court noted that the jury clearly accepted that Raymond’s injuries were inflicted by appellant, and that those injuries were extensive and serious enough to allow the jury to infer an intent to kill. <em>See </em>Trial Ct. Op. at 16-17 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

We agree. The extensive physical injuries appellant inflicted on the child, his cold-hearted failure to timely seek medical assistance, and the contradictory explanations appellant offered as to how Raymond sustained his injuries, including his admission to Dunson, were sufficient to support the inference that appellant intentionally caused the child’s death. The evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant intentionally, deliberately, and with premeditation killed Raymond Graves. Appellant capped a sustained period of abuse by beating a helpless, six-year-old child to death. The injuries inflicted were brutal: both the prior beatings and the beating that finally caused the child’s death. The injuries were enough, an expert said, to kill an adult. Appellant was of course free to argue to the jury that he was too obtuse to realize the damage he was doing when he “stomped on Raymond” and beat him so as to cause not only invisible brain damage and spinal hemorrhaging, but visible seizures and fresh injuries to the child’s head, chest, collarbone, back, elbow, and mouth. But the jury was not obliged to believe such a claim.</p>

Appellant repeatedly references the “non-lethal” injuries that he inflicted upon Raymond. This is a curious turn of phrase, considering that the six-year-old child is dead as a result of the injuries. There is nothing in the law, logic, or human experience that provides, as a matter of law, that specific intent cannot be found when the medical examiner cannot point to a specific blow as the definitive cause of death. The very personal nature of a beating such as this negates the notion that a specifically identifiable killing blow is required to prove specific intent. After each beating, indeed, after each blow, appellant had time to reflect on what he was doing to his son. And, with the final “stomping” he administered to various vital parts of the child’s body, appellant had ample time to appreciate the lethality of his conduct. The jury acted well within its authority in finding specific intent. Nor does the fact that Raymond could possibly have survived the final, hours-long beating without the damage inflicted by the prior abuse negate a finding of intent.</p>

The statement was offered not to show appellant’s propensity to crime, but in the context of establishing the family environment and relationships among appellant, Raymond’s mother, and Raymond. Considering the isolation in which appellant kept Raymond, this testimony was useful for the jury in understanding how appellant kept away Raymond’s mother, the other adult most likely to have noticed the abuse and protected Raymond. Appellant’s prior abuse of Raymond’s mother (in addition to her testimony regarding her drug abuse and time in rehab) provides context for her later testimony that she took little action when appellant refused to allow her access to her son, or, on those rare occasions when she did see him, to speak with him alone.</p>

Appellant objected and moved for a mistrial when this statement was made. The trial court sustained the objection, but denied appellant’s request for a mistrial.

Counsel replied that he did not. However, the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>gave the instruction during jury deliberations, when the jury reconvened after submitting a question to the court. Before responding to the jury’s question, the trial court, without a request or objection from appellant, instructed the jury to remember that Powell’s testimony had been stricken from the record and that the jury could not consider it as evidence.</p>

On the merits, the Commonwealth notes that the prosecutor did not deliberately elicit the reference: the prosecutor asked only if appellant had had a bad temper all his life, to which Tyrone Powell responded, “[n]o, it calmed down after he went to prison.” The Commonwealth also notes that the <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>trial court sustained appellant’s objection, and appellant did not request a mistrial.

Appellant argues that the photographs were “gruesome,” particularly C-23, which he states shows Raymond’s scalp pulled back from his skull during the autopsy. According to appellant, the evidentiary value of the photographs was minimal,-as the Commonwealth could have proved the nature and extent of Raymond’s injuries by other means, specifically, “numerous other photographs of the crime scene and the victim,” which appellant believes would have been sufficient to show Raymond’s injuries.

The Commonwealth also argues that appellant’s claim is waived because he fails to discuss or describe six of the seven allegedly objectionable photographs, and provides only a cursory description of C-23.

Presumably, the seven photographs that were published to the jury are the seven photographs to which appellant now objects. Our review reveals that only eleven photographs are included in the record, and none of those photographs bears any identifying marker. Because appellant does not describe six of the seven photographs, it is impossible to determine which of the eleven photographs are the ones to which he currently objects. As appellant fails to identify these photographs in a way that would allow this Court to identify and review them, his claim is waived as to the photographs he identifies as C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16, C-17, and C-22.

Instead, he elected to cause eighteen separate wounds ... not deep enough to cause fatal injury, but certainly deep enough to cause pain to the victim, who remained conscious throughout her ordeal.” <em>Karenbauer, </em>715 A.2d at 1099 (internal quotation marks omitted). Like the victim in <em>Karenbauer, </em>Raymond suffered an array of wounds at the hands of his father/caretaker, all of which were distinct from the traumatic brain injury that caused the seizure that led to his death. These injuries included blows to the mouth that broke a tooth, blows to the eyes, jaw, and cheek, the back of the head, the neck, the forehead, the upper chest, and arms. Raymond suffered three separate brain hemorrhages, a hemorrhage in the thymus gland, and a spinal cord hemorrhage. Appellant’s own description of the night of the murder detailed an all-night beating, where appellant repeatedly kicked, punched, hit, and stomped on Raymond because he “wouldn’t shut up.” By appellant’s own admission, Raymond was conscious throughout the hours-long beating. Nor was appellant’s abuse of Raymond limited to the night of the murder; rather, appellant isolated and abused Raymond for a period of <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>at least several months, subjecting him to prolonged beatings severe enough to be audible to appellant’s neighbor and prompting his neighbor to call the police to report the abuse. The frequent beatings inflicted severe injuries, both visible and internal, that disfigured the six-year-old’s face and irreparably damaged his brain.</p>
    <p id="b319-5" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[205,635,1157,683]]]'>Raymond’s injuries were painful, sustained over a long period of time, and the vast majority, if not all, were inflicted prior to death. As with his argument regarding the intent to kill, appellant’s argument that there is no evidence to support a finding of torture because there was no “final blow” defies established law and common sense. Had appellant simply intended to kill Raymond, he could have easily done so. Instead, he chose to beat Raymond to death over the course of at least several hours, or, viewed more broadly, the course of months. The evidence amply supported the jury’s finding that appellant inflicted all of the injuries present on Raymond, and that he intended to cause pain and suffering beyond that necessary to bring about the victim’s death in doing so.</p>

Strictly speaking, a finding of “mercy” unmoored from a specific statutory mitigator should not trigger a capital jury’s weighing process. The “catchall” mitigator in the capital sentencing scheme only permits a jury to consider “[a]ny other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of the offense.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8) (emphasis added).

Of course, a jury may consider mercy or sympathy when weighing specific aggravating and mitigating factors, but it may not exercise its sense of mercy or sympathy in a vacuum. By the same token, appellant was entitled to present and argue any evidence that was relevant and admissible to statutory mitigators in his attempt to convince the jury to exercise its mercy or sympathy and return a life sentence.
