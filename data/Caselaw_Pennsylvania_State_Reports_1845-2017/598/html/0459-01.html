I write separately, however, because, rather than finding the language of the statute of limitations set forth below to be plain, as does the Majority, I conclude that this Court should look to the <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>rules of statutory construction to determine if the term “this act” applies to the WCA in <em>toto, </em>or only to insurance fraud prosecutions brought under Article XI of the WCA.</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[292,481,1160,515]]]'>The WCA was first passed in 1915, and has since been amended many times, including an amendment in 1993, <em>inter alia </em>adding Article XI relating to insurance fraud, and an omnibus amendment in 1996, modifying multiple sections of the WCA, including, but not limited to, Article XI. <em>See </em>Act of July 2, 1993, P.L. 190, No. 44; Act of June 24, 1996, P.L. 350, No. 57 (hereinafter “Act 57”). It is uncontested, however, that until Act 57, the WCA never contained a statute of limitations. <em>See </em>Act of June 24, 1996, P.L. 350, No. 57, § 27, as amended, 77 P.S. § 1039.12.</p>

    <p id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.6",528,[291,1239,1159,736]]]'>A prosecution for an offense under <em>this act </em>must be commenced within five years after commission of the offense. 77 P.S. § 1039.12 (emphasis added). If this term applies to all of the WCA, then the five-year statute of limitations added by Act 57 controls any criminal prosecution thereunder, including the one at issue here, alleging failure to maintain workers’ compensation insurance. Conversely, if the term “this act” applies to Act 57 only, the crime in this case would not be governed by this five-year statute of limitations, because an employer’s failure to pay compensation insurance is not a crime of insurance fraud under Article XI, which was amended by Act 57. Instead, this case would be controlled by the Commonwealth’s default two-year limitations period set forth in the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5552(a).</p>

They extract meaning from the General Assembly’s numbering of <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>the statute of limitations as § 1112 in Article XI, which relates exclusively to insurance fraud. They additionally assert that “this act” refers to “Act 57,” which included revisions to Article XI’s insurance fraud provisions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> It is noteworthy that Appellants’ interpretation would provide for a statute of limitations for insurance fraud that would be commensurate with the five-year limitations period for criminal insurance fraud prosecutions brought outside of the WCA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

    <p id="b529-5" data-blocks='[["BL_529.4",529,[193,735,1152,940]]]'>Moreover, Appellants observe that if the General Assembly intended the five-year provision to govern the entirety of the WCA, it could have placed the five-year limitations period in Article V of the WCA, entitled “General Provisions” rather than in Article XI, relating to “Insurance Fraud.” Appellants further assert that if the General Assembly intended the five-year limitations period to apply to the entire WCA, and not just Article XI, it could have used the term “prosecutions under the Workers’ Compensation Act,” not “prosecutions under <em>this </em>act.” 77 P.S. § 1039.12 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>77 P.S. § 1 (“[Tjhis act shall be called and cited the Workers’ Compensation Act”). Accordingly, Appellants assert that the limitations period relates solely to insurance fraud cases, and not to the crime for which they are charged. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>the correctness of this argument, Appellants assert that the limitations period on the criminal activity alleged against them is the default two-year limitations period, outlined in Title 42:</p>

The trial court concluded that the function of Part I of the Crimes Code is to establish-norms to govern criminal proceedings. The court observed that the Crimes Code referenced the Judicial Code’s default two-year limitations period, which applies to all offenses defined by any statute. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 107(a) (“General rule. — The provisions of Part I of this title (relating to preliminary provisions) are applicable, to offenses defined by this title or by any other statute.”); 18 Pa.C.S. § 108(a) (“General rule. — Except as set forth in subsection (b) [referring to offenses against unborn children], a prosecution for any offense under this title must be commenced within the period, if any, limited by Chapter 55 of Title 42 (relating to limitation of time).”). ■ Appellants therefore argue that the trial judge was correct that, given the inapplicability of the five-year provision, the two-year default provision referenced in the Crimes Code controlled.</p>

Only when the words used by the legislature in enacting a statute are not explicit does a court turn to other factors to ascertain the legislature’s intent, including legislative history. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c). Moreover, pursuant to 1 Pa.C.S. § 1953, “[w]henever a section or part of a statute is amended, the amendment shall be construed as merging into the original statute .., and the remainder of the statute and the amendment shall be read together and viewed as one statute passed at one time.”</p>

Utilizing Appellants’ interpretation would require us to hold that the legislature used the term “act” in the introductory language of § 27 to refer to the WCA and then employed the same term in § 1112 to refer to Act 57. It strains common sense, however, to contend that the legislature, in an attempt to restrict the statute of limitations to insurance fraud offenses in Article XI, used the term “this act” to mean Act 57, when, in fact, Act 57 was an omnibus act amending many parts of the WCA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> As noted above, Act 57 is not identical to Article XI, indeed both contain provisions not included in the other.</p>

So, it employed the term “this section” to <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>apply to the relevant statutory section, “this article” to apply to Article XI, and “this act” to apply to Workers’ Compensation Act. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 464, 957 A.2d at 277. Thus, the best interpretation of the language used herein is that the word “act” in both § 27’s introductory phrase and in § 1112 refers not to a chapter or section of the WCA, but to the “act” itself.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>
