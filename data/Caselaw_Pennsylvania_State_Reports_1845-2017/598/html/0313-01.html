As detailed later in this opinion, credit unions in Pennsylvania have historically organized their membership based upon common bonds of association, such as shared occupations. Effective February 2003, however, the General Assembly amended the Credit Union Code to follow the federal model, which, in addition to permitting association through common bonds, also allows membership to be organized by well-defined geographic communities or districts. Credit unions, including TruMark Financial Credit Union and Freedom Credit Union (collective<a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>ly, “the Credit Unions”) sought to take advantage of this amendment and filed a notice with the Pennsylvania Department of Banking (“the Department”) of their intention to convert to geography-based membership. The Pennsylvania Bankers Association, the- Pennsylvania Business Bank,- Fulton Bank, and Premier Bank (“Appellants” or “the Banks”) protested the Credit Unions’ proposed conversions, and were granted permission to intervene in an administrative proceeding before the Department, which was convened to consider the Credit Unions’ proposals to convert to geographically-organized entities. Following the hearing, the Department granted the conversion of TruMark and Freedom, and revoked the Banks’ intervenor status. The Banks then appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which affirmed the Department.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> For the reasons that follow, we vacate the Department’s order dismissing the Banks as intervenors, and remand to the Commonwealth Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

As noted previously, however, the General Assembly amended the Credit Union Code, effective February 2003, by adding a provision, 17 Pa.C.S. § 501(e), that gives Pennsylvania credit unions the option of organizing membership by well-defined geographic communities, as permitted under the Federal Credit Union Code, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201759" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 U.S.C. § 1759">12 U.S.C. § 1759</a>, rather than by common bonds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> According to the Banks, the <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>expanded membership afforded by <a href="/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201759" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="12 U.S.C. § 1759">12 U.S.C. § 1759</a> and 17 Pa.C.S. § 501(e) provides credit unions with an unfair competitive advantage, given that credit unions, which historically have been non-profit, cooperative entities organized for beneficent purposes, are exempt from most taxation, while Banks remain fully subject to taxation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

In response, the Banks submitted letters of comment and protests, opposing the Credit Unions’ proposals. On April 3, 2004, the Department published a notice in the <em>Pennsylvania Bulletin </em>stating that the Credit Unions’ proposals presented novel and complex issues of unprecedented scope, and therefore, the Department had decided to hold a consolidated hearing pursuant to 17 Pa.C.S. § 503(A.2) of the Credit Union Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> 34 Pa.B. 1806.

The Credit Unions filed answers denying that the Banks had a direct interest, and arguing that unfair competition was not a relevant factor for determining eligibility to intervene under any of the subsections of § 35.28(a). <em>See supra </em>note 7. Moreover, the Credit Unions made a cursory assertion that, to satisfy the direct interest prong, the potential intervenor must not only have a direct interest, but must be bound by the agency’s action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

However, notwithstanding that the Banks had argued that they met the requirements of the direct interest prong, the Department’s order granted intervention pursuant to § 35.28(a)(3) (henceforth, “the public interest prong”), which provides that intervention may be granted where the petitioner possesses an “interest of such nature that participation ... may be in the public interest.” In addition, the order granting intervention indicated that limitations could be subsequently imposed, pursuant to 1 Pa.Code § 35.31(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> .However, the Department did not specify what limitations might be later imposed; nor did it indicate that it was permitting only tentative participation by the Banks. As delineated in note 9, while 1 Pa.Code § 35.31(b) provides a process whereby an agency can tentatively grant participation in a proceeding subject to a subsequent grant or denial of a petition to intervene, the Department did not do this. Instead, it granted the Banks full intervenor status under the public interest prong.</p>

The Banks, in turn, cross-examined the Credit Unions’ witnesses and called their own experts, who provided testimony attempting to demonstrate that the criteria for the Credit Unions’ conversions were not met. Understandably, the Banks did not directly address the unfair competition claim raised in their petitions to intervene in support of their assertion that they had a direct interest in the proceedings, given that intervention was granted in accord with the public interest, rather than the direct interest, prong.</p>

Significantly absent was any suggestion by the presiding officer that the Banks’ intervenor status was in jeopardy because they failed to prove that they satisfied either the direct interest or the public interest prong. <em>See supra </em>note 7. Shortly thereafter, the parties submitted post-hearing briefs containing proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. In their briefs, the Credit Unions renewed their claim, raised previously in opposition to the Banks’ petitions to intervene, that the Banks failed to establish a direct interest in the proceedings, as required by the direct interest prong, and therefore, the Banks should not have been allowed to participate further in the administrative hearing as intervenors.</p>

The Secretary’s order also dismissed the Banks as intervenors on the basis that they failed to prove, pursuant to the direct interest prong, that their interests would be directly affected by the alleged unfair competition occasioned <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>by the Credit Unions’ tax-exempt status.

In the Banks’ view, because the Department did not indicate that their participation was tentative, or premised upon some additional proof to be addressed at the hearing, the Banks wholly lacked notice that their right to intervene remained in dispute, <em>see </em>Petition for Review at 16, depriving them of the opportunity to furnish evidence to support their intervenor status. In the alternative, the Banks averred that they had general standing based on the competitive harm that would result if the Credit Unions were permitted to expand, and therefore, were in substance intervenors as of right. Finally, in a second alternative argument, the Banks claimed that they had standing and, consequently, a right to intervene, as a matter of law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

In this regard, the Banks asserted that the amendment to the Credit Union Code, 17 Pa.C.S. § 501(e), as well as § 103 of the Banking Code, 7 P.S. § 103 (which states that one of the purposes of the statute is to preserve the competitiveness of financial institutions), were independent statutory bases that would give the Banks standing to participate in the proceedings as a matter of law. Further, the Banks noted that in <em>National Credit Union Administration v. First National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em><a href="/us/522/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="522 U.S. 479" data-case-ids="11472372" data-case-paths="/us/522/0479-01">522 U.S. 479</a>, <a href="/us/522/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="522 U.S. 479" data-case-ids="11472372" data-case-paths="/us/522/0479-01">118 S.Ct. 927</a>, <a href="/us/522/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="522 U.S. 479" data-case-ids="11472372" data-case-paths="/us/522/0479-01">140 L.Ed.2d 1</a> (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that competing financial institutions’ interest in limiting the markets of federal credit unions arguably fell within the “zone of interests” to be protected by the Federal Credit Union Act. The Banks averred that this case supported their view that the potential lost profits occasioned by the credit unions' expansion created a direct interest sufficient to provide them with standing. As we ultimately conclude that the Department did indeed err in revoking the Banks’ intervenor status, we need not address these theories.</p>

Briefly, <em>Biester </em>was a taxpayer standing case wherein a lawyer in his individual capacity sought to intervene and file a petition for review in this Court regarding the Attorney General's application to impanel a multicounty investigating grand jury. We initially granted intervention prior to oral argument on the petition for review. However, after oral argument, wherein the Attorney General challenged standing, we narrowed the test for taxpayer standing and held that the individual in <em>Biester </em>failed to satisfy this test. Thus, unlike the instant case, the issue of standing was continuously litigated throughout the pending oral argument in <em>Biester, </em>and therefore, the individual in <em>Biester, </em>unlike the Banks, had notice that his intervention status remained in dispute, and an ongoing opportunity to prove his standing.</p>

Regarding the Banks' claim that the amendment to the Credit Union Code, 17 Pa.C.S. § 501(e), gave them standing, the court held that the statute contains no language supporting a different standing test for banks, and that there was no authority that would allow other financial institutions such as commercial banks some special right to intervene in proceedings under the Credit Union Code. The court likewise rejected the Banks’ claim that § 103 of the Banking Code was an independent basis providing the Banks standing, noting that § 103 does not indicate legislative intent to provide commercial banks with standing absent the meeting of the traditional test. Finally, the court noted that the Banks' reliance on federal case law pertaining to standing was not controlling <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>in that the "zone of interest” analysis under federal law has no analog under Pennsylvania law.</p>
