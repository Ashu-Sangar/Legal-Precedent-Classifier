The store security guard and cashiers fled the building, and Appellant’s coconspirators also fled, with most having never entered the premises.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellant proceeded to drag the victim to the front office, where there were two safes, one of which the coconspirators believed to contain $40,000 to $50,000. Officers responding to the scene heard a gunshot from within the store; observed Appellant inside the store; saw Appellant outside while in possession of the .44 caliber pistol and a bag containing approximately $2,200 taken from one of the store safes; and apprehended Appellant in the vicinity. Mr. Richardson was found in the office where Appellant left him, having suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the left side of his head.</p>

Among other witnesses, Vann testified for the Commonwealth, describing the planning and execution of the robbery from his vantage. Notably, Vann indicated that, during the planning, Appellant said that if Mr. Richardson resisted he would kill him. Store personnel testified that, of the two safes in the manager’s office, Mr. Richardson would have had access to only one-the other was accessible only by armored-car personnel. Although there were no witnesses to the actual killing, store personnel related that they remained in the vicinity and did not witness anyone enter or exit the storefront; the responding officers indicated that they did not see anyone other than Appellant exit the rear of the store; and one of the first officers to enter the store stated that the only person found there besides the victim was a patron who had hidden in a bathroom.</p>

The expert also explained that a dried liquid substance was found on the muzzle of the revolver, which a DNA expert confirmed was bodily fluid matching Mr. Richardson’s profile. A medical examiner opined, based on the character of gunpowder stippling around the wound to the victim’s head, that the pistol that fired the shot would have been approximately twelve inches away at the time of discharge.</p>

He admitted that he perpetrated the robbery, shot Mr. Richardson in the leg, and brought him to the office to open the safe. Appellant, however, denied shooting the victim a second time and disputed the Commonwealth’s contention that his codefendants were involved in the planning and execution of the robbery. Instead, Appellant claimed that he acted at the suggestion of a friend of his brother’s, whom he could not identify.</p>

Counsel indicated that, although he did not intend to speak with Appellant about the case, he believed that decisional law required that he and Appellant be permitted to confer. In response, the court asked counsel to provide the relevant law before or during the lunch hour to support his position. According to the trial court, during the seventy-six-minute recess, counsel did not provide any authority; nevertheless, Appellant was permitted to discuss the presentation of character witnesses with his attorney before resuming his testimony.</p>

At the penalty phase, Appellant was represented by co-counsel, who was appointed nineteen days before the start of the trial. The Commonwealth offered as an aggravating circumstance that the killings occurred during the perpetration of a felony, namely, robbery. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S § 9711(d)(6). Appellant offered as mitigating circumstances claims that he lacked a significant history of prior convictions, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); he was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2); his capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(3); and his age at the time of the offenses should be regarded as mitigating, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4), as well as pursuing the catchall mitigator, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). Appellant presented testimony of family members, friends, and a mental-health expert to support the asserted mitigators. Ultimately, the jurors found that the one aggravating circumstance unanimously found — that the killing was committed in the perpetration of a felony — outweighed the sole mitigating circumstance found by any juror — the catch-all mitigator. Accordingly, the jury set the penalty at death. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv).</p>

Appellant concedes that he perpetrated the robbery and shot Mr. Richardson’s leg, but he maintains that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he fired the fatal shot. In this regard, Appellant emphasizes that: there was no agreement among the conspirators to kill Mr. Richardson; he never admitted to perpetrating the killing; and no one observed him in the act. Appellant maintains that the jury must have inappropriately inferred that he was the killer, although several coconspirators were present at the location, who could have fled during the confusion ensuing after the initial gunshot. Appellant also argues that his concession that he shot the victim in the leg cannot establish that he killed the victim, as the Commonwealth did not prove that such wound would have been a fatal one.</p>

    <p id="b692-5" data-blocks='[["BL_692.4",692,[291,833,1158,1288]]]'>In the present case, certainly Appellant’s admitted conduct in intentionally shooting Mr. Richardson in his leg as part of a robbery scheme demonstrates the degree of his regard for the victim’s health and safety. By Appellant’s own admission, he was squarely in a position to have committed the killing in close temporal proximity to the shooting. Testimony from store personnel, coconspirators, and the responding officers tended to discount the possibility of anyone else having shot the victim. Immediately prior to his apprehension, Appellant possessed a weapon which the Commonwealth’s evidence demonstrated contained bodily fluid indicative of a close-range shot, such as was delivered to Mr. Richardson’s head. Appellant also had money in his possession taken from the office where the victim was shot. Furthermore, the Commonwealth presented evidence to support its theory that Appellant shot Mr. Richardson since the victim was unable to open the second safe. In this regard, as noted, Vann testified that, prior to the robbery, Appellant stated that if the manager resisted, he would kill him; and store personnel attested to the restrictions on access to the second safe. Finally, specific intent to kill is also readily inferable from Appellant’s use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the victim’s body. <em>See Commonwealth v. Speight, </em><a href="/pa/544/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="544 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="463538" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0451-01">544 Pa. 451</a>, 459, <a href="/pa/544/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="677 A.2d 317" data-case-ids="463538,7861134" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0451-01,/a2d/677/0317-01">677 A.2d 317</a>, 321 (1996).</p>

The only affirmative testimony upon which he relies to support his claim that the Commonwealth’s substantial evidence of guilt was offset is his own testimony that he did not kill the victim. Based on the above, it is readily apparent that the jurors made a credibility determination which was squarely within their province, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s weight-of-the-evidence claim. <em>See generally Commonwealth v.
