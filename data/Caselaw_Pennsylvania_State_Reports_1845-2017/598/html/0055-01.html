Accordingly, we begin with a brief history of the MCTLA, and in particular the 2003 retroactive amendment at issue in this case. Between 1923 and February 1996, the MCTLA allowed for the imposition of an attorney collection fee of five percent for claims resulting in a verdict or default judgment. <em>See </em>53 P.S. §§ 7187, 7271 (originally providing for attorney fees of five percent but, as further discussed <em>infra, </em>amended by Act of Feb. 7, 1996, P.L. 1, No. 1, § 2, to permit the imposition of “reasonable attorney fees” pursuant to 53 P.S. § 7106).

The fee provision thus burdened the delinquent taxpayer with the reasonable attorney lees expended in collecting the taxes, rather than imposing the financial burden of collection on the municipality or school district. Pursuant to the dictates of the amendment, municipalities adopted ordinances and resolutions establishing a schedule of attorney fees. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 7106(a.l).</p>

The trial court opined that the decision in <em>Pentlong </em>did not create a cause of action, but instead merely interpreted the statute as not authorizing the collection of reasonable attorney fees in conjunction with the collection of delinquent taxes. From that observation, the trial court concluded that absent a cause of action, no vested right existed to be unconstitutionally impaired by Act 20. The court concluded, “Plaintiffs are, in reality, seeking to protect personal expectations that they would never have to pay attorneys’ fees when their tax delinquencies and real estate liens are resolved.

The Commonwealth Court, however, failed to realize that, unlike the claim in <em>Ieropoli, </em>the Delinquent Taxpayer’s claim did not fit cleanly into the traditional model of a Remedies Clause issue. In <em>Ieropoli, </em>we were faced with a plaintiff claiming that his remedy for an injury suffered had been extinguished by legislative action in violation of the Remedies Clause, specifically, that the General Assembly enacted legislation capping the asbestos-related liability of a successor corporation that resulted from a merger or consolidation with the originally-liable corporation. After thoroughly analyzing the history of the Remedies Clause in Pennsylvania, we agreed with the plaintiff in <em>Ieropoli </em>that the legislation violated the Remedies Clause because it extinguished the plaintiffs accrued cause of action to recover for his asbestos-related illness. As properly noted by the Commonwealth Court, we “held that under the Remedies Clause, a cause of action that has accrued is a vested right which cannot be eliminated by subsequent legislation.” <em>Konidaris v.

The court also concluded that the Delinquent Taxpayers’ unjust enrichment claims failed to the extent the claims related to attorney fees that had not been paid prior to the enactment of Act 20, concluding that without actually paying such fees the cause of action was not complete. Absent an accrued cause of action for unjust enrichment on those claims, the court concluded that Act 20 could be applied retroactively without violating the Remedies Clause. Conversely, the court found that the enrichment element was satisfied as to those claims based on attorney fees actually paid prior to the enactment of Act 20, and concluded that for those limited claims, Act 20 unconstitutionally extinguished an accrued cause of action: “[Application of [Act 20] to this [unjust enrichment] claim will remove any argument that the enrichment was unjust, effectively extinguishing this cause of action.” <em><a href="/a2d/884/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="884 A.2d 348" data-case-ids="8906504" data-case-paths="/a2d/884/0348-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/884/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="884 A.2d 348" data-case-ids="8906504" data-case-paths="/a2d/884/0348-01">at 355</a>.</p>

Additionally, observing that under common law attorney fees cannot not be imposed absent express statutory authority, the Delinquent Taxpayers claim that the attorney fees could not be levied in this case absent clear language in the MCTLA, citing <em>Township of Springfield v.

Instead, the Law Firm asserts that Act 20 was a remedial statute addressing the failings of the 1996 amendments revealed in <em>Pentlong. </em>Moreover, the Law Firm notes that even if the MCTLA did not provide for the collection of attorney fees, the municipalities adopted ordinances and resolutions in the wake of the 1996 amendments specifically permitting the collection <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>of attorney fees at the time when the liens were filed and when the fees were paid.
