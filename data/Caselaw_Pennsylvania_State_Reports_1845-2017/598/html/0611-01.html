We hold that trial had commenced for purposes of Pa.R.Crim.P. 621(B) and, therefore, the trial court did not err in denying Appellant’s request to withdraw his jury trial waiver. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth herein, we affirm.</p>

Using these exchanges as the requisite probable cause, police obtained a search warrant and recovered from Appellant’s residence a small amount of marijuana, bagging material, a scale, PCP residue, and cash. In due course, Appellant was charged with multiple counts of possession of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, and possession of drug paraphernalia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

He argues that because <em>Wright </em>is a Superior Court opinion, we are not bound by it, and, further, that the decision is not persuasive because it fails to consider alternative interpretations of the presented question.

It asserts that most states allow a trial court to exercise discretion when considering, at any time during the proceedings, whether to allow the withdrawal of a jury trial waiver. <em>See Marquez v.

The Commonwealth maintains that because Pa.R.Crim.P. 621(B) permits the absolute withdrawal of the jury trial waiver prior to commencement of trial, Pennsylvania actually provides more protection of a defendant’s right to a jury trial than most of its sister states, and there is neither the need nor justification for expanding the right of withdrawal by retarding when during the proceedings the trial is deemed to have commenced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The Commonwealth also posits that to adopt Appellant’s suggestion would open our trial <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>courts to manipulation, presenting the example of a defendant agreeing to waive a jury trial, waiting until jurors are dismissed, completing disposition of pre-trial motions and opening arguments, and, then, demanding that his jury trial waiver be withdrawn, delaying the trial and adversely impacting the trial court’s ability to efficiently marshal judicial and societal resources.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Keeping in mind that Pennsylvania liberally affords criminal defendants the absolute right to withdraw their jury trial waivers before trial commences, we should ensure that the exercise of such right is not used to frustrate the administration of justice by delaying the proceedings for tactical gain.</p>

While Appellant challenges the Superior Court's injection of an abuse of discretion standard in review of what we acknowledge is a question of law, he acknowledges that the court’s use of "abuse of discretion” language may have been a mere "slip of the tongue." Appellant's Brief at 28. The Commonwealth asserts that while the Superior Court employed "abuse of discretion” language, it would appear from the context of the memorandum opinion that the court was simply applying its previous ruling in <em>Wright, </em>which utilized a "question of law" <em>de novo </em>standard of review in deciding when trial commences for purposes of Pa.R.Crim.P. 621(B).
