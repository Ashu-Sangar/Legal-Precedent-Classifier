Following a trial by jury in 2003, Noel Matos Montalvo (Appellant) was found guilty of one count of first-degree murder and <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>one count of second-degree murder arising out of the killing of two victims, Miriam Ascencio (Miriam) and Nelson Lugo (Nelson), on April 19, 1998. Appellant also appeals from lesser sentences imposed for his convictions of burglary and criminal conspiracy, which arose from the same criminal episode as the murders. Because we find no merit to the issues raised by Appellant, we affirm the judgments of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b330-5" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[301,688,1165,726]]]'>To provide context for our analysis, we begin with a brief discussion of Appellant’s brother, Milton Montalvo (Brother), and his late wife, Miriam. The record reveals that, sometime in 1995, Brother and Miriam moved from Puerto Rico to York County, Pennsylvania. By all accounts, the couple’s marriage during this time was fraught with frequent fighting and disagreements. Although unclear, the record suggests that, by March of 1998, the disagreements between the couple had worsened, prompting Brother to move out of the apartment he had shared with Miriam. As detailed in the following paragraph, Brother’s separation from Miriam did little to quell the turbulence of their relationship, as they remained in contact with each other and continued to argue over the following month.</p>

During his visit, Brother used the store’s telephone to call Miriam about certain unemployment checks that she had allegedly received in the mail. N.T., 3/14/2003, at 616-17. The conversation between Brother and Miriam soon grew acrimonious, and Brother began shouting angrily at Miriam over the telephone. As this was occurring, Appellant entered the grocery store and walked to Brother’s location. When Brother hung up the telephone a few minutes later, Ms. Soto overheard Brother tell Appellant that he wanted to kill Miriam. Appellant then told Brother to “leave it to him,” and that he would murder Miriam himself. <em>Id. </em>at 619.</p>

N.T., 3/13/2003, at 574. Upon their arrival, the responding officers observed that the door to Miriam’s apartment had a window in the center of it divided into four panes, and that the pane nearest to the door lock was broken. N.T., 3/13/2003, at 574-75, 583. After further investigation, the police discovered the lifeless bodies of Miriam and Nelson lying on the floor inside. A subsequent autopsy report revealed that Miriam died from stab wounds to her eyes, blunt force trauma to her head and body, and lacerations across her neck. Nelson’s autopsy report revealed that he died from a stab wound to his chest.</p>

During this visit, Ms. Soto, who was in a nearby bedroom, overheard Appellant and Brother describing in gruesome detail how they murdered Miriam and Nelson earlier that night. The record indicates that police eventually learned about Appellant’s and Brother’s meeting with Miguel when they interviewed Ms. Soto during a subsequent police investigation. During this interview, Ms. Soto told the investigating officers that she specifically recalled hearing Appellant admit that he killed Miriam by cutting her throat and stabbing her in the eyes.</p>

Brother was captured in 1999 and extradited to York County to stand trial for the murders of Miriam and Nelson. In due course, Brother was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary, and, after a penalty hearing, was sentenced to <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In contrast, Appellant remained a fugitive for several more years. In February 2002, however, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) received a tip that Appellant had moved from Florida to an apartment unit located in Hudson County, New Jersey. This tip proved accurate, as Appellant, who had changed his appearance and was living under an assumed name, was found at this location shortly thereafter. Appellant was extradited to York County to face charges in this case for homicide, conspiracy to commit homicide, and burglary.</p>

Mr. Rice recounted the sounds he had heard on the night of the murders, noting that he heard glass breaking, that he heard Brother’s voice, and that there were banging sounds that sounded like someone “wrestling.” N.T., 3/13/2003, at 545-46. Mr. Morell, who lived below Miriam’s apartment, testified that he also heard Brother’s voice on the night of the murders, that he heard Miriam say, “call the police,” and that “dragging” sounds were coming from Miriam’s apartment shortly thereafter.

At the penalty phase, the Commonwealth argued two aggravating circumstances with respect to Appellant’s first-degree murder conviction: 1) the killing was committed during the perpetration of a felony (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6)); and 2) Appellant had been convicted of another murder committed either before, or at the time of, the offenses at issue (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll)). The defense, in contrast, argued two mitigating circumstances: 1) Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1)); and 2) there were other mitigating factors under the catch-all mitigator, including the fact that he was a good worker, attended church, and was a good son to his mother (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8)). At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the judge directed defense counsel to present his closing argument first, before the Commonwealth’s closing argument.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Accordingly, the trial court imposed the death penalty for the first-degree murder of Miriam, and a sentence of life imprisonment for the second-degree murder of Nelson. Appellant also received 10 to 20 years of imprisonment for burglary, which was imposed concurrent to a 10 to 20 year sentence of imprisonment for conspiracy to commit homicide.</p>

In his 1925(b) statement, Appellant raised 48 issues, all of which were rejected as unmeritorious by the trial court in a subsequent opinion and order.

Further, as recounted earlier, Appellant and Brother were heard discussing killing Miriam the evening before the murders, and both were seen together before and after the crimes, thereby supporting the existence of a conspiratorial agreement.

In addition to arguing that there was no direct evidence linking Appellant to the homicides, Appellant spends several pages in his brief arguing that the evidence was “insufficient” because the Commonwealth’s witness, Ms. Soto, was not credible. In this regard, Appellant emphasizes that Ms. Soto gave conflicting testimony at Brother's trial several years earlier. This specific claim, however, challenges the weight, and not the sufficiency, of the evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v. DeJesus, </em><a href="/pa/580/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="580 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="1100728" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0303-01">580 Pa. 303</a>, <a href="/pa/580/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="860 A.2d 102" data-case-ids="1100728,9145847" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0303-01,/a2d/860/0102-01">860 A.2d 102</a>, 107 (2004) (noting that questions concerning inconsistent testimony go to the credibility of the witness, and hence, implicate the weight, rather than sufficiency of the evidence). While we acknowledge that Appellant included a boilerplate weight of the evidence claim in his 1925(b) statement, he has since abandoned this claim on appeal to us. We further note that the jury found Ms. Soto's testimony credible, which was within its prerogative. <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>
        <em>See <a href="/pa/580/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="860 A.2d 102" data-case-ids="1100728,9145847" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0303-01,/a2d/860/0102-01">id.</a> </em>(noting that this Court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the jury on issues of credibility). Finally, as summarized in our analysis of Appellant’s sufficiency claims, there was evidence presented at trial implicating Appellant in the homicides, such that the verdict cannot be said to shock one’s sense of justice. <em>See Commonwealth v. Diggs, </em><a href="/pa/597/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="597 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="3924891" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0028-01">597 Pa. 28</a>, 38-39, <a href="/pa/597/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="949 A.2d 873" data-case-ids="3924891,8240638" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0028-01,/a2d/949/0873-01">949 A.2d 873</a>, 879 (2008) (stating that, in a claim that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, a new trial will be awarded only if the jury's verdict is so contrary to the evidence as to shock one's sense of justice).</p>
