      <em>Commonwealth v. Marshall, </em><a href="/pa/596/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="947 A.2d 714" data-case-ids="4088151,4088640,8398197,8398235" data-case-paths="/pa/596/0587-01,/pa/596/0586-02,/a2d/947/0714-01,/a2d/947/0714-02">947 A.2d at 721</a>. Marshall’s PCRA petition was filed on January 27, 2006, the same day as Appellant’s petition in this case. As this Court held that Marshall’s claim, based on the same alleged “after-discovered facts” as those asserted here, was untimely, then clearly Appellant’s claim in the instant case is also untimely. There is no basis to distinguish this case from <em>Marshall; </em>the claims, and their timing, are identical. Appellant has not established an exception to the PCRA timeliness requirements, and thus he was not even entitled to the hearing the PCRA court held. We need not reach the merits of Appellant’s claim, that the PCRA court erred in limiting the scope of the hearing, because no hearing was warranted. Indeed, we would have affirmed the PCRA court if it had held no hearing at all. <em><a href="/pa/596/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="947 A.2d 714" data-case-ids="4088151,4088640,8398197,8398235" data-case-paths="/pa/596/0587-01,/pa/596/0586-02,/a2d/947/0714-01,/a2d/947/0714-02">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/596/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="947 A.2d 714" data-case-ids="4088151,4088640,8398197,8398235" data-case-paths="/pa/596/0587-01,/pa/596/0586-02,/a2d/947/0714-01,/a2d/947/0714-02">at 723</a>.

The mitigating factors found by the jury were that Appellant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2), and that the capacity of Appellant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired. 42 Pa.C.S § 9711(e)(3).</p>
