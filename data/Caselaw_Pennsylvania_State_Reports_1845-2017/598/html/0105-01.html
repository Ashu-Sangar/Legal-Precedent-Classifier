      <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>1. Whether as a matter of first impression, an attorneys’ fee award made pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (“MMWA”), <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202301" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 2301">15 U.S.C. § 2301</a> et seq., cannot be entered after entry of judgment where: (i) the MMWA requires that fee awards be entered as “part of the judgment,” and where (ii) Plaintiff voluntarily took judgment on the underlying verdict, and thus disposed of all claims (including the Plaintiffs unresolved claim for attorneys’ fees) before the trial court entered the fee award.</blockquote>

Whether, as a matter of first impression, the courts of Pennsylvania are required to follow United States Supreme Court precedent regarding the interpretation of federal fee shifting statutes when interpreting the fee shifting provision of the MMWA, and, if so, whether the trial court’s decision to add a $1 million “risk multiplier” bonus to the fee award violates controlling United States Supreme Court precedent.</blockquote>
