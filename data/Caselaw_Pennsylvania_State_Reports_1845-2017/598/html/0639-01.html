Following a penalty hearing at which appellant elected to present no mitigation evidence, the same jury found two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances, and accordingly returned a sentence of death. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(iv) (verdict must be sentence of death if jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance and <a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>no mitigating circumstance). The two aggravating circumstances found by the jury were: (1) appellant committed the killing while in the perpetration of a felony (rape), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); and (2) appellant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9). On March 20, 1987, the trial court formally imposed the death sentence for the first-degree murder conviction, and a consecutive term of imprisonment of 8/£ to 17 years for the rape conviction.</p>

The remaining claim alleged that appellant’s appellate counsel, an attorney in the Butler County Public Defender’s Office, possessed a conflict of interest at the time of his representation. On May 18, 2004, the PCRA court held an evidentiary hearing solely on the conflict of interest claim. Appellant requested that Judge Doerr recuse himself from the case on the basis that he was a member of the Butler County Public Defender’s Office at the time of appellant’s trial and the time relevant to the conflict of interest claim. Judge Doerr denied appellant’s request. On July 16, 2004, the PCRA court entered an order denying relief on the conflict of interest claim.

We decline to ignore the PCRA and reinstate the discretionary relaxed waiver doctrine. The unpredictability inherent in Section 9543(a)(2)(v) is equally implicated with Section 9543(a)(3)(iii). The fact that a Third Circuit panel says that a salutary state procedural default, such as the PCRA’s statutory waiver provision, will not be respected and the fact that the Circuit misconstrues the scope of the former relaxed waiver doctrine cannot control our interpretation and enforcement of the PCRA. Finally, this Court is bound by decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, not the opinions of the inferior federal courts. The PCRA provision speaks in terms of absolutes (“does not constitute”); the holdings of inferior federal courts, in instances where the High Court has not spoken, are, by definition, tentative. Thus, we reject the notion that the PCRA waiver provision does not apply to appellant’s claims because the Third Circuit allegedly believes that no capital claim is waivable.</p>

First, many of the jurors stated that they had read newspaper accounts of the victim’s murder shortly after it occurred.

Third, another juror informed the court that he saw the newsletter in or around the jury room, though he stated that no one who had been selected had read it.

Upon hearing this information, trial counsel immediately moved for a mistrial and to strike all the jurors who had been empaneled. Following a brief recess where trial counsel and the prosecutor questioned prospective juror Perko further and discussed the situation, both counsel reached an agreement, which the trial court accepted, whereby they would continue the <em>voir dire </em>process keeping these facts in mind and would allow trial counsel wide latitude in his examinations of potential juror taint. For its part, the trial court informed the parties that it was “not concerned with the impressions or the attitudes of the jurors unless they know something of his past record or they are not going to follow the court’s instructions.” <em>Id. </em>at 993-94.

Appellant contends that subsequent out-of-court questioning of potential jurors demonstrated that they had been exposed to prejudicial information about appellant’s prior criminal record.

Appellant claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing “to adequately place upon the record the full extent of this juror misconduct.” Appellant’s Brief at 18. As noted, appellant’s declarations do not support his predicate accusation. More fundamentally, appellant’s claim depends upon an assumption that appellate counsel had a constitutional duty to interview <a id="p672" href="#p672" data-label="672" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*672</a>jurors to properly present the jury taint claim. Appellant cites no case to support this assumption and, contrary to appellant’s assertion, there is no general recognized duty to interview jurors.

However, as we have noted earlier, it is important to remember that there may be claims that sound purely in appellate counsel ineffectiveness, unrelated to accusations against trial counsel. For example, trial counsel may have preserved a claim by objection, which appellate counsel did not pursue on appeal. Or there may be an extra-record claim — factual or case-law related — which arose after the trial. Or there could be a claim respecting the manner in which appellate counsel litigated a claim.

Neither of these two instances constituted a situation where the prosecution, either personally or through a witness, vouched for or discredited, through opinion, the credibility of a witness.

The charge was favorable to the defense to the extent that it narrowed the jury’s consideration of the evidence, and an objection would have risked a broader charge encompassing all relevant purposes. Furthermore, it must be emphasized, the trial court’s charge addressed head-on the only potential for unfair prejudice arising from the evidence, squarely telling the jury that it should not infer guilt from the evidence of appellant’s work release and that it was admitted for the limited purpose of gauging the weight and credibility of appellant’s testimony.

Capital counsel obviously have a duty to conduct reasonable investigations into mitigation evidence. But counsel do not have a recognized duty to interview jurors in the hopes of uncovering a collateral claim by which to undo the verdict. Furthermore, the fact that there was an issue in <em>voir dire </em>concerning juror exposure to media accounts does not give rise to a duty to go on a post-verdict fishing expedition into other, distinct, unrelated, speculative “jury influences.” As the PCRA court recognized, there is no evidence that counsel knew that the Bible was present in the jury room and was being relied upon for an improper purpose. Additionally, given that post-verdict questioning of jurors is strongly discouraged and that jurors generally may not impeach their verdict, appellate counsel’s “failure” to question jurors in search of such a claim was perfectly reasonable. Finally, we agree with the trial court that the alleged presence of the Bible in the jury room and the occasional prayer do not prove improper use of the Bible as was at issue in <em>Chambers. </em>The presence of the Bible, and of prayer, do not mean that it was a factor in the jury’s deliberation, much less that the jury somehow substituted biblical teachings for the governing law, and those substitute teachings were somehow harmful to appellant’s case.

Therefore, appellant’s underlying claim is not cognizable under the prior capital sentencing scheme’s prohibition on victim-impact evidence as described in <em>Fisher </em>and <em>McNeil. </em>Accordingly, appellant’s claim that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this meritless claim on direct appeal lacks arguable merit.</p>

Appellant argues that the record shows that he was not told and did not understand that he would face an “automatic” death sentence without the presentation of mitigating evidence. Appellant asserts that a death sentence would be “automatic” in the absence of mitigation because the jury had <a id="p709" href="#p709" data-label="709" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*709</a>already found one of the aggravators. This is so, appellant says, because the jury allegedly found him guilty of killing the victim during the course of the rape. Further, appellant contends that, although trial counsel conducted a record waiver colloquy and appellant said he “understood” the nature of capital sentencing proceedings, his responses and explanations to trial counsel’s questions demonstrate that he supposedly did not understand the proceeding. Appellant also maintains that his waiver was the result of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness because trial counsel failed to investigate and inform appellant of available mitigating evidence. Counsel’s duty to protect a defendant’s rights, asserts appellant, is increased when the defendant is mentally or emotionally impaired, as appellant claims he was in the present case. Further, appellant contends that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this issue on direct appeal. Appellant maintains that prejudice is demonstrated because appellant was sentenced to death as the result of the defective waiver and because, but for counsel’s ineffectiveness, appellant could have presented a compelling case for a life sentence. Responding to the PCRA court’s conclusion that this issue was previously litigated in <em>Tedford I, </em>appellant argues that this Court’s conclusion that appellant could not be compelled to present mitigating evidence did not depend on the validity of his waiver and, therefore, the waiver issue was not previously litigated.</p>

That decision was first made by appellant weeks before trial. Appellant maintained his stance despite counsel urging him to authorize a mitigation defense. Moreover, as this Court noted on direct appeal, the record colloquy that counsel conducted made clear that appellant understood the nature of the penalty proceeding, his right to present mitigation evidence, the aggravating circumstances the Commonwealth was to pursue, and the differing burdens of proof. Appellant was adamant that trial counsel not pursue any mitigation. Indeed, ignoring the advice of counsel, appellant here refused to allow counsel to call family members to testify on his behalf.</p>

But, appellant’s assumption is not correct as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. As a matter of fact, the <a id="p715" href="#p715" data-label="715" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*715</a>guilty verdict on rape — a charge vigorously contested — did not require the penalty jury to find a specific temporal relationship between the murder and the rape. The penalty phase issue was thus distinct. Moreover, the jury still had to find the specific aggravating circumstance, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, there was the ever-present prospect of jury nullification, and all it would have taken was one juror. As a matter of law, the claim fails because appellant can cite no authority, in existence at the time trial and appellate counsel were acting, that required a mitigation waiver to include advice from the defendant’s lawyer that waiver would “certainly” lead to death.

Furthermore, this case cannot be likened to the unreasonable-failure-to-investigate-mitigation cases such as <em>Williams v. Taylor, supra, Wiggins, supra, </em>and <em>Rompilla, supra. </em>In those eases, counsel failed to conduct even the most cursory investigation into apparently readily available mitigating evidence. Here, in contrast, trial counsel did not “decide” not to investigate and decline to present mitigating evidence. Rather, he was instructed not to do so by appellant, notwithstanding counsel’s existing investigation and counsel’s avowed “desire, willingness and ability to go forward” with mitigation evidence. In fact, trial counsel advised appellant to present mitigation, urged him to discuss the matter with his family members who could have presented certain mitigating evidence, notified the court that he had mitigating evidence in the form of family member testimony, and repeatedly informed the court that appellant was proceeding against the advice of counsel.</p>

Given the circumstances on the record, appellant’s claim that trial counsel was ineffective respecting the mitigation waiver, for failing to investigate and inform appellant about potential mitigating evidence, and/or for failing to realize that appellant’s waiver was infirm lacks arguable merit.

Moreover, trial counsel informed the penalty phase court that he had urged Appellant to meet with his mother and sister to discuss mitigation. Notwithstanding these disclosures and admonitions, Appellant told penalty phase counsel that he did not desire to participate in the penalty phase of the case, and, instead, preferred formally to waive his right to present mitigating evidence.

In reaching this conclusion, the Majority specifically rejects on three distinct bases Appellant’s assertion that counsel was ineffective for failing to inform him of the self-induced mortal peril resulting from his waiver of his right to present mitigation evidence. First, the Majority opines that while Appellant had been found guilty of rape and murder, this did not preordain imposition of the death sentence because the jury could have concluded that the victim’s death did not occur during the perpetration of the rape, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6).

As for the Majority’s assertion that the guilty verdicts as to the charges of rape and murder did not require the finding of a relationship between these charges, it is, of course, accurate that there is a distinction between the guilt phase question — did Appellant commit a rape and murder — and the penalty phase issue — was the murder committed during the perpetration of the rape. However, having found Appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt during the guilt phase of luring the victim to his place of employment, raping her, and then murdering her to prevent her from going to the police, I believe that the likelihood that the jury would decline to find the Section 9711(d)(6) aggravator was nonexistent.</p>

It is difficult for me to see how the burden of proof or the mandate of juror unanimity would provide any impediment in the penalty phase.</p>

Consistent with my analysis herein, Appellant would not have been able to do anything to derail the jury’s finding of the (d)(6) aggravator. Indeed, Appellant himself acknowledged as much during the colloquy when he informed the court that he did not believe that he had any chance of prevailing and obtaining <a id="p737" href="#p737" data-label="737" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*737</a>a life sentence. Moreover, in Appellant’s brief he notes that he believed “he would have no chance for a life sentence.” Brief for Appellant at 77. Apparently, this belief originated in Appellant’s perception of the respective burdens of proof: Appellant felt that because he had lost in the guilt phase, where he had no burden, he would not be able to prevail in the penalty phase, where the defense had a burden of proving mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(1)(iii). Accordingly, notwithstanding the arguable merit of Appellant’s claim, it fails under the prejudice prong of <em>Commonwealth v.

I wish to distance myself from this point to the extent it suggests that an appellant could never prevail on a claim of appellate counsel ineffectiveness where appellate counsel raised an issue in his post-trial motions and then abandoned it on direct appeal.

I find the Majority’s reliance on <em>Powell </em>curious. In <em>Powell, </em>the jury balanced a non-statutory mitigator ("mercy”) against three aggravators and sentenced the appellant to death. Chief Justice Castille, writing for the Majority, specifically disapproved of the jury's attempt to exercise mercy or sympathy in the absence of specific mitigators. <em>Id. </em>2008 WL at *16, <a href="/pa/598/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="380" data-cite="956 A.2d 406" data-case-ids="3990016,8207764" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0224-01,/a2d/956/0406-01">956 A.2d at 427</a> (“Of course, a jury may consider mercy or sympathy when weighing specific aggravating and mitigating factors, but it may not exercise its sense of mercy or sympathy in a vacuum____[It] must correspondingly bottom any such exercise of mercy or sympathy on the evidence of specific mitigators.”). In contrast to <em>Powell’s </em>explicit disapproval of the jury's attempt to consider mercy, the Chief Justice is now asserting that the jury can, in fact, exercise mercy even though Appellant decided to forgo presenting any mitigation evidence whatsoever, thereby precluding the channeling of mercy through the finding of a mitigator. Thus, it appears that the Chief Justice has disapproved of the jury's exercise of mercy in <em>Powell, </em>while taking the contrary position <em>sub judice </em>that the jury may always nullify the verdict.</p>
