The plea had been negotiated with the Commonwealth, which agreed to drop two lesser charges, and was formalized in a written plea agreement. At the plea hearing, the factual basis for the plea was presented by the Commonwealth without dispute or contradiction from Appellant. During the ensuing oral plea colloquy with the court, Appellant acknowledged that he had reviewed, understood, signed, and had no questions concerning his written plea agreement. Appellant further acknowledged, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) he understood the potential maximum penalties for aggravated indecent assault, which were once again stated during the colloquy; (2) it was in the court’s discretion to decide the appropriate sentence; (3) he had not been promised anything in exchange for his plea other than the withdrawal by the Commonwealth of the two lesser charges; (4) he was surrendering his right to a jury trial and a presumption of innocence; (5) he understood that a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>was the equivalent to a guilty plea for sentencing purposes; and (6) he had had a sufficient opportunity to review and discuss his plea with his attorney.</p>

This document further established, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) Appellant was aware of the maximum penalties for aggravated indecent assault, as set forth therein; (2) he was aware of his right to counsel and was satisfied with his counsel’s representation; (3) he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol; (4) other than under the terms of the plea agreement itself, he had not been made promises to induce his plea, nor had he been threatened; (5) the trial court would determine his sentence; <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>and (6) he was satisfied that his plea was voluntary and in his best interests.</p>

Appellant was also advised that he was subject to the registration requirements as a sexual offender for a period of ten years following his release from incarceration, which was the registration period mandated for offenders convicted of aggravated indecent assault under the provisions of Megan’s Law I. Later on the day of sentencing, attorneys for the Commonwealth and Appellant approached the court with the concern that the registration requirements under Megan’s Law II, then in effect, would impose a lifetime registration requirement on Appellant because of his conviction of aggravated indecent assault. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1(b)(2) (providing that under Megan’s Law II, effective July 9, 2000, individuals convicted of aggravated indecent assault are subject to lifetime registration as sexual offenders).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court and the attorneys agreed that because <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>Appellant’s crime had been committed while Megan’s Law I was in effect, Appellant was subject to its ten-year registration requirement, not the lifetime registration requirement under Megan’s Law II.</p>

Consequently, Appellant filed a motion to withdraw his <em>nolo contendere </em>plea, averring that had he known that he would be subject to a lifetime registration requirement, he would not have pled <em>nolo contendere, </em>and therefore his plea had not been made knowingly and intelligently. Appellant also moved to modify his sentence. On February 5, 2003, the trial court denied both motions; however, in a subsequent opinion written pursuant to Pa.R.A.P.1925(a), the court opined that Appellant should be subject only to the ten-year registration requirement under Megan’s Law I, not the lifetime registration requirement under Megan’s Law II.

Citing <em>Commonwealth v. Fleming, </em><a href="/a2d/801/1234-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="801 A.2d 1234" data-case-ids="9412637" data-case-paths="/a2d/801/1234-01">801 A.2d 1234</a> (Pa.Super.2002), the Superior Court concluded that Megan’s Law II governed Appellant’s registration requirements as a sexual offender. In <em>Fleming, </em>the defendant pled guilty to attempted criminal homicide and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse on August 9, 2000. Following the defendant’s plea, the trial court, on December 6, 2000, imposed a sentence that required lifetime registration under Megan’s Law II. On December 13, 2000, the defendant filed a motion for modification of sentence wherein he argued that he should be subjected to registration for only ten years because the underlying offense had occurred on September 18, 1999, prior to the effective date of the lengthier registration requirements under Megan’s Law II. The trial court denied the motion, and on appeal, the Superior Court affirmed, <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>holding that the defendant was subject to the lifetime registration requirement under Megan’s Law II. <em>Fleming, <a href="/a2d/801/1234-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="801 A.2d 1234" data-case-ids="9412637" data-case-paths="/a2d/801/1234-01">supra </a></em><a href="/a2d/801/1234-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="801 A.2d 1234" data-case-ids="9412637" data-case-paths="/a2d/801/1234-01">at 1240-41</a>. More specifically, the <em>Fleming </em>court determined that because the registration requirements of Megan’s Law II do not serve to punish an offender but rather are designed to help ensure the safety of the public, the application of the lifetime registration provision of Megan’s Law II was not, as the defendant had argued, an <em>ex post facto </em>violation under the United States Constitution. <em><a href="/a2d/801/1234-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="801 A.2d 1234" data-case-ids="9412637" data-case-paths="/a2d/801/1234-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/801/1234-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="801 A.2d 1234" data-case-ids="9412637" data-case-paths="/a2d/801/1234-01">at 1241</a>.</p>

The court based its determination on the conclusion that the registration requirements of Megan’s Law are a collateral as opposed to a direct consequence of the criminal conviction. The court noted that this Court has consistently held that a defendant’s lack of knowledge of collateral consequences to the entry of a guilty plea does not render a plea unknowing or involuntary. <em>Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, the court opined that because this Court has determined that the registration requirements of Megan’s Law do not constitute criminal punishment, such registration requirements are properly character<a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>ized as a collateral consequence of a defendant’s plea. Hence, the court concluded that for purposes of his plea, Appellant need not have been advised at all as to the length of the registration requirement, and that his misunderstanding as to the duration of the registration requirement was not a basis for withdrawing his plea. <em>Leidig, supra </em>at 748.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Special parole' is a statutorily imposed term of supervised release that follows and is in addition to a term of imprisonment for certain federal drug crimes. <a href="/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="21 U.S.C. § 841">21 U.S.C. § 841</a>(b). Rule ll(b)(H) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that a defendant entering á guilty plea or a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>be informed by the court of “any maximum possible penalty, including imprisonment, fine, and term of supervised release.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(H); emphasis added. Specifically, a defendant entering a plea must be informed that if the terms of the special parole are violated, the defendant can be returned to prison for the remainder of his or her sentence and for the full length of his or her special parole term. <em>See Parry v. Rosemeyer, </em><a href="/f3d/64/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="64 F.3d 110" data-case-ids="7411926" data-case-paths="/f3d/64/0110-01">64 F.3d 110</a>, 116 (3d Cir.1995). Appellant contends that because criminal defendants subject to supervised release must be informed of the terms of this aspect of sentence and the consequences of violation, then sexual offenders must be afforded similar protections concerning the registration requirements of Megan’s Law.</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[291,1424,1159,539]]]'>However, it is plain that there is no similarity between federal supervised release and the registration requirements of Megan’s Law. The former is specifically a component of the sentencing scheme for those convicted of certain drug offenses. As such, federal supervised release is a direct consequence of a conviction, not a collateral consequence. By contrast, there is no question, pursuant to our earlier discussion, that the registration requirements of Megan’s Law are a collateral consequence of conviction. Thus, Appellant’s argument has absolutely no merit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

The logical extension of these holdings is that the registration requirements of Megan’s Law are collateral, not direct, consequences of conviction. To the extent that there was any confusion following those decisions that the registration requirements of Megan’s Law are collateral and not direct consequences of a plea or other conviction, we settle the issue here: such requirements are collateral consequences and, as such, a defendant’s lack of knowledge of these collateral consequences to his or her pleading guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>fails to undermine the validity of the plea. <em>See Frometa, <a href="/pa/520/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="520 Pa. 552" data-case-ids="1815635" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0552-01">supra </a></em><a href="/pa/520/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="520 Pa. 552" data-case-ids="1815635" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0552-01">at 93-94</a>. Moreover, it is immaterial to our holding whether Appellant is subject to lifetime registration or only ten-year registration, an issue we need not address at this time. Because the Megan’s Law registration requirements, of whatever duration, are matters collateral to Appellant’s plea, the Superior Court correctly concluded that in accepting Appellant’s plea, the trial court need not have advised Appellant as to the length of the registration requirement, and that any misunderstanding as to the duration of the registration requirement was not a basis for a post-sentence withdrawal of the plea. Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>

Illustrative in this holding is the fact that the Megan’s Law registration requirements are not a direct consequence of a plea to the underlying offense, as they do not impose punishment.
