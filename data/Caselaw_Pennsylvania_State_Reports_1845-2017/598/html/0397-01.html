This approach, the Commonwealth contends, allowed counsel to attempt to create reasonable doubt by shifting suspicion away from appellant and, simultaneously, in two other directions. On the one hand, trial counsel elicited testimony from the Commonwealth’s expert witnesses that the <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>shots could have been fired by Kevin Cofer from the driver’s seat.

The Commonwealth had the sole burden of proof at trial. By eliciting testimony from Commonwealth witnesses about the feud between Graves and the Boys from the Bottom, trial counsel was able to emphasize in closing argument that, if anyone had a motive to kill Graves, it was members of the Boys from the Bottom, not appellant. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., 5/17/93, at 733-34 (“Motive.

At the same time, in the absence of any defense expert testimony narrowing the potential list of suspects, trial counsel was able to cast suspicion in his closing argument on Kevin Cofer as well. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 729 (“What does Kevin Cofer have to hide? I think that should be the paramount question, ladies and gentlemen, regarding this case.”); <em>id. </em>at 731 (“What is this man trying to hide? Did Kevin Cofer render aid?

He fled.”); <em>id. </em>at 745-46 (“We don’t have to prove a case against Kevin Cofer, but there is reasonable doubt.”). In his PCRA hearing testimony, when asked whether he had made a strategic decision not to consult with a ballistics expert, trial counsel confirmed that he “made a strategic decision to cross-examine witnesses” presented by the Commonwealth instead, in order “to try to create a reasonable doubt and have Mr. Collins found not guilty.” N.T., 10/8/04, at 69; <em>see also id. </em>at 120-21 (trial counsel’s affirming the strategic basis for his determination not to call a ballistics expert).

Conceding that Attorney Savino represented Montague in two unrelated matters, the Commonwealth argues that neither matter could have affected Savino’s performance at appellant’s trial because the first matter concerned a drug possession conviction and ended nine months before appellant’s trial, while the second matter was an aggravated assault case that arose after appellant’s trial. Additionally, the Commonwealth emphasizes that, at appellant’s trial, Savino attempted to cast suspicion on the Boys from the Bottom, the gang of which Montague was leader, and simply lacked sufficient evidence to single out Montague himself as the perpetrator. Even assuming Savino was ineffective, the Commonwealth argues, direct appeal counsel could not reasonably have been expected to determine the identity of “Little Man,” whom in a statement a single witness named as the owner of the car Graves allegedly stole — let alone investigate a potential connection between “Little Man” and Savino — because direct appeal counsel had no reason to believe that any such connection existed.</p>

Notwithstanding appellant’s assertion in his reply brief, the defense first became aware of these facts long before the PCRA hearing. In fact, as appellant notes in his initial brief, it was on May 5,1993, the second of three days of jury selection, that trial counsel learned of the removal of the items from the Taurus. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Brief at 39 (citing N.T., 5/7/93, at 103 (referencing trial counsel’s awareness of same two days pri- or)). Likewise, it was on May 10, 1993, the second day of appellant’s five-day trial, that trial counsel received a copy of the report of the lead residue test police conducted on the headrest. N.T., 5/10/93, at 345. Therefore, the record belies appellant’s bald assertion in his reply brief that “[t]he facts underlying his due process claim were not available to prior counsel” (Reply Brief at 17). Moreover, appellant’s theory depends upon an assumption that the defense was entitled to access to the Taurus in a relatively undisturbed state. That is a claim that trial counsel obviously could have forwarded by requesting such access, but he did not. Accordingly, to the extent it relies on the Commonwealth’s failure to notify the defense of the removal of the headrest, appellant’s claim that direct appeal counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the underlying due process claim fails because it does not address trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to raise the due process claim before the trial court.</p>

Appellant argues that Cook’s testimony would not have constituted double hearsay because neither statement would have been inadmissible.

Neither the necessity for, nor the inherent trastworthiness of, reputation evidence inheres in a mere acquaintance’s testimony as to a person’s reputed nickname.

As further support for its waiver argument with respect to the notice-of-removal claim, the Commonwealth argues that appellant failed to plead this claim in his PCRA petition. In response, appellant in his reply brief cites Claim V of his first counseled PCRA petition, which alleged that chemical testing of the headrest should not have been admitted at trial because the Commonwealth belatedly produced that evidence. Acknowledging the Commonwealth’s position that the instant underlying notice-of-removal claim is obviously distinct from Claim V, appellant nonetheless contends that the Commonwealth’s waiver argument is "based on nothing more than inconsequential variations between the way in which the claims were pled below and the way they have been presented here."

The Commonwealth argues that these claims are waived for appellant’s failure to include a signed certification from both trial and direct appeal counsel as to their testimony at the hearing, as required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(d)(1). Appellant responds in his reply brief that the Commonwealth’s waiver argument is waived because it was not raised before the PCRA court, which did not dismiss any of the claims on the basis of the absence of signed certifications. Appellant further notes that, if the Commonwealth had raised his failure to include the signed certifications before the PCRA court, he would have been entitled to the opportunity to cure the deficiency pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 905(B) (allowing PCRA court to order amendment of PCRA petition that is defective as originally filed).</p>

In the course of setting forth this claim, appellant asserts that, because the trial court did not give a limiting instruction, the jury was free to consider Cofer’s prior statement and testimony implicating appellant as substantive evidence of appellant’s guilt rather than simply as evidence to impeach Cofer. Appellant, however, does not present this as a separate underlying claim of trial court error and provides no authority in support of it. While it is worth noting that the relevant authority would seem contrary to such a claim, <em>see Commonwealth v.
