Rather, appellees argue, <em>Barnett </em>stands for the proposition that “a governor has the right to independently assess and disapprove the subject, the amount, and the purpose of any appropriation.” Appellees’ Brief at 10. Indeed, appellees contend, “the scope of a governor’s disapproval power is entirely coextensive with the General Assembly’s right to include language in an appropriation bill.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=48%20A.%20976" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="48 A. 976">Id.</a> </em>In other words, according to appellees, if the General Assembly can enact language in an appropriation bill, the Governor has the constitutional authority to eliminate the language. In appellees’ view, conditional language is no exception: if the General Assembly puts in a condition restricting the use of a specific appropriation, that condition qualifies as an “item” within the meaning of Section 16 and is therefore, under <em>Barnett, </em>fully subject to the Governor’s disapproval power. Appellees reject appellants’ contention that the <em>Barnett </em>Court’s discussion of the scope of the Governor’s disapproval power is <em>dicta. </em>According to appellees, the <em>Barnett </em>Court <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>could not have determined whether the Governor had the constitutional authority to reduce the amount of an appropriation without first determining the scope of the executive disapproval power granted by Section 16.</p>

Appellees, however, take issue with appellants’ contention that the Challenged Vetoes resulted in the creation of new legislation. Engaging appellants’ hypothetical of a $1.1 million general appropriation with a $0.1 million specific appropriation vetoed by the Governor, appellees argue that a governor’s disapproval of the specific appropriation is no more “creative” in effect than a governor’s reduction of an appropriation. Such a veto, appellees explain, does not free up the $0.1 million for any purpose of that governor’s choosing; rather, the $0.1 million simply reverts to the agency’s general appropriation, which the General Assembly made. As for appellants’ ’argument that a governor’s exercise of his disapproval power in this fashion contravenes legislative intent in some sense, appellees dismiss this notion as a red herring, contending that Section 16 is designed to act as a check against legislative power rather than as a vehicle to advance legislative intent.</p>

Thornburgh’s disapproval of 51 provisions of the 1983 general appropriation bill, Democratic Governor Robert P. Casey’s disapproval of four provisions of the 1988 general appropriation bill, and Republican Governor Thomas J. Ridge’s disapproval of a single provision of the 1995 general appropriation bill.

Thus, in this particular special act, the governor could have vetoed any or all “items of appropriations” and approved the remainder of the bill which would have included the three sections of the bill in question.

Moreover, it seems evident that, in initially using in Section 16 the phrase “item[s] of any bill making appropriations of money,” the focus was not on providing a precise definition of “item” but on distinguishing the type of bill to which the Constitution was referring (i.e., an appropriation bill) from that to which it had been referring in Article IV, Section .15 (i.e., general legislation).

Because, in the language of <em>Barnett, </em>Section 2010 includes no “subject” connected to an “amount,” Section 2010 is not an “item” for purposes of Article IV, Section 16 and therefore is not susceptible to the Governor’s item veto power under that provision of our Constitution.</p>

In Section 219 of the 2005 GAA, the General Assembly appropriated $921,080,000 in state funds and $1,288,555,000 in federal funds to DPW for outpatient services and, additionally, directed that: (1) DPW not expend funds for family planning services in excess of amounts expended for such services during the 2004-05 fiscal year; and (2) any such funds expended be subjected to the same restrictions contained in the appropriation for grants for women’s medical services. Similarly, in Section 223 of the 2005 GAA, the General Assembly appropriated $137,393,000 to the State Police for general operations and, additionally, required that the State Police conduct a public hearing and provide thirty days’ public notice before closing any State Police barracks. Rather than allocating any sum of money to the DPW or State Police, the Challenged Vetoes concerning Sections 219 and 223 merely restricted those agencies’ discretion in administering the programs for which they are responsible. Neither the provision purportedly vetoed in Section 223 nor the provision purportedly vetoed in Section 219 contained any sum of funds that the General Assembly directed be spent for any purpose. These two Challenged Vetoes are in this respect analogous to the Mississippi governor’s veto in <em>Holder, </em>which the <em>Barnett, </em>Court found distinguishable from the reduction veto exercised in that case.

Section 801 includes fifteen separate appropriations to PennDOT for various purposes, totaling nearly $1.5 billion. The particular appropriation in the provision that Governor Rendell purported to veto is $770.5 million for “the salaries, wages and all necessary expenses for the administration and operation of the maintenance program for State roads, bridges, tunnels and structures.” Within the part of Section 801 appropriating $770.5 million for general transportation infrastructure maintenance, the General Assembly included three provisions earmarking three relatively small amounts for specific maintenance projects. The last of the three earmarks is for $1.5 million — about one-tenth of one percent of the total appropriation to PennDOT — for a pilot project to expand the width of pavement markings from four inches to six inches on limited-access highways. This discrete earmark is analogous to the three provisions of the 1899 appropriation bill in <em>Barnett </em>that set aside separate sums from the Philadelphia portion of the public school appropriation for the Teachers’ Institute, the School of Design for Women, and the Teachers’ Annuity &amp; Aid Association. Although the Governor did not specifically veto these three provisions in that case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">22</a> this Court noted that each was an “item” for purposes of Article IV, Section 16 because each “presented] [to the Governor] the double consideration of the beneficiary and the amount.” <em>Barnett, </em><a href="/citations/?q=48%20A.%20976" class="citation" data-index="165" data-cite="48 A. 976">48 A. at 978</a>. Likewise, here, the overall $770.5 million appropriation made by the General Assembly in Section 801 presented the Governor with the question of whether $1.5 million should be spent on the specific purpose of widening pavement markings. We therefore hold that Governor <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>Rendell’s veto of Section 801 provision was a valid exercise of his item veto power under Article IV, Section 16 of our Constitution.</p>

The Governor’s vetoes of language in Sections 219, 223, and 2010 were such “language only” disapprovals, while the Governor’s veto of the Section 801 provision was not. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court to the extent that it upheld the Governor’s vetoes of language in Sections 219, 223, and 2010 of the General Appropriation Act of 2005, and we affirm that part of the order that upheld the Governor’s veto of language in Section 801 of the 2005 GAA.</p>
