The testimony presented at trial revealed that prior to the night of the murder, Spence and Appellee had unsuccessfully solicited David Carter to kill Ogrod and Dunne. On July 31, 1986, at approximately 1:45 a.m., Jeffrey Horoschak called Ogrod’s house. Ogrod did not answer the telephone. <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>Instead, Appellee answered and told Horoschak that Ogrod was asleep. Thereafter, at 3:30 a.m. that same morning, Edward May drove Spence, Gray, and Barrett to a location one block from Ogrod’s house. Approximately thirty minutes later, Appellee, who was already at the location, served as lookout while Spence, Barrett, and Gray attacked Dunne and Ogrod with knives and a crowbar while they slept in the basement of their home. Dunne was stabbed in the heart and died almost instantly. Ogrod, however, survived the attack and eventually identified Spence as one of the perpetrators.</p>

The court reasoned that the “trigger-date” for the sixty-day provision in Section 9545(b)(2) was March 22, 2004, when it placed on the record its finding in <em>Spence </em>that the Commonwealth violated <em>Batson </em>by engaging in purposeful discrimination in striking a black juror.

The PCRA court stated that “[i]t would be patently unjust to deny [Appellee] equal protection under the Pennsylvania and U.S. Constitutions on the basis that he did not share his codefendant’s skin color, especially when the retrial will be for the actual doer, and [Appellee] was the <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>lookout.” PCRA Court Opinion dated June 8, 2006, at 6.

It contends that this Court has repeatedly held that the PCRA time requirements are jurisdictional in nature and that we have no authority to create <em>ad hoc </em>non-statutory exceptions to them. It alleges that the PCRA court’s ruling on Spence’s <em>timely </em>filed PCRA petition cannot serve as the newly discovered “fact” upon which Appellee’s <em>Batson </em>claim is predicated pursuant to Section 9545(b)(l)(ii). Rather, the Commonwealth argues that the “fact” upon which Appellee’s <em>Batson </em>claim is predicated, which was “unknown” to Appellee and “could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence” pursuant to Section 9545(b)(1)(h), was the discovery of the McMahon tape, which had been released to the public in April of 1997. To illustrate the point, the Commonwealth asserts that the same evidence that enabled Spence to raise successfully a <em>Batson </em>claim in a timely filed PCRA petition was likewise available to Appellee in April of 1997, long before Appellee filed his second PCRA petition in 2002 and his supplemental PCRA petition in 2004.

Structural errors typically “deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.” <em>Neder, </em><a href="/us/527/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="527 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="1248184" data-case-paths="/us/527/0001-01">527 U.S. at 8-9</a>, <a href="/us/527/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="527 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="1248184" data-case-paths="/us/527/0001-01">119 S.Ct. 1827</a> (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). The classic example is denial of the right to counsel. In contrast, as <em>Batson’s </em>progeny has made clear, the core right being protected by <em>Batson </em>is the right of citizen-jurors not to be discriminated against. When such purposeful discrimination occurs, relief may be granted to a party — the defendant or the Common<a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>wealth in a criminal case — irrespective of whether the discrimination produced a jury that, in fact, was unable to be fair. The error is “structural” only in the sense that it is the type of claim that does not require proof of actual prejudice. Thus, I do not believe that it is the “structural” nature of the claim that weighs in favor of an expansive “standing” approach. The “standing” is expansive because it is the juror whose right is primarily at issue: the Commonwealth, or the defendant as the case may be, objects to vindicate the right of a citizen who lacks “standing” himself to object.</p>

A true assessment of strikes must account for the composition of the panel as a whole, and the conduct of other lawyers exercising strikes. It must be remembered that <em>Batson </em>works both ways: the right of jurors being at issue, neither the defense nor the prosecution may discriminate, and discriminating actions of one side, if unaccounted for, result in an incomplete picture.</p>
