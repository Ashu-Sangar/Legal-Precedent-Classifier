Sergeant Harvey testified that on three occasions during the operation of the checkpoint he had made a decision to “open the checkpoint and let traffic flow” in order to “avoid unreasonable delay for the traffic that was in line.” N.T. at 9. After reviewing the parties’ briefs, the trial court granted Appellee’s suppression motion, concluding that, although the officers had the authority to stop every vehicle that came through the checkpoint, they did not have the <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>authority or the discretion to stop and then restart the checkpoint. In, the trial court’s words, “[t]he authority to conduct the checkpoint [as granted in the Memorandum of Authority] did not include authority to suspend the checkpoint when traffic backed-up.” Trial Court Opinion, dated 2/4/05, at 3-4. The trial court further explained its logic as follows: “[T]he sobriety checkpoint did not satisfy the <em>Tarbert-Blouse </em>requirements because the question of which vehicles to stop at the checkpoint and which vehicles to allow to proceed through when traffic backed-up [sic] was left to the unfettered discretion of the police officers at the scene.

More specifically, the Superior Court determined that the supervising police officer had “unfettered discretion” as to when to suspend the checkpoint due to traffic back-up and when to resume operation. It is undisputed that, on three occasions during the evening of the checkpoint, Sergeant Harvey, the supervising officer, opened the checkpoint to allow all the traffic to pass through unimpeded in order to alleviate a traffic back-up. It is also undisputed that the administrative authorization for the checkpoint did not specifically set forth criteria by which Sergeant Harvey would determine when traffic was sufficiently backed up such that temporary suspension of the checkpoint was warranted. Based on these undisputed facts, the Superior Court, as well as the trial court, inferred that the decision as to which vehicles to stop at the checkpoint was controlled by the arbitrary discretion of the officers at the scene and not by prefixed objective standards. We cannot agree with this inference, as explained below.</p>

Only when the traffic volume became heavy and the resulting back-up caused an unreasonable delay did Sergeant Harvey temporarily suspend operation of the checkpoint and allow every vehicle to pass through unimpeded. Such a temporary suspension and resumption of checkpoint operations occurred only three times during the course of the evening. There was no allegation— much less any evidence — that Sergeant Harvey or any other police personnel, based the decision as to when to suspend or <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>when to resume operation of the checkpoint on the characteristics or actions of any particular vehicle or driver.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">7</a> Rather, Sergeant Harvey’s uncontradicted and uncontested testimony indicated that he ordered suspension, followed by resumption of the checkpoint, based on his experience and trained observations of the traffic conditions at the location of the checkpoint. Thus, while Sergeant Harvey did exercise his informed and knowledgeable discretion regarding when to suspend and when to resume the checkpoint, neither he nor any other officer exercised any discretion as to which vehicles to stop when the checkpoint was in operation because all vehicles were stopped at such times. Contrary to the Superior Court and the trial court, we cannot conclude that this procedure violated the <em>Tarbert-Blouse </em>proscription against placing unfettered discretion with the on-site officers as to which vehicles to stop at the checkpoint.</p>

Considerations of safety, both for the public and the officers, must be paramount in the operation of a checkpoint. With regard to the second requirement, the <em>Tarbert-Blouse </em>guidelines specify that a checkpoint should necessitate only a “momentary stop” for a “brief ... observation” of each vehicle’s operator, in order to keep the intrusion to a minimum. <em>Blouse, supra </em>at 1179-80. An unreasonable delay in passing through the checkpoint would constitute more than a minimal intrusion, and accordingly must be avoided.

Furthermore, it is obvious that many factors influence traffic volume and flow through a checkpoint, such as the characteristics of the roadway, including the number of traffic lanes, the presence or absence of traffic lights and intersections, and posted speed; the nature of the adjacent real estate, and whether it is rural or urban, business or residential; environmental conditions, including weather and light intensity or glare; the number and experience of the officers on the scene; and any unexpected or emergency event along or in the roadway, such as a motor vehicle accident or passing ambulance. The officers on the scene must continually observe and evaluate the net effect of all the interacting influences on traffic volume and flow through the checkpoint. The officers on the scene are the only ones who can integrate the effect of all the conditions on the ground and make an informed and educated decision as to when traffic conditions require temporary suspension of a checkpoint to ensure that safety is paramount and delay is reasonable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">8</a>

Traffic buildup at the checkpoint, however, is <em>sui generis, </em>in that it is always a foreseeable condition, as it stems from the nature of the activities that take place there — most notably, the systematic interruption of normal traffic flow to check for signs of intoxication. Further, establishing parameters to guide officers in determining when to pause, and when to resume, operations, appears to be a relatively straightforward undertaking, whether it is accomplished as part of the administrative authorization for the particular roadblock in question, or in some other way. In the present case, there were no such parameters available to the checkpoint supervisor, and — as is evident from the suppression transcript — this left him with no objective standards to consult in deciding when to suspend and resume operations.

However, the <em>TarbertBlouse </em>requirements are not concerned only with the manner in which an individual driver is stopped, but with ensuring that the sobriety checkpoint is conducted according to neutral, objective criteria so as to comply with the demands of the Constitution. Thus, because I am persuaded that the checkpoint failed to substantially comply with <em>Tarbert-Blouse, </em>I would find Appellee’s detention unconstitutional. Finally, to the extent the Commonwealth avers that the police would have stopped Appellee even if they had not temporarily suspended the checkpoint, I find this contention of little relevance given my determination that the checkpoint was conducted in an unconstitutional manner.</p>

Majority Opinion, at 481 n. 7, 957 A.2d at 726 n. 7. With respect, I believe this assertion misses the point. The guidelines apply to all suspicionless roadway checkpoints as a means of ensuring generally that motorists’ constitutional rights are protected, and it is illegal for the police to fail to comply with them even in instances where there is no evidence of actual misconduct. Thus, the issue is not whether any misconduct occurred, but whether the relevant constitutional principles require prior administrative guidelines for temporary pauses in checkpoint operations.</p>
