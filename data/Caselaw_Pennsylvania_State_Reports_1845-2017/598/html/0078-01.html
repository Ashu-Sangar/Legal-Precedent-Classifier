    <p id="b141-10" data-blocks='[["BL_141.10",141,[185,1272,1151,417]]]'>Appellee, Information System Services, Inc. (“ISS”), developed computer consultation software. It was incorporated in New Jersey in January 1981 and maintained its principal place of business there. In June 1994, however, New Jersey revoked ISS’s certificate of incorporation for failing to file annual reports. ISS’s corporate charter has not been reinstated, and therefore, its general powers conferred by New Jersey law were suspended. <em>See </em>N.J.S. §§ 14A:4-5(5).</p>
    <p id="b141-11" data-blocks='[["BL_141.11",141,[186,1713,1151,635]],["BL_142.1",142,[301,307,1163,469]]]'>Two months after the revocation, ISS purported to sell various corporate assets, including a retail-sales software system, to Appellant, Jonathan Platt, a Pennsylvania resident. The sales agreement was executed in Newtown, Pennsylvania, and was signed by ISS’s president and sole shareholder, Jack Liberi, on the corporation’s behalf. The agreement contained representations and warranties that ISS was a corporation in good standing as a domestic entity under New Jersey law and as a foreign corporation as required by other law, and that ISS maintained full corporate power and authority to enter into the agreement and consummate the transaction. The consideration was to be $350,000, paid in three installments by <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>Platt. Despite the representations and warranties, in addition to lacking good standing in New Jersey, ISS also failed to obtain a certificate of authority from the Pennsylvania Department of State, a prerequisite to “doing business” in the Commonwealth by a foreign corporation. <em>See </em>15 Pa.C.S. § 4121(a) (“A foreign business corporation, before doing business in this Commonwealth, shall procure a certificate of authority to do so from the Department of State, in the manner provided in this subchapter.”).</p>
    <p id="b142-4" data-blocks='[["BL_142.4",142,[297,801,1164,845]]]'>In 2004, ISS filed a complaint in confession of judgment, contending that Platt had failed to tender full payment under the sales agreement. Initially, judgment was entered on the confession, but it was subsequently opened in January 2005, upon Platt’s petition. Platt then moved for summary judgment against ISS, alleging that it lacked the capacity to sue, in light of the revocation of its New Jersey corporate charter, as well as its failure to obtain a certificate of authority in Pennsylvania, <em>see </em>15 Pa.C.S. § 4141(a) (“A nonqualified foreign business corporation doing business in this Commonwealth ... shall not be permitted to maintain any action or proceeding in any court of this Commonwealth until the corporation has obtained a certificate of authority.”). ISS opposed the entry of summary judgment and filed a motion to amend the caption, requesting to substitute “Jack Liberi t/a ISS” as the plaintiff.</p>

First, the court indicated that ISS’s capacity to sue should be determined according to the law of New Jersey, the state of ISS’s incorporation. Referring to New Jersey Statute 14A:4-5(5) (authorizing the state treasurer to issue a proclamation declaring a certificate of incorporation to have been revoked and that all powers conferred by law are inoperative and void), the common pleas court concluded that ISS lacked the authority to sue. The court also found that ISS lacked the capacity to sue in Pennsylvania under Section 4141(a) of the Commonwealth’s Foreign Business Corporation Law, because it did not obtain a certificate of authority in Pennsylvania, a prerequisite to initiating an action in courts of <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>15 Pa.C.S. § 4141(a). Based on its determination that summary judgment was appropriate in light of ISS’s lack of capacity to sue, the common pleas court reasoned that ISS’s motion to amend the caption was moot. The court also indicated that, even if the motion to amend were granted, Liberi also lacked capacity to sue under Section 4141(a)’s proviso that: “Nor ... shall any action or proceeding be maintained in any court of this Commonwealth by any <em>successor </em>or assignee of the corporation on any right, claim or demand arising out of the doing of business by the corporation in this Commonwealth until a certificate of authority has been obtained by the corporation or by a corporation that has acquired all or substantially all of its assets.” 15 Pa.C.S. § 4141(a) (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b143-4" data-blocks='[["BL_143.4",143,[200,1069,1156,690]]]'>ISS appealed, arguing that the common pleas court erred in refusing to permit it to amend the caption to substitute Liberi, in his individual capacity, as plaintiff. ISS contended that Liberi is not subject to the requirement of Section 4141(a), because he is not a corporation, and therefore, could not be subject to the corporation-specific requirement to obtain a certificate of authority. In its opinion under Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(a), the common pleas court repeated its position that Liberi was a successor in interest to ISS, a corporation that lacked the capacity to sue in Pennsylvania. The court concluded that ISS was simply attempting to alter the business classification in an attempt to circumvent Section 4141(a)’s requirement that it obtain a certificate of authority.</p>

The court held that, because the sales agreement was signed after New Jersey revoked ISS’s corporate charter, ISS did not need to obtain a certificate of authority prior to initiating suit in Pennsylvania. According to the Superior Court, the revocation effectuated a complete dissolution of the corporation, such that the sales agreement was between Platt and a “nonexistent corporation.” <em><a href="/a2d/920/0846-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="920 A.2d 846" data-case-ids="8325361" data-case-paths="/a2d/920/0846-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/920/0846-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="920 A.2d 846" data-case-ids="8325361" data-case-paths="/a2d/920/0846-01">at 849</a>.

Since the amendment to the caption to substitute Liberi as plaintiff would not alter the assets subject to liability, the Superior Court found no prejudice to Platt and concluded that the petition to amend should have been granted. <em><a href="/pa-super/366/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="366 Pa.

Referencing the language of Section 4141(a), the Superior Court reasoned that the statute prohibits only successors or assignees of corporations from initiating suit. Because, under the above reasoning, there was no corporation involved in the transaction in the first instance, the court concluded that Section 4141(a) could not apply.</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[292,1086,1161,785]]]'>Presently, Platt argues that the Superior Court’s approach rewards ISS for its corporate malfeasance and nonfeasance by permitting it to avoid the consequences of its failure to comply with clear requirements of New Jersey and Pennsylvania law. According to Platt, ISS’s noncompliance with New Jersey law resulted in the conversion of the corporation into a “non-legal entity” incapable of maintaining a valid lawsuit. Furthermore, Platt relies on Section 4141(a) as prohibiting a foreign corporation and its successors from initiating or maintaining lawsuits that arise out of business transacted in the Commonwealth without first obtaining a certificate of authority. ISS also advances the common pleas court’s interpretation that Liberi is an unauthorized “successor” for purposes of Section 4141(a) and should be foreclosed from making an end-run around the statute.</p>
    <p id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[291,1921,1159,418]],["BL_145.1",145,[186,314,1147,96]]]'>ISS, for its part, agrees that it should be regarded as a dissolved corporation but, in line with the Superior Court’s analysis, asserts that the consequence of the purported dissolution was that ISS assets fell to its sole shareholder, Liberi. Since Liberi signed the agreement with Platt after the asserted dissolution, ISS maintains that the agreement was effectively consummated in his right and interest, as opposed to that of the corporation. ISS stresses that Liberi, as an <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>individual, did not require a certificate of authority to do business or to commence a civil action in Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p id="b145-5" data-blocks='[["BL_145.5",145,[188,616,1152,968]]]'>Upon review of the actual operation of New Jersey law, we differ with the Superior Court and the parties concerning the effect of a revocation of a corporate charter based on a failure to file annual reports. In the first instance, the governing statutes do appear to channel revocation cases into a dissolution procedure. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A. § 14A:12-1(g) (prescribing that a corporation may be dissolved “[a]utomatically by a proclamation of the Secretary of State repealing or revoking a certificate of incorporation for nonpayment of taxes or for failure to file annual reports.”). However, the decisional law appears to treat revocations for failure to file annual reports in a less severe manner, as in the nature of a suspension, distinguishing the full dissolution paradigm and permitting retroactive reinstatement of corporate charters to validate actions taken during the period of revocation. <em>See Asbestos Workers Local Union No. 32 v.
