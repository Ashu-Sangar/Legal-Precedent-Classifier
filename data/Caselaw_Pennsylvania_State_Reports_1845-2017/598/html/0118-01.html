It contends that there is no basis for the City's more restrictive interpretation of the term "harbor structure." HSP contends that such a narrow interpretation disregards the context of the term within Act 321 and the wide array of uses for which licenses have been issued pursuant to the Act, including licenses previously issued for the construction of a sugar refinery on the land at issue. We agree that the statutory language does not restrict the landowner’s use of its property adjoining the waterfront in the way the City now advocates; that is a matter left to local zoning law. The construction of piers, wharves, or other harbor structures as part of the development of a permitted use falls within Act 321.</p>

However, the general repealer clause contained in the Dam Safety Act states that “[a]ll other acts or parts of acts inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.” 32 P.S. § 693.27(b). It seems evident (to me anyway) that Act 321 is inconsistent with Section 6(a) of the Dam Safety Act, at least to the extent Act 321 would otherwise allow the City unilaterally to license HSP to build out into the Delaware River beyond the low-water mark. <em>See id., </em>§ 693.6(a) (prohibiting any person from constructing, operating, maintaining, modifying, enlarging, or abandoning any water obstruction or encroachment without the prior written permission of the state Department of Environmental Protection). Therefore, Act 321 was nullified by the general repeal-er clause at least to this extent. The majority notes that, under the Dam Safety Act, Act 322 licensees (but not Act 321 licensees) may dispense with the Section 693(a) permit requirement. The majority concludes that this reflects a legislative intent not to “eviscerate” Act 321. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 157-61, 954 A.2d at 1179-81. I do not agree, however, that this conclusion follows from the premise. Specifically, Section 693.6(a) requires all persons who “construct ... any <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>... water obstruction or encroachment” anywhere in the Commonwealth to obtain a departmental permit, a precondition of which is that such person hold an interest in the subject property issued pursuant to either the Dam Safety Act, or some “other specific authority from the General Assembly.” 32 P.S. 693.15(a). The mere fact that Act 322 licensees are deemed to already hold such a permit seems irrelevant to the question of whether Act 321 survived the Dam Safety Act, or otherwise constituted “other <em>specific </em>authority” from the General Assembly, such that Act 321 licensees would be eligible to receive a Section 693.6(a) permit. (On this point, moreover, I agree with Mr. Justice McCaffery that Act 321 is general, not specific, authority, as it does not designate any particular tract of land for licensing.)</p>

The answer emerges upon a reading of the entirety of Act 321, which grants powers to the City that are unrelated to encroachments into navigable waterways. Section 9 of that statute, for example, authorizes the Director of Wharves, Docks, and Ferries (now the Director of Commerce) to acquire unimproved, but reclaimable, marshlands that lie wholly within the City “between the low-water line and the high-water shore-line of’ such waterways. 53 P.S. 14197. The act also empowers the director to demand that the owners of harbor structures keep their facilities clean and free of obstructions— or, alternatively, to hire others to clean and clear them and charge the cost back to the owners. <em>See id., </em>§ 14196. There are also reporting requirements, and any number of other provisions in Act 321 that are beneficial in themselves and are entirely consistent with the Legislature’s decision to repose all licensing and permitting power within the Commonwealth government for the building of encroachments into the river in the first instance. The General Assembly could reasonably have found it salutary to leave these measures in place by not repealing Act 321 <em>in toto, </em>but only to the extent of its inconsistency with the Dam Safety Act — a goal evidently accomplished through the wording of the general repealer clause. Hence, I do not share the majority’s view that the <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>mere failure to expressly repeal Act 321 in the same manner as Act 322 evidences an intent to leave it completely unaffected. To the extent there is any doubt on this subject, moreover, it must be resolved against the existence of the City’s authority to issue the license in question. <em>See Denbow v.

Although the <em>amicus </em>brief submitted by that agency indicates that it would not be in a position to convey an interest in the submerged lands in question in the form of an “easement, <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>right-of-way, license or lease,” 32 P.S. § 693.15(a), the Department does not purport to predicate this limitation on the geographical location of the SugarHouse casino. Nor does the Department address the question of whether the City retained authority under the then-existing statutory scheme to grant an “estate or interest” in the submerged lands sought by HSP, which is a precondition to the issuance of a departmental permit. <em>See </em>32 P.S. § 693.15(a) (“No permit shall be granted pursuant to this act for any project to occupy submerged lands of the Commonwealth ... unless the applicant has obtained an easement, right-of-way, license or lease pursuant to this act, or holds an estate or interest in such .submerged lands pursuant to other specific authority from the General Assembly.”). In fact, the Department clarifies that the reason it would not be empowered to grant a license in this case pertains to its view that the project does not conform to the provisions of Sections 693.15(b) and (c) of the act, <em>see </em>Brief at 9 n. 4, which require that the project occupy no more than 25 acres, <em>see </em>32 P.S. § 693.15(c),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> and that it be undertaken for one of a set of specified purposes not relevant here. <em>See </em>32 P.S. § 693.15(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Although the Department recognizes that it does not hold exclusive licensing authority under Section 693.15 for the above reasons, this, in my view, does not support an interpretation favoring the vitality of Act 321, as the majority suggests. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 156-57, 954 A.2d at 1179.

Although the above, while it was in effect, does appear to have authorized the City’s Commerce Department to convey a property interest in the submerged lands of the river, such authority only existed relative to wharves, bridges, and “other harbor structures.” As stated in Act 321’s preamble, the statute was enacted in recognition of the growing commerce of <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>Pennsylvania, and the substantial improvements in the channel-ways of the Commonwealth’s rivers and harbors. Thus, the Legislature authorized the City Department of Wharves, Docks, and Ferries (the predecessor to the City Commerce Department) to regulate the development of “wharves, piers, bulkheads, docks, slips and basins.” Act 321, § 6; <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 14191 (giving the director power to regulate “bulkhead and pierhead lines,” “the distance between piers,” and the development of “wharves, piers, bulkheads, docks, slips, and basins” within Philadelphia city limits). This limited scope of authority also obtains in Section 10 of the act, as quoted above. According to HSP’s site plan, the facilities that will encroach beyond the established bulkhead of the Delaware River into Commonwealth-owned lands include such features as a slots venue, hotel, parking garage, retail space, and restaurants. A slots casino, together with all of its surrounding commercial entities, can be located inland and has no inherent connection to water travel or water-related commerce. Therefore, regardless of how beneficial these items may appear to the City, they are not in the nature of a wharf, bridge, or any other harbor structure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> Accordingly, the construction of such facilities upon submerged lands does not appear to have been contemplated by Section 10 of Act 321,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> and, again, any doubt on the question must be resolved against the existence of the City’s authority.</p>

I would find that the provisions of the Dam Safety Act, at a minimum, give rise to a substantial doubt that the portions of Act 321 at issue remained in effect at the time the license was granted to HSP. (Indeed, I have difficulty envisioning how the Legislature could have been more explicit in the intended comprehensive scope than to do precisely what it did — i.e., specify that the Dam Safety Act applies to all navigable waters in the Commonwealth, including the Delaware River. <em>See </em>32 P.S. § 693.4, 693.12(a).) As to such uncertainty, the majority emphasizes the principle of statutory construction disfavoring implied repeals. It should be noted, however, that — as is often the case — there are multiple competing principles of construction involved here. The Legislature is presumed to intend to retain its power as against municipalities, thus giving rise to the rule noted above that doubts about municipal authority are resolved against their existence. In this regard, although the majority references <em>Pennsylvania Turnpike Comm'n v.

As between these two areas of concern with regard to legislative intent, I believe that the one pertaining to the protection of the General Assembly’s legislative authority should take precedence. Thus, I depart from the majority's decision to elevate the precept that implied repeals are disfavored as the only controlling principle for resolving doubts concerning the City's remaining authority under Act 321.</p>

The Dam Safety Act further provides that all encroachments in the navigable waters of the Delaware River are subject to the approval of the Navigation Commission for the Delaware River, a Commonwealth entity. <em>Id., </em>§ 693.12.</p>

To posit that both the City and the Commonwealth have the authority to grant a license for use of a single, definable portion of a river’s submerged lands is to allow for the possibility that two separate licensees may obtain encroachment rights over the same stretch of river.

The broad scope of the Dam Safety Act, coupled with the general repealer clause which repealed all other acts or parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of the Dam Safety Act, compels the conclusion that the sole authority to grant use of the submerged lands in the Delaware River in Philadelphia lies with the Commonwealth.

Most telling is the 1980 legislative act, by the same legislative session that passed the Dam Safety Act, that authorized the Commonwealth to enter into a lease with the City itself, for the development of Penn’s Landing. Similarly, in 1988 and 1989, the Commonwealth leased submerged lands to the City for development. One is hard-pressed to conceive a reason for these leases to have been issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the City of Philadelphia if the City, in fact, had retained authority itself, pursuant to Act 321, to award use of the lands in the bed of the Delaware subsequent to the passage of the Dam Safety Act amendments in 1979.</p>
