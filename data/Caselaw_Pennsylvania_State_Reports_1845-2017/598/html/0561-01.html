The conceit present in Smolow’s theory is that the negligent owner is entitled to interest despite the lack of an indication that the interest would have been earned by the negligent owner if he had possession of the property during the relevant time. For example, if the property had been an abandoned suitcase of cash, why should the owner receive interest earned through the DAUPA system, when that cash would not have earned any interest sitting in the suitcase?</p>

The federal district court dismissed Smolow as the named-plaintiff in his parallel federal action after determining that Smolow could not claim any net loss justifying compensation, even if the court determined that a taking had occurred. After considering expert testimony presented by both sides, the federal court, concluded that the $170.48 in costs of managing Smolow's presumptively abandoned property far exceeded the interest earned, even taking Smolow’s interest figure, which exceeded the Commonwealth’s interest figure. <em>Smolow, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/513/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="513 F.

Moreover, even if Smolow had stated a claim, it would have been a waste of judicial resources to remand this case for development of the record to determine if he had suffered the net loss required to justify compensation. <em>See Brown, </em><a href="/us/538/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="538 U.S. 216" data-case-ids="9030620" data-case-paths="/us/538/0216-01">538 U.S. at 235-236</a>, <a href="/us/538/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="538 U.S. 216" data-case-ids="9030620" data-case-paths="/us/538/0216-01">123 S.Ct. 1406</a> ('jTjhe just compensation' required by the Fifth Amendment is measured by the property owner’s loss rather than the government’s gain.”). Logic dictates that even an extremely efficient government unclaimed property system would have costs per individual claim that would far exceed the approximately thirty dollars of interest in this case. As Smolow can claim no net loss, no compensation is justified in this case.</p>

Compare <em>Suever v.

The majority, however, makes relatively short work of the question. Notably, although its analysis rests integrally upon a concept of presumed negligence on the part of property owners subject to the operation of the custodial escheat statute, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 566, 959 A.2d at 301, the majority does not pause to discuss the justification for such a presumption or the availability (or non-availability) of due process protections available under the statute to those subject to its operation who are not, in fact, negligent. <em>Cf. Suever v.

Rather, I believe the Commonwealth Court should have considered the general principle that courts will not address debatable constitutional challenges where there is an alternate basis for disposition. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hughes, </em><a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="581 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1140661" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01">581 Pa. 274</a>, 312 n. 24, <a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="865 A.2d 761" data-case-ids="1140661,9035570" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01,/a2d/865/0761-01">865 A.2d 761</a>, 783 n. 24 (2004) (collecting cases).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Had it applied this principle, the court would have deferred decision on Smolow’s constitutional claim pending consideration of whether the Commonwealth’s expenses in the administration of his property and claim were equal to or exceeded his interest claim. This matter has been raised by the Department and is an issue Smolow agrees could be dispositive. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 33. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the federal district court presiding over the federal claims asserted by Smolow considered the net-loss question as a threshold one, rejecting Smolow’s individual claims on the basis that he suffered no net loss prior to consideration of the constitutional challenge maintained by substitute named plaintiffs. <em>See Smolow v. Hafer, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/513/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="513 F. Supp. 2d 418" data-case-ids="3869147" data-case-paths="/f-supp-2d/513/0418-01">513 F.Supp.2d 418</a>, 437 (E.D.Pa.2007). Indeed, the majority finds it obvious that Smolow could not have suffered a loss, albeit as an alternative basis for its disposition, set forth in a closing footnote. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 571 n. 12, 959 A.2d at 304 n. 12.</p>
    <p id="b635-5" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[195,1499,1156,400]]]'>In summary, 1 believe that the most prudential approach to this appeal would be to enforce the application of the settled approach of screening for grounds for resolution alternative to addressing a debatable constitutional claim, particularly since this would clarify whether the decision on the constitutional question is in any way meaningful to the party in interest. Notably, again, the majority ultimately concludes that its own decision simply is not. <em>See id.</em>

        <em>. </em>It occurs to me that the consistent application of this prudential sort of approach to the review is particularly preferable in cases reaching this Court via direct appeal, as it ensures that appeals as of right are appropriately framed and developed for the appellate review. Notably, in the direct-review matters, this Court does not have the ability to prescreen the cases based upon suitability considerations, as it does on the discretionary review docket.</p>
