The Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED.\nThe issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n1. Does the Superior Court\u2019s decision conflict with U.S. Supreme Court precedent on the confrontation clause thereby creating a direct conflict with another Superior Court decision?\n2. Did the Superior Court disregard this Court\u2019s harmless error precedent by allowing the Commonwealth to discharge its burden of proving harmless error through a two-sentence footnote?\n3. Did the Superior Court decision misconstrue the reach of Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), and thereby insulate Pennsylvania\u2019s Tender Years Hearsay Act from an ex post facto challenge?\nJustice McCAFFERY did not participate in the . consideration or decision of this matter.",
