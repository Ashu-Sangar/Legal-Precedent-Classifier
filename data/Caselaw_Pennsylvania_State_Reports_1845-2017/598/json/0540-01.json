This petition was dismissed as untimely, and should be returned to the procedural posture prior to the improper dismissal. As there has been no consideration of evidence in support of the merits of the petition, entitlement to relief under the PCRA must await the three-pronged proofs required in all such matters; resentencing is at best premature.\nJurisdiction relinquished.",
