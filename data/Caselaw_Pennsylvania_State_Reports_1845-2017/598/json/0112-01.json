The issues to be briefed and argued, rephrased for clarity, are:\n(1) By applying state law to override federal treasury regulations, is the Superior Court\u2019s award of the joint treasury account to the decedent\u2019s estate precluded by the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution?\n(2) Did the Superior Court err in holding that the presumption of survivorship under 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6304(a) is defeated, per se, if the joint account results in an allocation of the estate that is inconsistent with an existing will?\n(3) Did the Superior Court err in determining, under 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6304(a), that there was clear and convincing evidence of a different intent at the time the account was created?\n(4) Did the Superior Court err in failing to accord the factual findings of the master the' same weight and effect as a jury verdict?",
