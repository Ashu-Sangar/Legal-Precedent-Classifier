WCAB (Steve\u2019s Prince of Steaks), 572 Pa. 380, 815 A.2d 620 (2003), in determining that Petitioner\u2019s failure to report to an offered job, because of her incarceration, was an act of \u201cbad faith,\u201d which would then relieve Respondent of the burden of showing job availability following any period of subsequent total disability experienced by Petitioner?\n(2) Did the Commonwealth Court commit an error of law in holding that Petitioner was barred by collateral estoppel from arguing that Respondent was, once again, required to show job availability following a period of total disability?",
