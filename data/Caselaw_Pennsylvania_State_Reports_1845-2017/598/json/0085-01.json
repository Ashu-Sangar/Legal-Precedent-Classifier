        "text": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nJustice EAKIN.\nAppellant was convicted of first degree murder for the choking death of Andrea Thomas and sentenced to death. At appellant\u2019s 1990 trial, a witness named Malcolm Tucker testified that when appellant was incarcerated pending trial, he admitted his guilt to Tucker; at the time, Tucker was in prison awaiting trial on sexual assault charges.\nAppellant appealed his conviction, and this Court remanded for a new trial, determining the trial court committed reversible error when it allowed certain evidence to be introduced at trial. See Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 534 Pa. 123, 626 A.2d 550 (1993). Upon retrial in 1994, appellant was again convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. Tucker died before appellant\u2019s second trial, but his testimony from the first trial was read to the jury. This Court affirmed the conviction; the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. See Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 549 Pa. 352, 701 A.2d 492 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1083, 118 S.Ct. 1535, 140 L.Ed.2d 685 (1998).\nAppellant filed a timely petition for relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9541 et seq., which the PCRA court dismissed following an evidentiary hearing. This Court affirmed. See Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 567 Pa. 310, 787 A.2d 292 (2001). Appellant filed a federal habeas corpus petition, and his execution was stayed pending those proceedings.\nIn the course of discovery related to the iiabeas action, appellant deposed Bruce Castor, the Montgomery County assistant district attorney (later district attorney) who prosecuted appellant at his 1990 trial and 1994 retrial. In his deposition, Castor acknowledged he testified at Tucker\u2019s sentencing hearing for the sexual assault charges. When asked how he came to testify at Tucker\u2019s sentencing, Castor replied:\nA. I was subpoenaed.\nQ. Did he have a deal with you guys? Did Mr. Tucker have a deal or some kind of arrangement with Montgomery County ... in exchange for his testimony?\nA. Mm-hmm. Sure.\nQ. What was that?\nA. [T]he deal that he had was that he would testify on our behalf and ... I would testify concerning how it is that he cooperated with us in an open plea before the judge.\nWe don\u2019t get involved in saying, \u201cIf you do this for us, you\u2019ll get this or you\u2019ll get that.\u201d We just \u2014 we\u2019ll make your corporation [sic] known to the judge if you testify on behalf of the Commonwealth.\nQ. Now, were you aware that Mr. Tucker was looking for that sort of consideration when he first came to the attention of the detective?\nA. Well, I don\u2019t know what he knows, but what I do know is ... what we told him; as, in fact, we tell everybody in this situation. We\u2019re not giving any kind of \u2014 specific proposal here.\nWhat we will say is, \u201cIf you have information of value and we think it\u2019s truthful and we utilize it, we will bring your level of corporation [sic] to the attention of your sentencing judge.\u201d\nAnd I remember I testified at his sentencing, and I think the judge gave him six months off for cooperating.\nDeposition of Bruce L. Castor, Jr., 10/28/03, Appellant\u2019s Brief, Exhibit 3, at 55-57.\nAppellant alleges this testimony revealed the existence of a deal between the Commonwealth and Tucker, which the Commonwealth improperly concealed from the defense. Appellant filed a second PCRA petition December 26, 2003, asserting Castor\u2019s deposition testimony constituted \u201cmaterial impeachment evidence,\u201d and that the Commonwealth was bound to disclose the existence of this \u201cdeal\u201d under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\nWithout conducting a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction, the PCRA court assumed the petition was timely. PCRA Court Opinion, 10/31/05, at 1. The PCRA court then considered the merits of the claims raised, and dismissed appellant\u2019s petition without conducting an evidentiary hearing. On appeal, this Court reversed and remanded on the basis the PCRA court failed to adequately set forth the reasons for its dismissal, and because the court failed to provide appellant with notice of its intention to dismiss and 20 days to respond before its dismissal, as required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B)(2). See Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 583 Pa. 104, 876 A.2d 365 (2005).\nOn remand, the PCRA court issued a memorandum and order stating its intention to dismiss appellant\u2019s petition and allowed appellant 20 days to respond. Having determined appellant\u2019s response failed to establish any genuine issue of material fact and that any further proceedings would serve no legitimate purpose, the court dismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing. See PCRA Court Opinion, 10/31/05, at 3. Appellant filed the instant appeal.\nOn appeal from the denial of PCRA relief, our standard and scope of review is limited to determining wheth-' er the PCRA court\u2019s findings are supported by the record and without legal error. Commonwealth v. Breakiron, 566 Pa. 323, 781 A.2d 94, 97 n. 4 (2001). A second or subsequent request for relief under the PCRA will not be entertained unless the petitioner presents a strong prima facie showing that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred. Commonwealth v. Carpenter, 555 Pa. 434, 725 A.2d 154, 160 (1999).\nAppellant argues the PCRA court erred in dismissing the petition without a hearing, and asserts he is entitled to relief, \u201cbased on newly discovered evidence that the Commonwealth engaged in misconduct and violated Brady v. Maryland, [373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194 (1963)] and Giglio v. United States, [405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763 (1972)] when it failed to disclose that the district attorney agreed to testify on behalf of a key prosecution witness at the witness\u2019 sentencing hearing .... \u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 3. Appellant fails to state under which substantive provision of the PCRA he asserts he is eligible for relief. Rather, he cites the PCRA generally as providing the basis for his requested relief.\nIn response, the Commonwealth correctly points out appellant\u2019s petition was not filed within one year of the date his sentence became final, which occurred April 20, 1998 \u2014 the date the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. This petition was not filed until December 26, 2003. Where, as here, a claim is not raised in a timely petition, the petitioner must allege and prove one of the three exceptions to the PCRA\u2019s timeliness requirements applies. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). Where the petition invokes one of these exceptions, the petition must be filed within 60 days of the date the claim could have first been presented. Id., \u00a7 9545(b)(2).\nAppellant\u2019s petition cites the timeliness exceptions set forth in \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(i) and (ii). He provides the following four paragraphs in support of his assertion that the claims raised in his petition are timely and properly before the court:\n28. Although the instant Petition is filed more than a year after Petitioner\u2019s conviction became final, the above-cited exceptions apply to Petitioner and renders his filing timely. This claim could not have been presented before this time, as a result of government interference.\n29. This Petition alleges that the Commonwealth failed to disclose substantial exculpatory material in violation of Brady v. Maryland, and its progeny. Such claims fit into subsection (b)(l)(i) because \u201cthe failure to raise the claim[s] previously was the result of interference by government officials \u2014 [the Brady violations] with the presentation of the claim[s].\u201d The claim also fits into subsection (b)(l)(ii) (\u201cthe facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence.\u201d)\n30. Petitioner is indigent, incarcerated, not learned in the law, and has consistently exercised due diligence in seeking appointment of counsel, investigation of his case, and vindication of his rights.\n31. This claim could not have been presented prior to the time when Mr. Castor admitted to having a deal with Mr. Tucker (who died prior to Petitioner\u2019s second trial).\nPCRA Petition, 12/26/03, at 9-10.\nThe PCRA court \u201cassumed that the petition was timely under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1) because it alleged that the prosecutor ... had improperly concealed the existence of a plea agreement between the Commonwealth and one of its key witnesses, Malcolm Tucker[,]\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 10/31/05, at 1-2, but the court failed to explain or justify this assumption. However, it is well-settled that the PCRA\u2019s timeliness requirements are jurisdictional in nature and courts may not address the merits of the issues raised in a petition if it is not timely filed. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 574 Pa. 724, 833 A.2d 719, 723-24 (2003); County of Allegheny v. Commonwealth, 507 Pa. 360, 490 A.2d 402, 406 n. 2 (1985) (jurisdiction may be raised sua sponte by court). The PCRA court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the instant petition as it was untimely and did not fall under any exception; however, the court failed to conduct the threshold timeliness inquiry. We therefore vacate the PCRA court\u2019s order, and will now address the timeliness issue based on the two exceptions cited in the petition.\nThis Court has repeatedly stated it is the appellant\u2019s burden to allege and prove that one of the timeliness exceptions applies. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Beasley, 559 Pa. 604, 741 A.2d 1258, 1261 (1999). Appellant\u2019s petition appears to claim the alleged Brady violation falls within both the governmental interference exception and the newly-discovered evidence exception to the one-year filing period. Although a Brady violation may fall within the governmental interference exception, the petitioner must plead and prove that the failure to previously raise these claims was the result of interference by government officials, and that the information could not have been obtained earlier with the exercise of due diligence. Breakiron, at 98. The newly-discovered evidence exception requires that the facts upon which the Brady claim is predicated were not previously known to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained through due diligence. Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 884 A.2d 848, 852 (2005); see also Commonwealth v. Chester, 586 Pa. 468, 895 A.2d 520, 523 (2006).\nAppellant claims the facts upon which his Brady claim is based were first revealed in Castor\u2019s 2003 deposition testimony, and were therefore unknown to him, and due diligence would not have revealed them before that time. Appellant alleges Castor admitted during his deposition there was a deal with Tucker whereby Castor would testify on Tucker\u2019s behalf at his sentencing hearing. Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 11. He asserts since the Commonwealth had previously denied any agreement was made with Tucker, Castor\u2019s deposition revealed this information for the first time. Appellant\u2019s claim is belied by the record.\nIn his 1997 direct appeal, this Court rejected appellant\u2019s double jeopardy claim, which was based on the allegation the Commonwealth failed to disclose a leniency agreement with Tucker. Hawkins, at 552. We reasoned:\n[t]he Commonwealth has consistently maintained that it has no record reflecting any plea agreement with Tucker and that it never promised Tucker leniency in return for his testifying against appellant. Under these circumstances, we decline to find ... a Brady violation occurred since appellant again offers nothing other than mere conjecture that such an arrangement existed.\nId.\nThe facts set forth in Castor\u2019s 2003 deposition are in accord with this. It shows neither a plea agreement with Tucker, nor a promise of leniency. It does not reveal any additional support for appellant\u2019s Brady claim. The deposition merely restated the same facts appellant had known since 1990 and 1991 \u2014 that Castor informed Tucker his testimony as a Commonwealth witness would be made known at Tucker\u2019s own sentencing hearing. Castor\u2019s 2003 deposition testimony simply reaffirmed the facts expressed in his earlier testimony at Tucker\u2019s 1991 sentencing hearing and Tucker\u2019s testimony at appellant\u2019s 1990 trial and 1994 retrial. Tucker testified:\nQ. Why did you decide at that point to cooperate with the police?\nA. I didn\u2019t want him on the street.\nQ. Are there any other reasons that you would want to cooperate with the police?\nA. I would hope that some consideration would be taken in my case.\nQ. Have any promises been made to you to get you to testify?\nA. No.\nQ. Have any threats been made to you to get you to testify?\nA. No, there have not.\nQ. Has there been given any inducements to you whatsoever to get you to testify?\nA. None at all.\nN.T. Trial, 8/7/90, at 25-26.\nAlthough Tucker admitted he was hopeful his cooperation would be looked upon favorably at his own sentencing, he expressly stated no promises, threats, or inducements were made to secure his testimony. Castor\u2019s testimony at Tucker\u2019s 1991 sentencing hearing does not add to this. Castor merely informed the sentencing court that Tucker testified for the Commonwealth at appellant\u2019s trial, and the information he provided was helpful in securing appellant\u2019s conviction; this testimony was given pursuant to a subpoena by Tucker\u2019s attorney, not as a deal offering leniency for favorable testimony. Specifically, at Tucker\u2019s sentencing Castor testified:\nQ. And was his testimony helpful in obtaining a conviction for Mr. Hawkins?\nA. Yes, it was.\nQ. A little helpful? Significantly helpful?\nA. Well, you have got to understand that we had already arrested Hawkins so at some time prior to the trial and prior to his arrest I had come to the conclusion Mr. Hawkins was going to be convicted. I learned about the evidence that Mr. Tucker had for us after his arrest; therefore, I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t have won the case without him but he was a significant piece of evidence in the prosecution and as it turned out the defendant bolstered his testimony because the defendant said he had never spoken with Mr. Tucker and I could prove that Mr. Tucker had spoken with the defendant. So it did help significantly.\nQ. So Tucker\u2019s credibility was important to the case also?\nA. Yes, it was.\nQ. Did you ask Mr. Tucker why he was testifying?\nA. Yes, 1 asked him on a number of occasions prior to the trial and also under oath in the courtroom.\nQ. And what was his answer?\nA. Well, he told me that he was approached by Hawkins because Hawkins knew your client did private investigating work and he was going to help Mr. Hawkins out. He was going to\" help Hawkins out in this case. He began to take notes and as he was learning from Hawkins what the crimes were he told me that his opinion changed and he thought Mr. Hawkins was a pretty bad criminal and he wanted to do something to try to stick it to him, as it were. And I said, now, that\u2019s not the only reason. And he said, no, I hope that a day like today would come where I would testify in mitigation of any crimes he is charged with. So it was both reasons.\nN.T. Tucker Sentencing, 5/20/91, at 17-18.\nAgain, this testimony was given in 1991; appellant was retried in 1994. While he raised the issue of a deal with Tucker throughout his direct appeal and his PCRA proceedings, appellant did not depose Castor until 2003 in his federal action. While Justice Saylor\u2019s concurring opinion suggests the evidentiary record of the District Attorney\u2019s policy to cooperate at sentencing with potential witnesses has not been established, Justice Saylor\u2019s Concurring Op., at 1257, there is much evidence confirming this hardly uncommon policy, and no evidence to the contrary.\nThe \u201cdeal\u201d alleged was not a unique windfall for Tucker; it was apparently a standard matter. As Castor testified:\n[W]e told him; as, in fact, we tell everybody in this situation. We\u2019re not giving any kind of \u2014 any specific proposal here. What we will say is, \u201cIf you have information of value and we think it\u2019s truthful and we utilize it, we will bring your level of corporation [sic] to the attention of your sentencing judge.\u201d\nDeposition of Bruce L. Castor, Jr., 10/28/03, Appellant\u2019s Brief, Exhibit 3, at 56-57.\nIf this is truly a \u201cdeal,\u201d it was not a deal specific to Tucker \u2014 it is a deal offered to \u201ceverybody in this situation.\u201d To find to the contrary would require a finding that District Attorney Castor perjured himself, and even appellant does not suggest this. To say a deal offered to everyone was not discoverable with the exercise of due diligence is unrealistic. Indeed, had Tucker\u2019s counsel wished to provide his sentencing judge with his cooperation, he could do so by exactly the means used here \u2014 subpoena the prosecutor. No \u201cdeal\u201d was needed.\nAs Castor did testify at Tucker\u2019s 1991 public sentencing, the testimony was in public records. See generally Chester, at 523 (\u201c[F]or purposes of ... \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(ii), information is not \u2018unknown\u2019 to a PCRA petitioner when the information was a matter of public record.\u201d). While the 1990 and 1991 testimony did not reveal details of an \u201cagreement,\u201d the facts upon which the claim is predicated are obviously present in the 1990 and 1991 testimony discussed above, and were certainly discoverable with any diligence at all. Since Castor\u2019s 2003 deposition testimony simply reflects the same information appellant had known since 1990 and 1991, we reject appellant\u2019s claim that the facts in the 2003 deposition were previously unknown to appellant and could not have been obtained a decade earlier with the exercise of due diligence.\nWhile Justice Saylor\u2019s thoughtful discussion of the appropriate interpretation of Giglio is intriguing, see Justice Saylor\u2019s Concurring Op., at 1256-57, the level of specific disclosure generally required for a routine, non-promissory arrangement between the Commonwealth and a witness is not squarely before us. As concerns timeliness under the PCRA, the standard is whether the existence of the purported agreement could have been \u201cascertained by the exercise of due diligence[,]\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h), one year from when appellant\u2019s sentence became final April 20, 1998. Id.; Mmray, at 202. As discussed above, there is no evidence suggesting the facts underlying appellant\u2019s claim were not ascertainable as early as 1990 and 1991. Further, the fact that such \u201cdeals\u201d between the Commonwealth and witnesses were universally available is fatal to appellant\u2019s claim here. See Justice Saylor\u2019s Concurring Op., at 1257. Even if we were to speculate a Giglio violation occurred, appellant would have had to raise that claim for PCRA purposes within one year from when his judgment of sentence became final on April 20, 1998.\nTherefore, appellant has not established his claim falls within either the newly-discovered evidence exception or the governmental interference exception to the PCRA\u2019s timeliness requirements. Because the PCRA court was thus without jurisdiction to consider the merits of this petition, see AbuJamal, at 723-24, we vacate that court\u2019s order and dismiss this petition as time-barred. The Prothonotary is directed to transmit the complete record in this case to the Governor pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(i).\nOrder vacated. Petition dismissed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nMadame Justice Greenspan did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justice McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion in which Justice BAER joins.\nJustice TODD files a concurring opinion.\n. All petitions filed under the PCRA, including second or subsequent petitions, must be filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final, unless the petition alleges, and the petitioner proves, an exception to the one-year time period. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b); Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 941 A.2d 1263, 1265 n. 4 (Pa.2008). The exceptions apply where the petition alleges and proves:\n(i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States;\n(ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence; or\n(iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and has been held by that court to apply retroactively.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(i)-(iii).",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\nconcurring.\nWhile I join in the result reached by the lead Justices, I respectfully differ with the reasoning concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s agreement with Malcolm Tucker. In contrast to the view expressed by the lead opinion, I believe that the evidence of a pre-existing agreement between Tucker and the Commonwealth as reflected in the District Attorney\u2019s 2003 deposition testimony constituted a factual predicate for Appellant\u2019s claim that is distinct from either Tucker\u2019s earlier statement regarding his subjective hope of favorable treatment at his sentencing hearing or the District Attorney\u2019s subsequent testimony at that hearing.\nThe underlying principles governing Appellant\u2019s claim were initially set forth in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), wherein the United States Supreme Court held that due process is offended when the prosecution withholds favorable evidence to an accused that would tend to exculpate him or reduce the penalty imposed. See id. at 87-88, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-97. Several years later, the Court extended this rule to embrace certain impeaching evidence, including that which might demonstrate witness bias. See Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 155, 92 S.Ct. 763, 766, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). This determination relied in part on the Court\u2019s prior decision in Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959), in which it observed that \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence, and it is upon such subtle factors as the possible interest of the witness in testifying falsely that a defendant\u2019s life or liberty may depend.\u201d\nIn the present matter, the prosecutor apparently promised Tucker that he would personally appear and testify at his sentencing hearing and make his cooperation in Appellant\u2019s trial known to the court. Tucker therefore would have had more than a subjective hope of receiving consideration. In my view, under Brady, Giglio, and their progeny, the Commonwealth should have revealed this information so the jury could have more completely assessed Tucker\u2019s credibility. Indeed, the District Attorney directly acknowledged that Tucker\u2019s testimony was an important factor in the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Appellant. See Lead Opinion, op. at 1254 (quoting Commonwealth v. Tucker, Nos. 5163-90 & 2150-90, N.T., May 20, 1991, at 17-18). While I agree with the lead Justices that this case does not involve a promise of leniency or a plea agreement, the prosecutor\u2019s promise to appear at Tucker\u2019s hearing was clearly relevant to Tucker\u2019s motivation to testify at Appellant\u2019s trial. See Strong, 563 Pa. at 464, 761 A.2d at 1172 (observing that \u201cdue process requires that any potential understanding between the prosecution and a witness be revealed to the jury\u201d).\nThe Supreme Court of Georgia addressed a similar question in Patillo v. State, 258 Ga. 255, 368 S.E.2d 493 (1988), where, in exchange for a witness\u2019 testimony, two assistant district attorneys agreed to inform the judge who had previously revoked the witness\u2019 probation in a separate matter that the witness testified favorably in the case at hand. In their discussions with this witness, the assistant district attorneys specified that they would not make a specific recommendation to the judge; rather, they would leave the decision to the judge whether or not to reinstate his probation. See Patillo, 368 S.E.2d at 497. The trial court determined that this evidence should have been disclosed by the prosecution, observing that \u201cthe state should have revealed the agreement no matter how non-promising the agreement was in terms of its prospects for the witness.\u201d Id. at 498. The Supreme Court of Georgia agreed with the trial court\u2019s reasoning and conclusion in this regard. See id. at 497. I find such analysis to be persuasive as the plain terms of Napue and Giglio require the disclosure of impeachment evidence. Accordingly, I believe that the district attorney\u2019s agreement with Appellant, notwithstanding its \u201cnon-promissory\u201d nature as to Tucker\u2019s ultimate sentence, should have been disclosed.\nThat being said, in addition to discussing the agreement between the Commonwealth and Tucker in his 2003 deposition, the District Attorney also stated that his office routinely indicated its willingness to cooperate at sentencing -with potential witnesses who could provide valuable testimony. The lead opinion concludes that this effectively undermines Appellant\u2019s assertion that he could not have discovered evidence of the agreement prior to 2003, reasoning that it would be unrealistic to conclude that a deal that was offered to everyone was not discoverable with the exercise of due diligence. I agree that the existence of such a policy would be fatal to Appellant\u2019s claim, since it could presumably have been ascertained through due diligence. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9545(b)(l)(i), (ii). Notably, however, the PCRA court did not make a specific factual finding regarding the existence of this policy. Indeed, since the PCRA court assumed the timeliness of Appellant\u2019s petition and dismissed it without an evidentiary hearing, the record has been insufficiently developed to evaluate this question, or to assess the other timeliness issues involved in this case.\nGiven that the timeliness of Appellant\u2019s petition implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of both this Court and the PCRA court, a remand of this matter for further proceedings might generally be warranted. However, in light of the other substantial evidence offered against Appellant at trial, I would ultimately conclude that Appellant has not established the degree of prejudice necessary to obtain post-conviction relief, despite my belief that the Commonwealth should have revealed its agreement with Tucker. Accord Patillo, 368 S.E.2d at 498 (implementing a similar disposition based on the reasoning that the outcome of the trial would not likely have been different, as, inter alia, the agreement was of a non-promissory nature and the witness was otherwise impeached by the revelation of his own criminal record). This analysis also applies to Appellant\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor impermissibly elicited false testimony by asking Tucker whether he had been offered any inducements to testify and failing to correct Tucker\u2019s response that he had not. See N.T., August 16, 1994, at 414. The United States Supreme Court has observed that, \u201c[ejven in eases of egregious prosecutorial misconduct, such as the knowing use of perjured testimony, we have required a new trial only when the tainted evidence was material to the case.\u201d Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 220 n. 10, 102 S.Ct. 940, 947 n. 10, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982) (citing Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154, 92 S.Ct. at 766, Napue, 360 U.S. at 272, 79 S.Ct. at 1178). In this regard, the Court explained that the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct on the trial (rather than the misconduct itself) constitutes the crucial inquiry for purposes of due process. See id. Therefore, assuming, arguendo, the existence of subject matter jurisdiction, I concur with the lead Justices that Appellant\u2019s present claims do not give rise to a basis for relief.\nJustice BAER joins this concurring opinion.\nJustice TODD.\nI join the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court in its result, as I agree Appellant has failed to establish his Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d) petition was timely filed. My reasoning somewhat differs, however.\nContrary to the lead opinion\u2019s characterization, I agree with the conclusion of Mr. Justice Saylor in his concurring opinion that \u201cthe evidence of a pre-existing agreement between Tucker and the Commonwealth as reflected in the District Attorney\u2019s 2003 deposition testimony constituted a factual predicate for Appellant\u2019s claim that is distinct from either Tucker\u2019s earlier statement regarding his subjective hope of favorable treatment at his sentencing hearing or the District Attorney\u2019s subsequent testimony at that hearing.\u201d Concurring Op. at 1. Nevertheless, Appellant was obliged to prove why, with the exercise of due diligence, he could not have obtained Castor\u2019s deposition testimony prior to 2003. As Appellant does not assert, let alone prove, that he could not have sought, or that he sought and was denied, such discovery prior to this time, he fails to fulfill the due diligence requirement. For this reason, I agree with the lead opinion Appellant has failed to establish his PCRA claim falls within any of the timeliness exceptions to the PCRA, and that his PCRA petition was, therefore, untimely filed.\n. I recognize that courts have differed in the application of Giglio in the context of less formal arrangements between government agents and cooperating witnesses. See generally R. Michael Cassidy, \u201cSoft Words of Hope:\u201d Giglio, Accomplice Witnesses, and the Problem of Implied Inducements, 98 Nw. U.L.Rev. 1129, 1152-57 (collecting cases and discussing problems in the application of Giglio). Several courts have narrowly construed Giglio as only requiring the disclosure of explicit agreements. See, e.g., Tarver v. Hopper, 169 F.3d 710 (11th Cir.1999); Moore v. Zant, 682 F.Supp. 549 (M.D.Ga.1988). Other courts, however, have interpreted the case as mandating the disclosure of inducements that do not rise to the level of express offers. See, e.g., Campbell v. Reed, 594 F.2d 4 (4th Cir.1979); Commonwealth v. Hill, 432 Mass. 704, 739 N.E.2d 670 (2000); People v. Diaz, 297 Ill.App.3d 362, 231 Ill.Dec. 523, 696 N.E.2d 819 (1998). I favor the latter approach, as I believe that it constitutes a more effective means of addressing the credibility/impeachment concerns that underlie the Giglio holding. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Strong, 563 Pa. 455, 469, 761 A.2d 1167, 1175 (2000) (observing that a tentative commitment from a prosecutor might be more likely to encourage false testimony from a cooperating witness than a firm promise, since the witness will have a greater incentive to curry favor with the prosecutor if a specific agreement has not yet been reached).\n. Indeed, the District Attorney acknowledged that such agreements are relevant to a witness' credibility: \"[Wjhenever I have had situations where I have sources like this testifying, you always bring that out in the direct evidence, what the situation is that he\u2019s expecting to get as a result of testifying, because you've got to explain to the jury what, you know, what potential motives he might have to be biased in our favor or whatever.\u201d Oral Deposition of Bruce L. Castor, Jr., Oct. 28, 2003, at 59. When the District Attorney was asked whether this particular agreement was placed on the record, he indicated that, \"I probably put it on the record at the \u2014 when he testified. It was \u2014 it has always been my practice to bring that out in court, say it right there on the record.\" Id. at 58.\n. I also differ with the lead opinion\u2019s use of the term \"newly discovered evidence\u201d in referencing Section 9545(b)(l)(ii), see Lead Opinion, op. at 1252-53, as I believe that the use of this short-hand is unnecessary and confusing in light of this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Bennett, 593 Pa. 382, 930 A.2d 1264 (2007).\n. This Court has not directly addressed whether Pennsylvania courts may forego the resolution of a complex jurisdictional matter in favor of a disposition based on the clear-cut merits of an underlying substantive issue. Traditionally, however, the federal courts could exercise such \u201chypothetical jurisdiction\u201d pursuant to Norton v. Mathews, 427 U.S. 524, 532, 96 S.Ct. 2771, 2775 (1976) (permitting federal courts to \"reserv[ej difficult questions ... of jurisdiction when the case alternatively could be resolved on the merits in favor of the same party\u201d). This practice was significantly curtailed in Steel Company v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998), which held that, at least in the context of Article III jurisdictional questions, the exercise of such jurisdiction was improper. Notably, though, the Steel Company decision did not specifically preclude the application of \"hypothetical jurisdiction\u201d in cases that did not implicate Article III. As such, several intermediate federal courts have continued to exercise such jurisdiction in situations involving statutory, rather than constitutional, jurisdictional matters. See, e.g., Royal Siam Corp. v. Chertoff, 484 F.3d 139 (1st Cir.2007), Abimbola v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 173 (2d Cir.2004), Bowers v. Nat\u2019l Collegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n, 346 F.3d 402 (3d Cir.2003). In my view, this approach constitutes a reasonable means of insuring judicial economy in cases involving clearly meritless claims, and, furthermore, it comports with this Court's similar practice of permitting the resolution of waiver issues through reference to the merits of an underlying claim. See Commonwealth v. Hughes, 581 Pa. 274, 304 n. 13, 865 A.2d 761, 779 n. 13 (2004).",
