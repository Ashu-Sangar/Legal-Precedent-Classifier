The issues, rephrased for clarity, are:\n(1) Is a criminal defendant\u2019s request to represent himself or herself timely where the defendant makes the request after the denial of a pre-trial motion and just prior to the commencement of a bench trial?\n(2) At a bench trial, where a defendant has indicated his or her readiness to proceed pro se, is it an abuse of discretion to deny the pro se request without conducting a colloquy as required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 121(C)?\nThe parties are directed to submit the matter on briefs.\nJustice TODD did not participate in the consideration or decision in this matter.",
