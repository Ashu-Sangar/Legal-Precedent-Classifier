The Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED, LIMITED to the following issues set forth below. The issues, as stated be petitioner, are:\n1. Whether as a matter of first impression, an attorneys\u2019 fee award made pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (\u201cMMWA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 et seq., cannot be entered after entry of judgment where: (i) the MMWA requires that fee awards be entered as \u201cpart of the judgment,\u201d and where (ii) Plaintiff voluntarily took judgment on the underlying verdict, and thus disposed of all claims (including the Plaintiffs unresolved claim for attorneys\u2019 fees) before the trial court entered the fee award.\n2. Whether under Pa.R.A.P 1701, a trial court lacks jurisdiction to enter a fee award after judgment has been entered and a notice of appeal has been filed.\n3. Whether, as a matter of first impression, the courts of Pennsylvania are required to follow United States Supreme Court precedent regarding the interpretation of federal fee shifting statutes when interpreting the fee shifting provision of the MMWA, and, if so, whether the trial court\u2019s decision to add a $1 million \u201crisk multiplier\u201d bonus to the fee award violates controlling United States Supreme Court precedent.",
