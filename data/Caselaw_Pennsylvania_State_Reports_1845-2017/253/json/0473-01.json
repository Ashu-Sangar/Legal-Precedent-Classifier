Kelley, deceased, to No. 16, January, 1916, it is held that the legal representative of E. W. Kelley has no claim upon the fund in court. The present appeal by the administrator complains that the allowance of interest was insufficient. Inasmuch as it has been decided that the representative is without standing, this appeal must be dismissed and it is accordingly so ordered.",
