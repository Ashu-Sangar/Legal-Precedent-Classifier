Lehman.\nWills \u2014 Life estates \u2014 Remainders\u2014Children\u2014Words of purchase \u2014Rule in Shelley\u2019s Case.\nWhere a testator devised certain real estate \u201cto my nephew...... for and during the term of his natural life. At his death the same is devised to the child or children in fee,\u201d the nephew took but a life estate in the property; the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case did not apply, and the children took as purchasers, not by devolution from their father.\nArgued March 6, 1916.\nAppeal, No. 84, Jan. T., 1915, by plaintiff, .from judgment of C. P. Franklin Co., Feb. T., 1915, No. 79, for defendant, on case stated, in case of Thomas A. McAfee v. Boy M. Lehman.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated to determine the nature and extent of plaintiff\u2019s interest in real estate.\nGillan, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nWe are asked to dispose of this case immediately in order that it may be heard in the Supreme Court on the next return day for this district. This does not give us the time for consideration that the question involved deserves. Since, however, it will be carried to the Supreme Court whatever our judgment may be, the matter will be there finally and properly settled.\nThe case stated sets forth the following as the facts:\nThomas A. McAfee, the plaintiff, entered into an article of agreement in writing by which he agreed to convey to the defendant, Roy M. Lehman, in fee simple two certain lots of ground situate in the Borough of Mercers-burg, in consideration whereof defendant, Roy M. Lehman, agreed to pay to the plaintiff the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). The defendant refused to comply with this agreement because he says the plaintiff cannot convey the said real estate in fee simple. It is agreed that if the court be of opinion that the plaintiff can make a fee simple title for said lots of ground then judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff in the snm of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). Otherwise judgment to be entered for the defendant. Costs to follow the judgment, each party reserving the right of appeal.\nThe plaintiff derived title to the said real estate by the will of James B. McAfee, dated 19th of September, 1911. James B. McAfee died on the 7th day of March, 1914. His will, which, since his death, has been duly probated, is as follows:\n\u201cI, James B. McAfee, of the Borough of Mercersburg, Franklin Co., Pa., being of sound and disposing memory and understanding, hereby make, publish and declare the following as and for my last will and testament, hereby revoking any and all wills by me at any time heretofore made.\n\u201cFirst: I direct that all just debts and funeral expenses be paid by my executor hereinafter named, as soon as he may find it convenient to do so.\n\u201cSecond: I give, devise and bequeath the Mansion House with the stable and all other buildings and ground appurtenant, lying west of North Main street, and on both sides of Oregon street, in the Borough of Mercer s-burg, Pa., to my nephew, Thomas A. McAfee, for and during the term of his natural life. At his death, the same is devised to the child or children in fee. If Thomas A. McAfee shall die leaving no child or children him surviving, in that event the above described property is devised to the children of my nephew, John McAfee. In no event shall John McAfee\u2019s children come into full possession of said property before they arrive at the age of thirty-five years. I also give and bequeath the big clock in the sitting room to my nephew, Thomas A. McAfee.\n\u201cThird: I give, devise and bequeath to Ellen Bennett, a house and lot now occupied by her for and during a term of her natural life. Said house and lot is situated on the east side of North Main street, Mercersburg, Pa. At her death the same shall be sold and the proceeds of sale shall go to the residue of my estate.\n\u201cFourth: I give and bequeath to my nephew, Thomas A. McAfee, the sum of $4,000.00 to have and to hold the same in trust. To invest the same in good lawful securities, to collect and receive the income therefrom, and pay to Ellen Bennett the sum of twelve dollars and fifty cents ($12.50) per month on the first days of each and every month for and during the life of said Ellen Bennett. At her death, the principal sum of $4,000.00 shall go into the residue of my estate.\n\u201cFifth: I direct that all the rest and residue of my estate,-real, personal and mixed, shall be converted into cash, and the same shall be divided into two halves. The one-half shall be divided into eight shares as follows:\n\u201cOne share to Kate Parker.\n\u201cOne share to William Funk\u2019s children.\n\u201cOne share to Annie Lackhover\u2019s children.\n\u201cOne share to John M. Funk.\n\u201cOne share to Edith Sheely.\n\u201cOne share to Mark M. Funk.\n\u201cOne share to Jacob Funk.\n\u201cOne share to James Funk.\n\u201cThe other half of my estate is to be divided into .two shares, the one share to John McAfee, and the other share to Thomas A. McAfee. The residue of my estate is to be divided just the same as the rest of my estate.\n\u201cI authorize and empower my executor to sell and convey all my real estate at public or private sale, to carry out the provisions of this my last will.\n\u201cI hereby nominate and appoint my nephew, Thomas A. McAfee, executor of this my last will and testament.\n\u201cWitness my hand and seal this nineteenth day of September, 1911. \u201cJames B. McAfee, (Seal).\u201d\nThe property in controversy is that described in the; second clause of the will. The question here is of course; whether or not the plaintiff took an estate in fee tail, which by the Act of April 27,1855, P. L. 368, is enlarged' into an estate in fee simple. Our first duty is to ascertain, the intention of the testator. Having ascertained that; intention we are to inquire whether or not any technical rule of law prohibits the intention being carried into\u00bb effect. It will be observed that the testator nowhere; in his will uses the words heirs, or issue. The words by which he devises the real estate are as follows:\n\u201cI give, devise and bequeath.......to my nephew,. Thomas A.McAfee, for and during the term of his natural life. At his death the same is devised to the child or children in fee. If Thomas A. McAfee shall die leaving-no child or children him surviving, in that event the above described property is devised to the children of my nephew, John McAfee.\u201d\nIt will be observed that it is only by the latter part of the above recited clause that we can conclude that the \u201cchild or children in fee\u201d refers to the children of Thomas A. McAfee the first taker. It will be further observed that the devise is to Thomas A. McAfee for life. Then in a separate clause \u201cat his death......to the child or children in fee.\u201d We are not informed by the case stated whether the said Thomas A. McAfee has any child or children. \u201cThe word child does not include......heirs, heirs of the body or issue unless such interpretation is imperativ\u00e9 or where the intention to \u00fase the word in a broader sense a more extended signification appears from tbe context of tbe instrument in which it is employed.\u201d\n7 Oyc. 125-127.\nIt seems to us from the plain language of this will that if Thomas A. McAfee have any,child or children they take this estate in fee by devise to them under the will of James B. McAfee as purchasers and not derivatively from their father. As we have said, we are not informed whether Thomas A. McAfee has children or not but whether the estate pass eventually to the children of Thomas A. McAfee, or the children of John McAfee it is evident that it goes to them as a new stock. The will is plain so that the consideration of technical rules to aid in its construction is not necessary. We are of opinion the plaintiff is not seized in a fee simple title to the real estate described and can not thus convey it.\nThe court entered judgment for defendant upon the case stated. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was the judgment of the court.\nO. O. Bowers, for appellant.\n(r. W. Atherton, for appellee, was not heard.\nApril 17, 1916 :"
