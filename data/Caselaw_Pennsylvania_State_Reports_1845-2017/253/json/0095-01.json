    "head_matter": "National Milk Sugar Company v. Smith, Kline and French Company, Appellant.\nQontracts \u2014 Sales\u2014Executory contracts \u2014 Rescission \u2014 Affidavits of defense \u2014 Insufficient averments.\nA manufacturer of milk sugar sold its product to certain vendees at a special price under an agreement which provided that the vendees would not enter into competition with the vendor by selling the milk sugar to other persons, and that if the agreement were violated by the vendees, the vendor might recover for all loss suffered by reason of the forbidden sale, for all milk sugar delivered and not paid for, and might rescind the contract on ten days\u2019 notice of its intention to do so. In an action by the vendor for milk sugar sold and delivered to the vendee, plaintiff .alleged a violation by defendant of the agreement relating to the sale of milk sugar, and that the contract had been rescinded; the affidavit of defense admitted the violation of the agreement but averred that it was done inadvertently and counterclaimed for the loss sustained by reason of plaintiff\u2019s rescission of the agreement. Held, the lower court did not err in entering judgment for plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nArgued Feb. 15, 1916.\nAppeal, No. 122, Jan. T., 1915, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Philadelphia Co., June T., 1914, No. 5242, for plaintiff, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, in case of National Milk Sugar Company v. Smith, Kline and French Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Potter, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit for the price of goods sold and delivered to defendant under a written contract.\nBuie for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. Before Bregy, P. J.\nFrom the record it appeared that the twentieth clause of the contract between the parties was as follows:\nTwentieth. In consideration of the purchase by the first party of the machinery, accessories, and equipment located at Bondout, N. Y., and Prattsville, N, Y., of the second party, and of the special price made by tbe first party to tbe second party for powdered sugar of milk and tbe covenants herein contained, tbe second party expressly agrees that it will discontinue tbe manufacture of sugar of milk and that it will not directly or indirectly engage in tbe manufacture, purchase or sale of milk whey, crude sugar of milk, or refined sugar of milk during tbe period from tbe date hereof to December 31, 1917, except as herein provided, and except in tbe State of Nevada and for consumption in said state only. The second party further agrees that in tbe event of tbe second party engaging in tbe manufacture, purchase or sale of milk whey, crude sugar of milk or refined sugar of milk in violation of its agreement as aforesaid, tbe first party shall have tbe right to terminate this contract at tbe expiration of ten (10) days after giving tbe second party written notice thereof, and in tbe event of such termination tbe first party shall be entitled to receive and recover from tbe second party any sum or sums, then due, or which may thereafter become due, and for all damages sustained by tbe nondelivery of tbe sugar of milk caused by such termination.\nOther facts appear in tbe following opinion by Bregy, P. J., sur plaintiffs rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense:\nTbe Supreme Court having requested an opinion as to why this rule was made absolute by us, we now file tbe following in reply to tbe request:\nTbe statement of claim and tbe affidavit of defense show tbe following condition of affairs.\nThe defendant company having sold its plant in which it manufactured milk sugar to tbe plaintiff company entered into an agreement which provided in great detail for their respective dealings.\n\u25a0 Tbe parts of that agreement which are important to consider in tbe 'present controversy are these:\nTbe plaintiff agreed to sell milk sugar to tbe defendants for their use in tbe manufacture of \u201cEskay Food,\u201d at a price that was special to them. The defendants agreed that they would not enter into competition with the plaintiff by selling the milk sugar that they bought ostensibly for their own use in the-manufacture of \u201cEskay Food.\u201d\nParagraph twenty of the agreement provided that if the defendants did sell the milk sugar above alluded to that the plaintiff could do all of three things.\nFirst. \u2014 Recover for all loss that had been suffered by reason of the forbidden sale.\nSecond. \u2014 Recover payment for all milk sugar delivered and unpaid for, and\nThird. \u2014 Had the right to rescind the contract on 10 days\u2019 notice of its intention to do sov\nThese rights were cumulative and not alternative.\nThe statement of claim alleged a violation of that part of the agreement, a rescission of the contract and a claim for milk sugar delivered and unpaid for.\nThe affidavit of defense admits the violation of the agreement not to sell, but says it was done \u201cinadvertently\u201d whatever that may mean.\nThis of course is no excuse for violating an agreement. The other reason assigned to prevent judgment is that they have paid the plaintiff his loss. But by the agreement they were bound to do that anyhow. That is one of the plaintiff\u2019s rights but only one.\nThey admit they have not paid for the goods delivered and sold for in this action but try to offset it by a counterclaim larger in amount. This counterclaim is entirely ineffective if the right to rescind existed with the plaintiff. This in our judgment was the plaintiff\u2019s right and it was exercised within a reasonable time.\nThe letters attached to the affidavit of defense show that the experts who were put on the defendant\u2019s books made a report showing the amount of sales made by the defendant on September 9, 1913, and on September 27, 1913. The contract was rescinded.\nThis, we think was within a reasonable time, We made the rule absolute because the defendant had violated their agreement not to sell milk sugar by his own ' admission and that the penalty for so doing was the right of plaintiff to rescind. This view made it unnecessary to consider whether the counterclaim was stated with sufficient definiteness. \u2022\nThe court made the rule absolute and assessed damages at $4,062.50. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in making absolute the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nJames Collins Jones, for appellant.\nJ ere J. Crowley, for appellee.\nMarch 20, 1916 :"
