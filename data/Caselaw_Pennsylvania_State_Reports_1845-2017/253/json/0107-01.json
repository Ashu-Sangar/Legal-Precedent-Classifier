Oakley, Appellant.\nWills \u2014 Beal estate \u2014 Life interest \u2014 Power to consume \u2014 Sale of real estate\u25a0 \u2014 -Estate conveyed.\nWhere a testator provided that \u201call the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, of whatsoever nature and kind, I give the use of during her natural life to my wife (naming her) also the right to use of the principal of my estate in case she needs with herself as the sole judge of such need. And at her death whatever shall be remaining shall be divided equally among my three nephews,\u201d the widow was empowered to convey a fee simple title to the testator\u2019s real estate.\nSubmitted, Feb. 23, 1916.\nAppeal, No. 251, Jan. T., 1915, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Lackawanna Co., March T., 1915, No. 251, for plaintiff, on case stated, in case of Louis Morel and Nettie Du Bois Morel v. W. D. Oakley.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Potter, Mosohzisker and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated to determine title to real estate.\nNewcomb, J., filed the following opinion:\nSuit is brought by vendors for the purchase-money due on sale of land. Defense is taken on the ground of an alleged defect in their title.\nThe facts are that the plaintiff, Louis Morel, and his brother, Peter, were, in the latter\u2019s lifetime and at the time of his death, jointly seized of the premises in fee as equal tenants in common; that Peter died testate; and that his interest was disposed of by the residuary clause of his will, in terms as follows:\n\u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, of whatsoever nature and kind, I give the use of during her natural life to my wife, Nettie DuBois Morel, also the right to use of the principal of my estate in case she needs with herself as the sole judge of such need. And at her death whatever shall be remaining shall be divided equally among my three nephews, namely,\u201d etc.\nTestator\u2019s widow joined in the sale which gives rise to the suit, and therefore she is coplaintiff here with her brother-in-law.\nThe single question at issue is whether she can convey good title in and to the purpart of which her husband died seized.\nAt bar the discussion turned for the most part on the technical nature of the estate to which she succeeded under the will; that is to say whether the fee, or an estate for life.\n\u2022 It is the former that is claimed by her counsel as more in accord with the rules of testamentary construction which give preference to a fee as against a lesser estate; and to the widow as against collateral relatives of the husband.\nBut it is believed her case is in no need of aid from these or any other mere presumptions, inasmuch as testator\u2019s meaning and purpose are clearly expressed and thus no room is left for speculation on the subject. All rules and presumptions are subordinate to the intent of testator where that is ascertained: Allen v. Hirlinger, 219 Pa. 56.\nIt is to he observed that in devoting his estate to the use of his widow, he made no distinction between real and personal property. In like manner the remainder, if any, was blended in the gift over to his nephews. It is thus self-evident that in his mind the \u201cprincipal\u201d of his estate would form a unit and as such would be at the widow\u2019s free disposal without stint during her lifetime. This is the unlimited power to consume the property both real and personal, and carries with it the power to convey as a necessary incident: Kennedy v. Pittsburgh & Lake Erie R. R. Co., 216 Pa. 575; Allen v. Hirlinger, supra.\nBut as was said in these cases, the right so conferred doesn\u2019t amount in law to that of an owner in fee, as it doesn\u2019t include the power of alienation by will.\nThe cases \u2014 or most of them \u2014 cited by defendant as supporting the claim of a life estate only in the widow, were considered in Kennedy v. Pittsburgh & Lake Erie R. R. Co., supra, where the ground upon which they are to be distinguished from the case here, is pointed out. It is nothing more or less, however, than a mere difference of intent and purpose in mind of testator as made manifest by what he has said. Broadly stated it comes to this: in the one class of cases the power to consume the corpus of the estate is given to the first taker in express terms;, while in the other the attempt has been made to derive it by mere inference from the gift over of \u201cwhat remains\u201d or \u201cwhat shall be left\u201d or \u201cso much as may remain unexpended,\u201d and the like phrases.\nThat is a very different thing from an intention distinctly expressed in terms.\nWhile it would not be accurate to say that the plaintiff, Mrs. Morel, took title under the will in fee, she did. take a life estate with power to sell \u2019and convey at ple\u00e1sure. It follows that the deed tendered was open to no objection for want of marketable title and the issue is, therefore, with plaintiffs.\nThe court entered judgment for plaintiff on the case-stated. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was the judgment of the court.\nK. 8. Kennedy, submitted for appellant.\n8. B. Price, O. B. Price and J. E. Price, submitted for appellees.\nMarch 20, 1916 :"
