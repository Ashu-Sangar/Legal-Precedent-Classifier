    "head_matter": "MacMillen, Appellant, v. Reading Printing Company.\nLibel \u2014 Publications\u2014Abuse of privilege \u2014 Case for jury.\nWhere in an action against a newspaper for a publication criticising the work of a professional violinist at a concert, it appeared that the publication complained of was libelous, but where under the evidence submitted by plaintiff the inference could be drawn that the publication was fairly and honestly made and with proper motives, although the inference might also have been warranted that it was made for the purpose of serving a malicious or unfair object to the injury of plaintiff, the case was for the jury, and a verdict and judgment for defendant were sustained, it was not material that defendant offered no evidence.\nArgued Feb. 28, 1916.\nAppeals, Nos. 40 and 41, Jan. T., 1916, by plaintiff, from judgment of O. P. Berks Co., Jan. T., 1915, Nos. 30 and 31, on verdicts for defendants, in cases of Francis MacMillen v. Reading Printing Company and Walter F. Dumser.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Stewart, Moschzisker and Walling,. JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for libel. Before Endlich, P. J.\nFrom tbe record it appeared that the alleged libelous publication which appeared in defendants\u2019 newspaper was as follows:\n\u201cConcert at Academy.\n\u201cONE FRANCIS MACMILLEN PLAYS IN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM. (DISAPPOINTING CONCERT.)\n\u201cFrancis MacMillen, a violinist, and Marie Hertenstein, pianiste, were heard in an ambitious program at the Academy of Music Thursday evening. An audience of musicians and devotees of music were somewhat disappointed in the work of MacMillen, whose chief art, it appears, is his attempt to mimic the mannerisms of a certain famous violinist.\n\u201cThe cultured audience was very patient, and, under the circumstances, liberal with its applause. The concert could hardly be called epoch-making in Reading.\u201d\nOther facts appear in the following opinion of Endlich, P. J., sur plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v.:\nThese actions of libel were tried together and resulted in verdicts for the defendants. They are based upon the publication in defendants\u2019 newspapers of a certain criticism of a public performance given by plaintiff, a professional musician, which criticism, it is contended, was not what it purported to be, but a veiled attack upon another person who is alleged to have incurred the defendants\u2019 animosity, and under whose management the plaintiff appeared on that occasion. At the argument counsel for plaintiff distinctly disclaimed the existence of any cause of complaint with respect to the rulings or charge of \u2018the court, except the refusal of the point that \u201cunder all the evidence in the case the verdict should be for the plaintiff.\u201d The reasons assigned in support of these rules are that the verdicts are against the evidence, the weight of the evidence, the law and the charge of the court.\nThe jury was instructed that.on their face the publications were libelous; that, however, if fairly and honestly made, they were privileged; but that, if made for the purpose of serving a malicious or unfair object to the injury of plaintiff or some third party, that privilege would not protect the defendants, and plaintiff would be entitled to recover. The question was thus one of an alleged abuse of privilege, to be inferred or not inferred by the jury from the circumstances developed by the evidence. It is true that all the evidence there was was that adduced by the plaintiff, the defendants offering no testimony. Yet the interpretation of the evidence, the determination of what was proved by it as bearing upon the motives and purposes of the defendants, \u2014 all this must, upon very familiar principles, be conceded to have been matter peculiarly within the province of the jury. Nor is there an exception to be made in this particular of the letter of the defendant Dumser to plaintiff\u2019s counsel, of Dec. 4, 1914, referred to in the argument. As throwing light upon the motives involved, its effect, together with the rest of the evidence, was undoubtedly for the jury: see Reynolds v. Richards, 14 Pa. 205; Miller v. Pichthorn, 31 Pa. 252; McKean v. Wagenblast, 2 Grant (Pa.) 462. And so was the testimony that no representative of the defendants was observed to be present at the performance criticized. \u2022 It does not, of course, conclusively prove the absence of any such representative; and if it did, it can hardly be laid down as a rule of law that a newspaper may not in good faith get its information in some other fair way or from some other reputable source, nor be assumed by the court that defendants did not do so. The question of the abuse of privilege, as presented in these cases, is essentially one of actual intent, which, whenever it arises, is one of fact: Mateer v. Hissim, 3P.&W. 160,166; and as pointed out in Philadelphia Trust Go., Ex\u2019r of Cummings, v. Philadelphia & Erie R. R., 160 Pa. 590, '600, such questions, under our law, depending as they do upon presumptions of fact and the probable and reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence, are to be solved by the jury, the correctness of whose conclusion upon them \"there is no rule of law to test. It may very well be that a different result might legitimately have been reached in 'these cases. But the court has no power to say that it ought to have been, and therefore no power to disturb the verdicts, which were not contrary to the evidence or the charge submitting it to the jury, nor to any legal instruction binding upon them or any principle of the law applicable to the cases.\nVerdict for defendants and judgment thereon. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was in refusing to direct a verdict for plaintiff.\nIsaac Eiester, with him George J. Gross, for appellant.\nYeager Snyder, of Snyder \u00e9 Zieber, for appellees.\nMarch 20, 1916 :"
