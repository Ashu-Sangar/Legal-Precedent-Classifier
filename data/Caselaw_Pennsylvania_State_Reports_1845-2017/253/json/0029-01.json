L. 87 \u2014 Death of husband \u2014 Decree confirming election after husband\u2019s death.\n1. The right of the husband or wife in the estate of the other as against the will of the other, under the Acts of April 1, 1909, P. L. 87, and May 4, 1855, P. L. 430, depends on whether the decedent left issue and is in no wise affected by whether the survivor has issue.\n2. Where \u00e1 husband elects to take against his wife\u2019s will and an inventory and appraisement of the real estate is filed, but prior to the final decree confirming such appraisement and setting apart the property, the husband dies, his personal representatives succeed to his rights under such election.\nArgued February 8, 1916.\nAppeal, No. 433, Jan. T., 1915, by Elizabeth C. Kane as legatee and devisee and as executrix, from the decree of O. C. Eel. Co., dismissing exceptions to adjudication in Estate of Annie T. Mallon, Deceased.\nBefore Mestrezat, Potter, Stewart, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nBroomall, J., filed the following opinion:\nAnnie Mallon died on January 22, \u00cd915, leaving a will. Owen Mallon, her surviving husband, on January 26, 1915, elected to take against her will, and made claim to real and personal property to the value of five thousand dollars, under the Act of April 1, 1909, Sec. 1, Art. II, P. L. 87, Stewart\u2019s Purdon, Yol. 5, page 5621, pi. 3. Annie Mallon died without issue, but at the time of her death, Owen Mallon had issue by a former marriage. Subsequently to exercising his election and after August 7, 1915, but prior to September 23, 1915, Owen Mallon died. An appraisement of real and personal property of the decedent was made and filed, amounting to two thousand four hundred and ninety-six dollars and seventy-five cents, which Owen Mallon elected to retain. The petition of Owen Mallon was presented on August 7, 1915, praying for a decree approving the appraisement, and setting aside the said property to him.\nElizabeth Kane, executrix of the will of Annie Mallon has filed exceptions to the allowance of the said petition, because, first, Owen Mallon had children by a former wife, who survived the decedent, and, second, because Owen Mallon died after making his election, but prior to final decree, confirming the appraisement and setting apart of the property to him.\nWe think neither of these exceptions can be sustained.\nUpon the first exception, by the Act of May 4, 1855, P. L. 480, Stewart\u2019s Purdon, Yol. 3, page 2460, pi. 64, \u201cThe power of any married woman to bequeath or devise her property by will shall be restricted as regards the husband, to the same extent, as the husband\u2019s power so to dispose of his property is restricted, as regards the wife, namely: so that any surviving husband may against her will, elect to take such share and interest in her real and personal estate as she can, when surviving, elect to take against his will in his estate.\u201d\nShe may take against his will under the 11th Section of the Act of April 11, 1848, P. L. 536, Stewart\u2019s Purdon, Vol. 4, page 5148, pi. 30, her share of the personal estate under the intestate laws.\nBy the Act of April 1, 1909, Sec. 1, Art. 2, P. L. 87, Stewart\u2019s Purdon, Yol. 5, page 5621, pi. 3, a widow is entitled to five thousand dollars of real and personal estate or both. \u201cWhen such intestate shall leave a widow and collateral heirs, or other kindred, but no issue.\u201d The right of the widow is made to depend on whether her deceased husband left issue, not on whether she has issue. So conversely the right of the husband is made to depend on whether the wife left issue, not on whether he has issue. In addition to this five thousand dollars of property, they each can take against the will of the other under the Act of 1909, where there is no issue, one-half of the remaining real estate for life and one-half of the remaining personal property absolutely. Hence this wife dying without a will as to her husband, although testate, without issue, this husband is entitled to five thousand dollars\u2019 worth of her property, and one-half of her remaining real estate for life, and one-half of her remaining personal estate absolutely, and all this under the Act of 1909.\nIf this hnsband had died first, she would not, it is true, have been entitled to five thousand dollars, under the Act of 1909, and hence construing .the Act of 1855, by its application to this particular case, and guided by the words \u201cso that any surviving husband may against her will elect to take such share and interest in her real and personal estate as she can, when surviving, elect to take against his will in his estate,\u201d it would follow that he would not be entitled to this five thousand dollars. But these words have received judicial construction in Seltzer\u2019s Est., 189 Pa. 571, and are subordinated to the paramount intent, expressed in the former part of the act in the words \u201cthe power of any married woman to bequeath or devise her property by will shall be restricted as regards the husband to the same extent as the husband\u2019s power so to dispose of his property is restricted as regards the wife.\u201d In other words, the right of the husband or wife in the estate of the other, as against the will of the other depends on whether the decedent left, issue, and is in no wise affected by whether the survivor had issue, and to this extent they are put on a parity. This decision was before the Act of 1909, but the portion in the Act of 1909, passes as a descent: Guenthoer\u2019s Est., 235 Pa. 67; Moore\u2019s Est., 50 Pa. Superior Ct. 76, and the same principles apply; Gilbert\u2019s Est., 227 Pa. 618. Our conclusion is in accord with that reached by Judge Steel, in Reamer\u2019s Est., 1 Lehigh County L. J. 331.\nThe second exception which relates to the effect of the death of Owen Mallon, after electing against his wife\u2019s will, but before a decree confirming the appraisement and setting the. property apart to him, has been determined against the exceptant in Buckland\u2019s Est., 239 Pa. 608.\nError assigned was in dismissing exceptions to the decree of the court.\nAlbert Dutton MacDade, for appellant.\n'John E. McDonough, for appellee.\nMarch 13, 1916 :"
