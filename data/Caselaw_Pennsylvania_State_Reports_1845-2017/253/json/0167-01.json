    "head_matter": "Keiser, Appellant, v. County of Berks.\nContracts \u2014 Arbitration\u2014Oral agreement to submit to award.\n1. An agreement to submit to an award of arbitrators must be mutual and must show a clear intent to submit the matter in dispute to a tribunal and to be bound by its decision; and the person asserting such agreement has the burden upon him to establish by proof its existence, and when such agreement is alleged to have been by parol it must be established by the preponderance of the evidence.\n2. In an action to recover the amount of an alleged award of arbitrators it appeared that plaintiff\u2019s property had been injured by a change of grade of a county bridge; that a parol proposition was made by plaintiff to the county commissioners that he should be paid the cost of raising the building to the new grade in lieu of damages, and that arbitrators should be appointed to ascertain such cost; that the commissioners and plaintiff appointed arbitrators who rendered the award upon which the action was brought. Plaintiff testified that neither he nor the commissioners had ever agreed that the amount of money the arbitrators should determine to be the cost of raising the building should be paid by the commissioners, and there was no other proof of any proposition to submit the amount of damages to the arbitrators for determination. The jury found a verdict for defendant, upon which judgment was entered. Held, no error.\nArgued Feb. 28, 1916.\nAppeal, No. 394, Jan. T., 1915, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Berks Co., Oct. T., 1915, No. 100, for defendant in case of David H. Keiser v. County of Berks.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Stewart, Moschzisker and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit on an alleged award of arbitrator.\nThe facts appear in tbe following opinion by Wagner, J.:\nThis is a suit by the plaintiff against the defendant upon an alleged award in his favor for $13,950.62, together with interest from December 9,1912, which plaintiff claims was made by five arbitrators. An award as defined in Green & Coates Streets Pass. Ry. Co. v. Moore & Ricfi, 64 Pa. 79, on p. 91, is: \u201cthe judgment of a tribunal selected by the parties to determine matters actually in variance between them \u2014 not merely to appraise and settle the price of property contracted for under the stipulation that this term of the contract was to be so ascertained.\u201d\nIt will be seen from this definition that in order that there may be an award, the matter or matters actually in variance between the parties must be determined. It is clear from the evidence in this case that the matter in variance between the plaintiff and the defendant was the amount of damages that had accrued to the plaintiff on account of the erection of the new Penn street bridge, and the thereby placing plaintiff\u2019s manufacturing plant below grade.\nThe plaintiff testified that his manufactory, wherein was carried on the manufacturing of shears, was located at the western approach of the bridge; that by reason of the erection of the new bridge this manufacturing plant was placed in a hole; that the pavement was raised almost as high as the building; that the production of the factory had been interfered with, and that by reason thereof he had a claim against the county for damages.\nIn order that there might be an award it was first necessary that an agreement he entered into by the parties, that is, the plaintiff in this case and the defendant, to submit this matter of variance, that is, the question of damages, to a tribunal for its determination. This agreement must be mutual and must show a clear intent to submit the matter in dispute to a tribunal and to be bound by its decision: McManus v. McCulloch, 6 Watts 357, 360; Wilson v. Getty, 57 Pa. '266, 269; Somerset Boro. v. Ott, 207 Pa. 539, 542, 543; Conneaut Lake Agricultural Assn. v. Pittsburgh Surety Co., 225 Pa. 592, 596; Reilly v. Rodef Sholem Cong., 243 Pa. 528, 531, and he who asserts this agreement has the burden upon him to establish by proof its existence: Hunn v. Penn. Inst, for the Instruction of the Blind, 221 Pa. 403, 411, and when this agreement, as in this case, is alleged to have been by parol, it must be established by the preponderance of the evidence: Gay v. Waltman, 89 Pa. 453, 457.\nIt is also clear from the evidence that the basis of this alleged award is a parol proposition claimed to have been made by plaintiff to the county commissioners, and the implied acceptance thereof, and that this constituted the agreement for submission. That this proposition is the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim of an award is thus made clear by his testimony where he stated he \u201cmade them this proposition\u201d; where his claim was that the county comsioners said \u201cthat that was a fair proposition.\u201d Also where he states his \u201cproposition was a flat one to them\u201d (meaning the county commissioners), and also in other parts of, his evidence, especially where he repeatedly speaks of his proposition that he made to the county commissioners, and the implied acceptance thereof by the appointment of two men and the request to plaintiff to appoint two men, as his agreement with them.\nThe question then naturally arises: What was the proposition that he made to the county commissioners and which he thus claims was accepted by them, and by the acceptation thereof constituted the agreement for the submission to the five men of the question in varianee, that is, damages? We find the testimony of this plaintiff to be: \u201cThen I proposed it in this way: That if they would pay the cost of raising the plant to the new level, the same as it was with the old level, why, then, I would waive all, any damages that might accrue through the movement of the machinery, and all damages to the building by interruption.\u201d This is a proposition that the county commissioners pay the cost of raising the plant to the new level. If that proposition was accepted then we have not an agreement to submit the matter of damages to five arbitrators, but merely an agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, that the defendant pay to plaintiff the cost of raising his plant to the new level. When asked: \u201cDid you make any proposition to them as to how this cost should be determined?\u201d his answer was: \u201cThey said that that was a fair proposition. Then I proposed that we arrive at it this way: I would appoint two men, and they would appoint two men, and then the four men would appoint the fifth man, stipulating that the men that would be appointed should be skilled in their line, each party to appoint one machinist and a carpenter or contractor, and the fifth man appointed by them was to be a civil engineer.\u201d If this proposition then in its entirety was accepted by the county commissioners, we have not what is claimed for by the plaintiff, an agreement to submit the matter in dispute to these five men, that is, the matter of damages, but an agreement by the county commissioners with this plaintiff that the county commissioners pay to the plaintiff the cost of raising the plant, and upon their doing so a waiver of damages, together with a further agreement that five men act as appraisers to determine this cost. This is not a submission of the damages to five men, but merely their appointment as appraisers to determine the cost, and, as is clearly pointed out in Green & Coates Street Pass. Ry. Co. v. Moore & Rich, supra, the proper action for the plaintiff would be a suit upon the agreement with the county commissioners, if the agreement be disputed, in which the finding of the appraisers would be the amount to be recovered in case the jury-found that such an agreement was entered into. As again bearing upon the proposition, as aforesaid ofi cross-examination, he says: \u201cMy proposition to them was that the amount they would pay me would be the cost of raising it up to the level,\u201d and when still further questioned: \u201cAnd it was to ascertain what it would cost that you agreed on these appraisers?\u201d he answered, \u201cThat is what was to be.\u201d The question was repeated: \u201cQ. And it was to ascertain what it would cost that you agreed on these appraisers?\u201d he answered, \u201cThat is right.\u201d If this then was his proposition, you have not a proposition to submit the question in dispute, the damages, to five men, but merely a proposition to submit the cost to them, which cost, as plaintiff claims, the defendant agreed to pay to him in lieu of damages. If, however, you further examine plaintiff\u2019s testimony you will find that he there testifies to a different proposition from that just stated. When there questioned: \u201cAnd you say you proposed to them that if they would raise the building and your machinery to the new grade you would make no claim for damages?\u201d his answer was: \u201cSure, that was the point.\u201d We now have a proposition that the county commissioners raise the building and machinery. The preponderance of plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to these two propositions is in favor of the first. Neither of these, however, can in any manner be construed to be a proposition to submit the matter in dispute, the damages, to five men as the basis of an award in favor of the plaintiff. Under neither of these propositions could the question of damages be submitted to the appraisers.\nThe plaintiff and county commissioners, Sandt and Kutz, were the only persons who were present when this proposition was made. Mr. Sandt when questioned: \u201cDo you recollect he (referring to plaintiff) made a proposition to you?\u201d answered, \u201cHe did.\u201d When further questioned: \u201cWhat was the proposition?\u201d he answered: \u201cThat we would appoint two men, that is, the county commissioners would appoint two men, and Mr. Keiser would appoint two, and the four would get together and appoint the fifth one.......They were to go over there, meet at the plant, and make an approximate estimate of about what it would cost to raise this machinery and the building to conform with the grade of the street.\u201d Mr. Kutz testifies: \u201cWe accepted the proposition to appoint two men to get at the' value of raising the machinery and the building.\u201d These three witnesses were the only ones who had direct knowledge of Avhat the proposition was. They clearly agree that the proposition was for the appointment of five men merely to estimate the cost of raising the building to the street level, their estimated cost, as alleged by plaintiff in part of his testimony, to be paid in lieu of damages, or, as alleged by the county commissioners, to be merely a tentative arrangement, to see whether they could not get together upon the question of damages.\nIt is not necessary to discuss the purpose for which these five men were to estimate this cost, for the reason that the suit is not upon the agreement, but upon the award, except to call attention that the plaintiff says that then there was to be a waiver of damages, whilst in other parts of his testimony when questioned: \u201cThere was nothing brought up about the commissioners paying you the amount, and you never agreed to stand by the award, what these men would determine to be the cost as your damages?\u201d he answered: \u201cThat question was never brought up,\u201d which answer is again repeated when questioned: \u201cThe commissioners never agreed orally or in writing to pay you the amount of money these men would determine to be the cost of raising your building?\u201d he answered: \u201cNo, sir, the question was never brought up.\u201d\nIn view of this testimony as to what the proposition was which plaintiff alleged constituted the agreement for submission to arbitrators, and which testimony, being given by plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, must be taken as verity, we cannot say that the verdict was contrary to the evidence, as alleged in the first reason for a new trial, or that we erred in refusing plaintiff\u2019s fourth point, which was one for binding instructions. Neither can we make absolute plaintiff\u2019s rule for judgment n. o. v. Indeed, upon this evidence, as produced at this trial, we should have affirmed defendant\u2019s point for binding instructions, and directed a verdict for the defendant, instead of submitting it to the jury. The submission, however, by reason of the verdict, did the defendant no harm.\nUnder this view of the case we are of the opinion it would not be necessary, to consider plaintiff\u2019s second reason, that is, that the court erred in the charge. We will, however, pass upon all the errors alleged by plaintiff. The first, refers to that portion of the charge where we said to the jury that it \u201cmust find not merely a proposition, and an implied acceptance of it, but you must also find from the evidence that this matter of damages was submitted to these five men, after they were selected, because if the question of damages was not submitted to them, then it makes no difference what your other findings may have been, the county would not be bound. The county is only bound if- that question was submitted to these five men.\u201d And again where we said: \u201cIf they were instructed to merely find the cost of raising the building and the machinery, then the verdict must be for the defendant. If, however, their instructions were to award damages, then your finding would be in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d We fail to see any error in this. The submission of the matter in dispute is the authority for the arbitrators to act, and it is only as they act upon the matter given to them' that their finding amounts to what can be called an award. See cases already cited, and Collins v. Freas, 77 Pa. 493; 3 Cyc. 785.\nThe other error alleged is where, on page six, we said: \u201cNow, let us look into the evidence upon that (referring to the submission of the question of damages to the five arbitrators). I have examined the testimony of Mr. Keiser, the plaintiff, and have found nothing in it wherein he says that the matter committed to these five men was the award of damages upon the basis of raising the building.\u201d We further said \u2014 which is not given as error : \u2014 \u201cWhen he was on the stand I asked him, \u2018You were not present when the instructions were given to the five men as to what they were to do?\u2019 and he answered, \u2018No, sir, the only thing is I was in when the talk was amongst the four.\u2019 \u201d\nThis is the evidence of the plaintiff. This portion of the charge must be taken in connection with what preceded, where we stated the matter must be submitted to the five men. The plaintiff\u2019s answer was that he was not present when instructions were given, the only thing was the talk amongst the four. He had testified that there was a general talk in the commissioners\u2019 office, and that after the appointment of Mr. Earns, the fifth appraiser, they would have to come over and arrive at the cost of raising this building to arrive at the amount of damages and make an award. In this portion of the charge, therefore, we gave what is the correct testimony of the plaintiff. But, as already stated, we consider that the determination of this case rests upon the fact that there Was absolutely no proof of any proposition to the county commissioners to submit the amount of damages to the five men for their determination.\nVerdict for defendant and judgment thereon. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was in refusing plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v.\nIsaac Eiester, for appellant.\nJoseph R. Dickinson, with him Ira G. Kwtz, for appellee.\nMarch 20, 1916 :"
