Such agreement also purports to make a disposition of said entire <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>estate and is in the nature of a family settlement. It is conceded that said widow and children are the only parties entitled to share in the estate of said deceased under the intestate laws. On February 18, 1915, the executor and trustee named in said will caused a citation to issue to said widow requiring her to produce and deposit with the register said purported will within fifteen days. Thereupon said widow and children presented their petition to the Orphans’ Court setting forth inter alia said agreement; and that they were the only parties interested in said estate; and praying that a restraining order in the nature of an injunction issue to enjoin said named executor and the register from proceeding with the probate of said will.

In such case of course the legal title vests in the trustee; and here the testator emphasizes his intention that the trust shall not fail by fixing a definite duration, and by the naming of successive trustees. Such a trust cannot be set aside at the option of the equitable owners, and none of the authorities cited for appellants control this case. In Harrar’s Est., <a href="/pa/244/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="244 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="1003456" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0542-01">244 Pa. 542</a>, the trust had no definite duration, and its principal purpose was the sale and distribution of the property of the estate, and meantime the payment of the income to the beneficiaries; and the trustees having neglected to make sale within a reasonable time, it is held in an opinion by Mr. Justice Potter (p. 549) that: “Whenever the law determines that the discretion of a trustee should have been exercised in a particular way, he will be constrained to act in accordance therewith;” and further .that the real estate being unsold those presently entitled to the proceeds thereof may elect to take it in kind; and that a trust will not be perpetuated for the benefit of the trustees. In Culbertson’s App., <a href="/pa/76/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="76 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="1038895" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0145-01">76 Pa. 145</a>, the deceased died intestate and thereafter by agreement between the widow and heirs she was to receive for life as her dower the interest on a certain fund which was placed with the administrator as trustee; and it was held that the parties who had created such trust could terminate it and have such fund turned over to the widow. In Packer’s Est. (No. 1), <a href="/pa/246/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="246 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="1006240" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0097-01">246 Pa. 97</a>, testator’s three children having died witlu out issue, it was held that the trust which had existed <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>about 33 years, and served its purpose, should be terminated. And the rule is recognized in those cases and others, “That no matter what may be the nominal duration of an estate given to a trustee, it continues in equity no longer than the thing sought to be secured by the trust demands.”</p>
    <p id="b316-4" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[274,684,1145,308]]]'>In the case at bar the main purpose of the trust is to secure an income for life for the widow and children.

As to the latter the case is plain for. it vests under the intestate law. But by the provisions of the will possession thereof cannot be had until the termination of the life estate upon the death of the last surviving child. Meantime the estate is held in trust, with the income payable <em>to </em>the widow for life and thereafter to the children in equal shares, “provided that if any of our children shall have died, or shall die, leaving issue, to said issue shall be paid and distributed per stirpes such share or shares respectively as the child or children from whom said issue shall have descended, would have taken if living.” The testator is speaking of the death of his wife and the words, “shall have died or shall die” we believe have reference to that date. Evidently by the use of the double expression he had in mind two periods of time, the one before and the other after a particular event. Even construing that event to be his own death and the words “shall have <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>died” to refer to occurrences prior thereto, you still have the words “or shall die,” which embraces future events, to wit, the death of children. And, as they may leave issue who under the plain terms of the will would share in such income until the death of the last child, it cannot now be said that the widow and children represent the entire estate. Words of survivorship do not always refer to the death of the testator. In Anderson’s Est., <a href="/pa/243/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="243 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1001598" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0034-01">243 Pa. 34</a>, in the opinion of Mr. Justice Mestrezat (p. 41), it is stated:</p>
    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[150,905,1148,640]]]'>“We agree with the appellant’s contention that it is a general canon of construction that words of survivor-ship in a will refer to the death of the testator. But this should not be held to be a hard and fast rule that cannot be changed by the instrument itself. It must always be subject to the intention of the testator as disclosed by the language of his will. It is a cardinal rule that the actual intent of the testator must prevail when it can be ascertained, and it follows that words of survivorship will relate to the death of the life tenant instead of the death of the testator if . such intent is clear from the will itself.”</p>
    <p id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[149,1565,1149,373]]]'>Here there can be no blending of the life estate with that in remainder, as the one is equitable and the other legal: Little v.

Effect should be given if possible to the entire will which cannot be done by ignoring the provisions in favor of the issue of children who may die before the termination of the trust.</p>
