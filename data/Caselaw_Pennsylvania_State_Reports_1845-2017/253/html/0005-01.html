But the clause is not ambiguous. There can be no doubt about the meaning of the bond where it says, “and shall well and truly pay to all and every person furnishing material, or performing labor in and about the construction of said highway, all and every the sum and sums of money due him, them or any of them, for all such labor and materials for which the contractor is liable.” It is one of what is called “the sole and exclusive use and protection of the State” to see to it that the contractor pays for his work and materials. The security of creditors <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>dealing with the contractor being provided for, the contractor is thereby enabled to command more honest and capable workmen and materialmen, to the consequent advantage of the State: Philadelphia v.

    <p class="summary" id="b44-4" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[255,660,1147,1017]]]'>The amount of the bond is fixed at fifty per cent, of the contract price in accordance with the Act of May 31, 1911. We fail to see the force of the argument that because the amount of it is not large enough to cover all of the breaches of its conditions, therefore it was not intended to cover them so far as it would go. The bond contemplates that the breaches of its conditions may exceed the amount of it, and carefully limits liability to that amount, and provides for the recovery by use-plaintiffs in the order of their writs. If the State is more interested to obtain redress for other breaches of the conditions of the bond than the one under consideration and should attempt to assert preferable redress to the exclusion of the contractor’s labor and materialmen, such case will have to be left until it arises. We see no reason why the State may not use its own bond in any way it may be to its greatest advantage. It is sufficient in' this case to know that the liability asserted in this suit does not exceed the amount of the bond.</p>

It is in the very words of that act, with the further provision intended to be in execution of its" details, and in protection of the obligors, that suits may be brought on it for the use of labor and materialmen, and that recovery may be had in the order of their writs, not exceeding in the aggregate the full amount of the bonds, and that there shall be a pro rata recovery among those whose writs bear the same date. These details are fairly well within the scope of the act. Therefore the condition of the bond for the payment of wages due or materials furnished the contractor has statutory authority to support it. It does <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>not derogate from the rights of the State. The State having entire dominion over the bond will pursue it in such manner as to best subserve its interests.</p>

Fields, the use-plaintiff, and the defendant. The bond contains the defendant’s obligation to “well and truly pay to all and every person furnishing material or performing labor in and about the construction of said highway,” together with an agreement that the labor and materialmen may sue upon the bond in the name of the Commonwealth to their use. After the labor has been performed and the materials have been furnished, it is difficult to understand how the defendant may successfully answer to one whom it has promised to pay and agreed upon the method by which payment may be enforced, “I am not in privity with the person who is suing for your benefit por with you.” As to the plaintiff in this suit,, the defendant is in direct privity by the bond. If the plaintiff could not legally accept the defendant’s undertaking, the undertaking would be nugatory. This was the case prior to the Act of May 31, 1911; Com., to use, v. Empire State Surety Co. (No. 1), <a href="/pa-super/50/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="50 Pa. Super. 404" data-case-ids="428535" data-case-paths="/pa-super/50/0404-01">50 Pa. Superior Ct. 404</a>, but under the Act of 1911, the Commonwealth can legally accept such undertaking. Indeed Fields could maintain an action in his own name, not upon the. bond, but upon the promise to pay him contained therein, upon the principle stated in Adams v. Kuehn, <a href="/pa/119/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="119 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="558086" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0076-01">119 Pa. 76</a>, 85, “Where one person enters into a contract with another to pay money to a third......and such third party is the only party interested in the payment, he can release the promisor from performance or compel performance by suit.” Kountz v. Holthouse, <a href="/pa/85/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="85 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="440464" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0235-01">85 Pa. 235</a>, is authority to the same effect. Of course, there must be a consideration to support the promise, but the detriment to Fields from parting with his work and materials after the defendant’s promise to pay him was made furnishes consideration. If A promises B that if C works for B, he, A, will pay <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>C for such work, and thereupon C works for B, there is manifestly a privity between A and C, ánd C may maintain an action in his own name to recover for such work; or as in our case, where the form of the remedy is agreed upon in the bond may maintain an action in the name of B to his use. In the latter case, the bond affords the privity, and by its seal imports consideration. A simple agreement with the Commonwealth to pay for all wages and materials would nqt be sufficient: Lancaster v. Frescoln, <a href="/pa/203/0640-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="203 Pa. 640" data-case-ids="994745" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0640-01">203 Pa. 640</a>; First Methodist Episcopal Church, to use of Hall, v.

In our case the moneys paid were paid after they were due- and payable. The only reservation was that the contractor should satisfy the Commonwealth that his labor and material bills were paid.

The hauling by Fields amounting to eight hundred and eighty-five dollars, and the hauling on the five hundred and eighteen dollars and eighty-four cents sheets, which apparently he procured to be done by others, was for work which the plaintiff alleges was done in the construction of the highway. The hauling is specifically mentioned in the contract between Fields and the contractor as something to be done in connection with the construction of the highway.
