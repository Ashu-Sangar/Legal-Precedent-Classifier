The case presented is one of divided ownership as between the surface and the underlying coal. It is not 'disputed, but, to the contrary thereof, distinctly averred that defendant owns the coal by virtue of its succession to the right and title of the Pawnee Coal Company, former owner in fee of both coal and surface from whom the parties respectively claim as the common source of title. Plaintiff’s title is traced to a conveyance which admittedly severed the coal estate. This was a deed of June 1,1870, by the <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>coal company to one Sarah Mahney — or Mahoney — for a town lot on Birch street, this city, being 40 feet in front by 150 feet deep, and designated on the company’s map, of the tract to which it belonged, as lot 16 in Block 34, “excepting and reserving however to said company, their successors and assigns, all coal and minerals beneath the surfacé of and belonging to said lot with the sole right and privilege to mine and remove the same by any subterranean process incident to the business of mining without thereby incurring in any event whatever any liability for injury caused or damage done to the surface of said lot or to the buildings or improvements which now are or hereafter may be put thereon: Provided that no mine or air shaft be intentionally opened or any mining fixture established on the' surface of said premises.” Plaintiff succeeded to this title in 1907 by deed reciting that the.coal and minerals were as fully excepted and reserved both as to the right to mine and remove the same and as to the exemption from liability for damages as heretofore excepted and reserved. Hence the sole question is to the legal effect of that reservation. If it operated to extinguish the right of support, then the plaintiff has no case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b148-4" data-blocks='[["BL_148.4",148,[260,1565,1144,260]]]'>Just when defendant succeeded to the underlying mineral estate and mining rights reserved by the common grantor out of the conveyance of 1870, does not appear; but it is averred that they were subsequently conveyed to and are now owned by defendant.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b149-5" data-blocks='[["BL_149.6",149,[161,1104,1148,307]]]'>Much the same is true as to the other phase of counsel’s theory founded upon the conception that the case is one to which the statute of frauds applies, and, therefore, his client’s right to surface support is. intact for want of a release in writing either by himself or his predecessor in title.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b149-6" data-blocks='[["BL_149.7",149,[159,1432,1150,688]]]'>Thisds begging the question. It assumes that the right once existed in the coal company’s grantee. One can release such right as he may have; that which he never had is another thing. When Mrs. Mahoney took title she accepted it with its limitations. It was for the company to offer the grant upon such terms as it saw fit to propose. It was for her to accept or reject it as it was. offered. In other words, it is competent for the grantor to offer his property upon terms the acceptance of which will necessarily imply a waiver of surface support; and that, as a mere incidental right of property, may be waived by necessary implication as well as by express covenant.</p>
