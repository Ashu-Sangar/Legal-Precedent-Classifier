Thereupon, Goldsmith’s son, at his father’s direction, changed the endorsement on the note in suit by striking out the words “Beading National” and inserting “Berks County Trust Co.,” such change being made in the presence of Mrs. Stocker and the other parties to the note. Mrs. <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>Stocker, however, did not re-execute the old note in its altered form or sign any memorandum assenting to the alteration.</p>

      <em>'A </em>very careful consideration of the argument in support of these rules, in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court reversing the judgment entered upon the verdict in the second trial of the cause: <a href="/pa/249/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="249 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="1013587" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0180-01">249 Pa. 180</a>, has led to the conclusion that none of the questions made is still open and that none of the positions taken is tenable. The contentions are, in substance, that there was no writing capable of answering the requirements of the Statute of Frauds in order to hold Mrs. Stocker liable to Isaac Goldsmith with respect to the note in the Berks County Trust Company, — that there, was no consideration to support the alleged assumption of such liability on her part, — that the proofs in the case fail, with sufficient precision for submission to a jury, to show the change in the memorandum on the back of the note in suit to have been made by Solomon Goldsmith as the agent or by the authority and consent of Mrs. Stocker,— and that at any rate, by reason of conflicting interest, he was disqualified to act for her. In the appeal to the Supreme Court all of these contentions were advanced and nearly all of the authorities now relied on cited. The fallaciousness of the former and the inappositeness of the latter, alike in that appeal and in these applications, <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>are settled by that court when, upon a state of tbe evidence in no essential particular differing from that disclosed by tbe record of tbe last trial, it is held that tbe controlling questions in tbe case are whether Mrs. Stocker did authorize Solomon Goldsmith to make the alteration in the memorandum; whether in so doing he acted as her agent or as Isaac Goldsmith’s, his father’s ; and whether the latter in return agreed to the renewal of his endorsement of the Berks County Trust Company note and at Mrs. Stocker’s request subsequently performed his promise, — and that these questions, under the evidence, are properly for the jury (see pp. 185, 186, 187). Nor, it may be specially noted because the point is specially insisted upon, can it, in the face of this ruling, be asserted that Solomon Goldsmith was not in a position to act in this matter for Mrs. Stocker, because, as a party to the contract, Isaac Goldsmith would not have been, and Solomon came with his father and in his father’s interest to the interview with Mrs. Stocker at which the transactions occurred and in a measure was his spokesman. Manifestly that circumstance does not exclude, as a matter of law or of fact, his having been duly authorized by Mrs. Stocker to make the change in the memorandum for her, and as, with respect to the same, her agent. Even a double agency, understood and assented to by both contracting parties, has probably never been supposed to offend against any recognized principle: See Patterson v. Van Loon, <a href="/pa/186/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="186 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="989738" data-case-paths="/pa/186/0367-01">186 Pa. 367</a>. The testimony of Isaac and Solomon Goldsmith, taken together, is that the change was proposed to Mrs. Stocker; that she consented to it, Solomon asking her whether she was “satisfied with it” and she saying “she was”; that he called for pen and ink to make it, and she sent her daughter for them; that thereupon with her approval and in her presence Solomon made the change, — -Mrs. Stocker, when it was done, stipulating and Isaac Goldsmith agreeing that he should renew the jjote m the Berks County Trust Company, which at her <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>request afterwards he did. Pressed to give the exact language used in the transaction, Solomon said that the foregoing was “as close as (he could) give it”; that there might have been other things “mentioned”; but that the above was “the sum and substance of what was said at the time that the change was made.” Perhaps the rule is here applicable, which was laid down by Judge Gibson in Cornell v. Green, 10 S. &amp; R. 14, at page 16 (and reiterated in Hepler v. Mount Carmel Sav. Bk., <a href="/pa/97/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="97 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="444801" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0420-01">97 Pa. 420</a>), with reference to the reproduction of the testimony of a deceased witness, that, where in the nature of things a recollection of the precise language, etc., cannot be reasonably expected, it is not to be exacted in order to render a deposition giving the impression produced by the whole, — i. e., the substance of what was said, — competent evidence. But however that may be, there is no possible distinction to be made between the effect of the Goldsmiths’ testimony as it stands now and as it stood at the previous trial; and therefore it must be considered that, according to the opinion of the Supreme Court, if, in spite of defendant’s contradiction of that testimony, the jury found it to be true, there is an adequate basis for every inference indispensable to plaintiffs’ recovery.</p>

The law of the case has been authoritatively indicated. It is for us so to accept and apply it. That in the trial or the charge there was any deviation from it is not understood to be alleged. The questions pointed out by the . Supreme Court as controlling were submitted to the jury in conformity with the ruling and language of the decision. Every point of the defendant was affirmed except those asking for binding instructions in her favor. These, if the case was for the jury, were of course incapable of affirmance, and therefore were declined without being read to the jury: See Woecker v. Erie Elect. Motor Co., <a href="/pa/187/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="187 Pa. 206" data-case-ids="900248" data-case-paths="/pa/187/0206-01">187 Pa. 206</a>, 208.
