The City of Pittsburgh regraded all thoroughfares in a neighborhood known as the “Hump District”; the plaintiff was a subtenant of certain premises located in a street affected by the change of grade; its property had a frontage of 60 feet, and the cut in the grade at this point ran from 24 inches at one end of its building to 2 inches at the other, although, during the course of the improvement, there was a temporary excavation of greater depth. The plaintiff had a verbal lease from year to year, with an obligation to vacate at any time upon three months’ notice; the particular yearly period here involved ran from April 1,1913, and, before renewing its lease for that term, the plaintiff knew the regrading was to take place in front of its property. The work which affected the premised in question commenced early in April, 1913, and continued for about four months; during this time the city “put posts up along the curbstone and nailed two beam planks up on those posts, completely shutting off the access (from plaintiff’s property) to the street”; this obstruction was necessarily incidental to the regrading, but, since the plaintiff conducted an automobile garage, the operations in <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>.connection with the public improvement effectively interfered with its trade, and materially reduced its profits, during the progress of the work. At trial, the witnesses for the plaintiff took the average of its business in previous years and deducted from the figure thus arrived at the financial results during the year of the regrading, showing a loss of about $5,000.00; this they claimed to be the damage which the plaintiff was entitled to recover against the city. Some of these witnesses spoke of the plaintiff’s alleged loss as a reduction in business, but others frankly referred to it as a loss of profits; it plainly appears, however, that all of them had in mind the idea that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the profits which it probably would have earned, had its business not been interfered with, during the four months when the regrading was taking place; and they placed ■ their estimate of the alleged depreciation in the leasehold value exclusively upon that basis.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[256,1311,1157,1077]],["BL_517.1",517,[180,345,1150,264]]]'>The trial judge ruled, on the admission of evidence, that “loss of profits” must be excluded as an element in fixing the plaintiff’s damages. In this connection, he said: “You are permitted to state what the value of this leasehold was on the day the work began there, at or about April 6, 1913, as unaffected by the improvement ......, and you are permitted to state what the leasehold was worth on the 8th of August, as affected by the improvement; was it worth more or was it worth less?” The expert witnesses for the defendant adhered to the ■rule thus enunciated, and testified that the improvement had not depreciated the value of the plaintiff’s leasehold interest, stating that, because of its short term and uncertain tenure, it would at no time, and under no circumstances, command a premium in the market, that its value was the amount of the rent ($300.00 per month) and no more, both before and after the regrading. Some of these witnesses went further and said the improvement was of a character that tended to, and actually did, -bring many more automobiles into the neighborhood <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>than theretofore, and that, in their opinion, this so favorably affected the value of the balance of the term under the lease as to more than offset any temporary inconvenience suffered by the plaintiff during the period of regrading.</p>
    <p id="b517-3" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[181,621,1158,1791]],["BL_518.1",518,[282,352,1151,479]]]'>In submitting the case to the jnry, the trial judge charged: “The value of the leasehold as it stood April 1, 1913, unaffected by the improvements, mnst be taken,then the value of the leasehold as it stood August 1,1913, as affected by the improvement, must be taken, and the amount which would represent the diminution in value thus ascertained, is the sum which you should allow this plaintiff, if you allow it any compensation.” After this, the jury were told they were not to allow as separate items of damage anything for “inconvenience,'interruption of business or loss of profits” during the period occupied in making the improvement; bnt that any relevant fact, properly proved, might be considered by them “in determining the aggregate diminution in value of this leasehold.” The trial judge .then went on to say: “Now if, npon the completion of this work on August 1, 1913, the residue of that leasehold, the unexpired term, the end of the lease year was of greater value than it had been before the entry by the city and the interruption of the right, then there can be no recovery at all in this case, because you can readily see that there was no damage.” He further said: “The same principle is to be applied as if the owner of the property, upon which this leasehold is situated, the owner in fee, had complained of the injury to his property by reason of the grading, and the; cut made in front of it; and the final test in this case would be — while he may have .been damaged to some extent by the cutting, and the interruption of the access to his property, yet, if, after the cutting was done and the whole scheme completed, his property was more valuable than it had been before, he could not be allowed any compensation in damages. So in this case the same rule applies. If, notwithstanding the interruption in <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>'the use and enjoyment of the demised premises for the period from April 1,1913, until August 1,1913, after the work had ceased on August 1, 1913, that, property or leasehold estate was more valuable than it had been before, in spite of these interruptions, it follows there can be no recovery, and your verdict should be for the city. Whether it was or not is one of the questions you are to determine, and as you may determine that question you should render your verdict.”</p>

The real point therein was whether the tenant could recover the cost of removing certain machinery from the condemned property, and we said that, since the parties had tried the cause in the court below upon the theory that the cost of the removal of the machinery constituted the chief measure of damage, the appellant “should not be heard to question its correctness”; so the case really sheds little or no light upon the subject now before us. In the same book, at page 512, however, we find reported Shipley v. Pittsburgh, Carnegie &amp; Western R. R. Co., where also the opinion Avas written by Mr. Justice Fell; there the plaintiffs were lessees of a building with an unexpired term of 16 months, which was appropriated by the defendant. We said that, while testimony as to the value of the tenants’ fixtures and the reasonable cost of their removal was admissible, yet these could not be proved “as separate items for which a recovery could be had, but as evidence of the value of the right of undisturbed possession to the end of the term which had been taken from the plaintiffs.” This case is also interesting because of a ruling therein to the effect that a clause in the lease requiring the tenant to vacate at any time upon ten days’ notice Avould not defeat a right of recovery where no such notice had been given by or on behalf of the landlord prior to the appropriation of the demised premises.</p>

Whether the assessment of damages be to the tenant in fee for life, or for years, the rule as to the measure of damages is precisely the same — What was the value of the property, that is to say, the tenants’ interest therein, unaffected by the injury? What was its value as affected <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>by the injury? The difference is the true measure of compensation. The damages must be measured according to the market value for any useful purpose”; and we added, “The determination of the lease as an estate in the land was of course to be estimated upon the residue of the current year only.” In both the Getz and McMillan cases, supra, the tenant was allowed to recover the expenses of the compulsory removal of machinery; we did not, however, permit this as a separate “item” of damage, but merely as “a proper element” to be considered in fixing the value of the leasehold. In other words, our underlying thought appears to have been: if a purchaser had appeared upon the scene to take over the lease, the fact that the holder thereof would be obliged to remove the business with the machinery to another location would, of course, cause the prospective lessee to diminish his bid for the balance of the term accordingly; hence, the cost of removal and the depreciation in value of the machinery were proper elements for consideration and deduction in measuring the value of the lease. This not only explains the Getz decision, but many other like cases.</p>

It involved a claim by a tenant for damages to its leasehold interest, caused by a change of grade. Early in the opinion (p. 640), we direct attention to Schuylkill Navigation Co. v. Thoburn, 7 S. &amp; R. 411, 422, which lays down this rule: “The jury are to consider the matter just as if they were called on to value the injury at the moment when compensation could first be demanded; they are to value the injury to the property without reference to the person of the owner or the actual state of his business, and, in doing that, the only safe rule is to inquire what would the property, unaffected by the obstruction, have sold for at the time the injury was committed? What would it have sold for as affected by the injury? The difference is the true measure of compensation.” We <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>there held that the rtile just quoted applied to the case before the court, and said, inter alia, that, (1) “only the difference in value..... .before and after the injury was inflicted could be considered,” (2) “the time at which this difference of value was to be estimated was immediately after the injury was completed,” (3) “in no event could there be any recovery for loss of profits,” and, more specifically, we said (p. 648) : “It is a fundamental proposition that the valuation of the property affected must be made immediately before and immediately after ......the injury is inflicted; the difference in those valuations is the measure of the damages......In the present case the change in the grade of the streets was made in August, 1893, and the value of the leasehold at that time, as contrasted with this value in the spring of 1892, when the work was commenced, must represent the damages to which the plaintiff is entitled.” See also Campbell v.

The report is not satisfactory, but it does appear therein that the jurors were told “they could allow no damages to the plaintiff except for actual money loss caused by the necessary work of taking down with care the front of the building,” and that “no allowance could be made for loss of profits.” The case requires consideration in our present inquiry, for a point submitted by the defendant, to the effect that “the plaintiff is only entitled to recover the depreciation in the market value of his leasehold as affected by the widening,” was refused. The trial judge called attention to the general charge, as substantially covering the request, but added, “I think the adverb ‘only’ would make the point too strong.” On appeal, we said that, under the special circumstances of the case, the refusal could have done the defendant no <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>material harm; but we further said, “an absolute affirmance of the point without qualification would have been error,” assigning as a reason that “the depreciation in the value of the leasehold would not be the only subject for allowance of damage.” What we evidently meant by this was that the jurors’ attention could not with propriety be exclusively confined to the bare thought of depreciation in the value of the leasehold, but in connection therewith they were entitled to appropriate instructions concerning the various relevant elements which, in fixing an allowance of damages, they could properly take into consideration. The use of the word “only,” with its context, was misleading, because the plaintiff was entitled to recover the depreciation in the market value of his leasehold not “only” “as affected by the widening,” but also, in a large sense, as affected by its direct physical results; for the expenses following in the wake of and directly attributable to a public improvement are elements not to be overlooked.

At trial, the defendant presented a point calling attention to the fact that the lease contained a clause against subletting without the consent of the lessor, and, although other persons appeared as plaintiffs with the original lessee, that no such consent had been shown. On this state of affairs the court was asked to direct a verdict for the defendant; but we determined the request rightly refused. We further decided that, under the “somewhat peculiar — quite out of the ordinary — circumstances of the case,” certain testimony which had been offered to prove the additional cost entailed upon the plaintiffs in the conduct of their business as the necessary and inevitable result of the condemnation, was proper “for the purpose of showing the value of the plaintiffs’ lease of the lot appropriated by the defendant.” In this connection we said the plaintiffs “sought to show the lease was worth what they claimed (its value to be) because it saved certain expenses......because of the advantages it afforded”; and, therefore, we added, that the matters called attention to in the testimony in question “were elements which evidently and properly entered into the consideration and determination of the value of the lease ......”; and we stated it was “a mistake to say the introduction of the testimony......was a covert attempt to recover profits.” See also the discussion, on general subject of restriction as to showing profits, in Cox v.

Therefore, in estimating the damages sustained by the. plaintiff company, the jury should consider not only what the leasehold proper was worth over and above the rental and other charges paid by the lessee, but the value of the leasehold as improved by the ice plant. In other words, the loss resulting to the plaintiff company is the difference between the value of the leasehold, as improved by the ice plant, for the unexpired term, and the rental and other charges payable by the lessee. This, as is apparent, would include the use of the fixtures and machinery by the tenant as well as the use of the demised premises for the residue of the term. The value of the leasehold proper for the unexpired term would be what the premises would be worth for any purpose for which they could reasonably be used over and above the rental and other charges payable by the lessee. To this must' be added the use-value of the machinery and fixtures until the expiration of the lease. These are not substantive elements of damage but are for the consideration of the jury in estimating the plaintiff company’s loss by being deprived of the residue of the term.”</p>

Co., <a href="/citations/?q=133%20Pa.%20240" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="133 Pa. 240">133 Pa. 240</a>), then these are elements which may be taken into account in fixing the value of the term; and, of course, one always may ¡sho’y that; by reason of the public improvement, the <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>rental value of the demised premises has suffered a lasting depreciation which, owing to the fact that the actual rent to be paid must remain as theretofore, necessarily would affect the market value of his leasehold (Coons v. McKees Rocks Boro., <a href="/pa/243/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="243 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1001575" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0340-01">243 Pa. 340</a>). In other words, one may show that, under the requirements of his contract, he is obliged to pay the same rent as before the improvement, whereas, as a matter of fact, if he were about to take a new lease, according to the reduced rental values caused by the improvement, in all probability, he would secure it at a certain lower rental; hence, because his lease calls for, relevantly speaking, too high a rent, the market, or selling value of the balance of his term is depreciated accordingly. In valuing the remainder of a term, while the fact that the landlord has the right to dispossess the tenant at any time upon a short notice may be an element for consideration, yet, when no such notice has been given, the mere presence of this provision in the lease will not absolutely defeat the right of recovery by the tenant, if he is able to prove a depreciation in the value of his leasehold interest, whatever it may be: Shipley v. Pitts., Carnegie &amp; Western R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/216/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="216 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="950409" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0512-01">216 Pa. 512</a>, and Ehret v.

A plaintiff is not entitled to compensation for indirect injury to his trade or for loss of profits suffered during the time occupied in making a public improvement, recovery being restricted to the direct and permanent effect of the physical injury to the demised premises upon the value of the balance of the tenant’s term. If the completed improvement permanently interferes with access to the leased property, the jury have a right to consider this an element of damage affecting the value of the leasehold, and, in order to show the extent of such interference, it is permissible to prove the falling off of trade or custom directly attributable thereto: Pittsburgh, Va. &amp; Charleston Ry. Co. v. Vance, <a href="/pa/115/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="115 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="551713" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0325-01">115 Pa. 325</a>.</p>

The testimony offered by the plaintiff did not tend to show a permanent diminution in the market value of its leasehold, or even to show an apparent permanent falling off of custom due to the completion of the improvement; on the contrary, at most it made out only a temporary loss of profits due to the obstruction of the demised building while the regrading was going on. Moreover, the testimony did not show, or tend to show, that plaintiff’s actual possession was disturbed, or that the market value of its leasehold interest was any less after the completion of the improvement than before; finally, there was no attempt to prove a reduction, or depreciation, in the rental value of the property, which had detrimentally affected the market value of the leasehold. In short, we conclude that, under the evidence, the rulings and instructions of the learned trial judge were adequate and without material error; hence, the several assignments must be overruled.</p>
