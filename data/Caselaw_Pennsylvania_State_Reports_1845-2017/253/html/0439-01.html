The van was not loaded. <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>He approached Lombard street, on which the defendant’s cars run eastward, and attempted to cross it. When the van was more than half across the track it was struck by defendant’s car, and the plaintiff was injured.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[253,539,1155,1342]]]'>The dimensions of the van were as follows: The pole was 12 feet 5 inches in length, the body of the van 15 feet 6 inches long, and 10 feet 2 inches high. The driver’s seat was open at the sides and his view up and down street was unobstructed. Lombard street is 50 feet wide. The distance from Juniper street to Broad street is 250 feet. The width of Broad street is 100 feet. There were street lights at Juniper street and at Broad street and between. The plaintiff could have seen a car 700 feet away, that is, 350 feet west of the west side of Broad street, pretty nearly to Fifteenth street. He certainly could have seen it on the west side of Broad street when, the car which injured him stopped to let off or take on a passenger or passengers. He says he looked when his horses’ heads were at the track, and there was no car in sight. He had to move his van across a track 5 feet 2 inches in width, which added to the length of his van would have made the length of the journey required to clear the car about 34 feet. He variously estimated the gait at which he traveled at 5 miles an hour or at <em>2y2 </em>to 3 miles an hour. Assuming it to be but 2% miles an hour, the car, if it was at its stopping place on Broad street, would have been compelled to travel at a greater speed than 25 miles an hour in order to collide with the van.</p>
