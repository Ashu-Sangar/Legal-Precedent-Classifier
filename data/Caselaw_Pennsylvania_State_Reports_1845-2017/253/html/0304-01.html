After reading the voluminous evidence produced at trial, we do not feel that this complaint can be sustained. As already indicated, it appears that the plaintiff, under his arrangement with the defendant, had the right not only to take merchandise from the stock of his employer, charging himself with it, but also to take cash from the money bag; it likewise appears that the plaintiff’s hand was not the only one dipped in the bag, and that, on occasions, cash therefrom was given to his employers without any record being made of the transactions. Although some of the testimony upon which the facts just stated are based came from the plaintiff, yet certain parts of it were corroborated by the defendant and his witnesses, and, as to other parts, we find no denial; in addition, it does not appear that a full disclosure of these material facts was made either to counsel or the district attorney when they advised the defendant he had probable cause for prosecuting the plaintiff. If the jury credited the evidence we have stated, and their verdict shows they did, then, in view of the acquittals of the plaintiff, and the threats indulged in by the defendant, we cannot say they acted without warrant in believing that full disclosures were not made by the latter to his counsel and <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>in determining that the prosecution was maliciously brought without probable cause.</p>
    <p id="b343-4" data-blocks='[["BL_343.4",343,[146,453,1172,928]]]'>The second assignment charges the trial judge erred in refusing to affirm a point to the effect that, “if the, jury believes the evidence of the witnesses called for the defendant, it establishes there was probable cause for the prosecution......, and the verdict must be for the defendant.” Had the evidence depended upon by the plaintiff simply been a, contradiction of that produced by the defendant and his witnesses, then the point before us &gt; might properly have been affirmed, but it loses sight of the testimony to which we called attention in disposing of the prior assignment, and which, if credited, while not always contradicting, might be taken satisfactorily to explain away most, if not all, of the incriminating evidence referred to in the request. Hence, a mere belief in the truth of the evidence produced by the defendant was not enough to control the verdict, and the point was properly refused.</p>
    <p id="b343-6" data-blocks='[["BL_343.5",343,[144,1394,1149,869]]]'>The third assignment complains because the trial judge declined to affirm a point to the effect that, if the defendant consulted counsel before bringing the prosecution against the plaintiff, and they advised the issuance of a warrant for his arrest, “this advice of itself establishes probable cause for such criminal prosecution and the plaintiff cannot recover.” In declining this point the court said to the jury: “It is for you to say whether he (the defendant) made a proper investigation; it was necessary for him, when he consulted counsel, to state all the facts which he knew, or could reasonably ascertain by proper diligence.” As before suggested, it cannot be said as a matter of law that it satisfactorily appears the defendant made a full disclosure to counsel of the actual facts in the case, and, therefore, we see no error in the matter covered by this assignment.</p>
    <p id="b343-7" data-blocks='[["BL_343.6",343,[142,2274,1148,101]],["BL_344.1",344,[251,339,1146,649]]]'>The fourth, fifth and sixth assignments complain because the court below sustained the plaintiff’s objection <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>to certain questions asked the district attorney, and the defendant’s counsel, when upon' the stand in the defendant’s behalf. The interrogatories ruled out simply requested these witnesses to give their conclusion upon a comparison of the evidence produced in the criminal trials and that at bar; in short, to say whether the proofs were “practically the same” on each occasion. There was no attempt .to introduce a transcript of the evidence in the criminal cases, and the conclusions sought to be elicited were incompetent and immaterial to the case on trial. We see no error in the rulings here in question.</p>
    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.4",344,[246,999,1150,1368]],["BL_345.1",345,[137,339,1149,599]]]'>The seventh and eighth assignments complain because the plaintiff was permitted to prove the fact that certain indictments against him had been nolle prossed. While the court permitted evidence to that effect, yet, at the time, the trial judge expressly stated, “In the case that was dropped there is no presumption of want of probable cause, or in the .case where a nolle pros, decree was entered......So far as the. case commenced before Squire Pelton and where the nolle pros, decree was entered is concerned, the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to show want of probable cause; the only case where the burden of proof is shifted is in the case of a verdict of acquittal.” The entry of a nolle pros, may be a sufficient ending of a criminal case to entitle a plaintiff to maintain an action for malicious prosecution (Murphy v. Moore, <a href="/sadler/9/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Sadler 64" data-case-ids="249022" data-case-paths="/sadler/9/0064-01">9 Sadler 64</a>), and the court’s ruling, above quoted, amply protected the defendant: see McClafferty v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/151/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="151 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="836729" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0086-01">151 Pa. 86</a>, 91; Zebley v. Storey, <a href="/pa/117/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="117 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="555838" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0478-01">117 Pa. 478</a>, 487; 26 Cyc. 60, Sec. 4. In each instance, the evidence indicates the nolle pros, was entered by consent of the court, and there is nothing to show that this was done at the request or with the consent of Mr. Swartz. The defendant, under cross-examination, was asked whether he had not dropped the charges .on these bills, but his counsel objected to the question being answered. The <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>district attorney also was asked concerning the disposition he had made of the indictments in question, and again, on objection of counsel for tke defendant, information upon the subject was withheld. _ The defendant did testify, however, that all of his charges against the plaintiff were “ended” ánd “out of court”; under these circumstances, there was sufficient to justify the conclusion that each of the indictments upon which a nolle pross was entered had been dropped at the instance of the defendant, and, this being so, no error was committed by the court below in its rulings in relation thereto. •</p>
