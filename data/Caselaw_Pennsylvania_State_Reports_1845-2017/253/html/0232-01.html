Mrs. Grant’s claim is based on the facts as above outlined, and to her the court below awarded the fund, on the ground that as the order had paid over the same its rules, etc., had <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>no bearing on tbe question at issue, and that tbe above quoted words, written by Mr. Faires on the letter, constitute a testamentary desigation, wbicb should be enforced. With wbicb we are unable to agree. Manifestly sbe was never designated as a beneficiary, for not one of tbe rules of tbe order relating thereto was complied with. Her relationship to Mr. Faires was not such as to render her eligible for designation on that ground, and tbe required affidavit as to dependency was never made, nor any action taken by tbe order in recognition of her rights as such. Tbe fact that after tbe certificate was returned to Mr. Faires be took no further steps in tbe matter, together with tbe fact of tbe ink lines having been drawn through tbe names, etc., on the said direction for such designation as above stated, seem to indicate an abandonment by him of tbe attempt to have Mrs. Grant recognized by tbe order as bis beneficiary; while the above quoted writing on tbe letter indicates bis desire that sbe should have tbe fund in question. But tbe fund was not bis nor subject to bis disposal, testamentary or otherwise, except as to bis right of ’ designation of beneficiary pursuant to tbe rules of tbe order. And tbe beneficiary named in bis certificate having died in bis lifetime, and no other designation having been made, tbe fund, under tbe said Act of May 24, 1893, P. L. 126, is payable to bis next of kin, whose right thereto became vested at bis death. And tbe contention, that their right therein is lost by turning tbe fund over to tbe executors to retain as stakeholders until tbe legal rights of tbe parties are adjudicated, is untenable. Tbe payment to a stakeholder, or into court, of a fund for wbicb there are rival 'claimants, to await tbe legal adjudication of their respective claims, does not constitute a waiver of the rights of either party.</p>
