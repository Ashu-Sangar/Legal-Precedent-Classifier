The ordinance was enacted under the authority of the Act of June 27, 1913, P. L. 638, to appropriate the sum of $3,000 for the payment of the salary of the superintendent. The mayor and councils appointed a board of seven directors and the board organized and appointed Arthur G.

L. 638, “providing for the creation of the Bureau of Public Morals in the Department of Public Safety in cities of the second class, defining its purposes, and providing for the payment of expenses incurred thereby.” The first section creates a Bureau of Public Morals in the Department of Public Safety in cities of the second class for the purpose of investigating and acting upon all questions and conditions arising from sex relationship affecting public morals. The second section provides for a board of seven directors appointed by the mayor and confirmed by council, the directors, who are subject to removal at the pleasure of the mayor, to elect from their own body a superintendent. <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>Section 3 confers full power on the board to investigate conditions growing out of sex relationship affecting public morals and to enforce laws and prosecute violations in matters of sex relationship and for that purpose they shall exercise such police powers as may be necessary, the business and policies of the board to be determined by a majority vote. Section 4 provides that there shall be detailed such policemen and detectives as the board may require from the regular police and detective force, subject to the approval of the director of the department of public safety, and during the time they are detailed they shall be subject to the orders of the board of directors through the superintendent and be responsible to the board. The board may appoint and employ additional investigators. Section 5 provides for the employment of clerical help.</p>

The directors have full power to direct the work.of the bureau and have dominion over all “sex relationship affecting public morals.” The detail of policemen and detectives from the regular force is subject to the approval of the director of the department, but he must obey the requisition and his only discretion is in approving the choice of individuals. The men are subject to the board of directors only. “The disguise is so thin that it can scarcely be called one”: Perkins, et al., v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/156/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="156 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="844956" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0554-01">156 Pa. 554</a>. All other bureaus are subordinate to and under the control of the heads of departments of which they are a part. This only is equal in authority and power. There is no question that the legislature can establish almost any form of government it pleases and that it may subdivide municipal functions, create departments, bureaus and other agencies and change them. But the question is not determined by what might have been done. There has been created for cities of the second class a form of government. This bureau is alien from it in every characteristic. By the <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>Act of March <em>7, </em>1901, P. L. 20, (3 Purdon 3009) the executive power is vested in the mayor. Nine executive departments are established, changed to ten by the Act of April 1, 1909, P. L. 83, (5 Purdon, 5757). The heads of departments must present annual reports to the mayor. Their accounts are subject to examination. Councils may provide by ordinance for bureaus, clerks and officers. Departments must furnish information to the mayor or councils. All the heads and subordinates must give bonds. The department of public safety is under the charge of one director and the administration of police affairs is in charge of this department. There is a system of supervision and control making it a responsible government.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b479-5" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[150,1115,1145,470]]]'>The Act of 1913 does not create a new department. Without any amending or repealing clause it establishes a separate board of directors to administer a part of the police affairs of the city, expressing, but not carrying out the intention to create a bureau. It creates neither a bureau nor a department subordinate to the mayor, in whom is vested the executive power of the city. It is a special agency for the performance of a municipal function.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b479-6" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[144,1607,1152,414]]]'>Section 20, Article III, of the Constitution is, “The general assembly shall not delegate to any special commission ......any power to......perform any municipal function whatever.” This forbids the delegation of the police power to any special board of directors. Under the existing municipal government this board is special and distinct. This is the real intent and purpose of the act.</p>

L. 796), was that the commissioners were independent of the proper municipalities and not agents of the city. They were not municipal officers. They were special for a special purpose. Judge White said, “It is true that, before a set of commissioners can be elected for the improvement of any street, the councils <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>must pass an ordinance directing the improvement and authorizing an election of commissioners. But that exhausts the powers of the councils in the premises, except to demand a bond, as above stated. The commissioners derive all their powers directly from the act of assembly. By the express terms of the act the powers are delegated to the commissioners and not to the city.......I understand this Twentieth Section, of Article III, as a positive prohibition against municipal functions being exercised by anybody, except the regular municipal authorities.” Referring to municipal agents or employees, he said: “They cannot be an independent body, they cannot have the municipal power delegated to them, so as to be beyond removal, supervision or control from the regular municipal authorities” : Mellon v. Pittsburgh, et al., 21 P. L. J. 185,186 (O. S.). In Perkins v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/156/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="156 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="844956" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0554-01">supra,</a> an act abolishing the commissioners of public buildings and transferring the building formerly under their control to the control of the department of public works was held to violate this section of the Constitution. It was held that this was creating another commission, even though the director was by general law an officer of the city. The special and unusual power given him to be exercised in a special manner with reference to one particular building constituted a special commission delegated to him. It was immaterial that the municipal functions were being exercised by the head of the department of the municipal government, for the commission was special.</p>
