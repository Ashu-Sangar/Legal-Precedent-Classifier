The sister anticipating the death of the brother, left a writing which stated “I am not responsible for the passing away of my brother' ......but I will know that his life is gone before mine passes, so I will have inherited his estate and the terms of my will stand.” Testatrix was, however, survived by said brother, whose name was Samuel, and by another brother, John. Several writings directed to John were found, requesting him to make certain dispositions of property. The register of wills admitted to probate the will of testatrix leaving her entire estate to her brother Samuel, and refused probate of the writings directed to her brother John. The Orphans’ Court affirmed the decree of the register. <em>Held, </em>that as the writings directed to John were only intended to take effect provided the brother Samuel predeceased testatrix, and were merely precatory in character, they never took effect as a will, and the decree was affirmed.</p>

By her will, dated March 3, 1905, Jane gave her entire estate to her brother Samuel if he survived her, and, if he did not so survive, then to her executors in trust to pay the income to her brother John Jamison for life, and after his death to pay the income to certain other beneficiaries. Samuel Jamison by his will, dated March 2, 1905, gave all his estate to his sister Jane if she survived him, and, if not, then to his executors in trust for the same beneficiaries as were named in the will of his sister Jane. On August 31, 1913, Jane Jami-son committed suicide, and Samuel apparently made an unsuccessful attempt to do so, but he survived his sister, and her will, dated March 3, 1905, was duly probated. On the day preceding her death, and evidently in anticipation thereof, Jane Jamison placed in a handbag certain letters and documents signed by her, and directed 'the delivery of the handbag with its contents to her <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>friend Gertrude H. Tyson, immediately after her death. One of these papers, which indicated clearly that she expected her brother Samuel to die before she did, was as follows:</p>

It was to <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>John, therefore, that she addressed her request that he would give certain specific securities, and the income from others, to certain persons whom she named. In one of her notes to her friend she states that she has asked John “if he will not allow” the disposition she has suggested to take effect. In another note to this friend, dated the day before, she says, “as John is the only heir I think he will grant my requests if you let him know how much I wish the things given to the» different persons.” But the event which she expected did not happen. She did not survive her brother Samuel. He survived her, and, under the first paragraph of her will, her entire estate went to him, without qualification or limitation. The writings were evidently not intended to apply at all .to the situation which actually arose. In one of them she speaks of her request to give away a business which admittedly belonged to Samuel and in which she could have had no interest, unless she first acquired it through the will of Samuel. Three of these writings bore the same date, and it is not possible to tell the order in which they were signed, but in one of them she states “the terms of my will stand.” Doubtless she had then in mind the contingency of her surviving her brother, but in any event it showed her intention that the will should stand. If it did, then clearly, as her brother Samuel was living when the will took effect, her entire estate became vested in him, and her brother John had no interest in or control over it. But aside from this the words employed in the writings are expressive merely of desire and recommendation, and are, therefore, merely precatory, and not testamentary.' She makes no disposition of her estate herself in the manner suggested, but knowing that if her brother John takes under the terms of her will, the income from all her property will go to him absolutely during his life, she requests that he will make certain gifts to the parties named, out of that which is given to him. In other words, having made a disposition of her property she expresses a desire that <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>the legatee shall make a certain use of her bounty. Nothing could be more clearly precatory. Under any aspect from which the case may be viewed, the court below was right in refusing to regard the papers in question as testamentary.</p>
