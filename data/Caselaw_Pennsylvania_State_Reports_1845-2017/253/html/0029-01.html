Owen Mallon, her surviving husband, on January 26, 1915, elected to take against her will, and made claim to real and personal property to the value of five thousand dollars, under the Act of April 1, 1909, Sec. 1, Art. II, P. L. 87, Stewart’s Purdon, Yol. 5, page 5621, pi. 3. Annie Mallon died without issue, but at the time of her death, Owen Mallon had issue by a former marriage. Subsequently to exercising his election and after August 7, 1915, but prior to September 23, 1915, Owen Mallon died. An appraisement of real and personal property of the decedent was made and filed, amounting to two thousand four hundred and ninety-six dollars and seventy-five cents, which Owen Mallon elected to retain. The petition of Owen Mallon was presented on August 7, 1915, praying for a decree approving the appraisement, and setting aside the said property to him.</p>

So conversely the right of the husband is made to depend on whether the wife left issue, not on whether he has issue. In addition to this five thousand dollars of property, they each can take against the will of the other under the Act of 1909, where there is no issue, one-half of the remaining real estate for life and one-half of the remaining personal property absolutely. Hence this wife dying without a will as to her husband, although testate, without issue, this husband is entitled to five thousand dollars’ worth of her property, and one-half of her remaining real estate for life, and one-half of her remaining personal estate absolutely, and all this under the Act of 1909.</p>
