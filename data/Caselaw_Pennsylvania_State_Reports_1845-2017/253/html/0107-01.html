    <p class="summary" id="b143-5" data-blocks='[["BL_143.4",143,[157,422,1149,650]]]'>It is to he observed that in devoting his estate to the use of his widow, he made no distinction between real and personal property. In like manner the remainder, if any, was blended in the gift over to his nephews. It is thus self-evident that in his mind the “principal” of his estate would form a unit and as such would be at the widow’s free disposal without stint during her lifetime. This is the unlimited power to consume the property both real and personal, and carries with it the power to convey as a necessary incident: Kennedy v. Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/216/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="216 Pa. 575" data-case-ids="950339" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0575-01">216 Pa. 575</a>; Allen v.

    <p class="summary" id="b143-7" data-blocks='[["BL_143.6",143,[160,1246,1148,755]]]'>The cases — or most of them — cited by defendant as supporting the claim of a life estate only in the widow, were considered in Kennedy v. Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/216/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="216 Pa. 575" data-case-ids="950339" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0575-01">supra,</a> where the ground upon which they are to be distinguished from the case here, is pointed out. It is nothing more or less, however, than a mere difference of intent and purpose in mind of testator as made manifest by what he has said. Broadly stated it comes to this: in the one class of cases the power to consume the corpus of the estate is given to the first taker in express terms;, while in the other the attempt has been made to derive it by mere inference from the gift over of “what remains” or “what shall be left” or “so much as may remain unexpended,” and the like phrases.</p>
