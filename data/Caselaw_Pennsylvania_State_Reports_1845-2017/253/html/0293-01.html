B. de Solms, with his wife and four young children resided. The elder Solms, in view of his approaching marriage to Mrs. Mary Jane Knight, and to better protect his said son and his son’s family, and in consideration of love for the son, executed a deed of trust, in which Mrs. Knight joined, conveying said plantation to the Philadelphia Trust Safe Deposit &amp; Insurance Company, in trust and for the use and benefit of said donor, Sidney J. Solms, for his life, with a reserved power of sale and, also of appointment at his death, and, in default of such appointment, for the benefit of his said son for life, as a spendthrift trust, and further providing as follows, viz:</p>

    <p id="b330-8" data-blocks='[["BL_330.8",330,[257,1828,1147,482]]]'>The rule in Pennsylvania seems to be that: “Where an estate is given to a person described by relation either to the testator or to other devisees, on a contingency that may or may not happen, and a person is in being at the time of the execution of the will, to whom, on the happening of the contingency, the description would apply, it is a safe general rule to hold such person as intended to be the devisee: Anshutz, et al., v. Muller, <a href="/pa/81/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="81 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="1044091" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0212-01">81 Pa. 212</a> (215).”</p>

Anshutz, all my right and title to my income from said estate so long as he shall live, and after his death, his widow is entitled to said income; after her death it shall be distributed to Annie M. Miller.” And it is there held that the one intended by the testator was the wife of said Anshutz when the will was made, and not some other person who might stand in that relation at his death. In Beers v. Narramore, et al., <a href="/conn/61/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="61 Conn. 13" data-case-ids="490531" data-case-paths="/conn/61/0013-01">61 Conn. 13</a>, it is held that by the term widow of his son the testator intended the wife of his son then living, and not any future wife, whom he might leave as his widow.

Webber, Exec., et al., <a href="/conn/65/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="65 Conn. 501" data-case-ids="806182" data-case-paths="/conn/65/0501-01">65 Conn. 501</a> (33 Atl.
