The trustees maintain that the profits realized from the sale of the said stock belong to the corpus of the trust fund; while counsel for A. G. C. Quay maintain that this sum is income and profits within the meaning of the will, and that this amount, together with the $10,775.45 should now be distributed to the next of kin of the said M. S.

Quay; until the happening of that event it could not be known who would be entitled to take. The interests of these residuary legatees are clearly contingent, and in such circumstances the income and profits from the trust fund go to the next of kin of M. S. Quay, including the profits derived from the sale of the tobacco stock, unless such profits constitute a part of the corpus of the estate. The important question, therefore, for decision is whether the amount realized from the sale of the said stocks over and above the price at which they were taken over by the trustees belongs to the corpus of the estate, or is profits within the meaning of the will.</p>

However, in any case reference must be had to the language of the will in dealing with such property. In Park’s Estate, supra, the language of the will is in substance the same as the language of the will under consideration. In that case the testator devised, and bequeathed the residue of his estate both real and. personal to his executors in trust, “ ‘to receive and collect the rents of the real estate hereby devised to them in trust, and the income and profits of the personal estate, hereby bequeathed to them in trust,’ (after deducting taxes and expenses and some minor annuities,) ‘to pay the residue of the net income arising from said real and personal estate, held by them in trust,’ into the hands of his daughter Margaretta, yearly and every year during her natural life, the corpus of the estate to be paid to her children after her death.”</p>

The gift, however, being general, gave those in remainder no title to any specific property, but implied. conversion into cash, which referred the value of the corpus to the date of <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>the testator’s death. Had the gift to Mrs. Leech been legal as well as equitable, that value would have been the measure of her liability to those in remainder and the source of the income and profits beneficially intended for her. Investment and reinvestment would have been in her control and for her sole benefit. Those in remainder would have had no interest further than the safety of this corpus and its payment at her death. This being conceded, why should the mere separation of legal and equitable estate imply any change in her beneficial estate?......In Earp’s App., <a href="/pa/28/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="28 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="981664" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0368-01">28 Pa. 368</a>, 374, which is the leading case, it was held that the surplus profits earned prior to testator’s death on stocks were essentially part of the stock itself and principal; while those earned after, whether declared in the form of cash, scrip or stock, belonged to the life donee. ‘In the case before us,’ said the Chief Justice, the testator has. not made a bequest of the stock itself to appellant; on the contrary he has given them only the income for life. Their interest commences after the death of testator. They have no right whatever to claim the income which had accumulated before his death.......It is equally clear that the profits arising since the death of the testator are income within the meaning of the will, and should be distributed among the appellants.’ ”</p>
