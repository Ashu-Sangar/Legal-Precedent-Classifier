L, 468. This opinion is published in the Pennsylvania Highway News, Vol. I, of May-June, 1915,1 Pa. Dept. Rep. 1299.</p>

L. 468, and this conclusion is irresistible from the language used in Section 34 of the said act, and especially is that so, when you follow the history of the preceding legislation, along the same lines and relating to the same subject. We are therefore, of the opinion, that it is the duty of Bradford County, to rebuild and reconstruct this county bridge in question.</p>

The unsafe condition of the bridge in question is such, that we regard the exigence of the case such, on account of the public being required to use this bridge when in a dangerous condition, that its rebuilding or repair should be made at once, and we therefore direct, that a peremptory writ of mandamus issue forthwith, requiring the said George N. Bird, Jesse L. Ellsworth and Miles E. Horton, county commissioners of Bradford County, to construct, maintain and keep in repair the bridge known as “Kelloggs’ bridge,” located upon the State highway, known as Route 17, under the Act of May 31, 1911, between New Albany and Monroeton, Bradford County, Pa., so that the same shall be reasonably safe for public travel, until such time as the same shall be rebuilt by Bradford County, under the Act of February 14, 1907, P.
