In an action to recover hand-money paid by plaintiffs to defendant under a contract for the sale of real estate, it appeared that plaintiffs refused to take title, alleging that the deed which defendant had tendered did not comply with the requirements of the contract. Defendant’s counterclaimed for damages for the refusal of plaintiffs to comply with the agreement. Defendant contended that the contract was in writing and offered in evidence a letter signed by plaintiffs and addressed to defendant, reading “Referring to our conversation over the ’phone yesterday in regard to the thirty thousand acres on the head waters of the Elk river in <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>West Virginia which our Mr. Kaye purchased from you last Monday, we think it would be a good plan for our Mr. Kaye to go along with you to Elkins next week, as we are anxious to get all the maps and descriptions of the deeds and rights of way belonging to all your holdings in these lands as soon as' possible, so we will have plenty of time to examine same before we sign the final detailed agreement which you are making.” It appeared that the property dealt with consisted of a great number of separate tracts some of which defendant owned and on some of which he held options. The acreage of certain of the tracts was uncertain, and the title to others was in dispute. <em>Held, </em>that the references to the land in question were inadequate to identify the property intended to be conveyed and that the writing was insufficient to meet the requirements of the statute of frauds of West Virginia where the land was located, which was practically the same as the statute of frauds of'Pennsylvania, and that defendant could not, therefore, recover damages for plaintiff’s alleged breach of the contract.</p>

H. Cobb, as agent, “with full power and authority to sell and dispose of the same”; that in December, 1905, Cobb notified the plaintiffs he had this land for sale, and it would cut certain stated quantities of timber per acre, 90 per cent, thereof being hemlock and spruce and the balance poplar and hardwood; that Cobb “invited the plaintiffs to inspect the land and timber with a view to purchase same”; that, in response, agents of the plaintiffs visited the land, and were “furnished with one James Gibson as a guide to take them over the ground and inspect the timber,” who “pretended to point out to them the boundaries of said 30,000 acres”; that, “relying upon the information thus obtained and the representations thus made,” the plaintiffs decided to purchase the tract, and for this purpose Joseph Kaye, on January 15, 1906, visited the defendant, who “reiterated the statements made by his agent, W.

B. Howard &amp; Co.,” dated January 18, 1906, and addressed to John A. Innes, together with other writings, and oral evidence, was sufficient to meet the requirements of the law. This letter reads as follows: “Referring to our conversation over the ’phone yesterday in regards to the 30,000 acres on the head waters of the Elk river in West Virginia which our Mr. Kaye purchased from you last Monday, we think it would be a good plan for our Mr. Kaye to go along with you to Elkins next week, as we are anxious to get all the maps and descriptions of the deeds and rights of way belonging to all your holdings in these lands as soon as possible, so we will have plenty of time to examine same before we sign the final detailed agreement which you are making.”</p>

The receipt given January 15, 1906, for the $10,000.00 paid on account, was signed by the defendant, not by the plaintiffs, hence, so far as the counterclaim is concerned, this writing, standing by itself, is not a memorandum “signed by the party to be charged.” When we come to the letter of January 18,1906, so largely depended upon by the defendant, while bearing the signature of “C. B. Howard &amp; Co.,” yet it, as well as the other writing just <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>referred to, indicates upon its face an incomplete agreement, not a final contract; more than this, when we consider the established facts at bar, it is plain that neither of these writings sufficiently identifies the lands in controversy. The property dealt with in the above writings consisted of a great number of separate tracts, some of which, at that time, the defendant owned outright, and upon others he merely held options; the acreage of a number of these tracts was uncertain, and the title to others was in dispute. It was not until January 23, 1906, that the defendant endeavored even to furnish a list of the properties which he proposed to convey, and it is admitted that at this time the deeds for several of these were not yet executed. Under these circumstances, it is apparent that the references to the lands in question contained in the above documents were wholly inadequate to identify the property intended to be conveyed, and an examination of the several other writings depended upon by the defendant, consisting of a check for the $10,000.00 hand-money, and some telegrams and letters, shows that these, taken either separately or together, did not fill the void in his case; for parol testimony was necessary not only to prove what was meant by “the 30,000 acres on the head waters of the Elk river in West Virginia which our Mr. Kaye purchased from you last Monday,” but to locate and show how much of each of the several tracts comprehended therein was to be conveyed to the plaintiffs. Even if all the writings depended upon by the defendant had been signed by the plaintiffs or their agents, which they were not, in order to be admissible for the purpose offered, they would have to be either self-sustaining or connected with each other by internal references, whereas here they were so foreign to one another that parol testimony was absolutely essential to show any association between them. In other words, these writings were not self-sustaining; neither separately nor together did they describe the lands in controversy sufficiently' to meet the requirements of the <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>statute, that is, they failed to show a completed contract for a defined subject-matter, signed by the party to be charged, or his agent..</p>
    <p id="b635-5" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[131,515,1150,1082]]]'>Orally to identify the subject-matter of a contract, referred to in a written instrument by general description or through the medium of a recognized name, is essentially different from an attempt by parol evidence to determine and define the subject-matter itself; in one case the name or description is simply applied to the thing in view, while in the other the thing itself is established: see Title, Guaranty &amp; Surety Co. v.

Here, notwithstanding the offers to show that the lands in question were known as the “Innes tract” and could be so identified, when all the relevant established facts are considered, it is too plain for discussion that the defendant attempted the latter, or forbidden, not the former, or permitted course, and we are not convinced the court below erred in refusing to allow this to be done. Before leaving the branch of the case now under consideration, we take occasion to say there is no material difference between our law and that of West Virginia on the subject in hand. The defendant’s assignments of error are all overruled.</p>

In disposing of this phase of the case, the court below states, inter alia: “The evidence is very conflicting as to the terms of the agreement. Plaintiffs’ evidence tends to show that it was an absolute unlimited contract; on the other hand, the defendant’s evidence is to the effect that it was a limited agreement, merely to sell and convey whatever interest the defendant had in the lands in question, expressly stipulating that the defendant would assume no responsibility as to titles, acreage or timber, and that the contract was for a reduced price because of such limited agreement. We instructed the jury that if they found for the plaintiffs on that question, then on account of certain defects <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>of title, shortages of amounts, etc., plaintiffs were entitled to rescind the contract. Of course, the defendant had a right to make such an agreement as he contends was made, and, if so, his part of the agreement would he performed by the tender of a deed sufficient to convey whatever interest he had in the premises. The verdict of the jury indicates that they accepted defendant’s contention as to the terms of said agreement. Plaintiffs also contended that such agreement, regardless of its terms, was void because of the alleged fraud of plaintiffs’ agent, one Captain W. H. Cobb, and, in that connection, letters of Mr. Cobb to plaintiffs were offered in evidence which plaintiffs urge contain false and fraudulent statements with reference to the property in question. There is nothing on the face of the letters indicating fraud; if fraudulent it was because the statements therein contained were at such variance with the actual facts as to be false and fraudulent; but the actual facts in the case had to be determined very largely from the evidence of witnesses, so, while it might be the duty of the court to construe the letters, it was certainly the province of the jury to pass upon the facts. We are not prepared fo say that the undisputed evidence discloses such a state of facts as to justify the court in declaring as a matter of law that Mr. Cobb was guilty of fraud in the transactions. The letters seem to contain some over-statements in regard to the gross amount of timber on the lands, and also as to the percentage of spruce and hemlock contained therein, but, so far as We know, the timber is still standing on the premises, so it has not yet been definitely determined as to the actual amount and kinds thereof; it still remains, so far as appears, a matter of estimate. Then, again, plaintiffs before purchasing went upon the premises and made some examination for themselves, and it is a question of fact whether they relied upon the statements made to them by Mr. Cobb, or upon their own personal inspection ; in fact, the letters invite the plaintiffs to visit and <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>inspect the premises. We are of the opinion that, under all the facts, the question of fraud was for the jury. ......As to a part of said lands......perhaps ten to twelve per cent......, [MeGraw &amp; Strader tract], there was in the title a limitation of twenty years for the removal of the timber; and, at the conclusion of the trial, it was urged by the plaintiffs that they had no knowledge of such limitation, inasmuch as the deed to defendant [for this particular part of the property] was not recorded until the 24th day of May, 1906, being some 24 days after plaintiffs had refused to accept defendant’s deed for the entire property, and that, by reason thereof, binding instructions should be given in favor of the plaintiffs. There are at least three reasons why we think such instructions could not be given. First, because, if defendant’s version of the original contract be correct — and that was for the jury — he was only bound to convey to the plaintiffs such title as he had; hence, if he tendered the plaintiffs a deed in terms like his own for said MeGraw &amp; Strader tract, it was a compliance with his version of the contract. Second,......there was evidence to submit to the jury tending to show the plaintiffs had......knowledge of the existence of said limitation ......before the time of the attempted rescission of the contract; so [the existence of the limitation not having been made a ground for rescission] the question of waiver as to that was for the jury. Thirdly, we are not convinced that the court could declare as a matter of law the said twenty-year limitation was of such materiality as to justify the plaintiffs in rescinding their entire agreement. It is possible that in case of the sale of timber the purchaser would have only a reasonable time in which to remove it, in the absence of any limit being stated in the agreement of purchase, and no evidence was offered as to what would be a reasonable time for the removal of timber from this tract of land. Nothing was offered tending to show that a twenty-year limitation would materially depreciate the value of such purchase <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>of timber, and we are not clear that there is any rule of law that would enable the court to so declare......We believe......that whether a contract for the sale of land will be regarded as rescinded for partial failure of title alone depends upon the circumstances,......and, if so, we cannot see, as matter of law, that [under the circumstances here present] the said twenty-year limitation was of such materiality as to justify plaintiffs in rescinding the entire contract.”</p>
    <p id="b638-10" data-blocks='[["BL_638.4",638,[260,841,1151,1510]]]'>The above quoted excerpts from the opinion of the court below amply dispose of the plaintiffs’ appeal, but it may be noted that the matter of this twenty-year limitation is nowhere depended upon or referred to in the plaintiffs’ statement of claim; it appears to have been brought forward at trial after the deed showing the limitation had been allowed in evidence for an entirely different purpose, and even then the plaintiffs did not ask to amend their declaration, in order to add this restriction as an additional justification for the rescission of their contract. While it is true that Mr. Cobb’s original letter to the plaintiffs stated “There is no time limit for the removal of the timber,” with some general exceptions, yet it was not made clear that the plaintiffs in any sense depended upon that statement, or that, in point of fact, the defendant really had any greater knowledge upon the subject than the plaintiffs; furthermore, all the indications were that the limitation was not considered of material importance by any of the parties until its significance was urged at the end of the trial in the court below. After reading the voluminous testimony in the case, we find no justification for the assertion that Mr. Innes deliberately misled the plaintiffs as to the existence of the limitation, and, since there was a decided conflict in the evidence as to whether or not they were deceived in any other respect concerning the lands which they sought to purchase, all of the issues in that regard were properly submitted to the jury.</p>

When Mr. Kaye, of the plaintiffs, called on Mr. Innes, the latter immediately informed him, “I wanted to get into communication with Mr. Cobb so there wouldn’t be any complication.” Mr. Innes testified that Mr. Kaye insisted on buying the property forthwith, without giving him an opportunity to confer with Mr. Cobb. Mr. Innes further said he told Mr. Kaye, “I have never been on the property and do not know whether there is a tree on it, and I wouldn’t guarantee whether there was a tree on it; ......if you take this property to-day, you take it on your own knowledge as to titles, acreage, right of way, or anything connected with this property — I am not familiar with the property myself”; to which Mr. Kaye replied that he had been upon the property and talked with Mr. Cobb, who had explained to him “regarding the titles and rights of way,” but he did not tell Mr. Innes what Mr. Cobb had said or that he was relying upon his statements. In conclusion, Mr. Innes stated that, when the plaintiffs finally declined to accept a deed for the property, they did not say Mr. Cobb had misled them in. any particular, but placed their refusal solely upon the ground that “James Gibson had shown them timber that wasn’t in the boundary, or on the lands that I (Innes) owned — they had been shown the wrong timber.” A witness for the defendant, who was present at the time of the purchase, fully corroborated his testimony, stating that Mr. Innes told Mr. Kaye he would accept his offer at $28.00 per acre, which was $2.00 less than the asking price, “but that if he sold them that morning to him he must take those lands just as he (Innes) had them as regards the timber and the titles and the acre<a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>age”; that “Mr. Kaye said Mr. Cobb had given him an estimate of the timber......and wanted to know of Mr. Innes what his estimate was,” and in reply Mr. Innes said “he had no estimate whatever......, that if he (Kaye) took the lands, he would take them on his own inspection, that he (Innes) wouldn’t guarantee there was a tree on any portion of them”; that “the result of the conversation was Mr. Kaye said he would take the lands for C. B. Howard &amp; Co. at $28.00 per acre, and drew a check for $10,000.00 as down payment, and gave it to Mr. Innes, and Mr. Hammond drew a receipt for this $10,000.00 which Mr. Innes signed and delivered either to Mr. Kaye or Mr. Hammond.” If the jurors believed this testimony, and their verdict shows they did, it was amply sufficient to justify a finding that the plaintiffs knowingly purchased the lands in controversy just as they stood and as defendant held them, which finding would be enough to sustain the verdict rendered. The law upon this subject has recently been reviewed in Little v. Thropp, <a href="/pa/245/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="245 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="326265" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0539-01">245 Pa. 539</a>; also see Lazarus v. Lehigh &amp; Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., <a href="/pa/246/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="246 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="1006193" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0178-01">246 Pa. 178</a>. The plaintiffs’ assignments are likewise overruled.</p>

The jury fixed this amount at $18,267.08, and the plaintiffs subsequently moved for judgment n. o. v., accompanying their motion with a suggestion that should it be refused “then the plaintiffs hereby specifically object to the entry of judgment in favor of the defendant upon the verdict of the jury for any greater amount than the costs incurred in this case, for the reason that the amount of damages proved by the defendant......and awarded to him by the verdict......, to wit, $3,547.20, is less than the hand-jmoney paid by the plaintiffs..which <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>amounted to $10,000.00 and is still retained by tbe defendant.” Tbe plaintiffs’ motion for judgment in tbeir favor was overruled, but tbeir objection to tbe monetary award made by tbe jury was sustained, and tbe verdict was amended “so as to be simply a verdict for tbe defendant” ; subsequently, on motion of tbe latter’s counsel, a general judgment was entered “in favor of tbe defendant and against tbe plaintiffs......, for costs in tbe above case.” While both plaintiffs- and defendant bave appealed from this judgment, yet tbe practice pursued in reaching it is not criticised by either side, hence it calls for no discussion on our part; we bave noted it merely by way of explanation of tbe record. Finally, we find no complaint from tbe defendant because the damages awarded him were struck from tbe verdict in bis favor; as to this, however, the court below very properly states: “Tbe defendant has already received from tbe plaintiffs more than three times tbe amount of bis expenditures, and it would be inequitable to allow him to recover again what, in fact, be has already been more than paid. Tbe very object of tbe $10,000.00 earnest money, cash payment, was tbe protection of tbe defendant, and, as we held at tbe trial that tbe parol contract was invalid under tbe statute of frauds, we see no basis on which tbe balance found for tbe defendant can be sustained...... In principle, this branch of tbe case is ruled by Roach v. Irvin, <a href="/pa/245/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="245 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="325993" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0162-01">245 Pa. 162</a>.”</p>
