    <p class="summary" id="b133-12" data-blocks='[["BL_133.17",133,[197,2370,1099,45]],["BL_134.1",134,[266,328,1146,320]]]'>The supplemental affidavit repeats the first and adds <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>thereto' the averment that on or about August 17, 1915, the arbitrator sent to the parties a paper called “Brief,” which is, in effect, a belated opinion justifying the award. Prom this brief the affiant infers that the arbitrator acted erroneously and, therefore, was inspired by bias and prejudice.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.4",134,[266,657,1147,590]]]'>Two questions are raised by these affidavits. The first is as to the meaning of the submission. The mere reading of it shows it to be plain and unambiguous. The defendant expressly names himself as a party, and the subject-matter to be discussed is of the utmost generality : “All outstanding claims of whatsoever nature made by Charles E. Starr against the Public Utilities Company and me, and the claims of the Public Utilities Company against Charles E. Starr,” and this is signed by the defendant in these words: “J. H. McNeal individually and as president of Public Utilities Co.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b134-5" data-blocks='[["BL_134.5",134,[266,1257,1146,254]]]'>The defendant’s contention that he understood this to mean that the suit was not against him individually and did not include all matters in controversy, is obviously baseless, the remarkable feature being that a lawyer should have the hardihood to advance it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b134-6" data-blocks='[["BL_134.6",134,[267,1530,1145,209]]]'>The other contention based on the arbitrator’s “brief” has no greater value. The submission is absolute, “all parties to abide by your decision with no right of appeal.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b134-7" data-blocks='[["BL_134.7",134,[267,1751,1148,532]]]'>Even if the arbitrator erred in law or in fact, the provision is nevertheless binding. Every one knows that human beings are liable to err, and the parties to this submission knew it and agreed to take the risk. The defendant especially would have little right to complain. The arbitrator was a near relative of his, and his training as a lawyer gave him special knowledge of the fact that, in all civilized countries, courts of errors and appeals sit continuously to correct the multifarious errors committed by courts of first instance.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b134-8" data-blocks='[["BL_134.8",134,[270,2295,1145,101]],["BL_135.1",135,[166,353,1148,426]]]'>In order to set aside the award it would have been necessary to aver with definiteness and precision either some <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>misconduct on the part of the arbitrator which would be an abuse of his authority, or some.gross and palpable error in law which would vitiate his judgment at its root. The first the defendant did not even attempt; the second he attempted by a cynical misinterpretation of his own instrument of submission, he being himself a lawyer and acting under the advice of one of the ablest and most learned members of our bar in the making of it.</p>

    <p id="b135-10" data-blocks='[["BL_135.11",135,[162,1522,1149,429]]]'>This action is upon an award of an arbitrator under a common law submission. The terms of submission, signed by the appellant, are plain and unambiguous, and, as the arbitrator clearly acted within the scope of the authority committed to him, his award is “with no right of appeal” in the appellant. The averments in his affidavit of defense are unavailing to defeat the appellee’s right to recover. The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>
