In the conduct thereof, flanging and punching machines, operated .by hydraulic <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>power, are used. The punching machine is used for spudding bolt heads and for punching holes in metal plates. Single and double dies, the latter in pairs, are used in the operation of punching holes. These dies are placed on the punching bed of the machine, and carefully adjusted by the operator so as to be true with the head of the plunger rod or bar, in order that a clean and true hole in the metal plate may be made. After the die has been carefully- and truly adjusted the operator fastens it ip its place, and then applies the power to the plunger rod or bar by releasing a valve which controls it. When the power is applied to the bar or rod it descends with force and punches a hole in the plate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.4",112,[288,1045,1150,480]]]'>On the morning of August 3, 1910, the plaintiff, who had been working at the punching machine for about six weeks, was engaged in adjusting a-die preparatory to punching holes in some metal plates. The machine was stopped. Whilst thus engaged he pulled the lever which controlled the valve of the plunger rod or bar. It suddenly dropped on the die, with the result that- a small piece of the die was broken off which struck the right eye of the plaintiff and destroyed the sight of it.</p>

In his statement of claim filed- he averred that the injury was the result of the negligence of the defendant in furnishing him an unsafe, improper, and defective machine. The plaintiff, in his statement, described how the accident happened. He stated that, “upon taking hold of the operating lever to gently move it to test whether the die and punch were true to each other, the said lever, because of its defective condition, suddenly and unexpectedly, and without any fault of the plaintiff, dropped the entire distance, causing the punch and die, which were not yet true, to come together with great force and violence, whereby a piece of one or the other was broken off by the sudden contact, and flew with great velocity through the air, striking the <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>plaintiff in the right eye, bursting the eyeball and permanently ruining the sight thereof.”</p>

The evidence of the plaintiff and his witnesses failed to establish the cause of the accident, or that the injury received by the plaintiff resulted from the negligence of the defendant. There was also a failure to show that the punching machine was defective.</p>
