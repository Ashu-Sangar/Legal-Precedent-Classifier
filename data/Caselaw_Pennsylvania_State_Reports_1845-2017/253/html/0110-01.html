    <p class="summary" id="b145-5" data-blocks='[["BL_145.12",145,[130,881,1148,1184]]]'>The principal relief prayed for is injunction to restrain defendant from mining out its coal beneath plaintiff’s lot. The suit arises out of a case of divided ownership as between the surface and the underlying mineral estate. The Pawnee Coal Company is the common source of the respective titles. Severance took place in 1869 by means of its grant to Hugh Gordon of a town lot on Stone avenue in this city known and numbered on the grantor’s tract as Lot No. 6 in Block 34, being 40 feet in front on the avenue by 140 feet deep, “excepting and reserving, however, to the said company their successors and assigns nil coal and minerals beneath the surface of and belonging to said lot, with the sole right and privilege to mine and remove the same by any subterranean process incident to the business of mining without thereby incurring in any event whatsoever any liability for injury caused or damage done to the surface of said lot or to the buildings or improvements which now are or hereafter may be put thereon: Provided that no mine or air shaft shall be intentionally opened or any mining fixture established on the surface of said premises.”</p>

There is no dispute, in other words, that the respective rights and liabilities of the parties in the subject-matter are to be determined by the effect of that initial conveyance. There is no allegation of unusual, unskilful or negligent mining. Hence, if that form of conveyance be sufficient to effect a severance and to extinguish the right of vertical support, then, it is conceded, plaintiff has no case. No doubt that is its prima facie effect; but the learned counsel seeks to avoid it on the ground (1) that treated as a reservation it was illegal because as broad as the grant; (2) as a waiver of support, it was void as against the statute of frauds for want of the execution of any writing on the part of the grantee.</p>
