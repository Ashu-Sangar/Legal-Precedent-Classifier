It appears that she entered a car at 33d and Chestnut streets. There is no allegation that the car had not come to a full stop. On the contrary, it is admitted that the plaintiff was within the car, which was of a type known as “Pay-as-you-enter”; she was standing in front of the box in the act of receiving change from the conductor. At the time of the accident the plaintiff weighed two hundred and fifteen pounds. She testified that she swayed forward and then backward and was caught by another passenger and the conductor. She subsequently went to 13th and Chestnut streets, where she alighted, got on a 13th street car and went to her destination in Kensington; she was obliged to walk some distance both going to, and returning in the evening from her destination in Kensington. She further testified that she did not observe that any other passengers were disturbed by reason of the starting or jerking of the car. I am of opinion that where the negligence charged is an unusual and extraordinary jolting or jerking of the car the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the unusual or extraordinary character of the starting or subsequent jerking or jumping of the car in order to take the case to the jury. The testimony of the plaintiff is that “the car started violently,” but there is no evidence as to any unusual or extraordinary starting or subsequent operation of the car; no presumption of negligence arises from the use of the words “violently started.” As has been said in the case of Sanson v. Philadelphia Rapid <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>Transit Co., <a href="/pa/239/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="239 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="995950" data-case-paths="/pa/239/0505-01">239 Pa. 505</a>, 508: “The company would not be liable for an injury that might accidentally result from a slight jerk of the car and one which frequently occurs even in the most careful operation. It is only where the jerk is out of the ordinary and is unusual and extraordinary that liability attaches on the ground of negligent operation.”</p>
