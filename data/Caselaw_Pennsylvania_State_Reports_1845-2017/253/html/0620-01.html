The petition further avers that the sheriff objects to proceeding to arrest and take relator into custody, upon the ground that the decree and order were not directed to him. While the proper remedy of the bail would seem to be an application for a bail piece, under which relator could be taken into custody, in view of the particular facts, and the evident intention of the relator to resist an arrest so far as possible, the decree heretofore entered is amended to read as follows: ■</p>
