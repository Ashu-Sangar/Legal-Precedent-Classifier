The plaintiff alleged, and the jury found, that he was but nineteen years of age at the time of the deed in question; but they further found that the conveyance <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>was made in the execution of a trust, and, on that theory, they rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants, upon which the court below entered judgment.

    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[260,1114,1146,865]]]'>It is well established that “one who takes and holds the legal title to land in trust can convey or mortgage the same in execution of that trust, and cannot disaffirm or avoid his deed or mortgage on the ground of his minority” : 22 Cyc. 531. When John Hlawaty accepted the conveyance from his father, he undertook to cárry out a confidence reposed in him in the nature of a trust, which he accomplished in his own way when he made the deed to John Zeock; therefore, sofar as the plaintiff is concerned, the trust, whatever it amounted to, has been fully executed ; and, since the principles of equity are interwoven with our law, the court below was entirely right in not permitting him to recover the property for his individual benefit, even though none of the deeds made mention of the trust obligation and he was a minor at the time of their delivery.</p>
