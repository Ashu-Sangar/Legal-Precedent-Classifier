On October 3, 1913, the theatre company was notified by the superintendent of police that he would close the theatre in ten days unless steps were taken to make the alterations.

The alterations required were, among other things, a partial reconstruction of the front wall, which would necessitate compliance with the ordinance of March 31, 1884, requiring the front wall to be set back to the new line of Chestnut street, a distance of five feet; additional exits from the galleries; a fire wall to protect the dressing rooms from fire on the stage; rear exits from the auditorium; the steps in front of the theatre to be done away with, and an approach by way of' an incline to be substituted therefor. The defendants aver that if these alterations were made the space for seats in the theatre would be materially decreased and would not be sufficient in the lower floor to warrant the use of the building as a theatre, and that there would not be sufficient space left upon the stage to give ordinary theatrical performances thereon; that the alterations would cost about $45,000, and if they were made the building would no longer be of any use as a theatre, because of the reduction of the size of the stage, and of the seating capacity of the auditorium.</p>
