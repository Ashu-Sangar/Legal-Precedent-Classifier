That said William J. Arnold had no knowledge of the condition of said pole and without any fault on his part and while in the performance of his duties, the pole broke and threw him to the ground, and thereby he was seriously and permanently injured.</p>

The same reasons were urged to sustain the motion for judgment n. o. v. and rule for new trial; to wit, that no negligence on the part of the defendant company was shown, and that the plaintiff, William J.

We cannot agree with this contention, but think the defendant company was bound to inspect its poles, and that its lineman did not assume the risk of accident which might arise by reason of the neglect of the defendant company in that respect. We are well aware that a contrary rule is held in some of our states but we do not think such is the law in Pennsylvania.</p>
