    <p class="syllabus" id="b67-7" data-blocks='[["BL_67.8",67,[177,854,1148,222]]]'>1. Where in an action for injuries to a child alleged to have been occasioned by a wagon, while the child was playing in the street, there was evidence that at the time of the accident the parents knew that the child was playing in the street, the question of their contributory negligence was for the jury.</p>

Where in such ease there was evidence from which the inference could be drawn either that defendant’s driver drove in negligent proximity to the child so that she was struck by the wheel, or that the child was not injured by the wagon, or that while playing the child brought herself in contact with the hub, without fault upon the driver, the case was for the jury and a verdict and judgment for defendant was justified by the evidence.</p>

      <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>The first is that error was committed in the instructions to the jury with respect to damages. This question is unimportant, because the jury have rendered a verdict .in favor of the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b68-4" data-blocks='[["BL_68.4",68,[229,547,1146,645]]]'>The second question is alleged error with respect to the contributory negligence of the father, and in this regard we are referred to citations of authorities holding that the contributory negligence of a father with respect to his child, and with regard to permitting the child to play in the street, is not a question to be determined by the court. These authorities have no application to this case, because the contributory negligence of the parent was referred to the jury for their decision. This was rightfully so referred, because evidence was introduced by the defendant that this child played in the street with the knowledge of her parents.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.5",68,[227,1203,1151,1191]]]'>The third matter is a complaint about a view of the case which was submitted by the court to the jury. Under the evidence the jury were at liberty tq come to any one of three conclusions. First, that while the girl plaintiff was playing in the street, the defendant’s driver drove in negligent proximity to her and struck her with the hub of the rear wheel of his wagon and knocked her down and injured her foot. Or, secondly, they might-have come to the conclusion in accordance with the defendant’s testimony that the child was not injured at all by the defendant’s wagon. Or, thirdly, they might have come to a conclusion by a sort of combination of the evidence of the plaintiff and defendant in an effort to harmonize it, that is to say, that the girl plaintiff ran into the street offering a tag for sale to the driver, and when he refused, that she whirled in a frolicsome way and brought herself in contact with the hub of the rear wheel, was knocked down and her foot was injured by the wheel. In this aspect of the case the jury were instructed that unless the driver drove in dangerous proximity to the child,- there would be no responsibility upon the defendant for an unexpected frolicsome act of the girl.</p>
