Our first duty is to ascertain, the intention of the testator. Having ascertained that; intention we are to inquire whether or not any technical rule of law prohibits the intention being carried into» effect. It will be observed that the testator nowhere; in his will uses the words heirs, or issue. The words by which he devises the real estate are as follows:</p>

Then in a separate clause “at his death......to the child or children in fee.” We are not informed by the case stated whether the said Thomas A. McAfee has any child or children. “The word child does not include......heirs, heirs of the body or issue unless such interpretation is imperativé or where the intention to úse the word in a <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>broader sense a more extended signification appears from tbe context of tbe instrument in which it is employed.”</p>
