Part of the real estate was situate in Illinois and upon this the Commonwealth claimed a collateral inheritance tax. It appeared that such real estate had not actually been sold and that at the time of testator’s death there was sufficient personal estate to pay all of the said legacies. <em>Meld, </em>that the will did not work such a conversion of the Illinois real estate as to render it subject to collateral inheritance tax in this Commonwealth.</p>

It is conceded that no such necessity has arisen or can arise in this case. But this case seems to be controlled by the general rule as to failure of purpose of conversion. The general rule is that the conversion is limited to the purposes, of the testator as expressed in the will, and in the event of a total failure of the purpose the property passes according to its original character.</p>

To the mind of the auditor, Clause No. 2 of the trio, to wit: that containing the direction to sell the real estate, emphasizes and gives added force to his desire to give his legatees their legacies free of collateral tax, because he directs the proceeds of the sale to be applied to the payment of legacies already carefully freed from any liability of deduction by the infliction of the collateral tax; in other words, the proceeds of the sale, if such a sale is necessary, is only to be used in the payment of legacies that are to be free of collateral taxation.
