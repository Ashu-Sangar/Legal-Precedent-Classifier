        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Jones,\nThis appeal is from an order granting a new trial in an action to determine the damages due the plaintiff husband and wife for the Commonwealth\u2019s appropriation of a portion of their land for highway purposes in an exercise of the condemnor\u2019s power of eminent domain. A board of view awarded the plaintiffs $10,000 which the Commonwealth appealed to the court of common pleas. The issue was there tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the plaintiffs in the sum of $4,053. On the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the court granted a new trial on the ground that the verdict was inadequate. Prom that order, the Commonwealth has appealed.\nAt the time of the relocation and construction of the new highway the plaintiffs\u2019 tract, containing approximately 96 acres, was bisected by a then existing highway with which a large portion of the property was level, a situation which admitted of driving directly to and from the highway and the property. Prior to the relocation, the portion of the land abutting on the highway had been surveyed and laid out as building lots. After the relocation and improvement, the plaintiffs\u2019 property was no longer level with the highway and the area laid out in building lots was inaccessible to the highway because of the changes in grade, which also affected the drainage and caused surface water from the highway to run upon portions of the plaintiffs\u2019 land making it swampy and rendering it useless for any purpose. In the construction of the new highway the Commonwealth actually took 1.9 acres of the plaintiffs\u2019 land for the widening and relocation and an additional .5 acre for the slopes of the cuts and fills.\nAs so frequently happens in cases of this nature, there was a wide disparity in the opinion evidence adduced by the respective parties as to the damages due to the taking. The husband plaintiff gave $15,000 as his opinion of the damages and an expert witness called by him and his wife placed the damages at $11,-750. On the other hand, the Commonwealth\u2019s sole expert witness testified that the damages were $2,500.\nThe appellant appears to conceive that, since the jury\u2019s determination of the damages was for an amount between the estimates as testified to by the witnesses for the respective sides, the verdict was the product of conflicting testimony and could not, therefore, be interfered with by the trial court. The eases which the appellant cites in this connection do not lend support to the proposition ivhich is a novel one to say the least.\nAppellant further contends that a court cannot grant a new trial alone on the ground that the verdict is inadequate. This contention is equally novel. The appellant\u2019s quotation from Crumrine v. Washington County Housing Authority, 376 Pa. 234, 239, 101 A. 2d 676, which in turn was quoted from Beal v. Reading Company, 370 Pa. 45, 49, 87 A. 2d 214, merely confirms that the trial court must give reasons for setting aside a jury\u2019s verdict in a case such as the present and that mere conclusions such as \u201cinterests of justice\u201d are insufficient.\nIn the instant case, the court did give valid reasons for deeming the jury\u2019s verdict to be not truly reflective of the amount of the damages. It pointed out the wide disparity in the damages fixed by the various witnesses from which it is apparent that the jury\u2019s verdict bore no rationally assignable relation to any of the testimony. The court also noted the very wide disparity between the jury\u2019s verdict and the amount of damages awarded by the board of viewers, saying, in this connection, that, \u201cWhile the amount as found by the Board of View is not binding in any sense upon the Court, nor is it relevant testimony in the trial of the case upon an appeal from the action of the Board of View, yet it is a fair indication of the amount of damages suffered by the land owners and on a motion for a new trial should be considered where the new trial is urged upon the grounds that the verdict of the jury was inadequate as in the case at bar.\u201d The reasoning is, of course, sound. In the Grumrine case, supra, where it was claimed that the jury\u2019s verdict was excessive, Mr. Justice Arnold, after noting that \u201c. . . the verdict is practically the same as a viewers\u2019 award\u201d, recognized for this court that \u201cThat is a circumstance tending to show the verdict is not excessive.\u201d Logically, its evidential value must work both ways.\nA further reason for setting aside the verdict is to be found in the rationale of the court\u2019s rejection of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that $4,053 was ample damages for 2% acres of unimproved farm land. The contention is but an expression of the fallacy which permeates the Commonwealth\u2019s attitude to the question involved. The court below adequately answered the mistaken idea when it said, \u201c. . . this is not the test applied by rule of law when the State appropriates property of a land owner. The proper measure of damages is well established. The owner of the land is entitled to receive as damages the difference between the value of the land immediately before the taking and the value of the land immediately after the taking, as affected by the taking, taking into consideration all of the uses to which the land might reasonably be put.\u201d\nOrder affirmed.",
