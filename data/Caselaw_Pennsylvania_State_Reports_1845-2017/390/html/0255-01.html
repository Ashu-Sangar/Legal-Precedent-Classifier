Martella as joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common”. These stocks which were claimed by William S. Martella as an inter vivos gift had a market value of approximately $14,361.25. The balance of Martella’s estate amounted to approximately $46,560.52. All of the stocks claimed by William had been purchased by decedent with his own money and were kept together with decedent’s other securities in a small metal box which decedent always had in his possession and to which he alone had access, with the exception that several months before his death he gave a key to the box to his daughter Natalie.</p>

The certificate was found in decedent’s safe deposit box made out in the name of Hilda S. Grossman or Theodore M. Grossman. The safe deposit box was leased by decedent but he had given his sister access thereto. Attached to the said stock certficate was a printed <em>power of attorney signed by Hilda </em>authorizing decedent to pledge the stock in question as collateral security for one of his bank loans.
