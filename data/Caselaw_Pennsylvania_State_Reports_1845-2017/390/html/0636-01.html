Oakley, 4226 Bristol Street, Pitts<a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>burgh. 7, inquired about rezoning of four acres which he purchased and on which he wishes to place a short range golf course, near Pleasant Hills Blvd. and Lebanon Church Road. He stated he would have access from Orchard Drive and Wolfe Drive, planned to erect a small tool house, and admission would be charged. The Commission will check the location.”</p>

At that time, the minutes record: “. . . It was moved by Chizmar, seconded by Novack, that an exception to the zoning ordinance be granted to Richard A. Oakley for short range golf course upon completion of proper forms and signature of authorized persons. Roll call vote: Chizmar — aye; Novack — aye; Greenlialgh — aye. Motion passed. . . .”</p>

The chairman replied that it had been permitted by a variance granted by the board. One of the board members pointed out that “. . . when the borough was zoned all vacant property was put in Residential A zoning, the highest classification, with the understanding it could be dropped when needs arise.” The chairman gave as reasons for the grant that other variances had been al<a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>lowed along the road on which this property was located, that the property had been for sale for years for development and they had never been able to develop it, and that “. . . in regard to the golf course, it was the impression of the Commission that it would be in a basin, the lights would be low, and it would not affect the adjacent property owners. . .</p>

We will not pass at all on these contentions, since it is clear that they are matters to be raised on the appeal itself and are not pertinent on the question of its timeliness now before this Court. It is pertinent, however, to note that whatever the terminology employed by the board, and whatever the legal effect of the board’s action, the practical effect of the board’s vote of June 13, 1956 and the order of June 28, 1956, was to authorize Oakley to proceed with the construction of his short range golf course, and was clearly a <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>decision from which appellants had a right of appeal under the zoning Act.</p>

    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[199,784,1146,930]]]'>Appellants, however, did not give notice to the board of any desire to be considered “parties”, nor did they in any way evidence to the board their “interest” in the case until August 21,1956, almost two months after the board’s order, when they first voiced their objections to the board. Prior to that time, there was little to distinguish them individually from any other members of the community. The zoning ordinance of the borough has no special provision for notice. Had this ordinance specified that notice be given to all property holders within a given area, or adjoining the lot upon which a variance or exception is sought, and had the board failed in this respect, then some basis for their objections might be comprehended. But here nothing-distinguished appellants from all the other property owners in the borough until they made their interest known to the board.</p>
