Pruner, of Centre County, Pennsylvania, devised real estate in trust to the boroughs of Tyrone and Bellefonte to establish a home for friendless children from the boroughs who were without parents. Whenever an excess of revenue became available for the support of such children, then qualified children from the City of Altoona were also to be admitted to the home. In the event that the boroughs for any reason could not carry out the provisions of the will the settlor provided that the property was to revert to his niece. Both boroughs by ordinances accepted the provisions of Primer’s will in 1905 and established a suitable home. In 1954, (for the third time),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the heirs of Pruner’s niece instituted proceedings in the Orphans’ Court of Centre County to terminate the trust. Notice of the action was served only upon the two boroughs. The heirs contended that the purposes of the trust could not be carried out and introduced evidence that no children had been cared for in the home during the past seven years. The orphans’ court held that the trust could be terminated only upon a showing that there were no children from the area designated by the settlor who could qualify for the home either at present or at any time in the future. Hence, the court concluded that even though there were no children currently in the home the petitioners’ evidence was insuf<a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>ficient to prove the failure of the trust. From the order of the court refusing the prayers of the petitioners the present appeal has been taken.</p>
