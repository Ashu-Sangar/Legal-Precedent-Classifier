Amid the sea of sand which surrounds them, this island of greenery with its palm trees and inevitable spring assures them that soon all will be well. However, as they eagerly stumble toivard the oasis, it never gets closer. It seems to retreat Avith the ever-receding horizon, first to cheer, then to tantalize, and finally to torment and torture the travelers. The sad awakening finally comes to the wayfarers that what they have been following was not an oasis but a mirage.</p>

And so, they appeal, and very often they find that what had seemed to them an oasis in the law books was only a mirage in the Sahara of jurisprudence. That is what the attorney for the appellant in this case learns today.</p>

Even after striking the plaintiff, the offending-ear travelled 145 feet before it could come to a stop. This Court has affirmed the lower Court which entered an involuntary nonsuit on the theory that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence because he was hit when he had taken only two steps into the street.</p>
    <p id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.6",145,[179,1660,1149,590]]]'>The facts are that on the night of December 6, 1953, James Rafferty.at about 11 o’clock, after bidding goodbye to friends with whom he had been visiting, started across Main Street in the city of Bethlehem to reach his domicile on the other side of the street. Visibility was poor because of a rain which was so heavy that one witness said: “It was raining cats and dogs.” Assuming that the density of the atmosphere was something less than that which would accompany a downpour of animals, the record reveals that visibility was still limited to about 80 feet.</p>

Assured that the coast was clear he started across the street. E. P. Sipple, whom he had been visiting that evening, testified that after the plaintiff Rafferty had committed himself to the street and had taken two steps he stopped to take a look and remained in this position for five or six seconds, when he was struck by an automobile' coming from his left.</p>
    <p id="b146-4" data-blocks='[["BL_146.4",146,[259,838,1154,1149]]]'>Since, in considering the lifting of a nonsuit, we are required to evaluate the record in the light most advantageous to the plaintiff, how can it be said that’ it is <em>inconceivable </em>on any reasonable hypothesis that a mind, desiring solely to reach a just and proper conclusion in accordance with the relevant governing principles of law, could conclude that the plaintiff was free of contributory negligence? What was the plaintiff to do? He stopped, he looked, and presumably he listened — and still he was hit; A witness testified that the defendant’s car was travelling 40 miles per hour in a zone where speed was limited to <em>25' </em>miles per hour. At 40 miles per hour, the defendant would be moving 60 to 75 feet per second. Thus, it is within the realm-of possibility that Avhen Mr. Rafferty looked to the left the car was not yet within the range Of vision since visibility, because of the curtain of rain, was limited to 80 feet, but when he turned to the right the car broke through the curtain of invisibility and bore down on the plaintiff at such speed that he was unable to get out of the way.</p>

Where he [the pedestrian] looks but does not see an approaching automobile, or, seeing one, erroneously misjudges its speed or distance, or for some other reason assumes he could avoid injury to himself, the question is usually one for the jury . . .’ The jury could have decided that plaintiff’s belief that he could cross the street in safety was reasonable; that he had the right to take into consideration the duty which the defendant owed him, as a pedestrian, to slow down and give a timely signal.” Is this authority also to become a mirage?</p>

It is possible from this testimony that after taking two steps into the street, the plaintiff heard noises of the defendant’s car’s approach or caught a glimpse of the approaching headlights and he remained fixed and immobile so that the motorist, seeing him, could avoid hitting him.</p>

There is no rulé in justice, <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>reason, and fair dealing that a plaintiff’s case must depend on his testimony alone so far as contributory negligence is concerned. Often the plaintiff does not know what happened. Paralyzing fright just before the impact or unconsciousness following the impact may so freeze or shake memory that he cannot with accuracy relate just what he did or did not do at the crucial moment. Lookers-on sufficiently removed from the point of the crash as to be insulated from emotional shock may thus be in an infinitely superior position to narrate the drama which enveloped the plaintiff in disaster.</p>
