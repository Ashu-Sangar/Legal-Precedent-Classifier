A determination in sueb regard is, in the first instance, within the province of the trial court whose decision will not be disturbed unless there is clear error of law or palpable abuse of discretion.” In determining the validity. of a refusal to enter judgment n.o.v. we examine the evidence to determine whether or not sufficient proof was adduced at the trial to justify the submission to the jury of each factual question: <em>Ashcraft v.

Hussey and </em>Co., <a href="/pa/359/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="359 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="473153" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0129-01">359 Pa. 129</a>, 134, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.2d%20170" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="58 A.2d 170">58 A. 2d 170</a>.

    <p id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[245,1061,1145,593]]]'>Bach, an elderly man, owned and occupied — at least, part of each year — a one story cottage at Manchester Beach on the shore of Lake Erie. This cottage was located in a somewhat isolated area in the immediate vicinity of which were several commercial fisheries. A hunting devotee, Bach owned various guns and other firearms including the Colt Woodsman .22 calibre automatic pistol which constitutes the focal point of this incident. When this pistol was not in use Bach kept it in a <em>loaded </em>condition in an unlocked dresser drawer in his unlocked bedroom.</p>
    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[242,1676,1145,656]],["BL_357.1",357,[217,339,1145,709]]]'>At approximately noon on July 23, 1953, Bach’s two young grandsons, Kuhns and Brugger, went fishing; upon their return at approximately 3:30 P.M. and during Bach’s absence, the boys entered their grandfather’s bedroom. Katrina Brugger — Brugger’s 2 year old sister — was then playing in the bedroom. In a spirit of play Brugger picked up a so-called “under and over” gun — a combination shotgun and rifle — and pointed-it at Kuhns. As he did this, Miss Pries, a great aunt of the boys, entered the bedroom and ordered Brugger to put away the gun which he did. A few minutes later Brugger went to his grandfather’s <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>dresser and found in the top left drawer thereof the Colt automatic pistol,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> previously mentioned, which was then loaded with a clip of cartridges resting in Its handle. In order to prepare this pistol for firing one draws back an upper slide forcing a cartridge into the firing chamber and the cartridge is then exploded by pulling the trigger. There was some testimony that this pistol at the time was mechanically defective and that, on occasion, if one held his finger on the trigger as he pulled back the slide, the pistol would discharge, without the added requirement of squeezing the trigger — a one-step, rather than a two-step procedure.</p>
    <p id="b357-4" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[213,1068,1147,663]]]'>According to Brugger<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> the shooting occurred in the following manner: “And I took it [the pistol] out, took it out of the holster, took it in my hand. I believe I had my finger on the trigger. And I pulled the slide back, and then the shot occurred.” The bullet, thus ejected, penetrated Kuhns’ body and perforated the spinal cord, paralyzing the entire lower portion of his body and destroying all voluntary control of his organs in that part of his body. His condition, as portrayed at trial, is such that he can no longer walk, requires constant care and medication and can never be gainfully employed.</p>

Brugger’s culpability or exculpability of actionable negligence depended upon a measurement of his conduct based on variable factors — his capacity and understanding based upon his age, intelligence, experience, etc.: a measurement properly to be made by a jury with the opportunity to evaluate his individual capacity to perceive danger. Concerning the capability of negligent conduct of a child between the ages of seven and fourteen it has been said: “Generally their conduct has been determined by a jury.

George Brugger says he doesn’t think he pointed it. The plaintiff said he did point it. Actually, the gun Avas pointed but it is a question of intention. <em>If George Brugger was mature enough to know better, and therefore negligent, then you may use that statute as evidence of negligence per sé, and hold him for it.

In this connection the language of Mr. Justice Gibson in <em>Sullivan v. Creed, </em>2 (Ir.)

However, this shooting did not take place at nighttime, but in the afternoon in a room where the presence of young grandchildren might be anticipated.

The language of Palles, C. B., is particularly apposite: “Lastly, I cannot think that it was beyond the province of a jury to hold that he [the father] might have foreseen that the taking of the gun by the boy would not have been an improbable result of his seeing it, in a place where there was not a parent or a person in authority to prevent him. I am, therefore, of opinion that a jury might well have found that the defendant ought, under the circumstances, to have foreseen that the boy might take possession of the gun. But even this is not necessary, for, in my opinion, the liability of the defendant would be the same if he ought to have foreseen that <em>any </em>boy, as distinguished from this particular boy, might have seen and handled the gun; and having regard to the place in which it was placed, I think it would have been wholly impossible to have withdrawn from the jury the question whether he ought to have so foreseen. This alone, however, would not be enough. Ought he then <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>to have foreseen that the boy <em>might </em>— -I do not say <em>would, </em>but that he <em>might </em>— -use the gun negligently?

However, no one individual can determine what would be done by this hypothetical creature [a reasonable man] under any given state of circumstances otherwise than by his own experience, and, as the experience of one man usually differs from that of another,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> our law wisely says that what is ‘reasonable’ is to be determined by the jury — that is, it is to be the resultant of the, to a certain extent, varying opinions of twelve different persons . . . .”</p>

The <em>Swanson </em>decision might be distinguished upon the ground that there was no evidence that the child obtained the revolver from the drawer— the place where the defendant kept it — on the day of the accident; however, the language of this decision indicates that the father’s act in keeping a loaded revolver in a place where its discovery and discharge by the child could be reasonably anticipated was not neg<a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>ligent and to that extent the decision in the <em>Stoanson </em>ease must be rejected.

In that case the defendant-father kept a .22 calibre repeating rifle in his home; on the evening in question the father and a 11 year old son were going hunting for rats; while the father performed some chores he placed the gun unattended behind the living room door; the son found the gun, took it to the car in readiness for the hunting trip and then proceeded to demonstrate the operation of the gun to a 7 year old child and the gun was discharged injuring the child. In upholding a verdict for plaintiffs, the Superior Court found that the defendant was negligent and such negligence was the natural and probable cause of the accident “since it was the natural and probable consequence of his negligent act in making the loaded gun accessible to his son.” It is particularly significant that the Court recognized that there “are few things as attractive to a young boy as a gun” and that, both before and since the Restatement of the Law of Torts, it was the accepted rule that a father’s conduct in permitting his child to have access to a dangerous instrumentality and the child’s me of it to the injury of another may be negligence depending on the circumstances.

In the trial judge’s charge this question was again discussed and the jury was warned that Kuhns’ and Brugger’s testimony were not to be considered; the trial judge then said: “It will be necessary for you to determine the liability as to him [Bach], from testimony given otherwise than by Albert G. Kuhns and George A. Brugger as to events during the lifetime of George W. Bach.” The instruction in this respect could not have been more clear. The liability of the Bach Estate was not dependent on the testimony of Kuhns and Brugger: as the Court below said in its Opinion: “Eliminating the testimony of Kuhns and Brugger under the direction of the court, the jury had more than sufficient facts and inferences from which to determine Bach’s responsibility and liability.

An indication of his total helplessness, and the reasonableness of the verdict, as reduced, can be gained from the following portion of the lower Court’s Opinion: <em>“It </em>is further contended that the court erred in permitting the jury to consider as an item of damages $2400.00, the cost of an ‘ell’ added to the plaintiff’s home for his convenience and to permit him by the installation thereof to do many things for himself which would otherwise require more constant attention at additional expense. The testimony was that this installation was made at cost and without profit to the contractor. Dr. Keck stated that with this room and the equipment in it the plaintiff could without help get in and out of his bath and with the installed crane and pulley also move into the bed and to a commode. Pictures in evidence show the real necessity and usefulness of the installation. Bathing was necessary to remove muscle spasms which frequently and unexpectedly occurred.

He had been previously warned by his grandfather not to touch any gun. We note, parenthetically, but importantly, that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania issues a hunting license to 12 year old boys to carry a loaded gun and go hunting if accompanied by an adult.

If, for example, a burglar or robber entered a <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>man’s home at night and he awoke, he would have to try to recall where he had hidden the key, get up in the dark, find it, unlock the drawer and finally get out the pistol, in order to defend himself or his property. By that time it would have been, in many instances, too late to defend himself or to capture the burglar. The present decision will also generate a tremendous number of law suits which will literally bankrupt young married couples who today have no maid or servant to aid them in tending- to the children, their home, the cooking, and everything connected with home life. A mother necessarily leaves carving knives, butcher knives and other similar articles attractive to young children on the kitchen table or around their home where the children and their young friends constantly play, while she finishes cooking the meat, arranges or waits on the table, or answers the telephone or the door. Inevitably a child will accidentally or negligently or unwittingly injure a playmate.

A familiar concrete example will more forcefully illustrate the majority’s unrealistic position. When a man is tried for murder, evidence of an entirely unrelated crime is admissible in order to aid the jury in determining, <em>not his gmlt, </em>but the penalty to be inflicted if their verdict is murder in the first degree. Every trial judge explains the limited purpose of such testimony; but nearly every trial and appellate court judge knows, and I venture to express my belief that every Judge in this Court believes that it is <em>in reality </em>impractical and <em>impossible </em>for the jury not to be influenced by such testimony in determining the guilt or <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>innocence of the defendant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">**</a> If the evidence of an <em>unrelated </em>crime is, as we all believe, sufficient to influence and prejudice the jury in determining criminal liability, i.e., guilt or innocence of murder, isn’t it clear that this jury could not fail to be unconsciously but unjustly influenced and prejudiced against Bach by the direct and the relatively very strong testimony proving Brugger’s negligence and incidentally, even though inadmissible against Bach, Bach’s negligence (if the majority’s theory is adopted)!</p>
    <p id="b383-4" data-blocks='[["BL_383.4",383,[214,888,1149,1163]]]'>The majority’s refusal of a new trial is untenable. The majority say that <em>if you eliminate the testimony of Kuhns and Brugger, </em>the jury still had sufficient, although barely sufficient facts (and inferences therefrom) to justify a verdict of negligence against Bach. That would be the proper test in considering, not a new trial, but an n.o.v. Nevertheless, in sustaining the lower Court’s refusal of a new trial, the majority now unwittingly apply the legal test for an n.o.v. instead of the test for a new trial. The basic question on this point is not whether, eliminating the inadmissible testimony of Kuhns and Brugger, there was barely sufficient evidence to fasten negligence upon Bach — the question is whether, when you take a scintilla of evidence of negligence and pile upon it (relatively) strong and direct <em>inadmissible </em>evidence of (under the majority’s theory) negligence, you can justify a failure to grant a severance and a new trial by applying the test which is applicable only in questions involving n.o.v., namely, were there sufficient facts and inferences therefrom to justify a verdict?</p>
