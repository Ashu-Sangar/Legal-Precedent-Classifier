In the case of the automobile owner as plaintiff and the Transportation Company defendant, a verdict was returned for the defendant. The Transportation Company filed motions for a new trial and for judgments n.o.v.; the n.o.v. motions were withdrawn at argument of the new trial motion.

Within the meaning of this canon, a lawyer represents conflicting interests when, in behalf of one client, it is his duty to contend for that which duty to another client requires him to oppose.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The full disclosure required by this canon contemplates that the possibly adverse effect of the conflict be fully explained by the attorney to the client to be affected and by him thoroughly understood.

But, manifestly, there are instances where the conflicts of interest are so critically adverse as not to admit of one attorney’s representing both sides. Such is the situation which this record presents. No one could conscionably contend that the same attorney may represent both the plaintiff and defendant in an adversary action. Yet, that is what is being done in this case. It was the attorney’s duty to protect the $10,-<a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>500 verdict of Ms plaintiff client against <em>the </em>additional defendant while it was his duty at the same time to relieve from liability the additional defendant whose representation the attorney had originally undertaken for the purpose of obtaining for him a recovery from the Transportation Company. Obviously, the attorney cannot serve the opposed interests of his two clients fully and faithfully. The ancient rule against one’s attempting to serve two masters interposes.</p>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.4",256,[277,843,1150,1150]]]'>The ethical conception, appropriate to the instant circumstances, was luminously expressed in <em>Bossler v. Wilson, </em>65 D. &amp; C. 164, 171 (1948), which involved a procedural situation materially akin to the present. It was there said: “Now as to the first stated fact necessitating a new trial as to <em>both </em>defendants, namely, the same attorney appearing for both the plaintiff and the additional defendant. It must be borne in mind that the original defendant was a plaintiff as to the additional defendant. No finding rendered under such circumstances can be allowed to stand and to mature into a judgment against the additional defendant, a verdict rendered in a trial wherein the attorney represented the plaintiff in the presentation of her case and the additional defendant in the presentation of his defense to the claims of both plaintiff and original defendant. The interests of these parties were adverse. No attorney can serve two opposing litigants any more so than one man can serve two masters. Upon this point the law of the Commonwealth is in harmony with Holy Writ”, citing in a footnote the scriptural references.</p>

In either event it accomplishes an injustice upon two persons who have fairly and squarely won a verdict in a trial which admittedly is free of error, and they should not therefore be compelled to face the shot and shell, worry, expense, suspense and agony of another courtroom battle.</p>

Leon Jedwabny and Peter Stachowicz were injured in an accident when the automobile in which they were riding as guests of Charles W. Atkinson, collided with a street car on 36th Street in Philadelphia. These persons and Atkinson brought a lawsuit against the Philadelphia Transportation Company, the passengers claiming damages for personal injuries and Atkinson seeking reimbursement for repairs made necessary to his car. The railways company denied liability and charged that Atkinson was either wholly or jointly responsible with the railway company for the happening of the accident. Accordingly it forced Atkinson into the case in the extra role of additional defendant.</p>
    <p id="b259-6" data-blocks='[["BL_259.5",259,[215,1468,1153,876]],["BL_260.1",260,[269,355,1146,311]]]'>On October 1, 1956, the cases came on for trial in Court of Common Pleas No. 6 of Philadelphia County. Attorney Herman Moskowitz represented Jedwabny, Stachowicz and Atkinson as Plaintiffs, and Atkinson in his capacity as additional defendant. Attorney James C. Welsh represented the Philadelphia Transportation Company. At the very outset of the trial, the trial Judge made the following announcement in open court: “In talking with counsel, it appears that Charles W. Atkinson, one of the original plaintiffs, has been drawn in by the defendant P.T.C. as an additional defendant. Therefore, in effect he appears on both sides. Counsel has explained that he has no separate counsel, for the reason that his claim is limited to property damage, to his automobile, and no personal injuries. That being so, since that would be all that <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>he would recover if he recovers anything, I approve this situation of appearing without separate counsel. But Mr. Moskowitz, since he was originally your client, I think you may properly look out for his interests.” To this Mr. Moskowitz replied: “Very well, Sir.”</p>
    <p id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[268,685,1148,757]]]'>It was Atkinson’s contention that he was free of negligence and that the accident was due entirely to the fault of the street car motorman. The plaintiffs Jedwabny and Stachowicz likewise maintained that the motorman alone caused the accident. Thus, it is to be noted at once that Atkinson’s position as additional defendant did not differ in any way from his position as plaintiff. Hence, his attorney, Mr. Moskowitz, did not in any way represent conflicting interests. It was Moskowitz’s contention throughout the trial that his clients suffered damages because of the sole negligence of the railway company. It was his contention all the time that Atkinson was in no way responsible for the accident.</p>

It often happens in our courts that an attorney files a suit against a certain defendant, and the defendant turns around and files a countersuit against the plaintiff. When such a case comes on for trial the attorney represents his client, both as plaintiff and as defendant. It would be absurd to assume that in such a situation the client should have two attorneys, one representing him as plaintiff and the other representing him as defendant.</p>

He found an incongruity in Mr. Moskowitz’s position, but unfortunately expressed that incongruity with an incongruity of his own.

But Atkinson does not want a new trial. He had had his day in court. The jury returned a verdict against him and he is willing to let matters rest as they are. There are some people in life who are willing to face realities and they experience no gratification in chasing the evanescent and elusive rainbow. Atkinson apparently finds more peace of mind in accepting the status quo than in making an effort which might result in an even greater loss. Accordingly he is satisfied not to have a new trial. It is for that reason that he did not make a motion for a new trial. It is for that reason that he is today opposed to a new trial. But the trial Judge, in his Olympian wisdom, declares that Atkinson has no right to be satisfied without a new trial and that, therefore, though the Heavens fall, Atkinson shall have a new trial!</p>

Atkinson can well afford not to have a blessing of this kind. The trial Judge’s magnanimity accomplishes the startling paradox that it injures the person it is intended to help and confers a boon on the party in the lawsuit that has no right to be helped, that is, the railway company. The railway company lost the trial on all counts and cannot point to a single error which would entitle it to a new trial. The trial Judge has admitted as much. He said in his opinion that the defendant “isn’t affected” by the “situation” which impelled him to order a new trial. The railway company “isn’t affected,” yet the trial Judge orders a new trial which will benefit <em>only </em>the railway company.</p>

Why should the trial Judge presume that Atkinson may not know his rights relative to a new trial? He has an “entirely reputable and high-minded lawyer”, the lawyer he engaged as far back as March 24, 1954, only a week- after he was brought into the case as an additional defendant. Mr. Moskowitz thus represented him for two and one-half years prior to the trial, throughout the trial, and after the trial. Atkinson never said that he was not satisfied with his attorney but the trial Judge makes bold to say that the client “may not even know his rights relative to a request for a new trial.” This is a reflection upon Atkinson’s attorney which is unwarranted, and unjustified and, since the trial Judge has already gone on record to the effect that he regards Mr. Moskowitz as “entirely reputable and high-minded,” the observation falls into the category of an abusive non sequitur.</p>

The allusion is interesting but the application is not apparent. Wherein did Mr. Moskowitz serve two masters? Prom the very beginning of the controversy he had but one master and but one adversary, and that alignment remained constant throughout the entire litigation. The original complaint in this case was filed by three plaintiffs: Leon Jedwabny, Peter Stachowicz, and Charles Atkinson. The complaint aimed at but one defendant, the Philadelphia Transportation Company. The Philadelphia Transportation Company, for reasons of its own (entirely proper, of course) forced Atkinson into the status of an additional defendant, but it did not and could not change his position that the railway company was solely responsible for the accident. Throughout the whole course of the litigation the issue remained as- it was at the very beginning, namely, Jedwabny, Stachowicz and Atkinson versus the Philadelphia. Transportation Company. No maneuvering by the defendant company could change that factual line-up. Prom the very beginning, and throughout the trial, the Philadelphia Transportation Company remained the opposition at which the three plaintiffs aimed, and against which they trained their guns. The action of <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>the railway company in making Atkinson an additional defendant did not transform liim from Moskowitz’s master into Moskowitz’s enemy.</p>
