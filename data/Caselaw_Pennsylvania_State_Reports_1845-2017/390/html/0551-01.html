The very nature of a “presumption” is to permit it to be rebutted by clear evidence to the contrary, and no evidence known to the judicial process is more lucid and scientifically certain than the blood grouping test when used to negative paternity.</p>

Mrs. Cairgle had been living apart from her husband since 1932, and continuously with another man since 1936. In 1939, 1942 and 1943 children were born to her which she surnamed after the man with whom she was then living. Subsequent to the husband’s death in 1948, she filed an amended claim with the Workmen’s Compensation Board for compensation for the three minor children as the legitimate children of Cairgle. She and some of her adult children testified that Cairgle had access to her during the time the minor children were born. The woman living with Cairgle from 1939 on denied this. The referee and the board disbelieved Mrs. Cairgle’s testimony in this regard. This Court pointed out, at p. 255, that: “. . . The old rule, that the presumption of legitimacy could not be overcome by any proof less than the absence of the husband beyond the seas immediately prior to and during the whole period of gestation, was so contrary to human experience that it was abandoned in Pennsylvania as early as 1814: . . .”, and although the evidence to rebut the presumption of legitimacy must still be “clear, direct convincing and unanswerable”, p. 256, it was concluded that the facts taken as a whole were sufficient to rebut the presumption. This presumption, which can be traced to Roman Law, was rebuttable even in the early common law by proof that the husband was beyond the King’s realm or by proving the husband’s impotence, and the presumption was further modified at an early date. As pointed out by Chief Justice Tilghman in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Shepherd, 6 Binney 283, 286 (1814) : “. . . In old times it seems to have been holden, that a child born of a married woman, whose husband was within the four seas which bounded the kingdom, could not be considered as illegitimate. This was unreasonable. When the husband <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>has access to his wife, it is right that no evidence, short of absolute impotence of the husband, should bastardize the issue. But where they live at a distance from each other, so that access is very improbable, the legitimacy of the child should be decided upon a consideration of all circumstances. The law was so laid down in Pendrell v. Pendrell in the fifth year of George the second, 2 Stra. 925, and has ever since been considered as settled.”</p>

It is to be reiterated that no test known to the law more adequately meets these requirements than the blood grouping tests with which this case is concerned. Testimony by witnesses as to access is always subject to close scrutiny because of the witness’s interest and the fallibility of human observation. Even medical testimony as to impoteney is often a matter of medical opinion; learned, but nonetheless opinion. These tests (and the Act provides for one or more, in case there is any question as to the validity of the results) are impartial, perfected to the limits of modern science, and unquestionable when used to prove nonpaternity.</p>

Thus if a child’s blood contains a particular blood characteristic not contained in the mother’s blood, then either the purported father must have the blood characteristic being tested for in his blood-stream, or he could not possibly have fathered the child.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Since maternity is rarely in issue, the blood grouping test has been found of inestimable value in excluding purported fathers from the liabilities of unwarranted legal parenthood. The tests have not been found of probative value to affirmatively show paternity because of the large class of possible fathers in each blood group. Their use in paternity cases, therefore, has been largely confined to negativing paternity, and the Act before us conforms to the prevailing usage in this regard. Thus if a defendant is unjustly accused of being the father of a child, he has a reasonably good chance of clearing himself via these blood tests, and as science <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>increases the number of reliable tests, so will the defendant’s chances of thereby proving nonpaternity.

Strictly speaking there is no “proceeding” in this Commonwealth “to <em>establish </em>paternity”, unless it may be said that a declaratory judgment or an adoption proceeding might have this effect. Paternity is “established” by a physical act according to the laws of nature, not by a judicial “proceeding” under the laws of this Commonwealth. There are many proceedings in which it is important to prove that one is in fact the father of a child, or that one is the child of a certain father, and for the purposes of that particular suit it may be found that the fact of paternity is “established”, but these are actions for support, criminal prosecutions, will contests, etc., not “proceedings to establish paternity”. The action for neglect to support a bastard child makes parentage pertinent to the inquiry in these words: “Whoever, being a parent, wilfully neglects or refuses . . . to . . . support . . .”. The action for desertion and nonsupport says: “If any . . . father . . . separates himself ... or neglects to maintain . . .”. In either case a man must be shown to be the father of the child before liability for its support will attach. In both cases “paternity is <em>relevant”, </em>and where “uncontroverted”, it is an <em>“issue” </em>to be determined at trial.

At the time the 1951 Act in question was before the General Assembly no legislation was needed in that regard; while in the paternity class, the Superior Court had twice ruled the courts powerless to compel blood grouping tests in such cases. It was in this paternity class that remedial legislation was in order, and in this class that the General Assembly acted.</p>

The blood grouping tests, it must be remembered, are generally admissible in paternity cases <em>only to prove non-parentage. </em>Maternity, by virtue of the simple physical facts, is almost never in question; it is as to paternity that doubt may arise. If maternity were in question in any case, these tests Avould be almost totally useless because the identity of at least one of the parents must be certain in order to make the tests usable, and the identity of the father is invariably more questionable than that of the mother. Therefore, the admissibility of blood grouping tests in regard to parentage is limited to tests which negative paternity.</p>

In not one of the first six examples cited<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_12" id="ref_footnote_2_12">12</a> is there a male defendant interested in proving his nonpaternity. Obviously an Act granting a power to “the defendant” to determine whether he “can be excluded as being the father of the child” does not apply to cases where there is no defendant who is trying to so prove. What persuasive effect these six illustrations have in the instant case where a defendant <em>is </em>trying to prove his nonpaternity is beyond this opinion-writer’s comprehension. If the six illustrations are cited merely to show that there are instances where this, or any statute for that matter, does not apply, then the examples may be multiplied ad infinitum. But certainly it does not persuade that a statute designed to aid defendants in establishing their nonpaternity “In any proceeding . . .”, should be inapplicable to the case at bar where a defendant is ashing the means wherewith he may prove his non-paternity.</p>

In one broad class of cases the use of blood grouping tests was being frustrated in Pennsylvania, and was not in accord with the modern nation-wide trend; that was in cases where it was alleged that the defendant was the father of a child, and in which he was unable to adduce concededly admissible and relevant evidence because of a refusal by the mother to submit several drops of her blood for a blood grouping test. The General Assembly, therefore, enacted a statute which would enable a defendant to procure blood grouping tests “to deter<a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>mine whether or not the defendant can be excluded as being the father of the child”. There is no language in the statute which limits the applicability of the Act to bastardy proceedings alone (actions for support of a bastard and fornication and bastardy prosecutions). The Act does not read: “In bastardy proceedings . . .” or “In actions for support of a bastard or prosecutions for fornication and bastardy . . .”. The Act reads: “In <em>any </em>proceeding . . .”. It was the inability to require a mother to submit herself and her child to a blood grouping test when paternity was in issue, which the Legislature sought to remedy by enacting the Act of May 24, 1951, and it is to this end that the statute should be interpreted.</p>

Robert J. and Adele O’Brien were married on October 24, 1938, and a daughter, Barbara, was born to them on June 25, 1939. In 1942 the husband and wife separated and have since lived apart. In 1946 a support order was entered against the husband for support of his wife and the daughter, Barbara. On February 11, 1947, five years after the husband and wife began living apart, a boy, Richard was born to Adele O’Brien. Three years later, on February 27, 1950, Adele and Robert O’Brien were divorced, and on March 6, 1950, the support order was modified so as to exclude the now-divorced wife and to increase the support for the daughter, Barbara. No mention was made in this order of the boy, Richard, although he was three years old at the time. Similarly, <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>pending the divorce action, the wife filed a petition for alimony pendente lite in which she noted that “. . . the defendant is endeavoring to support herself and their minor daughter, but said sum is grossly inadequate for that purpose.”- — no mention was made of the boy, Richard. Indeed it was not until October 28, 1954, four years after her divorce, seven and a half years after Richard was born, and twelve years after Adele stopped living with Robert J. O’Brien, that Adele O’Brien first moved to make the appellant, Robert J. O’Brien, liable for the support of the boy. The inference is inescapable that neither relatrix nor the appellant had hitherto considered Richard to be the son of Robert J. O’Brien. It was during the hearing in February, 1955 on this petition to include a then eight-year old boy in a support order for the first time, that the appellant moved that a blood grouping test be ■taken. It appears patent that this appellant is trying •to do just that which the law, in my opinion, allows him to do, namely, gather what evidence he can to enable him to escape liability for support of a child he believes he has not fathered.</p>

      <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[219,1709,1146,596]]]'> It may be noted that each of the illustrative cases cited by the majority in this connection were cases wherein the jurisdiction involved (including Pennsylvania in the cited <em>Baker v. Weiss </em>and <em>Spencer v. Spencer </em>decisions) permitted the blood grouping test to be used. And our discussion of <em>English, Krutsick </em>and <em>Morris </em>cases, supra, makes clear that in many civil cases in this Commonwealth, including several of those cited in illustration, a trial court may require the contestants or litigants to agree to a blood grouping test, or else refuse to proceed, thus generally encouraging a recalcitrant party in interest to submit to a blood grouping test without benefit of statute. This “judicial urging” certainly makes the statute unnecessary when the recalcitrant party is a plaintiff in a civil action or a contestant, in a will or intestacy proceeding.</p>

      <p id="b592-7" data-blocks='[["BL_592.7",592,[290,1953,1145,361]]]'> The Statutory Construction Act is also clear in stating: “In no case should the punctuation of a law coni rol or affect the intention of the Legislature in the enactment thereof.”, Art. IV, §53. Although it is not necessary to this view, it may be noted that juxtaposing the comma would make the proviso read: “In any proceeding, to establish paternity the court, on motion of the defendant, shall order the mother . . .”. Such punctuation would give the intended full play to the word “any”.</p>
