Curry, II, having become 21 years of age, established an irrevocable inter vivos trust with a corpus of $50,000 and named the First Blair County Bank, Tyrone, Pennsylvania, trustee. The trust instrument provided for the payment of income to the settlor for life, and thereafter, to his children until the youngest should reach 21, at which time the principal was to be paid in equal shares to the children and the issue of deceased children per stirpes. In default of surviving children or their issue, the fund ivas to be paid over to the settlor’s then heirs-at-law.</p>
    <p id="b127-7" data-blocks='[["BL_127.8",127,[186,1099,1148,653]]]'>In 1955 the settlor filed a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County to terminate the trust. Proceeding under Section 2(a) of the Estates Act of 1947, Act of April 24, 1947, P.L. 100, as amended, 20 P.S. §301.1 to §301.22 (Supp.), Curry alleged that a change in his status had caused the trust to become oppressive, and that the original purpose behind the creation of the trust could not be carried out. He prayed for partial termination of the trust and distribution of the corpus directly to him in the amount of $25,000. The record discloses that notice of the proceeding was given <em>only </em>to the trustee.</p>

The settlor obtained new counsel, and a petition for a rehearing was filed and granted. At the rehearing the settlor sought relief under the general equitable powers of the court and advanced two new theories; one, that the failure to include a revocation clause in the agreement was the result of mistake, and two, that the trust was testamentary in nature: The court affirmed its earlier decree, and refused to termi<a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>nate the trust either in whole or in part; hence, this appeal.</p>
