That Act (which has since been changed and restricted) provided, inter alia, in §2 that no pow<a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>er or interest, subject to a-spendthrift trust provision, or similar provision, may be released or disclaimed <em>except in favor of a remainderman. </em>The Act further provided, in §4, that “This act shall apply to releases and disclaimers <em>heretofore </em>and hereafter delivered.” The' Court, speaking through Justice Allen M. Stearns, held (a) that the portions of the Act of 1943 as amended, which applied to existing spendthrift trusts, was unconstitutional; and (b) that the refusal of a spendthrift trust income beneficiary to receive the <em>income </em>— after <em>accepting the gift </em>— does <em>not permit the parties or a Court to terminate the trust or accelerate the </em>remainder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">*</a> The reasons for the Court’s decision and the language and rationale of its opinion is particularly pertinent and controlling: “. . . When, prior to the Act, a beneficiary of income subject to spendthrift trust provisions accepted the gift, <em>this Court consistently held </em>that the beneficiary could not thereafter terminate the trust by releasing, renouncing and disclaiming his interest. The basis for this doctrine rested upon the ancient maxim: <em>Cujus est </em>dare, <em>ejus est dis</em>ponere: The bestower of a gift has the right to regulate its disposal. <em>Spendthrift trusts are sustained </em>not because of the law’s concern for the donee, but <em>because the testator or donor possessed an individual right of property in the execution of the trust. To permit a termination by agreement or release loould be an invasion of the donor’s property right. . . .</em>
