Sellers (appellees) deny any reduction in the financial condition and further argue that, even if there were any reduction, buyer has no right to reimbursement under the agreement unless such reduction resulted from occurrences outside the ordinary course of business or which caused a materially adverse change in the company’s financial condition. Actually the buyer’s position is that paragraph 9(a), supra, constituted a “warranty” on the sellers’ part that the financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries was not less favorable than <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>demonstrated by the financial statement of June 30, 1954 and, therefore, sellers having breached the warranty the buyer is entitled to claim the difference between the net worth on June 30, 1954 and September 17, 1954.

If A promises to deliver to B 1300 shares of A Co. stock but delivers only 1200 shares there is no injustice in allowing B to take the 1200 and sue for damages. But if A promises to deliver 1300 shares at a certain price, and B promises to pay a certain price for them, but the contract provides that B need not perform if the market price is lower than the sale price on the delivery date, there is no basis in law or justice in allowing B to take the shares and sue for the difference between sale price and market price.

The clear and <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>precise language of the promise in clause 5(g) prevents me from doing what buyer asks me to do, i.e., not to interpret, but to rewrite the contract in the light of the preliminary negotiations.”</p>
    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[238,559,1146,1212]]]'>The arbitrator concluded that to construe paragraph 9(a) as creative of a promise for the breach of which the buyer could recover damages — i.e., a warranty— would be inconsistent with paragraph 5(g). With this conclusion we are in full agreement. The sellers in paragraph 5(g) represented and warranted, inter alia, that there had not been any changes in the financial condition of the company or its subsidiaries other than changes in the ordinary course of business, none of which had been materially adverse and were changes required or permitted under the agreement. Paragraph 9(a) covers an entirely different situation in that it referred to such changes in the financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business which were materially adverse and not permitted under the agreement; if this situation arose the agreement specifically provided that the buyer was under no obligation to complete the purchase. A comparison of paragraph 5(g) with paragraph 9(a) clearly leads to this conclusion; to place upon paragraph 9(a) any other construction than that placed upon it by the arbitrator would amount to a redundancy.</p>

The language employed by the parties is manifestly indicative of that which was intended and the meaning of the agreement — free as it is of ambiguity and doubt — is to be determined by Avhat the agreement states. The parties carefully and scrupulously delineated between the sellers’ undertakings which were intended to be “warranties” and those Avhich were intended to be “conditions”. It is crystal clear that the <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>undertaking under paragraph 9(a) was simply a “condition” and not a “warranty” and once the buyer elected to accept this agreement tbe provisions of paragraph 9(a) ceased to be operative and the buyer had no right to recover any damages.</p>

        <em> </em>Lord Abinger in <em>Chanter v. Hopkins, </em>4 M. &amp; W. 399, has said: “Two things have been eoniounded together. A warranty is an express or implied statement of something which the party undertakes shall be part of a contract; and though part of the contract, yet collateral to the express object of it. But in many of the cases, some of which have been referred to, the circumstances of a party selling a particular thing by its proper description, has been called a warranty; and the breach of such contract, a breach of warranty ; but it would be better to distinguish such cases as a non-compliance with a contract which a party has engaged to fulfill; as, if a man offers to buy peas of another, and he sends him beans, he <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>does not perform his contract; but that is not a warranty; Hiero is no warranty that he should sell him peas; the contract is to sell peas, and if he sells him any thing else in their stead, it is a nonperformance of it. So, if a man were to order copper for sheathing ships — that is a particular copper, prepared in a particular manner ; if the seller sends him a different sort, in that ease ho does not comply with the contract; and though this may have been considered a warranty, and may have been ranged under the class of cases relating to warranties, yet, it is not properly so . .</p>
