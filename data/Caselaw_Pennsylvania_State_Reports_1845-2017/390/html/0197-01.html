L. 45, §1, 53 P.S. §4613 (Supp.) (Sterling Act) gives to the City of Philadelphia extensive authority to tax transactions, privileges, subjects and personal property within the limits of the City. In 1937 the City Council of Philadelphia, pursuant to this Act, passed an ordinance “imposing a stamp tax upon certain <em>transactions </em>relating to documents and obligations. . . .” (Emphasis throughout supplied). The ordinance provided that “Every person who makes, executes, issues, or delivers any document . . . shall be subject to pay for, and in respect to such document, or for and in respect of the vellum, parchment or paper upon which such docu<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>meat is written or printed, a tax at the rate of five (5) cents for each one hundred (100) dollars, or fraction thereof, of the value represented by such document.”</p>

On December 7, 1954, after the publication of the decision in the <em>City Stores Co. </em>case, Council amended the 1952 ordinance by providing that the <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>term “deliver”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> should include the presentation for re cording within the City of Philadelphia of any docu ment whereby title to or any interest in real property located within the city was transferred or conveyed, regardless of where the document was executed, delivered or accepted, thereby bringing the transaction of recording the deed within the scope of the taxing provision and apparently remedying the situation which the 1952 amendment had failed to cure.</p>

From this decision, the three taxpayers have taken the present appeals.</p>
    <p id="b222-4" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[262,448,1148,646]]]'>The first contention of the appellants is that the transaction taxed by the city in all three cases — presentation of a deed for recording — is already the subject of a fifty cent tax imposed by the Commonwealth under the Act of April 6, 1830, P. L. 272, 72 P.S. §3171. Section one of the Sterling Act prohibits the City of Philadelphia from taxing “a privilege, transaction, subject . . . or . . . personal property which is now . . . subject to a State tax or license fee.” Consequently, the appellants urge the Commonwealth’s tax operated to prohibit the city from imposing a similar tax.</p>
    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[259,1121,1148,540]]]'>We have already declared that both the 1937<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and the 1952<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> ordinances levied taxes on certain <em>transactions </em>pertaining to real estate. The 1954 amendatory ordinance in no way affected the type of tax imposed. It merely broadened the scope of the ordinance by expending the definition of “delivery” to include the presentation of a deed for recording. See <em>Philadelphia Appeal, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/383/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="383 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="1261950" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0428-01">383 Pa. at 433</a>. Hence, the Philadelphia ordinance continues to impose a “transaction” tax. Does the Act of 1830 impose a similar tax?</p>

The Act of 1830 does not levy a tax upon a <em>transaction </em>(presentation of a deed for recording) ; it does by its <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>terms levy a tax upon the <em>document </em>itself which is being recorded.</p>

Our view of the matter is also confirmed by the references to this Act in opinions of the Attorneys General<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> of the Commonwealth as imposing a tax upon documents. See, for example, Opinions of the Attorneys General, 10 Dauph. 113 (1907); 57 D. &amp; C. 335 (1946). See also <em>Gone v.

However, section eleven of the act provides: “Notwithstanding anything contained in any law to the contrary, the validity of any . . . ordinance . . . now or hereafter enacted or adopted by the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof, providing for or relating to the imposition, levy or collection of any tax, shall not be affected or impaired by anything contained in this act.” This saving clause permits the continued levying of the Philadelphia tax which otherwise clearly would have been prohibited by operation of the Sterling Act. The appellants urge, however, that the saving clause was enacted in violation of Article III, section 6, of the Pennsylvania Constitution and that, therefore, the Sterling Act remains effective to nullify the city tax.</p>

The incidental provisions of the statute need not be enumerated or indexed in the title if they are germane to the legislation as a whole. ‘Unless a substantive matter, entirely disconnected with the named legislation, is included within the folds of the bill, the act should not be declared as a violation of the Constitution by reason of its title offending Section 3 of Article III.’ ” <em>Gumpert’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/343/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="343 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1208376" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0405-01">343 Pa. 405</a>, 407, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.2d%20479" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="23 A.2d 479">23 A. 2d 479</a> (1942).</p>
