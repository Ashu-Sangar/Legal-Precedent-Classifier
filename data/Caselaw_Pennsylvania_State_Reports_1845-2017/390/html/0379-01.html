Sauder, was indicted for the murder of William (Will) Glasgow, and was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree with the recommendation of life imprisonment. Motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial were filed by counsel for the defendant. The motion for a new trial was not pressed at the time of argument in the Court below; nevertheless the motion <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>in arrest of judgment and the motion for a new trial were dismissed by the lower Court.</p>
    <p id="b401-4" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[195,447,1145,212]]]'>The very important question raised in this case is whether the evidence, which was solely circumstantial in character, was legally sufficient to support the defendant’s conviction of first degree murder.</p>
    <p id="b401-5" data-blocks='[["BL_401.5",401,[191,670,1148,663]]]'>On <em>May </em>3, 1855, the date of the murder, and for a considerable period of time prior thereto, the defendant and William Glasgow, the victim, lived together, admittedly without benefit of clergy. The evidence produced by the Commonwealth clearly established that William Glasgow was murdered by being struck over the head with some blunt instrument as he lay in his bed in the very small one room house occupied by the victim and the defendant. The murder weapon was never found. Dr. O’Donnell testified that any normal adult, male or female, could have inflicted the fatal wounds if the murder weapon was heavy enough.</p>
    <p id="b401-6" data-blocks='[["BL_401.6",401,[187,1344,1150,994]]]'>There was no eye witness of the murder and the exact time of death was unknown. According to the Commonwealth’s evidence, the defendant was the last person known to have seen Glasgow alive. At 8 p.m. on the evening of <em>May 3, </em>1855, a neighbor, Thomas Hardin, informed Glasgow that the defendant was called on Hardin’s telephone. Between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m. of that same evening, defendant left the house where she and the deceased lived. She then entered a taxicab which she had ordered and which had been parked in front of the residence. The taxi was driven by James T. Browning (called “Brownie” by the defendant). There was no evidence of any one else having seen the decedent until 2:00 p.m. the following day when he was found murdered by Hardin. Dr. Stahr, the Deputy Coroner, testified that in his opinion the death occurred somewhere between 8 and 20 hours before the body was discovered.</p>

      <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>Upon discovery of the murder, Hardin called the police. Upon arrival, the police found the victim’s body lying in a pool of blood on his (and defendant’s) bed. Clothing hanging on pegs near the bed and other objects near the bed were spattered with blood. The foot end of the bed and the ceiling of the room were similarly spattered with blood. According to State Policeman Charles Simmons (the investigator), the room in which he found the decedent was not disorderly and did not show any evidence of a struggle. He also found a poeketbook under the pillow on which decedent was lying. It contained a $100 bill and a $5 bill. Simmons was the first to interview the defendant on the evening of May 4, 1955, at which time the defendant was taken into custody. He testified, inter alia, as follows:</p>
    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[250,1226,1146,593]]]'>“. . . one of the first things she asked me she said, ‘Did you find Will’s pocket book, he had a $100.00 bill in it and a $5.00 bill in it.’ I said now where could it have been, and she said it was in his pocket book under his pillow, then I asked her several different questions, and then she turned to Brownie and said, ‘Don’t you remember my calling back and telling Will to put the cat in, didn’t you hear him answer me?’, and Brownie said ‘No’. Mrs. Sauders was fairly well intoxicated as she sat there, and we took her into custody at that time. . . .</p>
    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[248,1840,1145,489]],["BL_403.1",403,[205,340,1146,267]]]'>“(Q) Did you question her at a later date? (A) I questioned Mrs. Sauders a number of times. (Q) What, if anything, did she tell you happened? (A) Well, the money angle was one of the first things she talked about, and when questioned how she came about this money, she said Will had given her $238.00 to buy a monument for her son who had died, and that she had $5.00 of her own. Later when she figured out what she had spent of the money, she had spent the ma<a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>jority, and wliat we recovered, was approximately $438.00 which, is about $200.00 in excess of the amount she admitted he gave her. (Q) What did she say about that? (A) She was confused, and said she didn’t know what he gave her, she always had this answer.”</p>
    <p id="b403-4" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[205,620,1146,927]]]'>The Commonwealth proved that the clothing hanging near the body as well as a great number of other objects situated near the bed were spattered with a pattern of blood droplets. The most incriminating evidence, as far as the defendant is concerned, was that <em>bloodstains </em>were found on the dress and coat which she was wearing when she left the residence on the evening of May 3, 1955. Peter Striekler, an expert chemist, testified that the dress and coat worn by the defendant contained the same pattern of blood droplets as were found on other clothing in the vicinity of the victim, and that this blood was human blood. <em>The defendant admitted that the bloodstains found on the front left shoulder area of her dress and on the lower portion of the right sleeve and on the left front chest area of her coat were the blood of William Glasgow, the victim.</em>

First, she told Officer Simmons that the bloodstains on her dress were received when she accompanied Glasgow to a doctor’s office after Glasgow was involved in an automobile accident. When subsequently confronted with the falsity of her story of accompanying Glasgow to a doctor after an automobile accident which occurred several months prior to the murder, she then said that a man by the name of George Streeter had come to the house on the evening of <em>Mag S, </em>1955, and had struck Glasgow in the face thus causing his nose to bleed and the blood spattered on her dress and coat. Defendant did not produce the George Streeter whom she impli<a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>caled and could not identify a man named Streeter who was produced by the State Police. An exhaustive search by the State Police failed to disclose any other George Streeter such as described by the defendant. Officer Simmons further testified that the defendant stated at one time that she would take the entire blame for the crime because she hated to see “Brownie [James T. Browning, the taxicab driver] burn ... he is too young to die.”</p>
    <p id="b404-4" data-blocks='[["BL_404.4",404,[259,838,1147,991]]]'>The Hiltons and the Hardins lived in the (same) house which adjoins that of the victim. Thomas Hardin testified that after 10:00 p.m. on the evening of May 3, 1955, he failed to see anyone around the Glasgow or Sauder residence, and likewise failed to hear any noise therein. He reiterated this testimony with regard to two periods during the early morning hours of May 4 when he arose to feed his newly born baby. Ruth Ann Hilton, age 12, recalled seeing the arrival of the taxicab driven by Browning, and stated that she did not see anyone else around the victim’s residence that evening. Elizabeth Hilton testified that she did not hear or see any disturbance around the premises that night, and that her dog, who generally barked quite loudly when strangers approached, failed to bark on that evening. Leroy Hilton, the husband of Elizabeth Hilton, corroborated this testimony insofar as the dog was concerned.</p>

According to her testimony on direct examination, she last saw William Glasgow when leaving their room on <em>May S </em>to take the (Browning) taxicab (between 9:30 and 10 :Q0 p.m.). Glasgow had been lying in bed, so defendant testified, before Streeter’s arrival. Defendant testified, inter alia, as follows:</p>

At this time Glasgow had on his pajamas tvith a pair of pants pulled over top of them. She then left their home between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m. and got in the (Browning) taxicab. Defendant then related a night and day of carousing in various bars and cafes in the City and County of Lancaster, having been driven there by Browning who corroborated her testimony in this respect. During the course of this carousing, defendant spent a considerable sum of money, admittedly the money of the victim. She testified that she spent part of the money for a new dress. On a later occasion, when asked about this dress by Officer Simmons, defendant replied (according to Officer Simmons): “I knew Will was dead and I wanted to go to the funeral home.” The evidence shows that the defendant was not apprised of the death of Glasgow by outside sources until <em>after </em>she had purchased the dress.</p>

On cross-examination, the defendant was confronted with the written statement which, incidentally, was at variance with several statements that she had made on direct examination.

Browning who, under her direction and instructions, took her <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>to numerous bars and cafes in Lancaster where she consumed considerable quantities of alcoholic beverages; that she displayed on one occasion three $100 bills and a $50 bill; that she paid for the expensive taxi hire and gave Browning money to buy drinks; that at 4:30 in the morning he left her at an address on South Water Street; that several hours later he called for her and drove her around town; that she bought and changed into a new dress; that she went to a cemetery memorial dealer and there purchased for $115 a tombstone to be placed over the grave of her son; that sometime during the day she said that “Will [Glasgow] had hemorrhaged but I don’t think he committed suicide”; that she went to Groff’s Funeral Home to which Glasgow’s body had been taken and while there was arrested by the State Police. A chemist, member of the State Police, testified that some stains and spots on Mrs. Sauders’ dress and coat were dried human blood. When questioned about these spots, Mrs. Sauders told two different stories: one, that her dress had been spotted from injuries sustained by Glasgow in an automobile accident and, two, that her dress had been stained as a result of a severe nosebleed which Glasgow suffered Avhen a George Streeter had struck GlasgOAV with his fist. When questioned about the money she had in her possession, Mrs. Sauders said that GlasgOAV had given her $238 to buy a grave marker for her son. While being questioned on the subject of money she asked the police if they had not found $105 in Glasgow’s pocketbook.

All one can say is that it is a house — presumably. The money found on the defendant, the spots on her dress, and the conflicting stories about the spots all envelop the defendant in a mist and fog of supposed guilt, but not one piece of evidence, or all taken together, cause her to stand out clearly and distinctly as the person who felled Glasgow in a foul and bloody murder.</p>

But neither of these admissions (contradictory to each other) would prove that she was present when Glasgow was killed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> Glasgow could have been murdered by someone else, with or without Mrs. Sauders’ knowledge, and some of his blood attach to her dress without her being present at the time of the killing. Since the pictures and descriptions of the body and bed reveal that Glasgow lost large quantities of blood, it is impossible to assume that Mrs. Sauder could have wielded an instrument which broke the dike of Glasgow’s life fluid and then have emerged from the gory flood with only a slight spattering of droplets on her clothing. The house in which Glasgow and Sauders lived was not much better than a shack and it had no running water facilities. The State Police investigation uncovered no evidence that garments had been washed in the severely limited time within which such laundering could have been accomplished, namely, between 8 p.m., when Glasgow was seen by Hardin alive and 9:30 when Mrs. Sauders left the habitation. It is to be observed further that the spattering of blood droplets on Mrs. Sauders’ dress was so inconspicuous that though she wore the dress the entire evening and night as she proceeded from one drinking place to another no witness was produced to say he had observed anything suspicious about her clothing. Even Browning, the cab driver, noticed no blood spots on her garments although he did say that after they had been in numerous taverns and cafes, at one of which places Mrs. Sauders drank six to eight glasses of beer, she made the remark that her dress had been soiled by beer and for that reason she wished <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>to change it. But this occurred at least 15 hours after she had left Glasgow’s house.</p>

While the hypothesis that Mrs. Sauders murdered Glasgow is not to be excluded, the law should not permit her conviction to stand on the basis of the bare possibility she might have killed Glasgow. If possibility and accessibility are to be the criteria for establishing guilt, then all the people living in the neighborhood of the Glasgow house could be and Avould be suspect. Between the time that Glasgow was last seen alive by Harden and the time he was discovered dead, 18 hours expired, certainly a long enough time for the murder to have been committed without Mrs. Sauders’ participation or knowledge.</p>

Although the amount of money in Mrs. Sanders’ possession at the time of her arrest was considerable for one in her apparent station of life, it seems that she was given to spending freely even before the fatal night of May 3-4, 1955.

Moreover, a short time after making the contradictory statements she had to be taken to the hospital for an emergency appendicitis operation.

Although neighbors testified they heard no unusual noises during the night after Mrs. Sauders left Glasgow’s house, neither did they hear any unusual noises when, according to the Commonwealth, Mrs. Sauders was committing the crime. There was no evidence that Glasgow was dead when Mrs. Sauders left his house, and some 18 hours were to pass before he was discovered dead, in all of which time the <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>murder could have been committed by someone other than Mrs. Sauders.</p>

Instead of crossing over on a bridge, the theory of prosecution leaps from stones of suspicion to stones of surmise, and from stones of assumption to stones of argumentation. This is not enough to take any person to a penitentiary for life. It is not enough to sustain any conviction under our salutary system which specifically states that guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. The doubts in this case are not only reasonable. They envelop the entire prosecution and conviction in clouds of uncertainty and indecision. Such a conviction cannot and should not stand.</p>
