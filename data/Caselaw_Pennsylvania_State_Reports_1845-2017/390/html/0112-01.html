On the day of the accident he had completed his day’s work, left the third floor, walked down to the street, walked out of the building through an exit door on the 32nd Street side of the building and walked south on the public sidewalk on 32nd Street to go to his home. Eberle slipped and fell on a driveway which crossed the public sidewalk and led to a loading door of the building which was used by the Union Dental Company. The “driveway” in question is a brick paved section of the public sidewalk on the west side of 32nd Street. The loading door abutting this portion of the sidewalk was marked with a sign: “Union Dental Company Dasher Manufacturing Company Shipping and Deceiving.”</p>

When he stepped on to the brick driveway the reciprocal obligations of claimant and the employer, each to the other, had been satisfied for the day. <em>When injured, claimant was no more than a member of the public using the sidewalk as a pedestrian </em>— the purpose for which this part of the street had been dedicated for public use.

He made claim for Workmen’s Compensation, which was allowed by the Referee, affirmed by the Workmen’s Compensation Board, affirmed by the Court of Common Pleas, disallowed by the Superior Court, and disallowed by the Majority of this Court.</p>

In the <em>Ganassi, </em>case the Superior- Court said that the claimant “was injured in using the only means of egress from appellant’s mine madé available to him”. In the case at bar the Majority says that Eberle could have turned to the north instead of to the south to catch the elevated.. But travelling north would not have taken him to the elevated— -without girding the globe. There was no eason under the sun for Eberle to have gone in the opposite direction from the one he needed to follow, in order to get home. It isn’t as if there was a barrier in the sidewalk on his right, it isn’t as if a visible danger presented itself in his going to the right.

One does not leave one’s employment with the precision, speed, and finality of a cannon shot — especially a 70-year old man. There are floors to cross, stairs to descend, sidewalks to be traversed before one is finally on the full tide of his return home, and until that home journey is definitively in train, the employee travels under the protecting canopy of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. Incontrovertibly is this true when the mishap which gives rise to the claim for compensation actually occurs on the <em>defendant’s premises, </em>as is the fact here.</p>
    <p id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[240,1093,1150,703]]]'>To deny compensation in this case is to play checkers with the Workmen’s Compensation Act. If the driveway had had a few feet greater width, taking its northern border to the foot of the stairs so that Eberle would have been continuously on his employer’s premises, even with the accident still happening at the same place, compensation would undoubtedly have been payable. However, since Eberle had to walk 15 feet in order .to get back on the defendant’s premises, once he had left them at the foot of the stairs, this Court holds that in those few steps that the employee walked, he walked out of the tent of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. I don’t agree.</p>

If a liberal construction of the Workmen’s Compensation Act can stretch one-third of a mile when it deals with an employee on his way to work, what paralyzes its <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>elasticity when only 15 feet are involved, and the employee, is on his way home?</p>

He is considered to be within the course of his employment if <em>on the ‘premises’ </em>where he is employed a reasonable length of time before the hour fixed to commence his duties.” In the case at bar Eberle could not have been more than a minute or two away from his work bench when he was injured.</p>

Thus, if an employee, after leaving the factory in which he is employed, crosses a State highway and is struck on the other side of the highway, still on premises of the employer, it cannot be doubted that, under the rule that he must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to leave his employer’s premises, compensation would be payable. But in this case, the Majority holds that as soon as Eberle’s feet touched the sidewalk pavement, he was like one banished from Eden and could never again return to the premises of his employer, even only 15 feet away.</p>

An examination of that case shows that while it is a stout enough pillar to hold up the principle there proclaimed, it can only be a weak and feeble reed to support the cumbersome weight the Majority places on it in this case. In the <em>Lints </em>case the claimant had attended a Christmas party given by her employer in the factory building in which she was employed. She left the party, not intending to return. Later she changed her mind and started back to the building, but got lost in a part of the plant which she had never “been around” before. She fell on property owned and under the control of Pennsylvania Ribbon Manufacturers, Inc., not the Delaware Ribbon Manufacturers, her employer. The Superior Court denied compensation, saying: “The most that can be said for claimant is that she was en route to ‘work’ when she opened the boiler room doors and fell into the building. <em>She had not as yet reached the employer’s premises.”</em>

In the very <em>Lints </em>case the Superior Court laid down the law, citing authorities, which should be controlling here, namely: “Where an entrance or exit is <em>provided </em>by the employer for his employes (citing cases); or where such exit or entrance is <em>available and intended for use </em>(citing case); or is <em>the usual means of ingress and egress </em>within the landlord’s building, to the tenant-employer’s place of business (citing case); or where the employe must traverse property of the employer or the employer’s landlord or employer to reach or leave work (citing case); then such entrance or exit, whether located on property under the control of the employer or not, is a part of the employer’s <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>‘premises.’” (Italics in original Opinion). Eberle was traversing property of the employer when injured.</p>
