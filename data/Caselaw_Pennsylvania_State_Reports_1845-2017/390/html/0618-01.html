The instrument further recited that the employe would keep confidential the names and addresses of Morgan’s customers, and that he would not cause any customers to withhold their patronage. The consideration stated in the agreement for these employe covenants was the taking of employment with Morgan. Additionally, the contract contained the language: “I intend to be legally bound hereby.” When each employe signed the agreement he was promised, and did receive, various benefits incident to employment with Morgan including an insurance policy, a raise in wages and additional customers.</p>

Two other salesmen, John Martucci and Dan Spiller, signed the restrictive agreement and continued as employes of Morgan. On May 22, Martucci left Morgan to go with Variety, and on July 30, 1955, Dan Spiller did likewise. They then began to solicit and serve the customers of Morgan on their former routes on behalf of Variety. Other collector-salesmen, all of whom had been former employes of Morgan, were hired by Variety and actively solicited the patronage of Morgan’s customers.</p>

The •chancellor also concluded that a conspiracy had not been proven, and that the defendants had neither misled customers, misused confidential information, nor enticed away any of Morgan’s employes. Exceptions to this adjudication and to the decree nisi which followed it were filed. The court en banc, (including the chancellor), reversed unanimously, and entered a decree enjoining defendants Martucci and Dan Spiller for one year from the termination of their employment with the plaintiff from divulging the names and soliciting the patronage of customers who became known to. them by reason of their former employment. The decree further enjoined the two defendants from attempting to divert any of plaintiff’s business and from persuading plaintiff’s customers to refrain from continuing their patronage. All of the defendants individually and trading as Variety Sales Corporation were prohibited from using customer lists, soliciting customers, persuading customers not to patronize, attempting to divert business, enticing employes, and using deceptively similar eards and records to the detriment of Morgan. Finally, all defendants were directed to account for profits obtained as a result of ••the <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>violations of the agreement and the solicitation of plaintiffs customers.

An employe may receive specialized training and skills, and learn the carefully guarded methods of doing business which are the trade secrets of a particular enterprise.

They are enforced by the courts as reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer. See <em>Arthur Murray Dance Studios, Inc. v.

A general cove<a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>nant not to compete, however, imposes a greater hardship upon an employe than upon a seller of a business. An employe is prevented from practicing his trade or skill, or from utilizing his experience in the particular type of work with which he is familiar. I-Ie may encounter difficulty in transferring his particular experience and training to another line of work, and hence his ability to earn a livelihood is seriously impaired. Further, the employe will usually have few resources in reserve to fall back upon, and he may find it difficult to uproot himself and his family in order to move to a location beyond the area of potential competition with his former employer. Contrarywise, the mobility of capital permits the businessman to utilize his funds in other localities and in other industries. In view of this greater hardship imposed upon an employe, general covenants not to compete which are ancillary to employment will be subjected to a more, stringent test of reasonableness than that which is applied to such restrictive covenants ancillary to the sale of a business.

Although the defendants obtained confidential customer information, Morgan was adequately protected by the decree which enjoined disclosure and solicitation, and so prevented the former employes from benefiting from their customer contacts and knowledge. Consequently, under these facts we find that the general covenants not to compete are not' reasonably necessary for the protection of Morgan and constitute an <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>undue hardship upon its former employes. It follows, therefore, that these particular covenants contained in the restrictive agreements are enforcible against Martucci and Dan Spiller only to the extent of preventing them from competing for the patronage of Morgan’s existing customers and their duty to account for breach of these covenants will be limited accordingly.

The chancellor had concluded that there had been no illegal enticement of plaintiff’s employes, although he found as a fact that all the employes of the defendant Variety Corporation were former employes of plaintiff. In <em>Belmont Laboratories Inc. v. Heist, </em><a href="/pa/300/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="300 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="1125964" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0542-01">300 Pa. 542</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.%2015" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="151 A. 15">151 Atl. 15</a> (1930), we said that in those cases which depend in large degree upon the credibility of witnesses whom the chancellor saw and heard, and whose testimony for that reason he is best able to weigh, the court en banc can properly disregard his findings only in a clear case, and then by putting upon the record its reasons for so doing. In the <em>Belmont </em>case, however, the chancellor who made the original finding did not sit on the court en banc when it made its determination. In the present case the court en banc which reversed the finding as to illegal enticement included the chancellor. “It is the final conclusion of the chancellor which is to be considered. Frequently he modifies the facts as first declared, where mistake is called to his attention, and the last statement made is to be treated as his deliberate conclusion.” <em>Piacentino v.

Therefore, the failure on the part of the plaintiffs to object to the admission of the evidence tending to show lack of consideration did not constitute a waiver of objection upon appeal. However, defendants’ evidence showing that, the restrictive agreement was signed one month after entering into the employment relationship- was xn'operly received even though it contradicted statements <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>contained in the restrictive agreement, because the Parol Evidence Rule does not prevent the denial of the truth of <em>statements of facts </em>contained in a written agreement, Restatement, Contracts, §82 (1932) ; 1 Williston, Contracts, §§115(A), 115(B) (Rev. ed. 1937) ; 20 Am.

Plaintiff’s evidence showing additional consideration in <em>order to uphold the validity of the agreement </em>also did not violate the Parol Evidence Rule, and was therefore properly admitted. However, since the validity of the covenant not to compete turns on the question of relationship to a principal transaction rather than .the question of sufficiency of consideration, the evidence is not helpful to plaintiff’s case.</p>
