The petition contained an allegation, couched in the language of §1107 (A) (4) of the statute, supra, that the directors were deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, that the stockholders were unable to break this deadlock, that irreparable damage and injury were being suffered by <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>the corporation, and such damage and injury would continue and be of such a character and nature as to destroy the stockholders’ equity and be injurious to the creditors.</p>

Pursuant to this order, on November 15, 1956, an exhaustive and comprehensive report was filed in which the temporary co-receivers reviewed the nature, history and problems of the business and concluded with the recommendation, buttressed with full reasons therefor, that a liquidating receiver should be appointed whose primary duty should be to liquidate the corporate assets.</p>

At this hearing, on November 21, 1956, appellee Robinson introduced testimony: (1) that neither the Robin-sons nor the Formans were able to control the corporation because each family owned 50% of the stock; (2) that there had been a serious dispute existent for several months between Richard S. Robinson and M. Alexander Forman which had arisen because of Mr. Forman’s insistence that the corporation’s fleet of motor vehicles should be reduced; (3) that as a result of this dispute Mr. Forman, who served as secretary-<a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>treasurer of the corporation, on one occasion had refused to sign the payroll checks of the corporation and that this unexplained refusal had resulted in the employees being unpaid at the proper time, thereby revealing to them the dissension existent in the management and affecting their morale; (4) that on another occasion Mr. Forman had refused to sign a check for approximately $29,000 (payable to the bank on which the corporation depended for its financing) on the date when the payment became due and that he persisted in this refusal until Mr. Robinson was forced to reveal to the bank the dispute within the corporation’s management and the inability of the stockholders (who comprise the entire management) to resolve this dispute.</p>

Mr. Miller: (counsel for the temporary receivers) Yes, Sir. Mr. Jones: (counsel for the appellants) That is right. At the last hearing I made representation to the Court that I desired to file certain exceptions. Events after that — since then we have worked two business days, Friday and <em>Monday </em>— Events <em>after that had led me and my client to agree and say to the Court that we should do nothing further hut agree to the Court appointing a permanent receiver and move on from that point, </em>your Honor. (Emphasis supplied) Mr. Miller: If it pleases <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>your Honor, although the term ‘permanent receiver’ is used, we speak of a ‘liquidating receiver’ within the purview of the Business Corporation Act of 1933, sections 1107 and 1108. The Court: Oh, I see. That is the correct term, is it, ‘liquidating receiver’, rather than ‘permanent receiver’? Mr. Miller: That is right.</p>
    <p id="b185-3" data-blocks='[["BL_185.4",185,[192,736,1149,766]]]'>It must be noted, parenthetically, that nowhere during the course of this discussion did appellants offer any objection whatsoever to what was being said or being done. The record could not possibly be any more clear on this point. Appellants consented to the appointment of what their counsel incorrectly described as a “permanent” receiver. Appellees immediately corrected this mistake, asserting that the correct term was “liquidating receiver” and the Court took immediate cognizance of the correction. <em>Appellants did not object or, in fact, say anything at all which would have the effect of qualifying their consent. </em>It can only be assumed, from the face of the record, that appellants consented to the appointment of a liquidating receiver.</p>
    <p id="b185-4" data-blocks='[["BL_185.5",185,[188,1514,1151,823]],["BL_186.1",186,[277,354,1146,488]]]'>This conclusion becomes even more inescapable in view of what was said shortly thereafter, at the conclusion of the hearing: “The Court: I will appoint Mr. Apfel as liquidating receiver. As you know, the Court may appoint a receiver on its own motion and eliminate one suggested by the original petitioner. This is no reflection whatsoever on Mr. Cohen, for whom I have high regard. It is just that at this point there is no necessity for two receivers and we want to keep the expense down. Mr. Miller: I appreciate that. The Court: I see Mr. Cohen is in court and I know that he will understand exactly what I am stating, that this is in no sense any criticism of him or any reflection on him. Mr. Irwin Apfel is appointed sole liquidating receiver. The bond heretofore required may be <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>continued until further order of the Court. There is no use increasing the amount of the bond unless the necessities of the situation require it. Mr. Miller: Very-good, sir. The Court: Whatever is to be done is to be done with the knowledge of all the parties concerned and nothing will be approved by the Court without ample notice and hearing. I hope that the parties will find a way of getting the most they can from this very profitable business.”</p>
    <p id="b186-4" data-blocks='[["BL_186.4",186,[275,854,1148,531]]]'>Again, appellants neither objected nor gave any indication whatever that they intended to qualify their consent to the appointment of a receiver. It should be noted, however, that they did not even attempt to present the case which they had stated, on November 21, 1956, that they needed additional time to prepare. The conclusion is unavoidable in view of this record that appellants’ claim they consented only to the appointment of a permanent, and not a liquidating receiver is untenable.</p>

Under these circumstances we have no alternative but to hold that at the continued hearing which occurred on November 28, 1956, appellants consented to the appointment of a liquidating receiver for the corporation.</p>

On <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>December 7, 1956 the appellants filed a motion to quash, dismiss and set aside the proceedings which motion the court below denied by a written opinion and order dated December 19, 1956.

    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[199,830,1148,658]]]'>On this appeal appellants argue: (1) that there was insufficient evidence to support the averments of the petition that there was a deadlock in the management and that the corporation was suffering irreparable injury; (2) that the court below appointed a receiver without an opportunity being afforded to answer the petition before the receiver took over, that the Court never made findings of fact or law as such, and that the entire proceedings lacked due process and are consequently void; (3) that the court below lost all further jurisdiction when the appeal was taken and certiorari lodged in that court.</p>
    <p id="b187-5" data-blocks='[["BL_187.6",187,[199,1507,1149,765]]]'>We deem it wholly unnecessary to considér the merits of the appellants’ first two assumptions in view of the fact that they, as has been explained, expressly consented to the appointment of the liquidating receiver. Having once given such consent in open court, thereby foreclosing the need for any further testimony to show the deadlock and irreparable injury, appellants will not now be heard to deny the necessity for the receiver’s appointment. Nor can appellants be heard to assert that they were denied due process of law when, in a hearing held for the express purpose of affording due process, they consented to the appointment of the receiver and thus, impliedly if not expressly, admitted the <em>necessity for </em>Such an appointment.</p>
