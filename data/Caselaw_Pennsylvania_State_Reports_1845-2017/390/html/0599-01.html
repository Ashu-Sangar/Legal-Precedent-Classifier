This notice' further stated that a tax was due the Commonwealth in the amount of $2,338.34 and the attorney’s attention was directed to the statutory provision providing for an appeal therefrom. The Commonwealth introduced in evidence the original tax record card in the Register of Wills’ office (prepared after an appraisal is final and after the forms of notice are sent out), which indicates the filing of the inheritance tax appraisement on July 26, 1952 and the mailing of notices on August 18, 1952. The record also discloses a letter addressed by the attorney for the estate to the “State Inheritance Tax Appraiser for Mercer County” in which the attorney, acknowledging receipt of a copy of a letter which the tax appraiser had received from Harrisburg wherein the Commonwealth proposed to increase the appraisal, not only specifically referred to the proposed appraisals on each property, but also inquired: “If there has been a formal reappraisal made of these properties, please advise me, as we will file an appeal from the suggested amount. If the appraisal is a statement in a tentative form then I would like to submit the following information.” In the same letter the attorney inquired: “Please let me know when the appraisal was finally made so that we may file the necessary appeal.” In reply to this letter the tax appraiser on September 10, 1952 advised the attorney, in writing, as follows: “In reply to your letter of August 23rd, concerning the reappraisal of properties in the above estate <em>the reappraisal is definite and final as far as this Office is concerned” </em>(Emphasis supplied) An examination of this correspond<a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>ence clearly indicates tliat the áttorney for the estate was unequivocally advised of the finality of the appraisement on September 10, 1952.</p>
