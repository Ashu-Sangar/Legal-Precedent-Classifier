The auditor awarded the share of the incompetent nephew to the testamentary trustee rather than to the incompetent’s committee.

By what law, then, could the appointment of a committee take this trust out of the hands in which the testator had placed it, and vest it in one who can exercise no greater or other right than could, were he sane, be exercised by the lunatic himself? The estate was devised to the trustees qua executors; ....

The trustee has had several years experience in caring for the needs and attending to the business affairs of settlor. Undoubtedly the trustees are better qualified, because of their experience in handling the affairs of the settlor and of the powers given them under the trust agreement, to administer the estate than the guardian, and administration by the trustees would result in a saving to the incompetent’s estate.
