The Township Authority, intending to enlarge its water works by constructing additional water lines, a filtration plant and a dam, selected Burke as its engineer for the project. Under the contract Burke agreed to furnish and perform certain specified professional engineering services in connection with the project for which the Township Authority agreed to pay him for such services “Six (6%) per Cent of the cost of the construction of the entire water system . . . .” The total estimated cost of such construction was $760,-000.</p>

When the County Authority exacted from the Township and the Township Authority a promise to pay reasonable fees and expenses of the consulting engineers up to $20,000 and when the Township exacted from the County Authority the promise to pay engineering fees in excess of $20,000, did the parties intend thereby to confer a benefit upon Burke? Taking into consideration the circumstances under which this contract was made and its terms it is obvious that the parties had no intent to confer a benefit upon Burke. The contract simply allocates between the respective parties the claims or obligations to be paid by each, respectively, once liability for their payment has been established either by way of litigation or settlement.
