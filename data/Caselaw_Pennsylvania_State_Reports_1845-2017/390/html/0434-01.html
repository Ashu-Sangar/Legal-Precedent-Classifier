On May 25, 1951, they arrived in Flagstaff, Arizona. Their cars were broken into on that night or the early morning of May 26th and an income tax refund check in the sum of $900 payable to F. G. Stein and I. Stein was stolen. They reported the theft to the Flagstaff police, and then proceeded to Los Angeles. Two or three days later they arrived in California, and on May 30, 1951, Dronsfield registered at the Surf Motel, Long Beach, California, where he remained overnight. On <em>June 2, 1951, </em>both Dronsfield and Stein reported for work at the Los Angeles office of Holland Furnace Company. On that day Dronsfield entered into a written salesman contract with the Company.</p>

Starr in Winslow, Arizona, purchased a wedding ring for $600 and paid for it with the above mentioned income tax refund check, and received from Starr his check for the difference between the cost of the ring and the amount of the check. Eight months thereafter, Starr’s bank advised him that the Stein check had been stolen and that he would have to make it good. Starr refused to reimburse the bank.</p>

Starr described the man who cashed the check as being from 28 to 32 years of age, 6 feet tall, weighing 190 lbs. and having dark brown hair. The United States Agent found Dronsfield to be about 5 ft. 7 iu. tall; weight approximately 165 lbs.; hair light brown. He also reported that there was no <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>similarity between Dronsfield’s handwriting and the endorsement on the check. Moreover, on <em>December IS, 1952, </em>and again on <em>August 20, 1953, </em>Starr was shown by the United States Agent four pictures of Dronsfield, and on both occasions Starr said that Dronsfield was not the man who cashed the check. The United States Agent testified that as a result of his colleague’s investigation the Government was satisfied that Dronsfield was not the man "for whom Starr cashed the check on June 2, 1951.</p>
    <p id="b456-4" data-blocks='[["BL_456.4",456,[230,875,1145,599]]]'>On January 30, 1955, Starr’s bank attached from Starr’s account the amount of money represented by the above mentioned (Stein) income tax refund check. Thereafter, Starr made an information against Dronsfield, charging him with forgery, and on <em>June 3, 1955 </em>identified the photograph of Dronsfield as the photograph of the man for whom he had cashed the check, although on prior occasions he had said that that was not the man. An extradition warrant was issued for Dronsfield’s arrest and Dronsfield then presented the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
