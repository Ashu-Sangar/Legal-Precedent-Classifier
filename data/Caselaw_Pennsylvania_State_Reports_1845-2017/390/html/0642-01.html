Prior to the enactment of the Franchise Tax Act of 1935, both domestic and foreign corporations Avere subject to the Capital Stock Tax Act of June 1, <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>1889, P. L. 420, which, as repeatedly held by this Court, imposed a tax on property. Therefore, in the case of foreign corporations there was taxed only so much of the corporation’s capital stock as the ratio of tangible assets within the Commonwealth bore to all of the assets of the foreign corporation wherever situated. This worked an unfair discrimination in favor of foreign corporations against domestic corporations (see <em>Commonwealth v. Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation, </em><a href="/pa/336/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="336 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1195631" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0209-01">336 Pa. 209</a>, at p. 215, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.2d%20404" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 A.2d 404">8 A. 2d 404</a>), which was remedied by abandonment of the capital stock tax as to foreign corporations and the imposition of a franchise tax in its stead. This was accomplished by amendment to the Capital Stock Tax Act of 1889: (See 72 PS §1871 for the Act of 1889 as amended by the Act of 1935). The amendatory Act of 1935 is entitled “An Act to further amend ... by substituting a franchise tax on foreign corporations in lieu of the capital stock tax on such corporations”. The new tax thus imposed on foreign corporations is, as termed in the title and in the body of the amendatory Act, a “franchise tax”, i.e., a tax on the privilege of doing business in the Commonwealth as we haire frequently stated. In order to determine the value of the exercise of this privilege conferred by the Commonwealth, the Franchise Tax Act provides a formula for the ascertainment of the corporation’s activities within the State. The business transacted in the State is measured through allocation fractions involving the proportion which the tangible property in the State, the payroll in the State and the gross receipts in the State respectively bear to the total assets, payroll and gross receipts of the corporation. It is unnecessary to set forth in detail the factors composing the formula. They were discussed at length in the <em>Columbia Gas </em>case, 336 Pa., <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.2d%20404" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 A.2d 404">supra</a> (see p. 214 et seq.) and in <em>Commonwealth v.

Claiming that the tax in question is a property tax and therefore extraterritorial assets of the corporation may not be included in arriving at the taxable valuation, appellant asserts that the formula or method applicable under the Capital Stock Tax Act should be applied to it. By stipulation it was agreed that under the formula prescribed by the Franchise Tax Act the taxable valuation is $11,664,320, and the resulting tax $58,321.60 as settled; that if, as claimed by appellant, the method or formula used in settling capital stock tax against appellant prior to the enactment of the Franchise Tax Act were applied, the taxable valuation would be $5,-734,202 and the tax thereon $28,671.01 which, since the tax as settled in the amount of $58,321.60 was paid, would entitle appellant to a credit of $29,650.59.</p>

The tax base was determined, not by the allocation to Pennsylvania of an arbitrary percentage of the total capital stock of the corporation, but, through the use of a tripartite formula, by ascertaining, insofar as possible, the relation of the corporate activities in this State to the activities of the corporation everywhere.

Thus analyzed and viewed in determining whether double taxation has occurred, the <em>decisions </em>upon which appellant relies are readily reconcilable with the cases holding the corporate franchise tax to be an excise tax.

The Act of 1935, supra, is a tax for the privilege of a foreign corporation coming into the state of Pennsylvania for the purpose of conducting its business <em>in corporate form. </em>The city ordinance, under attack, is a tax for the privilege of doing business within the city with respect to <em>any </em>individual, partnership or corporation. It is not a tax limited to foreign corporate associations. In the second place, while in each case the <em>object </em>of the tax is to license for the purpose of doing business, the tax actually <em>imposed </em>by the Foreign Corporate Franchise Tax is measured by the value of <em>the property of the foreign corporation toithin the state. </em>In the Pittsburgh ordinances the tax is on the <em>gross volume </em>of business conducted by the taxpayer.

In cases decided by this Court following the passage of the Act of 1935 we <em>unequivocally and repeatedly held that the franchise tax imposed by it is not a property tax </em>but, as its name implies, a tax levied for the privilege of doing business in the Commonwealth, and its constitutionality was upheld: Commonwealth v.

Of course this attempted distinction not only disregards the recent decisions and the clear and forceful language of the Court’s opinions, but it also completely overlooks the fact that the local ordinance (of the City of Philadelphia) whose validity was challenged was absolutely invalid and void under the Sterling Act, if it levied or collected “any tax on a <em>privilege, </em>transaction, <em>subject, </em>or occupation or on personal property which is now or may hereafter become subject to [1] a state tax or [2] a license fee.” The most important and basic issue in <em>National Biscuit Company v. Philadelphia, </em>374 Pa., supra, as well as in the recent cases hereinabove cited, was whether the State taxes — including the State Franchise Tax Act of May 16, 1935— were franchise taxes or property taxes. In that' case the majority, we repeat, held that the taxes imposed by the State Franchise Tax Act of 1935 (and other State Tax Acts enumerated therein) were <em>property taxes </em>and consequently sustained the validity of the Philadelphia so-called Mercantile License Tax as a franchise or excise tax, i.e., a tax for the privilege of doing business in Philadelphia.
