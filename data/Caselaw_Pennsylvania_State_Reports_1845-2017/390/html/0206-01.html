    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.5",228,[264,1500,1147,539]],["BL_229.1",229,[210,322,1149,712]]]'>The building which is the subject of this appeal is located at 6026-28 Pine Street, Philadelphia, and extends southward to Osage Avenue. In 1954 Sears applied to the city for a building permit to construct a loading platform on the property. Incidental to this application Sears was informed that a “use permit” was required for the building since it was no longer being put to its original use as a public garage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> As a result of an inspection of the premises it was discovered that Sears was allegedly using the property <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>as a warehouse in violation of the zoning ordinance, and had been so doing since June 25, 1947. The appellant, Sears, was therefore denied the use permit and it thereupon requested the Zoning Board of Adjustment to grant a variance. The variance was refused and the denial of the use permit was sustained. Sears then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas and argued that the premises were operated not as a warehouse but rather for the sale of goods on the premises at retail, a permitted use, and accordingly it was entitled to a use permit. The Pine Street premises, the appellant contended, were utilized by Sears for the following purposes:</p>
    <blockquote id="b229-4" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[211,1045,1147,92]]]'>(a) Sale and delivery of merchandise on the premises.</blockquote>

    <p id="b229-7" data-blocks='[["BL_229.7",229,[213,1433,1147,267]]]'>The lower court found that the structure was used essentially as a warehouse, a prohibited use, and that the decision of the zoning board in refusing a variance was proper. Sears and the owner, Lehr, who had been allowed to intervene, then took this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b229-8" data-blocks='[["BL_229.8",229,[212,1711,1148,209]]]'>We agree with the court below that the evidence does not bear out the appellants’ contention that the premises were used (a) for the sale and delivery of merchandise on the premises.</p>

    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[246,767,1146,151]]]'>In short, the evidence shows that the Pine Street building was nothing more than a warehouse where an occasional sale took place.</p>
    <p id="b230-6" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[243,941,1148,648]]]'>Prom the opinion of the court below, we quote with approval: “I do not think that the Pine Street premises is a place where customers come to buy. It is a place where, from time to time, customers may come to get delivery of what they bought at the Market Street store, which the Market Street store did not have in supply. The Market Street store has various items on display; the sale is made there; the customer gets his sales-slip there. He takes it and presents it at Pine Street to pick up the merchandise, since the Market Street store does not have enough space to stock all its items.”</p>
    <p id="b230-7" data-blocks='[["BL_230.7",230,[241,1604,1146,319]]]'>Appellants contend, however, that the other uses made of the Pine Street building — (b) the sending of goods to the 63rd Street store to fill orders taken thereat, and (c) delivery of goods directly to customers on the basis of orders taken at the 63rd Street store— qualify as “sales on the premises.”</p>

The rules of the code relied upon are designed to determine, at the various stages in a commercial transaction, the relative rights and liabilities of buyers and sellers. While the subtleties of the sales definition of the code are important to the law of commercial contracts, they have no application to the zoning regulations involved in the present case which concern the physical use to which land is put.</p>

The record is plain that the Pine Street premises has the characteristics of a warehouse. It is serviced by a regular í'Ioav of heavy trucks producing noxious Diesel fumes and causing a serious traffic problem. Further, there is continual loading and unloading of freight Avhieh results in annoying noise as does the handling of the merchandise necessary to the operation of the Sears premises.</p>
