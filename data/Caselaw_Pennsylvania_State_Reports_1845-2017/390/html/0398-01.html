One of court en banc having died before the opinion was rendered, the judgment was set aside and a reargument had. New trial was then awarded, and defendant now appeals. The award of new trial was on the ground that “the ends of justice require that this case be tried a second time”; although the court observed in its opinion that “We also believe, which we agree is nothing but dictum, that the verdict of the jury was capricious.”</p>

Merely because this Court, or the court below, might have found differently is not sufficient for disregarding the jury’s action.

    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[224,671,1147,1145]]]'>Under written contract therefor, defendant was engaged in removing cork-covered steel tanks from plaintiff’s building. To do so it was necessary to cut the tanks through the use of acetylene torches. The work was begun in February, 1952, and continued until a fire destroyed the building on April 4, 1952. All evidence as to cause of the fire was oral, and circumstantial, but plaintiff contended and sought to prove that it resulted from defendant’s negligence. Although the fire started in the room where defendant had been working, the last time that that work was done in the area of origin of the fire was two days before the fire occurred. Plaintiff offered proof that cork was of such composition that, ignited, it would smolder for long periods before bursting into flame. The testimony also brought out the fact, that contained in the same room was other equipment of plaintiff, in use and supervised by plaintiff. There was no proof of improper use of the acetylene torches, but plaintiff sought to establish that defendant did not use proper precautions to avoid fire.</p>
    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[223,1848,1144,421]]]'>In support of its motion for new trial, plaintiff contended that the court erred in its charge on circumstantial evidence and in rejecting proof of similar occurrences in defendant’s past work, as well as a proposal which preceded execution of the contract. It further contended that exclusive control was in defendant, which did not meet the burden of exculpating itself from fault.</p>

This was modified by the declaration that “it is sufficient if the evidence satisfies reasonable and well balanced minds that defendant’s negligence was the cause.” In its charge in this respect, the court below was definitely not in error. To the contrary, its charge was almost verbatim as stated in <em>Connor v. Hawk, </em>supra.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The evidence here was definitely not sufficient to preclude that the fire resulted from a cause other than defendant’s acts; nor does the evidence satisfy a reasonable mind that defendant caused it.</p>

Inc. [would be supplied].” The court below correctly excluded it, as well as proof that defendant had provided a night watchman in the early stages of the work. Not only was all testimony in respect to the work and its supervision admitted, but the proposal must be taken to have been superseded by the contract: <em>Buffington v. Buffington, </em><a href="/pa/378/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="378 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="1250890" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0149-01">378 Pa. 149</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.2d%20229" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="106 A.2d 229">106 A. 2d 229</a>. There was no testimony to establish improper supervision, nor that a night watchman was necessary or was required by the contract governing the parties. Further, the jury was warranted in finding that the premises were not under the exclusive control of defendant, and that the fire did not start as a result of any action of defendant. The cause, under all the circumstances of this case, could have been from a number of factors other than defendant’s acts — at least, the issue' was for determination by the jury alone, and its verdict should not be disturbed.</p>
