In 1933, defendant Fisk Realty Co., Inc. was incorporated in Pennsylvania to hold title to the real estate on which the cleaning plant was operated. Two years later the partnership entered into the retail dry cleaning business and defendant Quaker Cleaners, Inc. was formed to operate retail stores which were opened, the receipts therefrom belonging to Liberty. In 1938, Isadore Rosenfeld gave his son, Samuel Rosenfeld, plaintiff, one-half of his 50% interest. Three years later defendants Harry Rosenfeld and Jack Rosenfeld were admitted to the partnership; they having acquired a 15% and 10% interest respectively from David Rosenfeld. In 1946 defendant David Rosenfeld II purchased a <em>7y2% </em>interest from Isadore, and defendant Sidney Singer bought a similar interest from plaintiff. Isadore died ón April 27, 1951, and his interest passed to, and now belongs to, plaintiff, Samuel Rosenfeld, either individually or as executor of his father’s estate. At the time this suit was instituted, and until the adjudication and thereafter, the interests of the partners in the partnership and the corporations have been as follows.: plaintiff, 35%; David Rosenfeld, 25%; Harry 'Rosenfeld, <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>15% ; Jack Eosenfeld, 10% <em>; </em>David Eosenfeld II, 7%% ; and Sidney Singer, 7%%.</p>

At the same time, all the individual partners entered into written articles of partnership. Paragraph Thirteenth of these partnership articles, which were in effect on April 27, 1851 when Isadore Eosenfeld died, provided that the partnership should terminate on the sixtieth day after the death of Isadore Eosenfeld.</p>

Up until 1948, plaintiff did considerable work for the partnership, including the fitting out and opening of various Quaker retail stores. Plaintiff has not been active in the business since 1948, but this is due to appellants’ having excluded him from participation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellants admit that they do not want plaintiff to resume active participation in the business.</p>

On or about June 29, 1951, all the remaining partners entered into a written salary agreement (under seal and under the provisions of the Uniform Written Obligations Act), which provided that the salaries for the defendant partners who were actively en<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>gaged in the operation of the partnership business, should be increased to the following amounts per week: David Rosenfeld, $600; Harry Rosenfeld, $550; Jack Rosenfeld, $325; David Rosenfeld II and Sidney Singer, each $275. This written salary agreement states that the increased salaries were to be effective on July 1, 1951, but is silent as to its term of duration. The agreement increased the salaries of the defendant partners by an aggregate of $67,600 annually, and reduced plaintiff’s 35% share of the profits by $23,600 per year. The chancellor found that at tké time this agreement for increased salaries was entered into, the individual defendants agreed that they would continue to recognize plaintiff’s 50% control of the business and that plaintiff’s share of the profits would be protected. Appellants repudiated their promise; they continued to exclude plaintiff from active participation in the business, attempted to repudiate the voting proxy involved in the principal issue in the court below, tried to remove plaintiff as an officer of the defendant corporations, and otherwise sought to reduce his rights to a 50% voice in the management and a 35% share of the profits of the business. On March 31, 1952, plaintiff notified the defendant partners by letter that he no longer agreed to the salaries specified in the agreement of June 29, 1951 and demanded that the salaries be reduced to the scale in effect prior to the agreement. Defendants refused to lower their salaries, but on the contrary, on May 25, 1953, appellants, over plaintiff’s protest, signed another instrument again raising the salaries of Jack Rosenfeld, David Rosenfeld II, and Sidney Singer. The chancellor found that the salaries which the defendants are receiving are consuming an unconscionable proportion of the profits of the business, and this disproportion is growing, due to the substantial decline in the profits of the business; though <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>plaintiff owns 35% of the business, he is receiving a much smaller and unfair percentage of its earnings, and no salary whatsoever. The chancellor and the unanimous court en banc held that the individual defendants must account for the salaries which they drew from the partnership after April 1, 1952, the date when plaintiff informed them that he no longer agreed to the salary increase, to the extent that they exceeded the amounts of their respective salaries prior to July 1, 1951.</p>

As was well said by the chancellor, speaking for the court en banc: “The salary agreement was obviously entered into as an amicable attempt to provide a mutually satisfactory solution to a situation which was responsible for intense bad feelings on both sides. But there is nothing in the circumstances to indicate that the partners intended a definite term of duration for the agreement. On the contrary, under the circumstances it appears that the salary schedule was to be a working arrangement to restore some degree of harmony among the partners, and we think it is the only fair inference that this agreement for Aveekly compensation Avas to continue only so long as the harmonious relationship remained betAveen the tAvo dissident factions. It is a reasonable conclusion that the parties deliberately and designedly refrained from binding themselves to any permanency of the relationship, that it was intended to be subject to change depending upon the situation. Defendants’ OAvn conduct indicates this, for they later ignored the writing and granted further increases, although they now rely upon the alleged continuously binding effect of the agreement as to the plaintiff. At any rate the evidence discloses no proof at all of any mutual understanding either as to a definite term or as to reasonable time of existence for the agreement.”</p>
    <p id="b67-3" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[198,1883,1146,379]]]'>“The salary schedule itself specifies no term, and its only reference with regard to time is to Aveekly compensation.

However, the increased salary agreement contains nothing whatsoever obligating the defendant partners to continue working for the partnership for any period of time. Admittedly the partnership is one at will, and any of the defendant partners could have stopped, and can stop, working for the partnership at any time. Nor is there any testimony at all that the partnership would have been dissolved and the business discontinued unless plaintiff signed the increased salary agreement, nor is there any testimony that the appellants threatened to do so. Moreover, the fact that appellants increased the salaries again in 1953, over plaintiff’s protest, is evidence that even they did not consider the increased salary agreement to be binding as long as the partnership lasted. Appellants admit that the increase in 1953 was unlawful, but attempt to justify it on the ground that they erroneously believed that the salaries could be altered by majority vote. But if the increased salary agreement was intended to be binding for the duration of the partnership, then, being a contract, obviously it could not have been changed by a majority vote of the partnership, but would need the consent of all the parties to the contract.</p>

As stated by the court below: “. . .

The salary agreement here in question does not purport to be a complete integrated agreement, but merely recites the increased salaries the defendant partners are to receive. When a contract is silent on its <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>duration, parol evidence is always admissible to show the circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract, the situation of the parties, the objects they apparently had in view, and the nature of the subject matter of the agreement, to show whether the agreement was to endure for a reasonable time or for some particular period: <em>Fessman Estate, </em><a href="/pa/386/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="386 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="1268334" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0447-01">386 Pa. 447</a>, 451, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.2d%20676" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="126 A.2d 676">126 A. 2d 676</a>; <em>Lubrecht v.

Kelling Nut Company, </em>supra; <em>Lubrecht v. Laurel Stripping Company, </em>supra. It was on this ground that the court properly based its decision and not on the oral promises of the appellants.</p>

This contention is based on the assumption, arguendo, that plaintiff signed the salary agreement of June 29, 1951 in consideration of defendants’ promise to recognize his 50% control of the business. In the first place, the court did not base its decision on a breach of this promise by defendants but on plaintiff’s right to terminate the agreement at will. In the <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>second place, this contention is not included in appellants’ “Statement of Questions Involved” and therefore need not be considered: See Rule 35, Rules of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania; <em>Burke Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/378/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="378 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="1250903" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0616-01">378 Pa. 616</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.2d%2058" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="108 A.2d 58">108 A. <em>2d </em>58</a>; <em>Blue Anchor Overall Co., Inc. v.

Lastly, by the decree of the court the plaintiff did not get specific performance of the agreement by the defendants to recognize the plaintiff’s 50% control or voice in the management of the business but only specific performance of the proxy given by David Eosenfeld II which was executed and delivered inore than five years before the increased salary agreement. Since this agreement was terminable at will, plaintiff did not rescind any contract when he exercised the legal right of a partner to refuse to consent to salaries being paid other partners in carrying on the regular business of the partnership.</p>

Since the court based its decision, as above stated, on the right of the plaintiff to terminate at will the increased salary schedule contained in the written agreement of June 29, 1951, a finding that defendants breached the oral agreement, was- not necessary to the decision reached. As to the lack of a formal finding or conclusion that the agreement in question was terminable at will, no such complaint was made in the court below by the exceptants, now appellants. The defendants filed only three exceptions to the chancellor’s adjudication and none of them <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>complained that the chancellor had erred in not making a formal finding of any cognate fact, or in not making any conclusion of law that was necessary. If the defendants had complained in the court below that there was no formal finding or conclusion that the salary agreement was terminable at will, the learned chancellor could and doubtless would have added formal findings.
