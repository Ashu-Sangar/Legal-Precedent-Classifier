In the event of a disagreement among the individual Trustees, the decision of Joseph Rocereto shall be conclusive and binding. . . .”, governs. His contention is that settlor intended that first an individual (Peruzzi) in whom he had complete confidence should control the trust, and, then, that appellant, a personal, not a “business” associate of settlor, should have a curb over the “management team”.</p>

With this contention we cannot agree. It is clear that settlor contemplated that the various trustees, being human, might on occasion disagree. It cannot be controverted that, as between the corporate and the individual trustees, settlor intended that the individual trustees should govern. He assured this in paragraph 14 by stipulating that “The Settlor, during his lifetime, and thereafter the Individual Trustee or Trustees then acting, shall have the right to require the Corporate Trustee to resign, and to substitute in place of said Corporate Trustee a new Corporate Trustee, . . . The Settlor, during his lifetime, and thereafter the Individual Trustee or Trustees then acting, shall have the right in like manner to require any succeeding Corporate Trustee to resign and to appoint a new successor Corporate Trustee in its place. . . .”. Thus he assured control of the Trust to the Individual Trustee or Trustees, and nothing more would seem to be necessary to effectuate this intention.</p>

    <p id="b207-4" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[184,771,1151,765]]]'>Considering the instrument itself, it is to be noted that few if any of the numbered paragraphs are so completely self-contained as to stand alone without reference to other paragraphs.

The second, third and fourth paragraphs enumerate the rights, powers and liabilities of the Trustees in the management of the trust res. The fifth and sixth paragraphs relate to the management of two specific portions of the trust res. The seventh, eighth and ninth paragraphs pertain to the trust income. The tenth paragraph directs that voting rights of stock in the trust res shall be solely in the Individual Trustees. The eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth paragraphs relate largely to the appointment, resignation, compensation and removal of the Corporate Trustee. The fifteenth paragraph is a general one pertaining to <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>laber additions to the trust res, the sixteenth generally prohibits encumbrances by the beneficiaries, and the seventeenth is a general direction as to payment of taxes.

    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[282,772,1148,919]]]'>Thereupon follows the nineteenth paragraph, which we construe to be a <em>general </em>one relating to the general question of disagreements. We are driven to this conclusion not only because of the placement of the paragraph, but because of its wording. If the paragraph were to refer only to disagreements stemming from a disagreement between the Corporate and Individual Trustees, it would logically follow or precede paragraph 14, which relates to the power of the Individual Trustee or Trustees “to require” resignation of the Corporate Trustee, or fall among paragraphs 11, 12, 13 and 14 which deal generally with the Corporate Trustee. In this case it is found at the end of the instrument, the place customarily reserved for general clauses, following the general provisions of paragraphs 15, 16 and 17, and after paragraph 18 relating to Individual Trustees.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[280,1712,1148,596]],["BL_209.1",209,[226,329,1150,701]]]'>Turning to the language of the second sentence of paragraph 19, it is not such as would refer back, or appear to be limited by, the first sentence of the paragraph. The first sentence begins “In the event of a disagreement between . . .”. This does not refer to a specific disagreement or class of disagreements, but refers to disagreements generally between the Corporate and the Individual Trustees, and apparently to disagreements not otherwise resolved by the instrument. Similarly the second sentence begins “In the event of <em>a </em>disagreement . . .”. This again appears to <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>be a general direction. If it were meant only to refer back to the first sentence, the language would be “In the event such a disagreement extends to the Individual Trustees . . .”, or something to that effect. Limiting words or phrases were not strange to the draftsman of this instrument. In paragraph 5, relating to Planters Nut and Chocolate Company stock, the concluding sentence reads: “The Trustees shall not be liable for any loss which may occur by reason of their holding <em>such </em>stock”, thus limiting the applicability of the sentence to the stock described in paragraph 5, and not to that referred to in paragraph 4 or elsewhere.</p>
    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[225,1052,1148,485]]]'>To read paragraph 19 as appellees contend would almost make it meaningless. Certainly the power “to require” the resignation of the Corporate Trustee, virtually assures that “disagreements” would be minimal at most. The Corporate Trustee here is almost in the position of being an employe, trusted and valuable it is true, but serving only at the will of the Individual Trustees. They may fire the Corporate Trustee and hire another, almost without limitation.</p>
    <p id="b209-5" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[223,1551,1148,321]]]'>It seems clear that paragraph 19 was intended to generally cover “disagreements”, where not otherwise resolved, and that the second and third sentences of paragraph 19 apply generally to disagreements among the Individual Trustees, not only to the disagreements envisioned in the first sentence of that paragraph.</p>
    <p id="b209-6" data-blocks='[["BL_209.6",209,[220,1884,1150,430]],["BL_210.1",210,[230,328,1147,313]]]'>It does not follow, however, that paragraph 19 applies to situations otherwise treated in the trust instrument. Certainly a “disagreement” as to where trust property should be kept could not be “resolved” by an appeal to paragraph 19 by the appellant, in light of the direction in paragraph 1, that “The Corporate Trustee shall have physical possession of all property constituting this trust.” The first or second sentence <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>of paragraph 19 would apply only where the trust instrument is not otherwise explicit. This is merely a restatement of the well known rule of construction that the specific provisions of an instrument will govern where applicable, when in conflict with general provisions.</p>
    <p id="b210-4" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[228,671,1149,1588]]]'>Paragraph 18 deals with the appointment of the Individual Trustees. It discloses a scheme of operation, which, when taken with the last two sentences of paragraph 19, disclose how the settlor intended this trust to be managed. We have already seen that the Individual Trustee or Trustees were to control over the Corporate Trustee. After settlor’s death he entrusted the management of the trust to Peruzzi, related to him through marriage, a business associate, and apparently his friend and one whom he trusted. After Peruzzi’s death, management was to pass to a group, three of whom were business associates, and a fourth, who was not a business associate, but related by marriage and apparently a friend, the appellant Rocereto. While a majority of the trustees were to be of the so-called “management group”, the settlor clearly gave Rocereto a power to curb that group, so long as Rocereto should live. After Rocereto’s death, control would rest squarely with the “management group”, since the “decision of a majority” would thereafter be binding in “disagreements”. Thus while settlor intended to curb the management group during the lives of Peruzzi and Rocereto, it is clear that in time he intended control to pass to the “management group”. He confirmed this intention by specifically restricting potential nepotistic practices, (contrary to his own practice), a further indication that he intended control to eventually shift from himself, to his relatives, and then to an unrelated “management group”.</p>
    <p id="b211-3" data-blocks='[["BL_211.3",211,[217,333,1153,1098]]]'>
      <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>Settlor’s direction was that, upon the death of one of the individual co-trustees, “. . . the surviving individual co-trustees shall appoint another individual or individuals to act as successor co-trustee so that at no time shall there be less than four individuals acting as co-trustees.” No limitation was placed upon this power to “appoint”. No one co-trustee was given a conclusive or binding decisional power in this regard. To permit appellant to exercise the power conferred upon him in general matters by paragraph 19 to this situation presented by paragraph 18, would be to permit him, depending on the chance of death, potentially to displace the “management group” as the eventual group in control of this trust, and, in effect, in control of Planters Nut and Chocolate Company, with trustees of appellant’s choosing. This we believe the settlor did not intend. Quite the contrary, he intended the management group to replace itself, thus insuring eventual control of the trust in hands sympathetic to the management of Planters.</p>

Neither of these issues embraced the question of whether a unanimous or a majority vote of trustees is required to reach a decision in situations where the common law rules had not been changed by the settlor. In cases where Rocereto would not choose to exercise his “control” power, or in situations where the trust instrument did not give him “control” power, the applicable rules of the common law or the statutes of this Commonwealth would apply. A stipulation extending the “conclusions of the Orphans’ Court” as to the interpretation of the charitable trust instrument to the private trusts does not even bring the common law rules into play, much less “change the common law rule” that “. . . the powers conferred upon them can properly be exercised only by all the trustees, unless it is otherwise provided by the terms of the trust.”, Restatement of Trusts, §194. In our Anew the effect of the stipulation, apart from making the court’s interpretation of appellant’s general powers in case of a disagreement among the individual trustees applicable to the private trusts, was to place the disagreement of the individual trustees on the question of selection of the successor trustee in the private trusts before the orphans’ court for decision. <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>The very evident purpose of the stipulation Avas to prevent the necessity of a “separate proceeding” for the determination of the appointive rights in the private trusts, and to avoid the further litigation Avith respect thereto Avhich was otherAvise bound to ensue, or as it Avas stated in the brief of the Louise Obici Memorial Hospital, was inevitable and imminent. It was clear that the individual co-trustees were unable to act in concert in this regard, as required by the law pertaining to private trusts. It Avas equally clear that the trust instruments required the surviving individual co-trustees to appoint a fourth individual co-trustee. Under these circumstances it is perfectly proper to have the disagreement of the trustees resolved by the orphans’ court.</p>

NotAvithstanding the directions, the vacancies were not filled over a period of years. It Avas held that payment on a mortgage which Avas part of the trust res, made to one other than a properly appointed trustee, could not discharge the debt. The Court stated, at p. 37: “We think, undoubtedly, the legislative policy in this Commonwealth is that where there are active duties to perform and there is a vacancy in the trusteeship, the courts are required, upon application and proper proof, to fill the vacancy.

If there are two or more trustees, action by all of them is necessary to the exercise of the powers conferred upon them as trustees. If one of them refuses to concur in the exercise of a power, the others cannot exercise the power.
