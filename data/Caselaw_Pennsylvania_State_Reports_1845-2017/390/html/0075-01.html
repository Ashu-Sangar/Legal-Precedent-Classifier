The writ required the defendant Board to permit repayment by the plaintiff, Wright, of certain amounts he had previously withdrawn from the County Employes Retirement Fund, and, upon receipt thereof, to pay Wright the required “service increment” as provided for in the 1955 amendment to the County Employes’ Retirement System Law.

L. 138. Wright left the employ of the county in 1932, and withdrew the contributions he had made to the retirement fund during the years 1924-1932 which amounted to $142.39. Subsequently, in 1933, he was reemployed and continued as an Allegheny County employe until his involuntary separation on January 31, 1956. In 1933, when he was reemployed, the retirement system was governed by the Act of May 2, 1929, P. L. 1278, which did not change the earlier law of 1919. During this latter period of 22 years, (1933-1956), Wright made regular contributions to the retirement fund, but never repaid the monies he had withdrawn after his first term of service had ended.</p>

The solicitor advised him that the 1955 law barred his right to make such repayment after the first of January, 1956. Subsequently, after Wright was involuntarily retired, the Board refused his tender of repayment, and Wright thereupon instituted the present action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

    <p id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[210,1274,1148,422]]]'>The plaintiff maintains that the rights conferred upon him by the Acts of 1919 and 1929 to make repayment at any time of funds withdrawn from the retirement system were, under the Pennsylvania pension doctrine, unalterable and unqualified, and could not be disturbed by future enactments.

Therein lies his error. The 1955 Act does not prevent Wright from repaying at any time the money he withdrew from the retirement fund; it merely requires that such repayment must be made prior to the stipulated date of January 1, 1956, <em>in order to qualify for the newly granted service increment first provided for in the Act of 1955.</em>
