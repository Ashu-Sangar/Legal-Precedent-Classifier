    <p id="b25-3" data-blocks='[["BL_25.4",25,[202,941,1154,1196]]]'>In this latter regard, we believe that plaintiff misconstrues the provisions of The Third Class City Code regarding a stay of proceedings pending appeal. Section 4124 of the Code provides that “An appeal to the board shall stay <em>all proceedings </em>in furtherance of the action appealed from . . .” (Emphasis supplied). We cannot conceive of a broader provision for the protection of one appealing from a decision of an administrative officer. A stay of “all proceedings” regarding a particular application of a Zoning Ordinance by an administrative officer would certainly stay any penalties instituted by the City to enforce compliance with the decision appealed from. Any other reading of this provision would render it practically meaningless. Furthermore, if plaintiff still would not feel wholly protected by this provision (and we cannot see how its complete protection can seriously be questioned), it would have the undoubted right to appeal from any “decision of the administrative officer” regarding the institution of penalties, and thus satisfy itself doubly that it is protected by the stay provision of Section 4124.</p>

All of the Acts prescribing zoning procedures for the various municipal subdivisions make provision for a stay in proceedings in one form or another in the case of appeal from the Board of Adjustment to the appropriate court.

In the amended Third Class City Code, at the place which corresponds to the cited provisions in the other municipal codes (i.e., at a point in the chapter entitled Board of Adjustment following the description of its make up, functioning, etc., and the allowance of appeals to the Board), Section 12198-4127 appears as follows: “Any person aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment or any city officer affected thereby may appeal therefrom, within thirty days, to the court of common pleas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Every such appeal shall specify the grounds thereof and the interest of the appellant.

At any time during the pendency of an appeal, upon application of the Appellant and upon due notice to the agency, the court, or a judge thereof, may after hearing grant an order of supersedeas upon such terms and conditions, including the filing of security, as the court or the judge may prescribe.”</p>

In its brief before this Court the plaintiff-appellee contends that there is nothing from which to appeal “For how is a property owner to know when a letter from a Solicitor is a ruling or merely a notice of the City’s position in any matter?” The answer to plaintiff’s question <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>is that the letter must be read in the light of the surrounding circumstances. The tenor of the complaint makes it quite clear that plaintiff did read the letter and understood it to be a notification to the company to remove its signboards. Plaintiff’s complaint states it as follows: <em>“8. </em>Defendant has notified plaintiff by letter to remove all of its signboards in conformity with said ordinance. A copy of said letter is attached hereto. . . .”. Plaintiff’s understanding of the letter becomes even more apparent when read in the light of Section 1804 of the Zoning Ordinance: “Violation; Penalty. Any person, firm, or corporation violating any of the provisions of this ordinance shall, upon conviction thereof in a court of record, be fined . . ■. Proceedings against violators shall be instituted by the City Solicitor upon motion of the Planning Commission or the Zoning Officer. . . .”.</p>
    <p id="b28-4" data-blocks='[["BL_28.4",28,[244,1273,1147,429]]]'>While this letter was not the institution of proceedings under Section 1804 (the letter was written two weeks prior to the date the billboard sign prohibition was to go into effect), there can be no question but that the company was plainly notified thereby to remove its signboards, and such notification clearly falls within the. broad appealable classification encompassed by the statutory term “any decision”.</p>

As Chief Justice Stern stated in <em>Knup v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/386/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="386 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="1268333" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0350-01">386 Pa. 350</a>, 353, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.2d%20399" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="126 A.2d 399">126 A. 2d 399</a>: “. . . it is equally well -established that a court will take jurisdiction- only <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>in a case in which a challenged statute, ordinance, or rule of court has been actually applied to a litigant; it does not undertake to decide academically the unconstitutionality or other alleged invalidity of legislation until it is brought into operation so as to impinge upon the rights of some person or persons. . .</p>
    <p id="b29-3" data-blocks='[["BL_29.4",29,[183,668,1151,762]]]'>At the oral argument it was suggested that the City Solicitor is not “the administrative officer” from whose “decision” an appeal could be taken. Aside from the clear intent of Section 4123 to allow an appeal from any administrative officer implementing the provisions of a zoning ordinance, it is a sufficient answer to note that the letter states that the Solicitor was acting “upon instructions from the Zoning Officer” and certainly the whole body of law relating to agency, particularly as it applies to an attorney- — City Solicitor, compels us to construe the act of the Solicitor here to be the act of the Zoning Officer, and there cannot be the slightest question of the applicability of the section as to Zoning Officers.</p>
    <p id="b29-4" data-blocks='[["BL_29.5",29,[180,1444,1150,654]]]'>The foregoing arguments are, however, largely technical. We are impelled to reach the conclusion that the court below erred by a much more basic consideration. The basic tenor of our decisions on the question of whether an action in equity, or any other action, will lie to raise a question of the validity or constitutionality of a zoning ordinance, or a particular application thereof, has been to emphasize that the statutory remedy prescribed by the Legislature is the exclusive remedy to be pursued by one “aggrieved” by á zoning ordinance, and a bill in equity raising the same question will not be permitted to lie.</p>

Chief Justice (then Mr. Justice) Jones stated unequivocally, at page 265: “. . . It is plain enough that the procedure statutorily prescribed for testing the validity of substantive provisions of a zoning ordinance or the method of its administration is through application to the board of adjustment by one aggrieved by the decision of a borough administrative officer in respect thereof and, thereafter, by appeal to the court of common pleas if the decision of the board of adjustment is likewise adverse.”.</p>

The basic issue in that case was whether a township could by adroit use of its zoning ordinance (and the holding would apply equally well to other local ordinances) hamper the construction of a power line which the Public Utility Commission had found necessary, along a right-of-way which had been approved by it. At page 336 we stated: “. . . We believe that the General Assembly never intended to bestow a power upon first class townships which is in headlong conflict with the power already given the Public Utility Commission. We believe that the General Assembly never gave any one of the political subdivisions through which the proposed line will pass the power to determine whether the public in another locality shall be served with electric energy, or the means by which they shall be served. . . .”.

Harron, </em>380 Pa., supra, the Court (citing many cases), sustained Equity jurisdiction and granted a mandatory injunction notwithstanding (1) the fact that the act of the defendant in excluding negroes from a swimming pool, was specifically prohibited by §654 of The Penal Code of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, and (2) the further fact that the said Act prescribed criminal penalties for its violation and (3) the further fact that the plaintiffs had a right to proceed against defendants in a civil action to recover damages. The injunction was granted (to protect personal rights which were placed upon the same basis as property rights) because (a) it would prevent a multiplicity of suits and because (b) the Court considered that all the combined remedies aforesaid were not adequate.</p>

As a general rule no one is entitled to relief in a court of equity for threatened injury until available remedies at law are exhausted, and our appellate courts have held that under Section 13 of the Act of March 21, 1806, P.L. 558, 46 PS §156, which provides that ‘In all cases where a remedy is provided, ... by any act or acts of assembly . . . the directions of the said acts shall be strictly pursued, . . .’, the remedy provided must be employed: see e.g. Lukens v.
