On May 31, 1951, Mary Stanko delivered to the defendants, a daughter and son-in-law, a deed to this realty purportedly executed by herself and her husband. The defendants paid Mary Stanko $2,000 in cash, and assumed the $20,949.50 mortgage on the real estate. They then entered into possession of the premises, and occupied a five-room apartment as their residence. During the following year the defendants collected the rents from the property, and maintained and improved the premises.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>In February, 1953, John Stanko filed a bill in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County to set aside the deed, averring that he did not sign the deed nor authorize anyone to sign for him. The case was originally heard by the late Judge Cottom, who died before rendering a decision. By agreement of the parties an adjudication by Judge Carr was made upon a transcript of the testimony and the original exhibits. After a rehearing at which the testimony of a handwriting expert was received in evidence, the chancellor concluded that the plaintiff never signed the deed nor authorized his wife to sign it in his behalf, but on the contrary immediately repudiated the deed when he learned of its existence in the spring of 1952. The defendants’ exceptions to these findings were dismissed by the court en banc, and a judgment ordering the cancellation of the deed was entered. From the final decree the defendants appeal maintaining that the chancellor’s findings were unsupported by the evidence, and that the decree failed to provide for recovery of the expenses incurred by the defendants in the acquisition, maintenance and improvement of the property.</p>
    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.4",303,[214,1559,1149,375]]]'>The chancellor in rendering his adjudication did not see the witnesses, (excepting the handwriting expert), therefore his findings of fact are not entitled to the same weight as the verdict of a jury; this Court is equally competent to form an opinion as to the facts from the evidence appearing in the record. <em>Wilwohl's Petition, </em><a href="/pa/311/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="311 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="1146210" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0152-01">311 Pa. 152</a>, 154, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20654" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="166 A. 654">166 Atl. 654</a> (1933).</p>
    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[213,1947,1149,322]]]'>However, nothing in the record impels us to disagree with the determination of the chancellor that the plaintiff had neither executed the deed, authorized his wife to sign it for him, nor had such notice of the transaction as would estop him from asserting his rights.</p>

      <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>The plaintiff testified that the signature on the deed was not his own and that he had not consented that his wife act in his behalf. Indeed, he asserted that he had no knowledge whatsoever of the transaction pri- or to his discovery of the conveyance in the spring of 1952, at which time he contacted the defendants and an attorney in order to assert his claim to the property. His testimony was corroborated in part by the handwriting expert who testified that the signature “John Stanko” appearing on the deed Avas not genuine. Further, Stanko’s position was substantiated by his Avife, Mary, Avho admitted signing her husband’s name to the deed without his knoAvledge and consent in order to obtain funds to send their incurably ill son to Arizona.</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.4",304,[262,1165,1147,1152]]]'>Defendants attempted to prove Stanko’s knowledge, or at least his notice of the transaction, by evidence shoAving that after the date of delivery of the deed he permitted his son-in-laAV to perform all of the routine maintenance duties which previously the plaintiff had undertaken. But these duties Avere not extensive or burdensome, and plaintiff testified that his son-in-law, then living on the premises, had volunteered to relieve his father-in-laAV of them. Hence, Stanko’s withdrawal raises no inference of knowledge of the transfer. Neither does the failure of the plaintiff to object to the subsequent management of the property by the defendants indicate such knoAvledge. John Stanko is illiterate except to the extent of being able to write his name. His Avife is a capable and experienced businesswoman to Avhom plaintiff has largely entrusted the management of their property and financial affairs. In view of this circumstance, it is quite reasonable to infer that the plaintiff never became apprised of the fact that his daughter and son-in-law had taken over control of the property.</p>
