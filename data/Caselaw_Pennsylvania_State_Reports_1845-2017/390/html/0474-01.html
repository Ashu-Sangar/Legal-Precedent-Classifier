Prior to 1934, plaintiffs, who have never mined any of the coal in question, had paid to defendant some $300 in royalties.

In 1941, negotiations were begun with respect to these encroachments, and on November 12, 1947 a deed acknowledged on July 2, 1941, was recorded in Somerset County. This deed between Davis and the defendant Ream recited a transfer of portions of the E coal from Ream to Davis; and a transfer of another portion of the E coal, and some of the E coal owned by Davis on the adjoining tract to Ream, as a result of which any conflict between Davis and Ream was considered settled. There is a question as to whether the plaintiff Beachley was involved in the 1941 negotiations, but no question that he is not mentioned in the deed as recorded in 1947.</p>

In a second opinion, the chancellor again dismissed the preliminary objections, holding that the plaintiffs had a right to the 100 acres of E coal by virtue of their lease from Mrs. Cober; and that plaintiffs’ right extended to the E coal and was not limited to the coal above the Mahoning Sandstone, as contended by the defendant.</p>

    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[265,794,1146,431]]]'>Underlying all these contentions is the basic question of whether the exception of “one hundred acres of coal bed geologically known and designated as ‘E’ to be hereafter surveyed from the northeast end of the farm . . .” is sufficiently clear and definite to grant adequate title.

An acre still means 43,560 square feet or 160 square rods, as it did in 1902, and 100 acres are still quite susceptible of simple calculation. The only question is as to what was meant by the northeast end. Here too, the delineation in the 1902 deed is sufficiently clear.</p>

The upper (not quite) parallel boundary of the trapezoid has, for the greater part of its length, a direction of South 46° West, or, put otherwise, it is but one degree from being a true northeast-southwest line. The lower line of the trapezoid is not quite parallel to the upper, having a direction of North 58° East, but it is sufficiently parallel to make the farm run in its longer measurements- in an unmis<a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>takably northeast-southwest direction. Under these circumstances there can be no- question which part of the farm is that designated as the “northeast end”. With this much information at his fingertips it would be a very simple matter for a surveyor to drop a line running in direction perpendicular to the mean difference between the upper and lower generally northeast-southwest boundaries of the farm, and so located as to mark off 100 acres from the irregular northeast side of the farm. It is purely a matter of mathematical calculation. The irregularity of the one side of the farm would not affect the perpendicular line which would fall well within the trapezoidal area, about one-third of the way in from the northeast side of the farm.</p>

In an action for damages for iron ore wrongfully removed brought some 40 years after the execution of the deed, this Court upheld an award of the value of the iron ore removed from the west (really southwest) side of a line drawn down the middle of the tract, as against the contention that the line ought to strictly conform to the north-south meridian, thus delineating a true east-west division of the farm. Clearly implicit in the decision is the conclusion that directions must be understood in reference to the specific tract in question, and not abstractly in their compass sense.</p>

Accepting, as we do, the factual determination that -the 100 acres of E coal <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>were sufficiently designated in the 1902 deed, it is clear that appellant’s legal contentions must fail.</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[278,446,1151,1485]]]'>Appellant’s first contention is that “Equity has no jurisdiction to compel the designation of coal which the parties have not designated.” This contention is answered primarily by noting that the coal acreage in question is adequately located by the deed of 1902. The only question here is whether equity may require a survey to be made to ascertain physically a line which exists as of right. Of this we think there can be no doubt. The survey prayed for in this bill is necessary to ascertain how much of plaintiffs’ coal has been encroached upon in order to accomplish the accounting ordered by the chancellor. It is an ancillary prerequisite to the equitable relief ordered by the court below. The coal in question was designated by the lease of 1902; the survey here requested does no more than fix the line physically. No one would contend that an exception was uncertain if the boundary line of the exception was designated as following a certain portion of the 40th parallel or a designated portion of the Somerset-Cambria County line, although that line might not be clearly marked physically at a particular point. A survey would certainly be proper to help determine whether a given house, or tree, or mine, fell along one side or the other of that boundary line. And so too in the instant case, the survey will merely fix physically a boundary line, the location of which is adequately set forth in the deed.</p>

Given the hotel site, the lots on which it stands and the ground properly appurtenant to it, can be ascertained by measurement to a certainty.
