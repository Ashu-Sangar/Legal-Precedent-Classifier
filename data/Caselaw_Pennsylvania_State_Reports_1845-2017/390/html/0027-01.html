The defendant insurance company sought to interest plaintiff in writing the insurance under a so-called “retrospective” plan of compensation. Under this arrangement the plaintiff would remit to <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>the defendant the full amount of the premiums he collected on policies written by him, from which the defendant company would deduct from the premiums as they became earned a stated percentage (in the case of the plan offered to plaintiff here it would be 15%) for its office fees, etc. Thereafter the defendant company would add the salvage and subrogation, and deduct the total losses and loss expenses due to these policies, and remit to the plaintiff the remainder as his compensation. If the remainder should be a minus figure in one accounting period, then the defendant company would carry that loss over to subsequent accountings. The net effect of this “retrospective” plan would be to make the agent’s commissions depend on the safety record of the risks he writes. If the loss ratio of his accounts is very low, then his commission, in the instant case, would run close to 85% of earned premiums on the insurance he writes. If the loss experience is high, then his commission would suffer proportionately.</p>

It is of course possible that the copy was lost or misplaced and also possible that plaintiff never signed and returned it. Still this does not obviate the necessity of plaintiff’s proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the copy of this letter was signed and returned. The then president of the defendant company testified that he did not recall receiving from plaintiff a copy so signed. The then special representative of the defendant company, with whom plaintiff had most of his dealings, categorically denied knowing of the existence of either of the letters until January of 1955, and he testified that he had access to the company’s files and had searched them for the copy of the letter in question without success. Plaintiff’s testimony as to signing and sending the copy of the letter was as follows: “Q. Did you sign a copy of those letters? A. I assume that I did, Mr. Dower. By Mr. Dower: I object to that. By the Court: The objection is overruled. Do you know whether you signed a copy? That’s Mr. Dower’s question. A. I don’t know, Your Honor, more than I know whether I signed these or not, but they were all in the same lot. I signed these because these are copies they had. I must have signed the others. I sign a lot of papers during the course of a day. I can’t remember signing each individual one because I can’t remember actually signing these. Q.

Jur., Contracts, §44. Plaintiff would have us consider the request for an acknowledgment as a mere nullity. There is a sound business reason why this requirement for an acknowledgment “signed and returned” had vital importance to the defendant. Assuming that the option to convert was to be open for some time “in the future”, defendant had to be on notice (assuming plaintiff’s interpretation of the effect of a conversion to a retrospective plan) to have a reserve amounting to several thousand dollars set aside, and not distributable as earnings in the form of dividends, etc., in case plaintiff exercised the option thus open to him. It was a wholly understandable and reasonable request, and absent compliance with the “sign and return” term, no option contract can be said to have come into existence.</p>

We think the judge was entirely justified' in this conclusion. The “option”, if interpreted as plaintiff would have it, had the effect of guaranteeing to plaintiff a profit of <em>25% </em>on all earned premiums he had written, and, in addition, give him the benefit of a favorable loss ratio, without incurring the risk of an unfavorable loss ratio. <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>We could possibly understand sucb an arrangement for a short period of time, especially in the case of a new agent who had no experience upon which to base his immediate decision, but a period of three years during which the insurance company is a complete insurer not only of the insured, but of the extra “good risk” profits of the agent as well, is beyond that which the usage of business or the contract in this case would reasonably contemplate.</p>

Garrish, the then accountant for the insurance company, testified that he was in charge of drawing up these statements, and that they were intended for use by the officers of the company only. His assistant, Miss Madeleine M. Clarke, testified that she had been hired in June, 1955, and that she had typed these statements and had mailed them to plaintiff by mistake. “The second month I was there this one just got by. It was one of those that should have been withheld for office records. I just let it go out by mistake.”</p>
