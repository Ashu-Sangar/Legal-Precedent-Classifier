As appears in the complaint, the Commission has issued certificates of public convenience as to the respective properties of the plaintiffs Stellwagon and Charch, and the statement by counsel for the intervening defendant in its brief and in its oral argument in this Court that since the filing of plaintiffs’ complaint a certificate has also issued as to the property of the plaintiffs Karrer and wife, is not challenged. The issuance by the Commission of such certificates of public convenience constitute a finding that the exercise of the power of eminent domain by the defendant electric company is necessary for the convenience, accommodation or safety of the public: <em>Reed v.

In the <em>Phillips </em>case, supra, the function and purpose of the transmission line is thus stated at page 627: “. . . The record reveals that the purpose for the transmission right-of-way is to coordinate the company’s system through the Bradford substation to assure adequate service to the Chester-Marcus Hook area. This proposed line will integrate the network to enable it to supplement power deficient areas from adjacent areas having available capacity. The whole enterprise, according to the testimony, will provide for the integration of the present Chester generating station and the proposed Eddy-<a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>stone station with other stations of the Philadelphia Electric Company and other Atlantic Seaboard utilities. This, it is. asserted, is essential to national defense and industrial expansion. . . .”. In the <em>Lmoer Chichester Township </em>case, supra, the Superior Court affirmed the Commission’s approval of the Philadelphia Electric Company’s application for the construction of a building on a site in Chester County to house control equipment consisting of switchboards and other necessary equipment essential to the operation of the Bradford substation mentioned in plaintiffs’ complaint and in the quotation from the <em>Phillips </em>case, supra, which was also approved by the Commission as a necessary adjunct to the proposed transmission line here involved.</p>
    <p id="b44-4" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[238,1096,1148,871]]]'>Thus it has been made abundantly clear that the transmission line is necessary for the service of the public. It is equally clear that since the electric company cannot condemn the defendants’ property because the proposed line will pass within 300 feet of a dwelling thereon (see Act of May 21, 1921, P. L. 1057, 15 PS §1182, referred to supra), this over-all important project necessary for the public service, located throughout with the approval of the Public Utility Commission, must fail unless the company acquires the defendants’ land by purchase. Nevertheless, while admitting that the transmission line is necessary for the service of the public, it is contended that equity may not sanction the breach by the individual defendants of their agreement with the plaintiffs. Under the circumstances here presented, we must disagree.</p>

In 43 C.J.S., Injunctions, §31, p. 465, it is stated: “On an application for an injunction it is the duty of the court to take into consideration the injury or inconvenience which may <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>result to tlie public if an injunction is awarded. Accordingly, while there are cases in which an injunction has been granted, ordinarily, when the issuance of an injunction will cause serious public inconvenience or loss, without a correspondingly great advantage to complainant, no injunction will be granted, and this is so, even though, as against defendant, complainant would be entitled to its issuance. The general rule under consideration has been applied where the allowance of an injunction would seriously interfere with or work detriment to public works or works of public benefit, where the issuance of the injunction asked would result in cutting off the public water supply, or the supply of electricity for lights and power, . .

These cases are clearly distinguishable. Both were cases of nuisance. In the <em>Evans </em>ease, supra, the operation of defendant’s plant for manufacturing fertilizing materials, and in the <em>Quinn </em>case, the operation of defendant’s plant for manufacturing iron and steel springs, was enjoined as injurious to the health and comfort of the respective individual complainants. Appellants quote excerpts from the opinions of the court in these casés as supporting their position. In the first place, the language employed in each of the opinions must be related to the issue decided; when it goes beyond that, it must be considered dictum, and indeed even as dictum it does not under the circumstances here presented, support the appellants’ contention. It is evident that in each of the two cases it was argued that the operation of the defendant’s manufacturing plant was in the public interest to an extent that justified the application of the principle that an injunction will be refused where its grant would be against the public welfare. The Court recognized this well established principle but held in effect that although the public generally was interested in and benefited from the operation of the industry in each case, such interest and benefit was not sufficient to overcome the complainant’s right to enjoy the occupancy of his property free from <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>the deleterious effects of the operation of the defendant’s business. Where the principle here involved comes into play, the extent of the public interest and benefit is the test. See <em>Elliott Nursery Co. v. Duquesne Light Co., </em>supra, where this Court upheld the refusal to enjoin the operation of defendant’s electric power plant. In the instant case more than substantial benefit to the public is involved. We are concerned with the supply of light, heat and power which are not merely beneficial but, as appellants admit, and the Public Utility Commission has found, <em>necessary </em>for the public welfare.</p>
