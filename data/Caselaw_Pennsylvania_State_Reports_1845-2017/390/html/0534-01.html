At the time of the accident, about 7:20 p.m. on August 1, 1951, Janet, aged 12, accompanied by Barry Balach, aged 11, and Carole Malone, aged 11, went to the park. The playground covered approximately 25 acres which included a baseball field, a softball field, two tennis courts, and an area with swings, sliding boards and sand boxes. It is open to the public from one p.m. to nine p.m., Monday through Friday during the summer season. Two recreation leaders, a man and a woman, are assigned to the playground during these hours. It was customary for the male recreation leader, John W. O’Rourke, to take his supper hour between 5:30 and 6:30, and for the female recreation leader, Noranne Ott, to take her supper hour from 6:30 to 7:30, because experience had shown that that period of time was least heavily attended, probably because users of the playground were themselves at dinner. Mrs. Ott had passed through the swing area at the time she went to supper at 6:30. O’Rourke had not been in that part of the park for twenty minutes to half an hour.</p>
    <p id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.7",556,[256,1682,1144,422]]]'>The children went right to the swings and started to wrap up the chains, stand up on the swings, twist the swings around, and let them unwind. The spinning motion resulting from the unwinding of the swing made Janet dizzy and she fell over backwards. She sustained a compound fracture of the right ulna and radius and her right arm had to be amputated between the elbow and shoulder.</p>

The City has appealed <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>from the judgment entered on each verdict, contending it is entitled to a judgment non obstante veredicto.</p>

O’Rourke was supervising or engaging in a baseball game<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> which was in a part of the park from which he could not see the swings. Had he seen plaintiff twisting and winding the swings he would have stopped her.

Children of all ages have used swings for many generations; sometimes they consist of a rope tied to a tree limb; more often, two ropes tied to a tree limb with a piece of wood for a seat. Young children, even •as young as four years old, have from time immemorial, used such swings, swung too high or too wide or too fast, swung double, climbed the ropes, twisted the ropes, pushed each other into the path of the swing; and done many other things while playing which every man, woman and child, and certainly every parent knows minor children do, but which involve risk, danger or injury and are forbidden by playground safety rules.</p>

A municipality maintaining a park or playground must exercise reasonable care to keep the property in reasonably safe condition for those who lawfully come upon it, and must also furnish reasonable policing and supervision of it in order to protect children who customarily play there: <em>Hill v.

A boy, 12 years old, climbed on the upper side of the <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>ladder and got Ms hand caught in the pivoting mechanism. This had happened on prior occasions to other boys and the attendants chased them off when they saw them there. Plaintiff contended there, as here, that the park did not provide adequate and reasonable supervision to prevent injury to children. The Court (1) held '(a) that plaintiff was liable only for ordinary care and prudence and (b) that this did not require the <em>constant </em>presence of an attendant; and (2) granted a judgment n.o.v. for the defendant.</p>

Such a standard and, to be more specific, the standard advocated by this plaintiff, cannot be adopted because it would impose so high and so unreasonable a degree of care as to make the city, in practical effect, an insurer of the safety of every child who enters the playground.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a>

Cooper, the minor-plaintiff in this case, lost her right arm as the result of riding on one of the swings provided by the City of Pittsburgh in McKinley Park, Many of the children using these chain swings would twist them until the chains wound tight, whereupon they would release the tension by lifting their feet from the ground and spinning rapidly, enjoying the vertiginous sensation created by the rapidly turning seat on which they sat. The revolving ride produced a dizziness which, while pleasurable, as intoxication is pleasurable to the drinker, frequently deprived the rider of a sense of balance and direction.</p>

The management knew that swings could and were being misused. Why did not someone on behalf of the management appear at the swings to instruct the children on correct behavior at the swings? Why did the City not post signs warning children that swing-twisting was prohibited? Did the City use reasonable care under the circumstances? The jury said it did not.

But the litigation involved here has nothing to do with the entire park as such. We are here concerned only with that small segment 'of terrain which was under the immediate jurisdiction of Recreational Leader O’Rourke.

Since when have supervisors been needed to tell children how to organize a game which is as familiar to them as walking and running?
