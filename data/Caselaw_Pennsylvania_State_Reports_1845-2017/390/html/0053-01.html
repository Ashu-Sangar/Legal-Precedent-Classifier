Wanamaker applied for a building permit and on August 27, 1956 the building inspector of the township gave verbal authorization to proceed with the necessary grading. From this administrative action the defendants lodged an appeal<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> with the Zoning Board of Adjustment under Section 3107 of the Act of June 24, 1931, P.

A preliminary injunction issued, but this was dissolved by the chancellor on December 28, 1956 on the ground that the statutory remedy which exists at law for taking appeals from the issuance of building permits is exclusive, and therefore the action in equity will not lie.

Appellant’s contention is that in the instant case it is ''. . . not asking that the court take jurisdiction of zoning matters but we are asking for relief on two well recognized grounds for the exercise of equity jurisprudence, the doctrine of res adjudicata and the function of bills of peace.”. It is argued that “res adjudicata” applies because the issues in the appeals which appel<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>lant wants to bar defendants from, pursuing have already been determined by the Superior Court in <em>Putney v.

Having no such grievance, obviously it requires no remedy. Its complaint is that defendants have been pursuing <em>their </em>statutory remedy against a zoning decision allegedly aggrieving them. The question here is not whether plaintiff has the right to defend the granting of a permit against defendants’ attack — which it unquestionably has — but whether it may take positive action by bill in equity to bar the defendants from pursuing a remedy guaranteed them by the Legislature. Plaintiff is asking that a court of equity enjoin the defendants from pursuing that very remedy which the General Assem<a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>bly has seen fit to prescribe, Act of June 24, 1931, P. L. 1206, Art. XXXI, §3107, as amended, 53 PS §19092-3107. A court of equity, ordinarily, would not be permitted to so contravene the clearly stated intention of the Legislature.</p>
    <p id="b78-4" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[234,605,1149,810]]]'>Plaintiff apparently recognizes this for it contends that the ruling of the <em>Knup v. Philadelphia, </em>case and its many predecessors does not apply here because this is not a zoning matter, but rather a question of res adjudicata and 'an action for a bill of peace. In so far as the decision of the Superior Court in <em>Putney v. Ahington Township, </em><a href="/citations/?q=70%20Montg.%20102" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="70 Montg. 102">supra,</a> rules the constitutional issues raised by the defendants in their appeals brought pursuant to Section 3107 of The First Class Township Code, there can be no question but that the Court of Common Pleas is quite capable of applying in the zoning proceedings, the doctrine of res adjudicata if applicable. Certainly the aid of a court of equity is unnecessary in the application of so basic a legal principle.</p>
    <p id="b78-5" data-blocks='[["BL_78.5",78,[227,1429,1150,871]],["BL_79.1",79,[172,335,1152,876]]]'>It is, of course, hornbook laAV that equity may take cognizance of a controversy in order to prevent repeated litigation of the same issue, but Ave are of the opinion that this is not a controversy where this jurisdictional basis is appropriate. What is the nature of the litigation that plaintiff is desirous of averting? Actually it is not litigation Avhich defendants might independently initiate, but rather appeals from the grant of building permits taken by defendants as parties who consider themselves “aggrieved ... by any decision of the administrative officer”. There are no independent vexatious suits here indicated, only “appeals” — which must be prosecuted under the statute Avith reasonable promptness — and these have specifically been permitted by the Legislature.- The litigiousness of which appellant complains is in reality limited <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>by the number of building permits for which application is made by plaintiff itself or its grantees. If and when the issues on an appeal are decided in plaintiff’s favor, res adjudicata or stare decisis will protect it in subsequent appeals raising the same issues. But as building designs and proposed business uses vary with the unlimited ingenuity of architects and business men, no single decree can possibly comprehend the variety of building permit issues which might arise in the future. Thus the prayed-for decree enjoining an attack on “the granting of building permits, in respect to buildings to be erected at <em>any time </em>hereafter on <em>any land” </em>encompassing the 30 acres owned by plaintiff, the 20 owned by Wanamaker and the 5 owned by Van Sciver, would require a reading of the future beyond the mortal powers of any court.</p>

There are many property owners in the general area, any one of whom could, if aggrieved, bring an appeal from the issuance of a building permit on the land now owned by appellant, and each of these appeals would have to be disposed of on its own particular merits. The injunction which appellant seeks would not of itself bar appeals by other “aggrieved” persons. The injury of which appellant complains is no greater than that attendant any rezoning in that multitude of instances where there is substantial resistance by the residents of the area to a proposed change. Any purchaser in such an instance would take with knowledge that his building permit application might be subject to the statutory appeal by aggrieved property owners, and it is not uncommon for potential purchasers in such situations to demand appropriate guarantees from their vendors. Appellant is not peculiarly harmed in the in<a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>stant case; indeed, it has already had the benefit of one adjudication in favor of its proposed use, and its position is therefore much more favorable than that of other potential vendors who find themselves in similar situations. And while appellant seems to be convinced that the defendants will indulge in repeated litigation by appealing every time a building permit is applied for, we cannot assume that this will be the case. Defendants have already lost a general attack on the rezoning ordinance before the court of quarter sessions and the Superior Court. They are undoubtedly prosecuting appeals from the particular building permits which have been granted to Yan Sciver and Wanamaker since the institution of this suit. Should they lose those appeals, we cannot assume that they will continue with further costly and presumably futile litigation. If such a situation should develop, and it became patent that the defendants are engaged in purely malicious litigation, then the appropriate forum would certainly not be powerless to apply suitable remedies to such vexatious litigation; but the case has not so ripened at the present time.</p>

Goldvarg </em>case, the complaining adjoining property owners had withdrawn their objections to a zoning change, which would have been otherwise refused, when the defendant entered into an agreement with them to limit his proposed construction to duplex apartments. When the defendant secured a building permit and proceeded to construct a 14-family, 3-story apartment building, the adjoining property owners brought an action to restrain him from violating the agreement with them. The Court found, at page 95: “. . . It is quite apparent that no remedy at law could adequately protect the property rights of plaintiffs from Goldvarg’s attempt to violate his agreement and to proceed to construct the proposed apartment building under an alleged invalid ordinance. The present controversy is not the ordinary zoning case in which disgruntled neighbors seek to contest the validity of an ordinance merely, or to question the administrative decision of either the building inspector or the Board of Adjustment. It would be absurd to compel plaintiffs, under the circumstances here involved, to proceed at law under either the Act of 1923 or that of 1927, supra, for the obvious reason that while such litigation was in progress, defendants’ building would be erected and as a result irreparable damages Avould be sustained by plaintiffs. . . .”.</p>
