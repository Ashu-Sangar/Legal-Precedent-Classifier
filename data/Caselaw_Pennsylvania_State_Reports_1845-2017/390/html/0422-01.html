L. 1145, as amended, 53 P.S. §§6851-6859. The ordinance, which is re-enacted annually, adopts the assessments on personal property of residents of the city made by the officials of the County of Allegheny in administering the county personal property tax and uses the assessments so made to determine the amount of tax due the city under its ordinance. While the statute providing for the county personal property tax specifically permits retroactive as<a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>sessment of the tax against the estate of a decedent for a period of five years after the property should have been returned for taxation, Act of June 17, 1913, P. L. 507, as amended, 72 P.S. §§4821-4844.2, there is no similar legislative authority for the retroactive assessment and collection of the city tax.</p>
    <p id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.4",444,[249,680,1145,826]]]'>The decedent Morrow, prior to his death in 1954 failed to file personal property tax returns either with the county or the city for the years 1951 to 1954. From the inventory which was filed in his estate the county obtained the necessary information and computed the amount of the personal property taxes which were due and delinquent. The city received this information from the county and billed the estate for the amount due it under its personal property tax ordinance for the years in which no assessments or payments were made. At the audit of the estate, the city’s claim was contested and subsequently denied by the auditing judge. After exceptions were dismissed by the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County, en banc, this appeal by the city followed.</p>
