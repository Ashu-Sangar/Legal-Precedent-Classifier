If Holden had actually spoken to Jones the words which Jones related in his interpretation of the wink, no more effective admission of guilty knowledge could be imagined. Jones and Holden had been to<a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>gether prior to the killing. Holden tells Jones to make up an alibi so that Jones can extend their companionship of the evening to an hour including and beyond the time of the killing. And then Jones not only refuses to do what Holden asks him to do, but relates the criminal attempt on the part of Holden to suborn perjury.</p>
    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[249,728,1144,490]]]'>But the fact of the matter is that Holden did not ask Jones to fabricate an alibi. He did not ask him to “cover up some of his actions.” All that Holden did was to wink. No one knows whether he was trying to convey a message, whether he was attempting to shut out a strong ray of light, or whether a bit of dust troubled him at the moment. The Court, however, allowed the jury to believe that the wink was a semaphorie signal to Jones to commit perjury.</p>
    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[247,1238,1145,370]]]'>Was ever more ridiculous evidence presented in a murder trial? What is to happen to our rules of evidence in criminal trials if they can be breached so glaringly, without reproof or criticism by this Court? Holden was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. He might have been sentenced to death. On a wink.</p>
    <p id="b250-6" data-blocks='[["BL_250.6",250,[246,1637,1145,97]]]'>And the Majority does not consider the matter of sufficient importance even to mention it.</p>
