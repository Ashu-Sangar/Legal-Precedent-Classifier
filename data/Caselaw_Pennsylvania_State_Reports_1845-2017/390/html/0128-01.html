As each Kampmann grandchild attained the age of twenty-five years, testator directed his trustees to pay “from the aforesaid one-half of the total income of my residuary estate, . . . [after payments for maintenance, support and education] a sum which in the uncontrolled discretion of my said trustees, . . . shall be necessary and proper for the support and maintenance of” each such grandchild, but in no event to exceed $25,000 annually. Testator then made the provision which raises the present controversy. “At any time during the life of my said grandchildren” [after the Kampmann grandchild attained the age of twenty-five years] “I authorize my trustees in their uncontrolled discretion to pay to such grandchild an amount of principal which shall be deemed necessary or proper for the business or other uses of such grandchild, . . .” provided all such payments shall not exceed the sum of $50,000 of principal. Testator then directed that no moneys, either principal or income should ever be paid over by any of the Kampmann grandchildren to their father, directly or indirectly, and any such payment would result in forfeiture by that beneficiary of any income or any payments under testator’s will.</p>

Equally different is the provision about the duration of the trust and the payments of principal. Testator provided, after provisions for payment of income to the University of Pennsylvania, on failure of issue of each Kampmann grandchild: “(c) Upon the death of the <em>survivor </em>of my said [Kampmann] grandchildren, then I direct that the principal of one-half of my residuary estate shall be distributed equally among the children then living of my said grandchildren, share and share alike, <em>per capita </em>and not per stirpes.” In other words, the Macklin great-grandchildren, upon the death of their respective parent, received absolutely their respective share, per stirpes, of the principal from which their parent had been receiving the income; whereas, the great-grandchildren in the Kampmann line received their share of the principal, not upon the death of their respective parent, but (if living) at <em>the death of the survivor </em>of all the Kampmann grandchildren, <em>and then per capita </em>and not per stirpes.</p>

It. seems to us the more plausible reason for testator’s clearly expressed inequality is that the testator, for undisclosed personal reasons, apparently cordially disliked Kampmann and preferred his daughter, Phoebe Macklin and the Macklin line to the Kampmann line. The testator had provided for the maintenance, support and education of the Kampmann children and the cost •and expense of their marriage, and the purchase of a home, but had limited their income to $25,000 a. year. Under such circumstances, it seems natural that..he would want to give each of them out of their family <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>share of the principal, $50,000, if, in the discretion of the trustees, it was necessary or desirable for business or other purposes, since they could not save out of $25,000 income a year as much as the Macklins could out of their unlimited income. The <em>inequality </em>between the two lines ivas the carefully considered intent and clearly expressed will of the testator, and furnishes no ground for a construction of the will in order to restore equality to the Kampmanns.</p>

Moreover, the Kampmanns’ construction of the will would nullify the testator’s general plan or scheme of his Avill and Avould particularly negate his provisions in 7 B (2) that as each Macklin grandchild died, his or her issue should <em>forthwith receive </em>a share of the principal corresponding to the share of income Avhicli their parent had been receiving. The Kampmann construction would require Macklin grandchildren to repay principal which they had received, if any Kampmann, subsequent to a Macklin death,, demanded and received $50,000 principal. In the alternative, if, for example, one or both Macklin grandchildren died (as could easily happen) years before any or all of the Kampmann grandchildren received their $50,000 of principal, the Court would have to set aside $150,000 of principal out of the entire principal of the trust and hold the same intact <em>until the death of the last survivor of the Kampmann grandchildren. </em>This flies directly in the teeth of the testator’s language disposing of principal to each Macklin great-grandchild and his clearly expressed scheme of giving to each of his Macklin great-grandchildren their share' per -stirpes <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>of the principal of the residuary estate, upon the death of their respective parent.</p>
