He performed his contract from October, 1930, until February or March, 1931. His bill was $8,756.07; defendants admitted at the trial that the work was done and the charges reasonable. He brought this action against both owners August 31,1937, to recover a balance of $1,288 with interest. The jury found for the plaintiff, obviously a just finding, and rendered a verdict of $5,008. The wife defendant moved for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v. After the motions were refused, judgments were entered on the verdict and this appeal was taken on behalf of the wife.</p>

In plaintiff’s books, inartistically kept, the accounts of the transaction sometimes appear under the titles, Frank Vitori, Frank Vitori and Angelina Vitori, Vitori Job, Clairton Job. In 1931, plaintiff took Vitori’s judgment note for $5,000 on account, crediting it to the Frank and Angelina Vitori account and leaving a small balance unsecured. Subsequently, as payments on account were made, Frank Vitori’s judgment notes for smaller sums were substituted until December, 1931, when his $3,200 note, the last of the series, was taken. Appellant contends that by taking her husband’s judgment note for $3,200 and entering judgment on it, plaintiff released her. Unless that was the intention<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> of the parties, she would not be released; whether it was their intention depends on evidence, and, as there was evidence that they did not intend, by giving and receiving the notes, to pay or extinguish the joint debt, the appel<a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>lant is bound by the verdict. A part of that evidence is also relevant in considering the defense of limitations, and will be referred to in connection with the second point.</p>
    <p id="b191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[204,516,1152,811]]]'>The learned trial judge affirmed the following point for charge on behalf of defendants: “8th — Even if the jury should find from the evidence that Frank Vitori and Angelina Vitori both entered into an agreement with the plaintiff to do the plumbing and heating work for them jointly and that Angelina Vitori was jointly liable to the plaintiff for the cost of doing this work in the first instance, nevertheless, if the jury also should find that the plaintiff accepted the note of Frank Vitori alone for the balance owing and if the jury should find from the evidence that this suit is based on the $3,200 note dated December 8, 1931, and signed by Frank Vi-tori alone, then and in such case the plaintiff is not entitled to recover against Angelina Vitori and their verdict should be against the defendant Frank Vitori only.”</p>

The jury was amply justified in finding that the contract was made by both husband and wife though the details of plan, construction and material were prescribed by Vitori on behalf of himself and as agent for his wife, the other tenant: compare <em>O’Malley v.

Mrs. Yitori denied making these statements but another witness, plaintiff’s attorney, called in rebuttal, testified that he, on behalf of the plaintiff, had a conversation with both Vitoris concerning this claim and that when he informed “both of them, ‘If this claim is not paid in two weeks, Wickerham is going to enter suit.’ Mrs. Vitori immediately said, ‘Oh mister, please, no make suit. No make case. Me pay.’ ” She also said: “No, don’t enter suit, I will pay this claim within two weeks.”</p>
