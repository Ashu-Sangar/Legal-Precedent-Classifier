Hershberger and the alleged maker Samuel W. Hershberger, his son. David M. Hershberger died April 15, 1934, and Samuel W. Hershberger October 26, 1936. In October, 1937, Arra Hershberger, daughter of David and administratrix c. t. a., d. b. n. of his estate, found the note in the pocket of his shirt in the bureau drawer of the room he had occupied. Defendant, Mary Katherine B. Hershberger, widow of Samuel and administratrix of his estate, denied any indebtedness of Samuel to David and averred that the note sued upon was a forgery. A verdict was recovered by plaintiff, but the court in banc held that the note should not have been admitted in evidence because of unexplained alterations upon its face, and entered judgment for defendant n. o. v.</p>

It is true that the burden was on plaintiff to establish its genuineness: <em>Austen v.

One of plaintiff’s witnesses testified that he had worked for thirteen years in a bank and trust company where Samuel W.

Another witness testified that he had been employed for twenty-one years at another bank where Samuel had an account, had seen him write his name, and was familiar with his signature; on various occasions Samuel had presented checks bearing his signature which the witness cashed; he identified the signature on the note in suit as that of Samuel W. Hershberger. A third witness, who had had business dealings with him through a long course of years also identified the signature; he testified that he had seen “dozens” of Samuel’s signatures on cancelled checks.</p>

The witnesses were not called as handwriting experts although at least the first two of them might have qualified as such <em>(Seaman v. Husband, </em><a href="/pa/256/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="256 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1030783" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0571-01">256 Pa. 571</a>, 575, 576, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.%20941" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="100 A. 941">100 A. 941</a>, 942, 943). While checks were exhibited to them and the signatures thereon identified by them as genuine they did not base their opinion as to the authenticity of the signature on the note in suit by comparing it with the checks; therefore the rule is not applicable that, to warrant the introduction into evidence of a writing offered as a standard, there must be evidence by a person who saw the party write it, or an admission by such party of its being genuine, or evidence of equal authority <em>(Shannon v.

The witnesses gave their opinions merely as persons acquainted with Samuel’s handwriting, as permitted by the Act of May 15, 1895, <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>P. L. 69, section 1. One of them testified he had seen Samuel write his name, but that is not a necessary qualification in order to enable a non-expert to testify as to the genuineness of a disputed signature. The only requirement is that he be acquainted with the handwriting of the alleged signer, and such acquaintance may be obtained in many ways, for example, from an assumption that signatures were genuine which he had long acted upon as such without challenge: <em>United States v. Simpson, </em><a href="/pen-w/3/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="3 Pen. &amp; W. 437" data-case-ids="1827576" data-case-paths="/pen-w/3/0437-01">3 P. &amp; W. 437</a>, 441; <em>Berkley v.

Superior Ct. 171</a>, 182-185. Here the witnesses had for many years charged to Samuel’s account money paid out in reliance upon the genuineness of the signature of his checks and he had never questioned these transactions. Certainly such a course of dealing was sufficient to acquaint them with his handwriting and to enable them to express an opinion as to the signature in controversy.</p>
    <p id="b523-3" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[190,1289,1155,973]]]'>The present suit was brought within a year after Samuel’s death in order to preserve the lien of the debt on his real estate in accordance with the provisions of the Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, section 15(a). The writ was originally issued against Mary Katherine B. Hershberger, Executrix of the Estate of Samuel W. Hershberger, Deceased. It being ascertained that Samuel had died intestate and that Mary Katherine B. Hershberger was not the executrix but the administratrix of his estate, plaintiff amended the caption of the case accordingly. Defendant insists that, as this change was not made within one year of Samuel’s death, the lien was lost. The amendment, however, did not effect a change in the identity of the person against whom the suit was brought; that person was the legal representative of the estate, and whether, as such fiduciary, she was an executrix or an administratrix is, in this connection, wholly unimportant.</p>
    <p id="b523-4" data-blocks='[["BL_523.5",523,[191,2275,1151,98]],["BL_524.1",524,[203,301,1162,2072]],["BL_525.1",525,[214,294,1152,485]]]'>On February 16, 1940, plaintiff caused a writ of scire facias to issue against Mary Katherine B. Hersh<a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>berger in her individual capacity as widow, and Daniel S., Arra A., and Charles D. Hershberger as heirs at law, of. Samuel W. Hershberger; the writ commanded them to appear and show “why the said lien should not be revived and the lien continued.” On motion of the administratrix the court quashed the writ. This was error. Plaintiff was confronted by a dilemma. Due to no fault of her own, but to the granting by the court of a new trial and, later, the entry of judgment n. o. v., the judgment to which plaintiff is entitled was not obtained by her. Meanwhile-the lien of the debt against the real estate would have been lost if a scire facias had not issued within six years from Samuel’s death: <em>Kirk v. Van Horn, </em><a href="/pa/265/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="265 Pa. 549" data-case-ids="1051892" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0549-01">265 Pa. 549</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.%20522" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="109 A. 522">109 A. 522</a>; accordingly plaintiff issued the writ in order to preserve the lien. It is urged by defendant that unless and until a judgment was recovered within that period a writ of scire facias would not lie. The Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, section 15 (a) provides that the debts of a decedent are to remain a lien on the real estate only for the period of five years (after the expiration of one year from the decease of the debtor) unless “the same,” that is, the lien, be revived by writ of scire facias against the decedent, his heirs, executors, or administrators “in the manner now provided in the case of the revival of judgments.” The revival, therefore, is not of the judgment but of the lien, which is to be revived in the same manner as judgments are revived; the judgment itself does not create a new lien as a judgment ordinarily- would, but merely prevents the lapse of the lien created by the statute: <em>Kirk v. Van Horn, </em><a href="/pa/265/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="265 Pa. 549" data-case-ids="1051892" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0549-01">265 Pa. 549</a>, 553, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.%20522" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="109 A. 522">109 A. 522</a>, 523. Under the act the plaintiff might, at his election, have joined the widow and heirs in the original suit; if, instead of this, they are brought subsequently on the record they are thereby afforded full opportunity to contest the claim by interposing any and all defenses to the merits: <em>First National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Bethlehem v. Laubach, </em><a href="/pa/333/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="333 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="1187935" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0344-01">333 Pa. 344</a>, 347, 348, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20139" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="5 A.2d 139">5 A.2d 139</a>, 142. The statute requires that the lien “be <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>duly prosecuted to judgment,” but not necessarily that judgment be obtained within the six-year period: <em>Hook v. McCune, </em><a href="/pa/184/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="184 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="988001" data-case-paths="/pa/184/0292-01">184 Pa. 292</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.%2072" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="39 A. 72">39 A. 72</a>. It could not have been intended that where, through no fault of a plaintiff, the obtaining of judgment is delayed beyond that period, the lien cannot be preserved.
