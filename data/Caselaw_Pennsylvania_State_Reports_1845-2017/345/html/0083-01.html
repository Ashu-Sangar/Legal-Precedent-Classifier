Keenan owned the land, in <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>the city of Easton, now owned and occupied by the plaintiffs, and which then had constructed on it a three-story stone building occupied as her residence; she also owned the adjoining vacant lot, now owned by the defendants. This lot she conveyed by deed containing the following covenant: “It is hereby understood and agreed between the parties hereto that one residence only shall be built on the above described tract of land and said residence shall not be nearer to Shawnee Avenue than twenty (20) feet.” The defendants subsequently acquired the land and constructed a residence which satisfied the restriction. In 1940 they proposed to alter the house into residences for two families. After a hearing on bill, answer, replication and testimony, the learned court dismissed the bill on the ground that such alteration was not a violation of the restriction.</p>

It is unnecessary to consider near-synonyms nor to resort to rules of construction. The question simply is whether one family or a number of families should at one time occupy the land. Some of the apparent difficulties suggested in argument perhaps result from attempts first to ascertain meanings attributed in other cases to restrictive phrases having some general resemblance to that in the record, and then to substitute such definitions for the words in this deed.</p>

The limiting words “one” and “only” must also be given their necessary effect. “Residence,” in its popular as well as its dictionary sense, means a place of abode; it is where one lives, either alone, or with one’s family; the family is the generally recognized unit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> By using the word “residence” and limiting its scope by the words “one” and “only” the parties agreed that during the existence of the covenant one place of abode only should be built for occupation by one person alone or with his family. If they had not intended so to limit the use of the land they would have used less restrictive words such as those considered in cases referred to in the argument. If, for example, they had restricted the use of the land to one dwelling house, or to one building, an apartment house would have been within this agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Obviously, they did not intend that an apartment house should be a use agreed to.</p>

The building restriction which gave rise to this litigation is clearly ambiguous. The stipulation that “one residence only shall be built” on the tract of land can be interpreted as meaning a residence for <em>one family </em>and it can also be just as reasonably interpreted as meaning <em>one building </em>used for residential purposes by one or more families. The <em>unity </em>stipulated for can as well mean <em>unity </em>of structure as <em>unity </em>of family. Webster’s New International Dictionary defines “residence” as “the house where one’s home is; a dwelling house”. Dwelling house is defined in the same dictionary as “a house, or some<a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>times part of a house, occupied as a residence, in distinction from a store, office or other building.”</p>

If two or more residences were built on each lot, the area would have a more congested appearance. (It is true that under the language of the restriction one structure could cover the entire lot so long as it was not built “nearer to Shawnee Avenue than 20 feet”, but it is a reasonable inference that neither party had in mind that any such sprawling “residence” would be built.) It may also well be that the grantor intended to restrict the building on this lot to a residence for only one family. If that was his purpose he could easily have said so by hyphening the word “family” after “one”. It is his own fault that he used ambiguous language and it is well settled that where a provision in a deed admits of two constructions, it will be construed most strongly against the grantor or most favorably to the grantee: <em>Collison v.

In such a situation that interpretation is to be preferred which best serves the public interest. It is a matter of common knowledge that on account of constantly increasing taxes and other adverse economic conditions owners of <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>city dwelling houses originally built for one family have found it necessary to convert their houses into “duplexes”. Such multiple<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> dwelling houses in cities have generally not proved to be out of keeping with the “residential character” of the neighborhood.

    <p id="b168-7" data-blocks='[["BL_168.8",168,[206,1077,1163,1019]]]'>. It seems to me clear that the restriction “one residence only shall be built on the above described tract of land and said residence shall not be nearer to Shawnee Avenue than twenty (20) feet” is a restriction on the <em>number of houses </em>to be built on the tract, and not on the <em>occupancy </em>of the house when built other than that it be for residential purposes. The word “residence” in the “phrase “one residence only shall be built” refers obviously to the <em>building </em>or <em>structure, </em>as is shown further by the provision that “said residence shall not be nearer to Shawnee Avenue than twenty (20) feet.” That “one residence only shall be built” means that two or more residences — houses—dwellings—shall not be built. Even if the wording of the restriction be deemed ambiguous, the rule — which the majority opinion admits, but to which, it seems to me, it gives merely lip service —is that all limitations on the free use of property are to be construed strictly. I therefore dissent, and would affirm the decree.</p>
