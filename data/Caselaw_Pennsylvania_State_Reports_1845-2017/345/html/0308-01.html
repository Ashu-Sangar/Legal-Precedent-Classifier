Bayer, a resident of the Commonwealth, died May 23, 1940, and left nine single-premium refund annuity contracts made with seven different insurance companies, bearing various dates from December 27, 1933, to April 26,1937, the total of the single premiums unrefunded being §37,080.84. There were some variations in the terms of the contracts but for present purposes we shall consider one as typical. It states the age of the annuitant as 51 years 10 months; that the “single premium” is §18,108, for which the company promises to pay to Bayer, “the annuitant,” §100 monthly “during the lifetime of said annuitant, such payments to terminate with the last payment due prior to the death of said annuitant, except that if the death of the annuitant occurs before the total of annuity payments made by the Company is equal to the sum paid by the annuitant as a single premium for this contract, the Company will continue the annuity payments to Martha E. Magraw . . . until the total annuity payments made shall equal the single premium paid, without interest.”</p>

L. 521, as amended, 72 PS section 2301, imposing a tax on “the transfer of any property, real or personal, or of any interest therein or income therefrom, in trust or otherwise, to persons or corporations in the following cases: ... (c) When the transfer is of property made by a resident ... by deed, grant, bargain, sale or gift, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor, vendor, or donor, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after such death.” The other provision is clause (d), providing: “The proceeds of policies of life insurance, payable otherwise then to the estate of the insured, and whether paid directly by the insurer to the beneficiaries designated in the policies, or to a trustee designated therein, and held, managed, and distributed by such trustee to or for the benefit of such persons or classes of persons under such plan and in such estates as may have been prescribed by <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>the insured under agreement with such trustee, shall not be included in imposing any tax under this section.”</p>

The subject taxed was the interest in the contract intended by him then to take effect in possession or enjoyment, i. e., the company’s obligation to repay any remaining balance of the amount received as the single premium. As these annuity contracts, like various forms of life insurance policies in which the right to change the beneficiary has been reserved, provide for the transfer of property “to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after” death, they are directly within the words of clause (c).

By the Act of April 15, 1868, P. L. 103, entitled “Relating to Policies of Life Insurance and Annuities” it was provided that such policies or annuities for the benefit of wife, children or any dependent relative, should be exempt from claims of creditors of such person.

Life insurance is an agreement to pay, to a person indicated, a certain sum upon the death of the insured ; the endowment provision adds thereto a contract to pay to the insured himself a specified sum provided he lives to a certain age. Life insurance is for protection against the adversity of death; endowment is based upon the contingency of survival, and is essentially a form of investment.”</p>

If, with these definitions in mind, the simple life insurance contract is contrasted with the traditional annuity contract, it will be observed that, in the case of life insurance, for annual premiums payable to the company (which in effect are annuities paid by <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>the insured) the company will pay a specified sum at the insured’s death; whereas the converse is true of the annuity contract, for, in that transaction the annuitant pays the single sum in consideration of which the company makes annual payments to him. The amount paid on the insurance policy at the insured’s death pursuant to the obligation created in his lifetime, is a transfer of property vesting in possession or enjoyment at his death and would be subject to the inheritance tax but for the exemption in clause (d). We are, of course, now considering contracts in which the right to change the beneficiary has been reserved, because such beneficiary has no vested interest in the policy or its proceeds during the insured’s lifetime, but only an expectancy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> See <em>Knoche v.
