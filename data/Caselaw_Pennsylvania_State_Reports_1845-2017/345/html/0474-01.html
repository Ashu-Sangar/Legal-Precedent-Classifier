He stopped the car about three feet off the paved portion of the highway and on the <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>easterly berm, to allow Mrs. Miller to alight and cross the road to a spring. The car was stopped about 123 feet north of a point opposite the spring. To go to the spring on the opposite side, it would have been necessary to travel a distance, fixed by Tarr, “between 140 and 150 feet,” by crossing the road diagonally or by going south along the east side of the road until she reached a point opposite the spring and then crossing the road. Mr. Tarr testified that he saw Mrs. Miller alight on the right side of his car and walk southward though he did not see what she did after passing the rear of his car. He dimmed his car lights and then observed, approaching from the north, the lights of defendant’s truck proceeding south “around the curve” at a distance fixed by Tarr as “from 1500 to 2000 feet” away. Tarr got out of his car, rolled a cigarette and then heard a crash. There was no traffic on the highway other than defendant’s truck, between the time Tarr stopped his car and the time when he heard the crash. Mrs. Miller’s body was thrown to the west side of the highway, after being struck by the right front fender of defendant’s truck. On the night of the accident, two Pennsylvania Motor Patrol officers questioned Gault about it. The plaintiff called these officers as his witnesses. Officer Barry testified that Gault informed him that Mrs. Miller was “in the center lane when I noticed her” and “appeared to be moving fast as though she was running . . . toward the west.” Officer Krzton testified that Gault said Mrs. Miller was “approximately 20 feet from the front of his vehicle and apparently in the center of the road . . . traveling from east to west running.”</p>

I do not think that the negligence of the victim, Mrs. Miller, “clearly appears”. Certainly the evidence of her negligence is not so clear that “there is no room for fair and sensible men to differ in their conclusions”, and <em>that </em>is the standard by which to decide whether or not a question of contributory negligence should be submitted to the jury, as we declared in <em>McCracken v.

First, she was crossing a 30-foot unlighted highway after dark, as she had a right to do. This highway was straight 2,335 feet northward to a curve, from the point where Mrs. Miller alighted from the car driven by Tarr. Secondly, the defendant’s truck was being driven at a reckless rate of speed. As Mrs. Miller started southward on the eastern berm of the highway, Tarr “noticed the lights of a car just breaking around the curve, coming down the grade”, i. e., southward. This curve was 2,300 feet away. Tarr started to roll a cigarette and had “about finished” doing so “when a motor vehicle roared by and in less than a second a crash”. When a car travels 123 feet in a second, its speed is 82 miles an hour. There is also very convincing circumstantial evidence as to the truck’s grossly excessive speed. Mrs. Miller’s body was lying between 50 and 70 feet beyond where it was hit and the truck came to a stop 70 feet south of her body. Thus it ran 120 to 140 feet after hitting her. From this fact alone the jury could find that Gault’s speed was illegal and excessive. “The test of control is the ability to stop quickly and easily.”: <em>Loran v. Rinehart, </em><a href="/pa/243/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="243 Pa. 231" data-case-ids="1001584" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0231-01">243 Pa. 231</a>, 234, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20A.%20967" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="89 A. 967">89 A. 967</a>; <em>Smith v.

Other proof of Gault’s illegal and excessive speed were these facts: The headlights of the truck were bent back against the radiator; a large oval dent was made on the metal fender; the metal mounting of the rear-vision mirror was broken. One of Mrs. Miller’s shoes was found 40 feet from her body and she was so mangled by the force of the “crash” that the record’s description of her head and body injuries is shocking to one’s sensibilities.

In <em>Adams v.

The majority opinion says: “It was her duty to look for and to see what was clearly visible; she must be taken as having seen the defendant’s approaching truck and having carelessly attempted to cross in front of it.” (citing <em>Glancy v. Meadville Bread Co., </em>hereinafter distinguished from this case). My answer to that statement is that the <em>truck </em>was “clearly visible”, but its <em>speed </em>coming as it was down a straight and dark highway was not “visible”, i. e., within Mrs. Miller’s power of observation. It <em>is </em>carelessness to attempt to cross in front of a truck 30 or 35 feet away as in the <em>Glancy v. Meadville Bread Co. </em>case, supra, but it is <em>not </em>carelessness to attempt to cross a highway when a car is approaching at a presumably lawful speed, 2,300 or even 1,000 feet away. To convict Mrs. Miller of negligence it would have to be shown that she was <em>chargeable with knovoledge </em>that the truck was coming so fast that she could not cross the road safely until the truck had passed. Whether or not she was <em>so chargeable </em>was <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>for the <em>jury’s </em>and <em>not </em>for the court’s determination. A person experienced in judging the speed of cars, can if standing by a highway judge the speed of a passing automobile. No person standing near a highway at night and looking down a straight and dark road, at the headlights of an oncoming car far away can form any fairly accurate estimate of that approaching car’s speed, for the reason that he cannot see any <em>stationary objects </em>along its path which will enable Mm to judge its speed. This is a matter of common knowledge and a fact verifiable by observation. There is no proof in this record that Mrs. Miller had any experience in judging the speed of cars under any conditions. When she saw this defendant’s car approaching <em>in the distance, </em>only the car’s headlights being visible to her, she had a right to <em>assume </em>that the car was running at a lawful rate of speed. It is the law of this State that “No person shall drive any vehicle upon a highway ... at a speed greater than will permit him to bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead.”: See 1002 of The Vehicle Code of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, as amended by the Act of June 22, 1931, P. L. 751. In <em>Mason v. C. Lewis Lavine, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/302/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="302 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1129047" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0472-01">302 Pa. 472</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=153%20A.%20754" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="153 A. 754">153 A. 754</a>, this court in an opinion by the present Chief Justice said: “A car should be so driven that it can be stopped within the range of its lights.” In <em>Gaber et ux. v. Weinberg, </em><a href="/pa/324/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="324 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="1171372" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0385-01">324 Pa. 385</a>, 387, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20187" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="188 A. 187">188 A. 187</a>, we said: “The rule [just quoted] is inflexible.” The evidence in this record supports the inference that Mrs. Miller was already <em>in </em>the road and past its center line when the range of defendant’s lights reached her and <em>then </em>the truck was “roaring” down upon her. Under these circumstances, the most obvious thing for Mrs. Miller to do was to attempt to run out of danger. She did run but the “danger” was approaching her so fast that her attempt failed and she was killed. Had the defendant Gault been operating his truck at the speed the law required, which was the speed Mrs. Miller had a right to assume that he was operating his truck, she could have reached a place <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>of safety before the truck passed. I find no case in the reports where a person has been adjudged in law guilty of negligence in starting to cross a 30-foot highway when only one car is within view and that car is <em>at least </em>1,000 feet away. If Gault was running the truck at a speed of 50 miles an hour, it would have taken him over 30 seconds to get from the curve to the place where Mrs. Miller was. If the driver of the truck had been running at a speed which would have enabled him to stop within the clear range of his lights he would, of course, have been running at a speed much less than 50 miles an hour. A person usually walks at a speed of 4 miles an hour or about 6 feet a second. Mrs. Miller could have crossed the 30 feet of that road in 5 or 6 seconds by walking at a normal gait. She had a right to assume that the oncoming car in the distance would not run her down if she crossed the 30-foot highway at the time she did. She had additional reasons for assuming that the car was approaching at a proper rate of speed because the visibility that night was not good. Defendant Gault testified: “It was very dark and gusty and a lot of wind and dirt in the air. There was pending a storm.” Under those circumstances no one would expect Gault to drive his truck at such an excessive speed. That Gault was inattentive and therefore reckless is shown by his own admission that he did not see Mrs. Miller until he was within 20 or 25 feet of her and this was in spite of the fact that his headlights lighted the road for a distance of 200 to 250 feet and the fact that Mrs. Miller must have been in plain view for she had crossed the 10 feet of the easterly lane and the 10 feet of the center lane and 5 feet of the 10-foot westerly lane when she was struck. All of the time she was travelling these 25 feet she was within the view of this truck driver, if he had been attentive.</p>

We there said: “This is not a case where the pedestrian stepped directly in the path of a moving car, but rather one where the pedestrian, already engaged in making the crossing, was justified in believing that passing motorists would have due regard for her safety.” In that case the victim was crossing at an intersection in a city; in the instant case the vietim was crossing a highway in the country and there was nothing unlawful per se in her crossing at that point. This case should also be ruled by our decision in <em>Maselli et al. v. Stephens, </em><a href="/pa/331/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="331 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="1184349" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0491-01">331 Pa. 491</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.2d%20590" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="200 A.2d 590">200 A. 2d. 590</a>, where we held that when the plaintiff-victim who had started across a highway and then saw the headlights of an approaching automobile “ran the last few steps in an attempt to reach the curb but was struck by the car before she could do so”, she could <em>not </em>be declared guilty of contributory negligence <em>by the court. </em>We said (p. 496) : “Clearly this was a case for the jury. . . . Under the decisions of this Court it is not required that she choose what might have been a safer course, nor to exercise the best judgment whether <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>slie should advance, retreat or stand still in an emergency which she did not create.” It cannot be said as a matter of law in the instant case that Mrs. Miller created the “emergency” which confronted her. The emergency was created by Gault’s grossly excessive and unlawful speed. It is an inescapable inference that had the defendant been running at a lawful rate of speed and had been able to stop his truck within the range of his lights Mrs. Miller could have crossed the highway without being struck by defendant’s truck, for she was within 5 feet of a place of safety when killed, and to this safe place she was running when the defendant’s truck ran her down.</p>

There we said (quoting from the court below in that case) : “It clearly appears from the testimony that the truck must have been a much closer distance — within not to exceed 30 to 35 feet — from the point of accident, when plaintiff looked and started across the road, as he took but a few hurried steps before he was struck by the truck.” Of course, if a person starts across a highway in the face of a truck only 30 or 35 feet away, he is negligent. Here the testimony of Tarr is that after Mrs. Miller alighted from his car to cross the highway, defendant’s truck was coming around the curve more than 2,000 feet distant. The case of <em>Gajewski v. Lightner, </em><a href="/pa/341/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="341 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1204520" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0514-01">341 Pa. 514</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.2d%20355" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="19 A.2d 355">19 A. 2d 355</a>, cited in the majority opinion is likewise inapplicable here, for there the victim “run into” the pathway of an oncoming car travelling 55 to 60 miles an hour only 100 feet from him, when he could have remained in safety “in the 19 feet intervening on the north side of the street.” In the instant case there is no evidence that Mrs. Miller ran into the path of the oncoming truck when it was only 100 feet away from her. It is a fair inference that she was already in the western half of the highway when the defendant’s swiftly moving car was much more than 100 feet away and that upon discovering her peril <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>she did the natural thing to do under the circumstances, to wit, to run to the edge of the road nearest her, within 5 feet of this edge she was struck. As this court said in <em>Weiss v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., </em>supra, “His [plaintiff’s] acts with regard to negligence must be judged from the circumstances as they then appeared. In his position one is not required to exercise the highest or even ordinary degree of judgment; it is a judgment arising from peril or care under the circumstances.”</p>

To hold that the plaintiff is bound by the statements made by this defendant, Gault, is to my mind in complete conflict with the applicable law in such cases as enumerated by text writers and by this court in numerous decisions. Plaintiff had a right to put in evidence Gault’s declarations without being bound by them exactly as a district-attorney can put in evidence a defendant’s statements or confessions without being bound by them. The rule is precisely the same in both civil and criminal cases and in the entire domain of law no rule is more unqualifiedly established than this, to wit, that when a statement or an admission made by a defendant is put in evidence by a plaintiff, a self-serving declaration of the defendant contained in that statement or admission <em>does not have to be accepted by the jury as true. </em>Henry’s Trial Evidence, 3rd ed., sec. 59, declares: “The jury may believe the admission against himself and yet refuse to credit his statement in his own interest.” In <em>Heyman, Admrx., Aplnt., v.

The majority opinion thus relies upon a rule of law which is wholly inapplicable to the situation presented here. That rule is based on the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, which provides that “in any civil proceeding a party to the record may be compelled by the adverse party to testify as if under cross-examination and the adverse party calling such witness shall not be concluded by his testimony”. We held in the cases above referred to that one who calls an adverse party as upon cross-examination is concluded by his testimony, if uncontradicted. In the case now before us, plaintiffs did <em>not </em>call the defendant, Gault, an adverse party. Plaintiff called the police officers to testify to Gault’s <em>statement to them </em>as to “how close he was to Mrs. Miller when he saw her” and “where she was located on the three-lane highway at the time he first observed her.” On cross-examination officer Barry stated that Gault said “She [Mrs. Miller] <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>appeared, to be moving fast as though she was running.” Officer Krzton testified to the same thing on direct examination, i. e., that Mrs. Miller was “approximately 20 feet away . . . travelling from east to west running.” The jury thus had before it from the lips of two witnesses a statement made by the defendant Gault not under oath, <em>to them, </em>the witnesses. The jury could accept as absolute verity the testimony of these two witnesses as to <em>what Gault said to them, </em>but, first, the jury was not bound to accept as verity all of Gault’s statement to these officers any more than a jury in a criminal case is bound to accept as verity all the declaration made by a defendant who confesses to an officer the commission of a crime. In such confessions defendants usually inject self-serving declarations. It is always for the jury to determine what part of a defendant’s statement it will accept and what part it will reject, and the rule is the same in both criminal and civil cases. Secondly, even if Mrs. Miller was “running” when this truck was bearing down upon her, that fact does not convict her of negligence. This court has never held that when a person sees a motor vehicle twenty feet away bearing down upon him that person must stand still or incur the liability of being adjudged negligent.</p>
