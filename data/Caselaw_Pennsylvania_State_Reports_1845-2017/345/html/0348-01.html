Apart from what is implied in the words themselves as used in 2 (c) (2) and 2 (c) (3), the legislature has provided that wages, etc., “assignable to this Commonwealth . . . shall be such expenditures ... as represent the wages, [etc.] ... of employes, not chiefly situated at, connected with, or sent out from, premises for the transaction of business owned or rented by the corporation outside the Commonwealth.” For present purposes the important words are the wages for “employes, not chiefly situated at, connected with, or sent out from, premises for the transaction of business owned or rented by the corporation outside the Commonwealth.”</p>

By ‘territorial men’ the company means employees in charge of controlled territories. All of the controlled territories were located outside the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

The salesman is advised of this limit and may never exceed the same. The salesman is advised two or three times a month of the shipments made to the various jobbers.

The suggestion is that the affirmation of appellant’s 12th request which reads, “The balance of said gross receipts in the amount of $6,461,672 arose from sales negotiated and effected by territorial men working out of and using hotels outside this Commonwealth as their headquarters, the rental of said hotel space was paid by the defendant,” results in this inconsistency. We need not decide whether, in affirming appellant’s 12th request for a finding, the learned court went beyond the stipulation made by both parties; we say this because after the case had been first heard, exceptions to the adjudication were filed and were considered by the court in banc, after argument; it was then that the decision was rendered from which this appeal comes, and it was then that reliance was placed by the court on the fact quoted above from the 10th stipulation. The court then said: “On the other hand, the payment of the hotel bills of employes does not impress us as the maintenance of an office, even though business be transacted there. There is nothing in the record to indicate any permanency of hotel rooms as an office; nothing to indicate the holding out of said rooms to the public as an office. Whether any books or records are kept there, salaries of other employes paid there, or what, if anything, is done there is not shown. The territorial men seem to have been traveling representatives whose expenses were paid by the defendant. We are left definitely with the impression that where the territorial man was, there was also the office. In other words, the office followed the man. If we may be permitted to use a mixed figure of speech, it was an ambulatory, peripatetic office <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>actively engaged in circumnavigating the state. We think that the facts given do not establish the maintenance of an office outside of this state as contemplated by the statute. On the contrary, the facts show that the territorial men worked from offices owned or rented by the taxpayer in Pennsylvania; tenth paragraph of stipulated facts. We can find no other stipulation which modifies this one in any particular, and even though it be conceded that this was so only to the extent described elsewhere, we think it would make no difference.</p>

    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[203,960,1160,1191]]]'>Appellant contends that if the construction of the statute made below is accepted, the word “premises” in the clause “not chiefly situated at, connected with, or sent out from, premises for the transaction of business owned or rented by the taxpayer outside this Commonwealth” cannot include a hotel room or rooms occupied by territorial men, and that, as a result, the appellant is deprived of the benefit of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment and of the uniformity provision of Article IX, section 1, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. In the first place, the statute refers not to “premises” alone, but specifically to “premises for the transaction of business owned or rented.” As to the 14th Amendment, it is sufficient to say that we see no ground for the contention that there is not substantial basis for classification between “premises for the transaction of business owned or rented” by a corporation and a hotel room occasionally occupied by a constantly traveling salesman in the circumstances specified in the stipulation of facts. As the law applies to all corporations, there is nothing to support a finding of want of uniformity.</p>

With respect to the challenged allocation of gross receipts, the question is whether they resulted from business transacted by territorial men operating from premises maintained for the transaction of business by the taxpayer in this Commonwealth; of that we have no doubt. The services of the salesmen described in the stipulation determine the status of the receipts for excise tax purposes, and therefore what was said with respect to the wages paid to territorial men applies also to the receipts from the business done by them as an ingredient of the apportionment formula.</p>
