He did not fill in the blank left after the words “Date when applicant desires retirement to begin,” presumably because he elected to retire immediately and not at some time in the future. The statement was completed on Saturday, February 8th, by Mrs. Dom, who then made the affidavit required of the beneficiary. Judge Dom delivered it to his physician, Dr. McMurray, with instructions to mail it to the Retirement Board. Dr. McMurray mailed it on the 8th and it was received by the Board on Monday morning, February 10th, about nine o’clock. Judge Dom died suddenly on Saturday afternoon, after the retirement statement, had been mailed. The Commonwealth contends (1) that Judge Dom did not specify the date on which he desired to be retired in the future and that the omission rendered his retirement inoperative; (2) that his retirement was not complete because (a) the statement was not received by the Board prior to his death and (b) because he had not resigned his office.</p>

Mr. Demming died November 21, 1932. General Davis did not deliver the statement to the Board promptly; an entry on its records states, “Because of the lack of knowledge as <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>to the requirements of this board and the provisions of the Retirement Act, [he] did not submit the application until after the death of Mr. Demming.” He delivered the statement to Deputy Attorney General Bender who delivered it to the Board on December 23, 1932. In Mr. Demming’s statement, as in Judge Dom’s, the space opposite the words “Date when applicant desires retirement to begin” was left blank.</p>

Mr. Demming had been in the employ of the Commonwealth for about 38 years and had to his credit with the Retirement Board the sum of $3,072.89. The Board approved his application March 28, 1933. Payments were made to Mrs. Demming on her husband’s account for the period from November 10th to November 21st, the date of his death, and to her, as beneficiary designated by him under option 3, as from November 21, 1932, the date of death, until July 31, 1935. On November 23, 1937, the Board notified Mrs. Demming that “ . . . the annuity of the late Benjamin Demming is revoked.” That notice was accompanied by a check for $55.17, an amount representing the balance of Mr. Demming’s retirement fund credit at the time of his death, less the annuity payments which had been made to her. She declined to accept the check on that condition and brought this suit.</p>

Beginning with section 4, the legislature provided for a Retirement Board and specified its powers and duties, inter alia, the powers and privileges of a corporation. (Section 5, Act of 1923, P. L. 863.) Section 13 deals with superannuation retirement and section 14 authorizes a qualified member to elect which of four specified options he chooses for the purpose of receiving the retirement allowance which the Commonwealth had agreed to pay.</p>

Judge Dom and Mr. Demming executed such statements and promptly started them toward the Board. They were not ineffective because a blank was left after the line, “Date when applicant desires retirement to begin.” Their exercise of their respective rights was complete. Each had expressed at the beginning of the statement his election to retire, one choosing option No. 2, and one, option No. 3. Each, by the words used, indicated a completed present retirement; if either had desired future retirement it would have been necessary to specify the date in the future when he desired his retirement to become effective. As the statute specified that “said application shall retire said contributor at the time so specified,” the statement retired the member as of the date on which the statement was executed, if the Board subsequently found the member qualified for retirement. The words “subsequent to the execution of said application,” in section 13, prevent attempts at retroactive retirement. We must therefore reject the argument that the application was ineffective because a blank was left after the line “Date when applicant desires retirement to begin.”</p>

It was of course necessary that the statement be filed with the Board as notice to, or demand on, the Commonwealth to perform its part of the contract and to enable the Board to determine administratively, for example, that the person proposing to retire was in fact a member and had reached the superannuation age, the amount of the retirement allowance and the amount distributable and the like. Until the statement reached the Board, the Commonwealth was not called on to pay. For such purposes, the application had to reach the Board, but the act does not provide that it must reach the Board prior to the member’s death. Retirement statements must, of course, be made in good faith and the court here found that both members acted in good faith. It would be an unreasonable construction of the contract and one out of harmony with the general rulé stated above, applied in construing such contracts, to hold that the death of a member after he retired should deprive the beneficiary of the benefit of an already vested right to share in the retirement allowance. While a subsequent amendment may not in all cases be referred to for the purpose of construing a statute, in dealing with the contract before us, it may be noticed that in the Act of 1937, supra, amending section 13, supra, the legislature provided that if the application was mailed before the date specified for retirement and prior to the death of the contributor, it should be effective if the retirement date was not more than 30 days from the date of filing or mailing. Even under this amendment, if a retiring <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>member died between the time his retirement statement was mailed and the time it arrived, the beneficiary would be entitled to take.</p>

The Retirement Board understood from the Demming statement<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> that the retirement was presently effective, because on April 5,1933, the Board wrote to Mrs. Demming that the “application is effective” and that a “check will be issued for the period November 10, 1932, to November 21, 1932, the date Mr. Demming died” and at the same time that checks would thereafter be issued to her as beneficiary.</p>
