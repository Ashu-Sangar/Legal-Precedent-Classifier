The tax was imposed under section 24 of the Act of June 1, 1889, P. L. 420, as amended (72 PS §2261). The Department of Revenue assessed against the trustee the state personal property tax on these shares. On appeal, a court of common pleas held that the tax sought to be imposed was unconstitutional and struck off the assessment. The Commonwealth has appealed to this court.</p>

It is necessary to an understanding of the force of these exemptions, allowed to resident holders of stock, to review historically the pertinent legislation. Section 21 of the Act of 1889, P. L. 420, imposed a capital stock tax on both domestic and foreign corporations, but <em>foreign </em>insurance companies were expressly excepted from this tax. By section 24 of the same statute a tax was imposed on gross annual premiums received by insurances companies from business done within this Commonwealth. The rate fixed was two per cent for foreign insurance companies and eight mills for domestic insurance companies, the latter being subject to the capital stock tax under section 21. An amendment to section 21 by Act of May 16, 1935, P. L. 184, made the capital stock tax applicable only to domestic corporations and imposed a franchise tax on foreign corporations. The new franchise tax applied the same rate as the capital stock tax to the same fundamental base, that is, capital <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>stock, but by formula endeavored to reach only the fractional part of the whole capital stock allowable to business done within the Commonwealth. This new franchise tax was not imposed on foreign insurance companies, but they and domestic insurance companies remained and still remain liable to payment of the gross premiums’ tax.</p>
    <p id="b211-3" data-blocks='[["BL_211.4",211,[221,713,1152,1664]]]'>We need not, for present purposes, review the legislative history of the state personal property tax on shares held by residents of the state prior to 1935. The Act of June 22, 1935, P. L. 414, imposed a state tax of one mill on shares of stock held by a resident either in his own right or as trustee “except shares of stock in any . . . corporation . . . that may be liable to a tax on its shares or its capital stock for State purposes . . ., or relieved from the payment of tax on its shares or capital stock for State purposes.” The first part of this exception, of course, exempted shares in domestic insurance corporations, and in <em>Miller’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/330/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="330 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1182929" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0477-01">330 Pa. 477</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.%20148" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="199 A. 148">199 A. 148</a>, we held that the second part exempted shares of foreign insurance companies as they were “relieved” from the payment of the capital stock tax. By Act of May 18, 1937, P. L. 633, the tax on shares held by residents was increased to four mills and the prior act was amended so that the particular language interpreted in <em>Miller’s Estate, </em>supra, was omitted and the exception was changed to read “except shares of stock in any . . . corporation . . . liable to a tax on its shares or a capital stock or franchise tax for State purposes under the laws of this Commonwealth.” By the Act of May 5, 1939, P. L. 76, the exception was again amended so as to read, “except shares of stock in any . . . corporation . . . liable to a tax on its shares or the capital stock tax or franchise tax imposed by section twenty-one of the act, approved the first day of June, one thousand eight hundred eighty-nine (Pamphlet Laws, four hundred twenty), and its amendments and supplements.”</p>

The gross premiums’ tax imposed by section 24 of the Act of 1889 is certainly not the capital stock or franchise tax imposed by section 21. It is apparent, therefore, that the legislature removed the exemption heretofore existing and that it intended to make a resident owner of stock in a foreign corporation subject to a tax on his shares.</p>
    <p id="b212-4" data-blocks='[["BL_212.4",212,[192,853,1156,857]]]'>The lower court correctly construed the statute in that respect, but held that it was unconstitutional as violating Art. IX, §1, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It is not necessary to discuss the two constitutional provisions separately. “As applied to questions of taxation, the constructions of the two enactments run together. That which would violate one would generally contravene the other”: <em>Com. v. Girard Life Ins.

Not only does our constitution require that taxes “shall be uniform, upon the same class of subjects”, but by Art. IX, §2, the General Assembly is prohibited from passing any special law exempting property from taxation. However, those sections do not prohibit a proper classification of the subjects of taxation; all that they require is that the tax shall be uniform upon members of a class. The fundamental question therefore becomes whether the legislature properly exercised its power of <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>classification when it placed owners of shares of foreign insurance companies in a different class from owners of shares in domestic insurance companies.</p>

There might be a point at which the taxes paid by a foreign corporation and those paid by the owners of shares in that corporation are so far out of line with similar taxes paid by domestic corporations and the owners of shares in such corporations that the result produced could be said to be arbitrary and oppressive. There has been a complete failure upon the part of the appellee to show that the net result of the different taxes has produced such a condition.</p>

We said in that case (p. 137) “that the gross premium tax of two per cent is equivalent to the capital stock and premium tax paid by other insurance companies within the spirit and purpose of the exemption <em>provisions”; </em>i.e., as a' matter of statutory construction we deemed that in exempting shares of corporations which paid a capital stock tax the legislature intended to include those of corporations which paid a gross premium tax. The words used certainly did not and could not mean that the two taxes are mathematically equivalent or approximately equal. There was no proof there, as there was not here, that the taxes were quantitatively equivalent. It was particularly noted in that case that mathematical equivalence was not required.</p>
