The number of acres of the land in question and <em>now underlaid </em>with mineable coal is 421.38. The lands consist of five contiguous tracts, totalling 604.09 acres. The assessment is made on an acreage of 577. The property is fully developed and well equipped for mining. The mining and transportation facilities are good. Drainage for the property is provided by a tunnel completed in 1930.

No records or maps of that mining operation are in existence or at least no such records were available at the time of the trial. It is impossible and has been impossible for many years to make any survey of the area containing the Mammoth Vein for the reason that there have been falls of top rock and coal, closing the gangways and passageways in the mine, the methods employed in mining the remaining coal of the Mammoth Vein in this area being by means of rock holes cut from the lower levels and by stripping or surface mining from the outside. Consequently, the Mammoth Vein has never been exposed sufficiently to enable any absolute measurements to be made. The estimate of the thickness of the Vein, as fixed by the appellant’s witnesses is by judgment obtained from their experience in mining the Vein upon the property. The appellee’s witnesses fixed their opinion as to the thickness of the Mammoth Vein from geological surveys of the area and historical data gained from publications printed by early mining engineers who operated in this area. They further base their opinion upon a cross section of the Mammoth Vein obtained from the records of the appellant company produced at the time of the trial, which indicates a thickness of the Mammoth Vein of thirty feet or more. As to this map or cross-section of the appellant, the explanation is offered that the cross-section does not depict an accurate representation of the Mammoth Vein for the reason that they were unable to accurately measure the Mammoth Vein and that the representation upon the cross-section is merely a sketch, as one of their witnesses stated, to complete the <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>picture or to show or indicate the top of the Mammoth Vein, the cross-section in question showing, however, an accurate measurement of the lower Veins. Similarly, there is no accurate method of determining the percentage of coal removed from the Mammoth Vein in first mining, since there are no records of the early mining done. In addition, there were differences of opinion expressed by the respective witnesses for the appellant and the appellee: as to the percentage of coal in place which can be mined and recovered and as to percentage of recoverable coal which can be marketed after removal and preparation; not as widely divergent, however, as the various estimates quoted and referred to above. For the reasons given, therefore, the various estimates of value for the years in question as well as the estimates given of the marketable tons of coal contained in the property are irreconcilable.”</p>

If taxpayers in and after 1937 objected that their properties had in the face of declining real estate values been over-assessed the Commissioners sitting as a Board of Revision of Taxes had put themselves in a position to meet this objection by raising the <em>ratio </em>between market and assessed values as indicated.</p>

The purpose was to rebut the testimony of the County’s three witnesses that they planimefcered eighteen acres in this vein upon this property and upon it they based their opinion of thirty per cent original removal and of witness Lewis that the figures he gave after planimetering showed openings. The court upon objection held this to be not rebuttal. Witness Pierce for the appellant had stated in cross-examination (early in the trial) that he came to the conclusion that forty-five per cent of the coal in the Mammoth Vein had been removed by first mining and he then answered “yes” to the following questions: “Was that figure arrived at as a result of the same type of examination of the maps and planimetering of the maps?” He later added: “The breasts and the breasts headings were all planimetered.” Appellant contends that “with the close of County’s case, the record remained with an opinion of thirty and fifty per cent removed in Mammoth Vein in first mining and thus deduced by planimetering eighteen acres or sixteen and two thirds of the whole. The appellant desired to show that by planimetering 112.72 acres, which included appellee’s area, or 78% of the whole, 58.6% was indicated as actually removed, or 8.6% more than witness Lewis’ estimate and 28.6% more than the other two appellee’s witnesses.” Since appellant in its brief admits that “the maps at the time of the mining [in the Mammoth Vein] were inaccurate”, we fail to see the value of any evidence obtained by planimetering them.

On the economic phases of this case all the court said was the following: “With respect to the economic conditions existing in the anthracite coal trade in the years in question, we find that the annual sales and net tons for the year 1930 was 64,346,491 tons, for the year 1933, 46,584,961 tons and for the year 1936, 51,874,887 tons. During the same years, we find an increase in the sale of oil, gas, coke and other anthracite substitutes. The increase, however, is not in direct proportion to the decrease in the sales of anthracite shown for the respective years, which would indicate that while it was undoubtedly true that in this period the substitutes used replaced the use of anthracite, yet the total increase in the substitutes is not reflected directly in the decreased sales of anthracite. We find that in the year 1930 the average value for the net ton of coal, taking the entire anthracite industry as a whole, was $4.98, for the year 1933, $4.05, and for the year 1936, $3.92. The average number of working days for the industry in 1930 was 208 days, in 1933,182 days, and in 1936,192 days. The average sales realization per net ton for the year 1930 was $5.39, for the year 1933, $4.36, and for the year 1936, $4.31. . . .” The foregoing excerpt is a totally inadequate picture of the economic plight of the anthracite coal industry during the years when the challenged assessments were made, to wit: 1931, 1934 and 1937.

In addition, about 6 thousand men and boys are engaged in breaking the stolen coal, in trucking it, and in distributing it to markets as far away as Baltimore and southern New England. The quantity sold in 1933 and 1936 has been estimated at around 4 million tons a year, with a sales value of above $30,-000,000 a year. This tonnage is equal to roughly <em>8% </em>of the present output of the legal mines, and has undeniably cut heavily into the markets of the legal mines themselves. ... In a good many places the bootleg mining has imperiled adjacent legal mines, or has made adjacent coal unworkable, or has endangered surface structures and roads. The bootleggers pay no royalties, no property taxes, and make no provision for compensation in case of accident. There is no dispute on the legal standing of bootlegging. The bootleg miners are trespassers and are stealing property, and the bootleg breakers and truckers are handling stolen goods. . . . Efforts to stop bootlegging in the Schuylkill fields by resort to the ordinary legal processes have thus far been almost wholly unsuccessful, except where surface buildings and roads or the operation of adjacent legal mines were in immediate danger. . . .”: From “Ad Interim Report” of Chairman W. Jett. Rauck and Commissioner James W. Angelí of the Anthracite Coal Industry Commission of Pennsylvania, (See Act of February 8, 1937), under date of May 15,1937.</p>
