On June 15, 1942, the court directed that he be paroled upon payment of the fine and costs, but defendant, the keeper of the prison, refused to release him because, on June 2, 1942, the Pennsylvania Board of Parole had ordered that he should be paroled on December 15, 1942. Banks obtained a writ of habeas corpus and the court, being of opinion that the Act of August 6, 1941, P. L. 861, which created the Pennsylvania Board of Parole, was unconstitutional, ordered his immediate release on parole as it had previously directed. The District Attorney of Delaware County has appealed on behalf of defendant; the Attorney General also has entered his appearance.</p>

The first is that it infringes upon the power of the Governor to grant commutations of sentence and pardons (Article IY, section 9). There is no novelty in this contention; it has been made many times in the courts of other states in which parole systems are administered by boards or prison managers, and has been rejected in practically all jurisdictions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> There is a radical difference between a pardon and a parole. A pardon is the exercise of the sovereign’s prerogative of mercy. It completely frees the offender from the control of the state. It not only exempts him from further punishment but relieves him from all the legal <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>disabilities resulting from his conviction. It blots out the very existence of his guilt, so that, in the eye of the law, he is thereafter as innocent as if he had never committed the offense: <em>Diehl v. </em>Rodgers, <a href="/pa/169/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="169 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="870585" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0316-01">169 Pa. 316</a>, 319, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.%20424" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="32 A. 424">32 A. 424</a>, 425; <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Quaranta, <a href="/pa/295/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="295 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1115171" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0264-01">295 Pa. 264</a>, 273, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.%2089" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="145 A. 89">145 A. 89</a>, 93; <em>Commonwealth v. </em>House, <a href="/pa-super/10/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="10 Pa.

It is not an act of clemency, but a penological measure for the disciplinary treatment of prisoners who seem capable of rehabilitation outside of prison walls. It does not set aside or affect the sentence; the convict remains in the legal custody of the state and under the control of its agents, subject at any time, for breach of condition, to be returned to the penal institution. Neither is a parole a commutation of sentence within the meaning of that term in the constitutional provision. When our present constitution was adopted, parole, as a penological expedient, was unknown to American jurists and legislators,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and “commutation” was then generally understood as meaning a reduction in the length of the sentence, effecting a discharge of the prisoner without any further supervision over him by the state authorities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The constitutional power of the Governor to grant pardons and commutations of sentence is exclusive, so that the fact that the legislature has, by various statutes, given the power of parole to the criminal courts,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> to the <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>board of managers of the Industrial Reformatory at Huntingdon,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and to the board of trustees of the State Industrial Home for Women,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> indicates that parole has never been considered as being within the category of either pardon or commutation.

It is urged that the granting of a parole is a judicial function and therefore the power to parole cannot be entrusted to an executive or administrative body. This contention also has been uniformly rejected in other jurisdictions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> where the constitutionality of statutes has been sustained vesting the power of parole in state boards (which now exist in some form or other in at least half of the states of the Union) or in boards of prison commissioners or man<a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>agers of reformatories.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The power to grant paroles is not inherent in courts; Pennsylvania courts never had such power until it was given to them by the Act of June 19,1911, P. L. 1059, and then only with respect to prisoners in county jails and workhouses. What the legislature thus gave it can take away again in whole or in part and vest in some other agency of government. The legislature has exclusive power to determine the penological system of the Commonwealth. It alone can prescribe the punishments to be meted out for crime. It can provide for fixed penalties or grant to the courts such measure of discretion in the imposition of sentences as it may see fit. It may enact that prison confinement shall be the punishment for crime or may abolish prisons altogether and adopt some other method of enforcing the criminal law. It may therefore establish a parole system by which prisoners shall, under certain conditions, be allowed to re-enter society through a gradual amelioration of their restraint and a substitution of controlled freedom for continued incarceration. The granting of parole and the supervision of parolees are purely administrative functions, and accordingly may be entrusted by the legislature to non-judicial agencies. What parole statutes give to the paroling authorities — in the present instance to the State Board of Parole — is in effect nothing more than the fact-finding duty of determining in each case when the conditions prescribed by the legisture for provisional release from confinement have been complied with, and that duty may properly be placed in charge of an administrative tribunal as is so commonly done in other fields of governmental administration.

The sentence is in no wise interfered with, especially since the act provides that a parole cannot be granted until the expiration of the minimum term prescribed by the court. The parolee is not discharged, but merely serves the remainder of his sentence by having Ms liberty restrained in a manner analogous to that employed in the “trusty” or “honor” system of prison discipline. “The parole authorized by the statute does not suspend sentence or operate to shorten the term.

But the law in regard to fines and costs is not affected by the act; in section 31 it is specifically provided that the act shall not apply to persons committed in default of payment of any fine. The Board of Parole is given no authority concerning the payment of fines and costs, although, of course, it may, if it so desire, make such payment a condition precedent to the granting or the continuance of a parole. Article IY, section 9, of the Constitution gives to the Governor the power to remit fines,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> and there is <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>no legislation granting such power to any other authority, not even to the courts; there are, however, many acts, beginning with the earliest years of the Commonwealth, which permit the release from imprisonment, on certain conditions, of persons who have served their terms and remain in confinement only because of failure to pay fines or costs of prosecution ;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> indeed, some of these acts authorize the board of prison inspectors to discharge a prisoner without the payment of fines or costs and even without proceeding under the insolvent laws, if, in the judgment of the board, he is unable to make payment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Such a release from imprisonment does not, of course, remit the fine, and the Commonwealth may still recover it by execution process from whatever property the prisoner may possess. Paroles, as heretofore granted by the courts or other authorized agencies, have never been regarded as interfering with the enforcement of the payment of fines, and the power to parole has uniformly been exercised without relation thereto. If the parolee does not liquidate the fine or costs which have been imposed upon him, he is still subject, just as before the passage of the present act, to all existing laws for the enforcement of that portion of his penalty; in order to release himself from such obligation without actual payment he must obtain a remission of the fine <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>from the Governor, or take the benefit of the insolvency laws after serving such additional period of confinement as is prescribed by existing laws, or avail himself of the procedure provided by other legislation which may be applicable to his particular case.</p>

The present statute proceeds on the theory that this can be better done, and the object more effectively accomplished, by entrusting the operation of the parole system to a state board the members of which shall be obliged to devote all their time and attention to the task.

It made its initial entrance into Pennsylvania when the Huntingdon Reformatory was organized in 1887, and it was not adopted in our state penitentiaries until 1909 or in our county jails until 1911.</p>

That such is extremely well established is demonstrated by a unanimous line of decisions in this and the other states, and also by decisions of the federal courts in protection of the United Stales Constitution. One of the best expressions on the subject is that of Chief Justice Gibson in <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>
      <em>De Chastellux v.

Each derives its authority, mediately or immediately, from the people; and each is responsible, mediately or immediately, to the people for the exercise of it. When either shall have usurped the powers of one or both of its fellows, then will have been effected a revolution, not in the form of the government, but in its action. Then will there be a concentration of the powers of the government in a single branch of it, which, whatever may be the form of the constitution, will be a despotism — a government of unlimited, irresponsible, and arbitrary rule. It is idle to say the authority of each branch is defined and limited in the constitution, if there is not an independent power able and willing to enforce the limitations.” It is crystal clear that where a statute does violence to the constitution the court has no alternative but must declare the legislation unconstitutional and refuse to enforce it, regardless of the wisdom, expediency or necessity for its enactment. The majority, in my judgment, has completely ignored this well-settled law in concluding that the Parole Act of 1941 is constitutional.</p>

It is true that the continuance of the substituted punishment depends upon certain Conditions,— the observance of the rules of conduct prescribed by the parole, and the "reports by the prisoner exacted by its terms. But whether the commutation is unconditional or conditional, as to time, it can make no difference. In either case the power to make the commutation is vested in the board of pardons. Raplje and Lawrence, in their Law Dictionary, define ‘commutation’ to be ‘the substitution of a lesser grade of punishment for that inflicted by the sentence pronounced upon conviction.’ Again, commutation has been defined to be ‘the change of a punishment to which a person has been condemned, to a less severe one.’ And it is added that ‘this can be granted only by the authority in which the pardoning power resides.’ 6 Am. &amp; Eng.

Such reasoning overlooks the fact that “commute” is derived from the Latin word “commutare”, which means to “change”: Webster’s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.). “Commutation” meant at the time the constitution of this Commonwealth was adopted in 1874, as it does now, “The change of a punishment to which a person has been condemned into a less severe one”: Bouvier’s Law Dictionary (14th Ed., 1870). It is a mistake to suppose that only a shortening of the term of imprisonment is commutation. Any change of the sentence which lessens the punishment, such as absolving prisoners from serving “at hard labor” or “in solitary confinement”, when such was a part of the sentence, is a commutation.

An act is judicial when it requires the exercise of judgment or discretion by one or more persons, body or board, when acting as public officers in an official capacity, in a manner which seems to them just and equitable, or for the general pub-lie welfare — as is the case under the indeterminate-sentence statutes.

Although the statute by section 31 specifically states that it shall not apply to persons committed in default of payment of fines, it is silent regarding persons committed to serve a prison term and to pay a fine as well. If the Legislature had intended to allow parole in the latter case without the fine and costs first being paid, it would have said so. As to sentences imposed prior to the effective date of the Act, however, such a pronouncement would have been an áttempt to change a judicial judgment in opposition to the constitution. It cannot be denied that the fine and costs are as much a part of the sentence as the term of imprisonment and that the sentence intended that they be paid before any release from confinement. To say that the prisoner would owe the amount, and that it could be collected from him by some other method is no answer. The point is that he cannot be released from imprisonment until the fine and costs are actually paid, without changing <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>the sentence, except by taking advantage of the insolvency laws. That this is a matter of great moment to the various counties of the Commonwealth is shown by the statement of the learned judge of the court below that in one year $114,000 was collected in Delaware County in fines and costs. The amount collected in the sixty-seven counties of the State is very considerable; and most of this money would be lost if fines and costs were not collected before parole. As to sentences imposed after the statute’s effective date, however, it may be true that the Legislature could validly permit prisoners to be released on parole without having paid their fine and costs.

The law as enacted needlessly creates an extravagantly expensive system of parole, by permitting the present costly county parole system as well as that of the Board of Pardons, to continue to function although it calls for an “exclusive” system of parole; it places the appointment of an unlimited number of parole officers and employees in political hands; and it is so inartistically drawn that, even if its many and serious defects are now overlooked, it is bound to result in confusion and litigation before its true character is ascertained.

The court said it was not a commutation, adding that a ‘commutation is the change of a punishment to which a person has been condemned into a less severe one;’ and further said, ‘It is not a conditional pardon, but the substitution of a lower for a higher grade of punishment.’ Thus in avoiding a conditional pardon, the court defined a parole to be just what it had in the sentence before correctly given as the definition of a commutation, which, according to all authorities, is within the pardoning power; 4 Black.

Pardon is remission of guilt; amnesty, oblivion or forgetfulness. The act of the board only shortens the terms prescribed by the sentence and leaves the conviction of guilt unaffected.’ That such is the effect of a full pardon, is not controverted; and that a parole is not a full pardon is not debatable. But in that case, neither commutation, nor a partial, nor a conditional pardon is considered. Therefore the case is of little force as authority upon the question here involved.</p>

But a strong dissenting opinion was filed in the case, by Judge Guffy (page 1011), holding a parole under the law, to be a conditional or partial pardon, and the law in conflict with the constitutional grant. In carefully examining the two opinions, the reasoning of the latter more fully commends itself to our judgment.”</p>
