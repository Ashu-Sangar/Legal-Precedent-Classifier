    <p id="b285-5" data-blocks='[["BL_285.8",285,[219,511,1154,263]]]'>Both plaintiff and defendant appeal; defendant assigns for error the refusal (1) of its request for binding instructions, (2) of its motion for judgment n. o. v., (3) of a request for charge, quoted below. The plaintiff’s appeal is from an order granting a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b285-6" data-blocks='[["BL_285.9",285,[219,785,1153,647]]]'>The defendant, since August 1, 1939, had been engaged in stripping operations removing the rock, earth, etc., referred to as overburden, from a vein of coal on land known as Green’s farm in Wilkes-Barre Township. Defendant used a large shovel or bucket attached to a drag-line operated by an engine with a boom about 200 feet long. The shovel or bucket had a capacity of 5 to 9 tons. The dumping of the overburden had raised an enormous pile or bank of such waste, at one point a hundred feet high. At the argument it was said that such stripping operations were common in the anthracite region.</p>
    <p id="b285-7" data-blocks='[["BL_285.10",285,[218,1445,1153,427]],["BL_286.1",286,[237,306,1162,702]]]'>On October 12,1939, at about 2 P. M. on a clear day, plaintiff’s wife, according to the evidence offered on his behalf, was seen walking along the foot of the pile of overburden, and was struck and killed by a large stone thrown on the pile by the operation of the shovel. The men conducting the operation were on the opposite side of the rock pile and did not know she was in the vicinity. In the plaintiff’s case, there is evidence that a shovel of <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>overburden was discharged once every five minutes, according to the witness, Block, and twice every five minutes, according to the witness, Kremzel. The evidence would support a finding that people in the community (there are no houses in the immediate vicinity) walked at will about the tract of land on part of which the work was being done. Plaintiff’s wife was familiar with the place; she knew of the stripping operation in process; she saw the pile of overburden along which she was walking and could not avoid seeing the dumping on the top of the pile. She was not suffering from any disability; she could see and hear and must be taken to have seen what was going on about her at the time.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[237,1020,1161,472]]]'>Two eye-witnesses testified in plaintiff’s case. Kremzel, plaintiff’s neighbor, said he was there engaged in picking coal from the refuse bank and while he was “tying up a bag of coal” a stone “rolled down the hill and struck Mrs. Victoria Dougerdas [Daugert] as she was trying to run away.” He was then about 25 feet from her. The witness, Block, testified that he was standing “between 20 and 30 feet” from Mrs. Daugert when she was struck.</p>

If he knows of the nature of the activities conducted upon the land and the manner in which they are conducted, he has all that he is entitled to expect, that is an opportunity for an intelligent choice as to whether or not the advantage to be gained by coming on the land is sufficient to justify him in incurring the risks incident thereto.”</p>
    <p id="b287-3" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[249,690,1154,648]]]'>Even if we assume that a question for the jury was presented as to defendant’s negligence, we are confronted with the negligence of plaintiff’s decedent contributing to the accident. Voluntarily, she placed herself too close to the plainly observable operation of the machinery conducted in the ordinary way on defendant’s premises; unfortunately, she misjudged the extent of the obvious danger, and it became the duty of the court to rule that her contributory negligence barred recovery.
