The appellants contend that another will, executed in 1938, known in the record as the fifth will, should have been probated to the exclusion of the second and third.</p>

The parties agreed that the first and fourth were revoked. The fifth will is the center of controversy.</p>
    <p id="b604-5" data-blocks='[["BL_604.5",604,[213,1078,1160,1086]]]'>Testator resided in the Borough of Turtle Creek, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. He died on October 28, 1940, aged eighty. For ten years prior to his death he had been in the habit of spending the winter and spring months in Florida. During his absence there in 1936, a flood occurred in Turtle Creek raising the water some distance over the floor of testator’s office. After the flood receded, his brother, Charles R. Trevaskis, opened testator’s safe and dried such of the documentary contents, “possibly twenty or twenty-five different papers,” as had been affected by the water and also took out of it. an envelope marked “My Will” which had not been damaged by the water; he stated that he did not open the envelope. He also testified that after testator returned from Florida in June of 1936, he gave testator the envelope marked “My Will” and the other documents which he had taken from the safe. He was asked when he first saw the third will and replied that he first saw it the day before or the day testator died when he found it in testator’s bedroom “in a sealed envelope.”</p>

Omitting date and signatures, an exact copy is <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>as follows: I A. L. Trevaskis Having made my third will and they were lost in the Flood at my office I here make this My last <em>{¿gt </em>will and testimony If they cannot be found I will My home at Turtle Creek Allegheny County to my sister (Grace II. Trevaskis my Sister) and the other Properties to be sold and the money to be shared alike to my sisters and gf Brothers share and share alike.

    <p id="b605-5" data-blocks='[["BL_605.5",605,[213,842,1154,697]]]'>When he made this will, both the second and third, which were ordered for probate, were in existence, though at the time he seems to have been uncertain concerning that fact. While he said “they were lost in the Flood,” he did not use the word “lost” in the sense of gone forever, but in the sense of disappearance that might be temporary; he thought “they” might be found, because he specified disposition of property to be effective “If they cannot be found.” The use of the word “will” in the singular with the plural “they” in the same sentence may be reconciled by assuming that testator knew that the word “will” may be used to include will and codicil.</p>
    <p id="b605-6" data-blocks='[["BL_605.6",605,[218,1558,1152,485]]]'>In the fourth will he refers to a prior will not as “lost in the Flood,” but as one which “cannot be found since the flood.” This was offered in evidence, as counsel for appellant stated, “Because it is part of the history of the case . . . Although not for the purpose of establishing it as a will.” It was made in Florida, February 7, 1937, and omitting signature, is as follows: “Being of sound mind make this my last will and Testimony. Having made made a will which cannot be found.</p>

The evidence, which has been referred to, supports the findings. Something is said in the argument about the burden of proof. As the evidence is in the record, it is immaterial who put it in; the question is whether it supports the findings on which the order was based. We have no doubt on that point.</p>
