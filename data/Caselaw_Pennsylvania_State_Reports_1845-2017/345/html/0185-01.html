As expressed by Gibson, C. J., in <em>Hileman v. Bouslaugh, </em><a href="/pa/13/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="964948" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0344-01">13 Pa. 344</a>, 351: “It is admitted that the rule subverts a particular intention in, perhaps, every instance; for ... it is proof against even an express declaration that the heirs shall take as purchasers.” But here the testator did not use the precise words employed in the rule in Shelley’s Case. He undertook to create a remainder not by use of the words “heirs” or “heirs of the body” but by employing the word “children”. The prime question therefore prompts the further inquiry as to whether the words used here are judicially approved equivalents of the words “heirs” or “heirs of the body”.</p>

If after considering the language of the will it is determined that the true intent of <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>the testator was to use the word “children” as synonymous with “heirs” or “heirs of the body”, then the rule in Shelley’s Case applies as a positive law; otherwise, it is not applicable.</p>
    <p id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[179,528,1159,536]]]'>Sin'ce the word “children” prima facie is not the equivalent of “heirs” or “heirs of the body” and primarily does not indicate heritable succession from the owner of the particular estate but individual acquisition, and since it “is not a word of limitation, but of personal description”, the burden of establishing a different connotation is on the one who asserts a contrary intent: <em>Guthrie’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/37/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="37 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="418953" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0009-01">37 Pa. 9</a>, 14.

If nothing more had been said it would not be open, to argument that the rule in Shelley’s Case had no application. The Land Bank’s position is not improved by a further examination of the will. He provided that if his son left no children or grandchildren then the farm should “go to and vest in his legal heirs”. The testator having given a fee simple to the children of his son after the expiration of the particular estate, such grant was not cut down by the subsequent provision in the will. In this respect we have the same situation as in <em>Curtis v. Longstreth, </em><a href="/pa/44/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="44 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="484292" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0297-01">44 Pa. 297</a>, 302, where the remainder was given to the children of the first taker, with the provision that if the life tenant should die without issue then the property should go to testator’s heirs. It was there said: “Had there been no gift of a remainder to children, the limitation over on the death without issue, would have given him an estate tail by implication, but there having been an intermediate gift of a remainder to children of the devisee, of the particular estate, the gift over on the death without issue must be construed as a gift on death without <em>such issue </em>as <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>those previously mentioned, to wit, children.” We held that the first taker took a life estate only and that it made no difference that the first taker was unmarried and without children when the will was made and when the testator died.</p>
    <p id="b269-4" data-blocks='[["BL_269.5",269,[262,570,1152,482]]]'>That case was followed by <em>Chambers v.

It was held that the use of the word “descend” disclosed an intent to create a line of descent from the daughter. This is one of several cases set out in the footnote above disclosing a liberal extension of the rule in Shelley’s Case and in which the cases were made to turn on the use of the word “descend”. Those cases have no application for no such words were used in the will which we are construing and there is here no ground for concluding that the testator intended to make the children a new line of succession.</p>
