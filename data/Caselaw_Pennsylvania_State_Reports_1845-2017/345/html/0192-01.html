The procedure followed at the inception of this case was pursuant to the provisions of the Fiscal Code of April 9,1929, P. L. 343, sections 405,1003,1004,1101, 1102, 1103, 1104; 72 PS 405, et seq. Plaintiff filed a statement of his account with the Auditor General, claiming $30,561.00, with interest from the Commonwealth. An answer was filed by the Liquor Control Board. After testimony was taken the Auditor General and State Treasurer allowed prima facie a claim of $10,-924.00 on “assigned orders” and then deducted $3,856.03 as “set-offs and counter-claims” in favor of the Commonwealth and made the net award $7,067.97. A petition for resettlement was filed with the officials above named, and refused. A petition for review was then filed with the Board of Finance and Revenue, and this was refused.</p>

This action arises from a series of transactions between Shlifer, the Board and the Bank. Shlifer upon receiving purchase orders from the Board would obtain from the Bank a loan of money. As security for the loan he would execute an assignment of the money due him under the orders of the Board, and deliver to the Bank invoices addressed to the Board, in forms provided by the Board, and also invoices on his own forms. He assigned the specific sums called for in the respective orders and he warranted that “. . . said merchandise has been heretofor delivered in accordance with directions of the . . . Board.” The Bank mailed these assignments and invoices to the Board, accompanied by a letter which stated, inter alia, “We ask that the same be accepted by the Board and acknowledged to us in order that check, when drawn, will be mailed directly to us.” The Chief of Disbursements for the Board acknowledged receipt of the assignments and invoices and stated: “When payment of these invoices is made, checks will be sent directly to your bank.”</p>
    <p id="b273-4" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[258,1497,1154,865]],["BL_274.1",274,[191,286,1160,317]]]'>Shlifer failed to deliver liquor called for in three of these orders and the Board refused to pay the assignee for the merchandise not so delivered. From this fact arises the major part of this litigation. The contention of the Bank is that the Board acquiesced in the warrant of delivery through failure to call attention to the fact of non-delivery, that moneys were advanced in reliance on the assignment and warrants and that the state is now estopped to deny delivery. The Commonwealth takes the position that the Bank knew that the Board Avas promising to send it only what was due Shlifer and that the Bank stands in no better position than its assignor. The Commonwealth admits that certain sums are due the Bank on assigned orders where delivery was made but claims the right to set off certain sums owed by Shlifer to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>admits that it owes Shlifer on these assigned and filled orders $10,924.00 and an additional sum of $95.73 on unassigned orders and it avers that it has set-offs and counter-claims against him in the amount of $3,951.76. The net sum admitted due (and found to be due) is $7,067.97.</p>
    <p id="b274-4" data-blocks='[["BL_274.4",274,[188,614,1162,1137]]]'>The claim made by the plaintiff below is made up of several items. The first item is a claim for $14,481.75. On October 26, 1937, Shlifer applied to the Bank for a loan of $47,695.65 and as security therefor he assigned moneys due on purchase orders issued by the Board, to wit: numbers 42814, 42815, 42816 and 42817. He also left with the Bank (A) “Vendors Standard Invoices”, which is a form used by the Board, and (B) invoices on his own form. These assignments contained the warranty as to delivery hereinbefore referred to. The procedure then followed by the Bank and the Board, respectively, was that above stated. The Bank then advanced to Shlifer the sum asked for. The Board paid the Bank the sums covered by the orders numbered 42815-6-7 and $14,481.75 on order numbered 42814, but refused to pay the balance of $14,642.00 claimed under that order because of the non-delivery of liquor represented by that balance. The Bank contends that the Commonwealth is by reason of the Boards failure to notify the Bank of this non-delivery of liquor estopped to assert it in these proceedings.</p>

J.

The representation or conduct must of itself have been sufficient to warrant the action of the party claiming the estoppel. If notwithstanding such representation or conduct he was still obliged to inquire for the existence of other facts and to rely on them also to sustain the course of action adopted, he cannot claim that the conduct of the other party was the cause of his action and no estoppel will arise.”: 31 C.

The assignment from Shlifer to the Board showed on its face that it was <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>not the assignment of a debt <em>absolutely due. </em>It expressly recognized the fact that the “merchandise covered by any snch invoice” might “in any particular fail to comply with such purchase order” and thereby it implied its possible return to the seller. It also expressly recognized that there might be a “set-off or counterclaim ... asserted by the Liqour Control Board against payment of any such invoice.” The Bank made no specific inquiry of the Board as to whether or not the liquor had been delivered, nor did it in its letter of transmissal of the assignments indicate that it was <em>relying </em>on the Boards “acquiescence” in Shlifer’s warranty of delivery. We have heretofore quoted what the Board in its acknowledgment said about “payment of these invoices”. An invoice refers primarily to goods <em>sent. </em>The Bank did not ask for shipping receipts or <em>delivery </em>receipts, which business prudence required that it should do before making the advances to Shlifer. On December 23, 1936 and on subsequent dates, the Board in mailing checks to the Bank covering similar assignments of Shlifer had deducted varying amounts on account of Shlifer’s failure to deliver liquor according to the orders. On March 7, 1938 there appeared on an order, when it was brought to the^ Bank, the following: “Unshipped balance ... on P. O. 42814 has been cancelled.” All these things put the Bank officials on notice that the Board would pay the assignee only the amounts owed for <em>actual deliveries </em>of merchandise and that Shlifer’s “warranty” was a matter exclusively between him and the Bank. There is in the record testimony showing that in a later transaction with Shlifer the Bank did require proof of the delivery of the goods covered by his assignment. In <em>Hill et al. v. Epley et al., </em><a href="/pa/31/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="31 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="985079" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0331-01">31 Pa. 331</a>, 334, this court said: “If . . . the truth be known to both parties, or if they have equal means of knowledge, there can be no estoppel . . . one is not relieved, who had the means of becoming acquainted with the extent of his rights: ...

Its “acknowledgement” and “acceptance” of the assignments amounted in effect to its saying to the assignee only this: “Whatever payments are ultimately found to be due Shlifer for the liquor covered by these invoices will be made not to him but to you, his assignee.” Nothing the Board said invested the assignee with any greater rights to payment for the merchandise than the assignor possessed.</p>

Schlifer delivered merchandise to the value of $9,764.50 on order number 50896 and none on the other three. The Bank claimed the sum just stated and it was allowed, subject to set-offs and counter-claims hereinafter discussed. The Bank’s claim of $98.00 by virtue of an assignment to it of the balance supposedly due, $522.50 on order number 50896 was properly disallowed for non-delivery of the liquor. The Bank had loaned Shlifer $522.50 on March 8,1938, on account of this unfilled “balance of order” and assignment but it was later notified by the Board that “undelivered balances” on this order had been cancelled.

      <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>There is nothing in the foregoing testimony showing that the debts claimed as a set-off existed or were even germinating at the time of the notice of the assignment. A set-off <em>accruing after </em>such notice cannot avail a defendant. <em>(Northampton Bank v. Balliet, </em><a href="/watts-serg/8/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 311" data-case-ids="483362" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0311-01">8 W &amp; S. 311</a>, 318.) If the defendant had established its set-offs and had showed either that they existed at the time of the notice of the assignments or if they were not then matured they were inseparably connected with the dealings on which the claims sued for were based they would have been allowable. The counter-claimant’s burden of proof was not met by the vague testimony it produced. The largest item of the set-off was $3,329.89 as a “floor stock credit” covering “the reduced value of the merchandise . . . in the State Store.” Accepting the implication that this was Shlifer’s merchandise, there is still wanting proof that Shlifer agreed when he sold it that he would allow a credit for its later “reduced value”. We have here only the defendant’s <em>claim </em>for a credit on account of this “reduced value”. It is not unusual for the vendors of merchandise to allow to steady customers a credit when the thing sold, as, for example, an automobile, a short time after the sale is listed at a lower price, but such allowances are usually mere gratuities given in order to hold the customer’s patronage. There is nothing in the contracts sued upon in this case (which had been assigned to the plaintiff) giving the slightest intimation that the debtor was entitled to a future credit on account of possible “reduced value” of the merchandise contracted for. There were no <em>“facts existing at the time of the assignment” </em>on which the counter-claims here made are based. Under the evidence they amount to no more than credits claimed or gratuities asked for. Even if recognized as claims well founded in fact, they appear to have <em>accrued after </em>notice of the assignment and as such they are <em>not </em>available to the defendant.</p>

The court below in its opinion pointed to nothing either in law or in fact justifying the allowance of this set-off. The court said: “It is true the board characterizes it as a set-off. That was a misnomer. What the board was speaking of was a lack either complete or partial, on the part of Shlifer in not filling some of the orders or invoices mentioned. It is not controverted by Shlifer or the bank that such partial or complete failures to fill certain orders did take place.” The answer to that is that whenever it was shown that Shlifer failed “to fill certain orders”, his assignee, the Bank, was not allowed to recover its claim based on such unfilled orders and herein we sustain the disallowance of such claims. The Bank’s failure of proof in respect to the filling of these orders cannot be availed of by the defendant to make good <em>its </em>failure of proof in respect to the set-off <em>it </em>claims. We adjudge defendant’s proof in respect to each and all of the above items of set-off inadequate.</p>
