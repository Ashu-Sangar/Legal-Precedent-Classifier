Fred P. Wenz, the decedent, owned a fractional interest in certain gas wells in Ohio, the production of which was being sold to a fuel company. Agents were appointed by the owners <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>of the fractional interests to receive payments for the gas and distribute the same among the owners.

Conroy.” It is true that the phrase “without having made a will” tends to support appellants’ contention that the paper in question was not a will, but it is a legitimate inference from all the circumstances that what decedent meant by that phrase was this: “without making a formal will disposing of all of my property”. Knapp was a mere collector of these royalties and it is conceded that his duty was “to distribute the same among the parties in interest”. Wenz in the challenged paper gave Knapp explicit directions as to what he should do with the net proceeds of Wenz’s share of these royalties <em>after Wenz’s death </em>and that direction was to pay these proceeds to Mrs. Conroy. <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>Wenz made Mrs. Conroy “a party in interest” as soon as he should die.</p>
    <p id="b474-4" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[209,424,1162,1415]]]'>It is also true, as appellants contend, that “the fact that this decedent sought to protect his agent’s authority beyond decedent’s lifetime, and failed in that attempt, does not justify the lower court’s conclusion that a will was intended.” The conclusion challenged is not justified <em>~by that fact alone. </em>The fact that this paper is in law either a will in respect to the decedent’s share of the gas royalties or it is nothing is a fact which with other facts in the case was proper for the court’s consideration in determining whether or not it <em>was </em>a will. In <em>McCune’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/265/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="265 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="1051924" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0523-01">265 Pa. 523</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.%20156" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="109 A. 156">109 A. 156</a>, this court said in substance that the test of whether or not a paper signed by a decedent was his will is: Was it “intended as a post-humous destination of the maker’s property?” Wenz placed no limitation on Mrs. Conroy’s possession of this share of his property once these proceeds were paid to her after his death. He did not designate her as a custodian or agent, nor did he direct that she should turn the royalties over to an administrator of his estate after his death. He did not make her a mere conduit of these proceeds. He could easily have designated Mrs. Conroy as a mere holder of these proceeds for the benefit of his estate, after his death, but he did <em>not </em>do so, and that fact is of legal significance. Wenz was approaching death and it may be inferred that he contemplated it when he executed this paper.</p>

North, </em>3 Yeates’ Reports 324. As proof of the absence of this ingredient, appellants cite the testimony of Mrs. Agnes Myers, a nurse at the hospital, who secured the pen and paper at Knapp’s request, which Wenz used in writing the paper now before us. She testified that during the writing of the paper Wenz declared that “he did not have a will and that he did not intend to <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>make a will at this time”.
