She relies on the cases of <em>Double Dollar B. &amp; L. Association v. Kushin, </em><a href="/pa/306/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="306 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1136860" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0121-01">306 Pa. 121</a>, and <em>Jacob Sall B. &amp; L. Association v. Heller, </em><a href="/pa/314/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="314 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="1154710" data-case-paths="/pa/314/0237-01">314 Pa. 237</a>, where similar reset agreements were held to be a change of the contract in a material part so as to affect the nature and extent of the surety’s liability. However, in those cases, there was no question but that the defendant was a third party, not in the line of title, who had guaranteed the debt of the mortgagor. In the present case, the defendant was in the line of title and it is clear from the testimony that she had taken title under and subject to the mortgage prior to the execution of the bond upon which judgment was entered. Therefore, without deciding whether the cancellation of the shares in 1936 and the issuance of new .shares in 1938 had the same <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>legal effect as a reset agreement, we do not feel that the Kushin and Heller cases are in point.</p>
    <p id="b160-4" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[210,403,1163,1468]]]'>We feel that this case is controlled by <em>Joyce, to use, et al. v. Hawtof, </em><a href="/pa-super/135/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="135 Pa. Super. 30" data-case-ids="1017192" data-case-paths="/pa-super/135/0030-01">135 Pa. Superior Ct. 30</a>, where it was said “It was made clear in the Willock case <em>(Willock’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/58/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="58 Pa. Super. 159" data-case-ids="446139" data-case-paths="/pa-super/58/0159-01">58 Pa. Superior Ct. 159</a>) that under the facts shown the mortgagor and his grantee were each liable as principal debtors, each continuing liable severally for the payment of the debt (pp. 164, 165). Consequently, the authorities cited by the appellant with relation to the effect on the liability of a surety of the release of part of the security have no application. In the present case the facts are even stronger, for Mollie Cohen did not assume and agree to pay the mortgage. (See Act of June 12, 1878, P. L. 205, 21 PS §655.) She only became liable to the mortgagee by virtue of her independent agreement for the extension and that without the knowledge or approval of the original mortgagor. The argument of the able counsel for the appellant is based upon a confusion of terms. In a number of cases the relation between the original mortgagor and the grantee of the real estate who assumes and agrees to pay the mortgage is described as one of principal and surety as between themselves. The expression “principal and surety” does not correctly describe the relationship from the standpoint of the mortgagee.” Accordingly, it was held that the fact that the mortgagee entered into an extension agreement with the grantee did not release the grantor. Therefore, the defendant’s rule must be discharged.</p>
