I found among some old records a statement of the capital invested in Post and Company as of June 30,1923, that Mrs. M. L. Post had invested $4,500.

No question such as that presented by this appeal arose in that case. Whether or not the property of a member of a bankrupt partnership <em>vested </em>in the trustee as of the date of the filing of the petition was- not there an issue. As Justice Holmes speaking for the court there said: “This is a proceeding to review an order of the Bankruptcy Court to the effect that the separate estate of Stanley Francis <em>should be turned over for administration to the respondent, Me-Neal, trustee in bankruptcy </em>of a firm of which Francis was a member. (Italics supplied) . . . Creditors filed a petition against Latimer, Francis and Marrin, alleging that they were partners trading as the Provident Investment Bureau, and that they were bankrupt individually and as a firm. McNeal was appointed receiver of the partnership and individual estates, but Francis denied that he was a partner and sought to have the receiver discharged.” It was later duly adjudicated that Francis was a partner and Justice Holmes stated “That now stands admitted for the purposes of the present decision.” He then pointed out that “it would be an anomaly to allow proceedings in bankruptcy against joint debtors from some of whom, at any time before, pending, or after the proceeding, the debt could be collected in full.” He said further: “If, as in the present case, the partnership and individual estates together are not enough to pay the partnership debts, the rational thing to do, and one certainly not forbidden by the act, is to administer both in bankruptcy. ... If it be said that the logical result of our opinion is that the partners ought to be put into bankruptcy whenever the firm is, as held by the late Judge Lowell, in an able opinion, <em>In re Forbes, </em><a href="/f/128/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="128 F. 137" data-case-ids="6714980" data-case-paths="/f/128/0137-01">128 Fed.

The Court in dismissing the bill said: “To decide this question it is necessary to consider the powers and duties cast upon the trustee by the Bankruptcy Act. Sections 23a, 23b (Comp. St. section 9607), confer jurisdiction upon the United States courts. Section 47 (Comp. St. section 9631) defines the duties of trustees and provides that as to all property in the custody of the bankruptcy court he shall be deemed vested with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a creditor holding a lien by legal or equitable proceedings thereon; as to all property not in the cus<a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>tody of the bankruptcy court he shall be deemed vested with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a judgment creditor holding an execution duly returned unsatisfied.

St. section 9651) provides that all transfers or incumbrances of his property, made or given by a person adjudged a bankrupt within four months prior to the filing of the petition, if made to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, shall be null and void; that the property conveyed by such null and void conveyances, unless exempt, shall remain a part of the assets of the estate. None of these sections purpose to vest the power in the trustee of a bankrupt person to bring an action to accomplish results sought in this suit. The jurisdiction of equity to set aside fraudulent conveyances is too well recognized to need citation, but the circumstances under which such suits can be maintained are equally well defined. The right of a trustee of a bankrupt to maintain a suit to set aside conveyances as a fraud upon the creditors whom he represents must be found in the Bankruptcy Act, and the power and right given in said act does not authorize this suit. The bankrupt is J. D. Howze; the conveyances sought to be vacated were made by Charles F. Snyder. It is for the creditors of Charles F. Snyder to proceed against him, and not the trustee in bankruptcy of J. D. Howze.”</p>
