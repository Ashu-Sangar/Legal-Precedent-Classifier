The school district filed a statutory demurrer which was sustained.\nIt has been repeatedly held that school districts are not liable for such negligence: Devlin v. Phila. School District. 337 Pa. 209, 10 A.2d 408; Goldstein v. Phila. School District, 329 Pa. 71, 196 A. 863; Carlo v. Scranton School District, 319 Pa. 417, 179 A. 561; Ford v. Kendall Borough School District, 121 Pa. 543, 15 A. 812. The same rule prevails in many other jurisdictions.\nIn appellants\u2019 argument, it is suggested that as the defendant protected itself by liability insurance, it waived the immunity otherwise conceded to exist. No principle was suggested that would support a judgment against the defendant: compare Silverstein v. Kastner, 342 Pa. 207, 20 A.2d 205.\nJudgment affirmed.",
