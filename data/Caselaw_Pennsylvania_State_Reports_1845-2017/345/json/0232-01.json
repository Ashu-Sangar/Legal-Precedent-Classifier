        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the refusal of the court below to grant plaintiffs a new trial. The plaintiffs, Eleanor F. O\u2019Neill and Montgomery Trust Company, guardian of the estates of Mary K. O\u2019Neill and Margaret E. O\u2019Neill, minors, brought suit against the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for $50,000, with interest from May 29, 1937. The claim was based on three policies of insurance, herein designated respectively as policies A, B, and C, insuring the life of Dennis A. O\u2019Neill, husband of Eleanor F. O\u2019Neill and father of the two minors above named, in the respective sums of $20,000, $25,000, and $5,000. Policy A was dated January 28, 1930; the other two policies were dated November 20, 1934. Attached to policy A was a \u201crider\u201d agreeing to pay \u201cto the beneficiaries ... in addition to the amount payable according to the terms of said policy\u201d the sum of $20,000, \u201cupon receipt ... of due proof of the death of the insured, as the result, directly and independently of all other causes, of bodily injuries sustained through external, violent and accidental means, provided (1) . . . (2) ... (3) ... (4) ... (5) .. . (6) that death shall not have resulted from bodily injuries sustained while participating in aviation or aeronautics except as a fare-paying passenger, nor while the insured is in the Military or Naval Service in time of war, nor as the result of violation of law by the insured.\u201d Policies B and C had \u201criders\u201d attached to them containing the same provision as to paying additional amounts in the sums respectively of $25,000 and $5,000 upon the same \u201cdue proof of death through external, violent and accidental means, provided (1) . . . (2) . . . (3) . . . (4) . . . (5) . . . (6) that death shall not have resulted from bodily injuries sustained while participating in aviation or aeronautics, except as a fare-paying passenger on a licensed aircraft operated by a licensed pilot, nor sustained while or as a result of participating in or attempting to commit an assault or felony, nor sustained while the insured is in the Military or Naval Service in time of war.\u201d\nPlaintiffs\u2019 statement of claim sets forth, inter alia: \u201cThe said Dennis A. O\u2019Neill died on May 29,1937, in Ms thirty-eighth year, while the policies and supplemental contracts thereto were in full force and effect, . . . The said death was due directly and independently of all other causes to bodily injuries sustained through external, violent and accidental means, and was not the result of self destruction, or caused by or contributed to, directly or indirectly, or wholly or partly, by disease, or by bodily or mental infirmity, and did not result from bodily injuries sustained while participating in aviation or aeronautics, nor sustained while or as a result of participating in or attempting to commit an assault or felony, nor while the insured was in Military or Naval Service in time of war, nor as the result of violation of law by the insured.\nDue proofs of the insured\u2019s death were filed with the defendant and the face of the policies totaling $50,000 was paid to the plaintiffs but payment of the additional total sum of $50,000 claimed was refused.\u201d\nAt the trial the widow plaintiff testified that during the early morning of May 29,1937, she and her husband returned to their home in Norristown after having spent the preceding hours at an Inn. She and her husband then quarrelled and after \u201cpushing him away\u201d she went to the side porch of their home. She then heard one of her children crying upstairs and she ascended the stairway and there noticed blood on the wall. She met her father and from what her father told her she \u201crealized her husband was hurt\u201d and she then summoned a physician. She then saw her husband \u201clying on the floor unconscious\u201d. Shortly after the physician arrived, her husband died.\nMrs. O\u2019Neill\u2019s father, Joseph J. McGinley, who was sixty-nine years of age at the time of the insured\u2019s death, testified that on the morning above identified he \u201cheard a noise\u201d and \u201crushed out of\u201d his room to the hallway. \u201cIt was dark\u201d and the witness\u2019 eyes were \u201cnot so good\u201d. He \u201cbecame excited . . . thinking it might be a kidnapping or robbery\u201d. He \u201crushed back to his room and turned on the light\u201d, picked up his razor and \u201cstarted pell-mell for the first floor\u201d. He added: \u201cNear the top of the steps I ran into an object. I did not know who it was. I could not see in the dark.\u201d He and a man \u201cgrabbed each other\u201d and \u201cboth went down twelve flights of steps head over heels.\u201d He said: \u201cI was lying on the broad of my back . . . and Dennis O\u2019Neill was lying on my feet. I was the heaviest of the two.\u201d A short time later O\u2019Neill went to the living-room and the witness went upstairs and shortly afterwards the doctor came and told the witness \u201cthat O\u2019Neill was dead\u201d.\nDr. McCarthy described the fatal wound as \u201ca four inch gash in his neck, exposing [on the left side] the carotid artery, which was severed\u201d, resulting in a hemorrhage.\nOn cross-examination both Mrs. O\u2019Neill and her father were asked if they had not within an hour or two of O\u2019Neill\u2019s death given an entirely different version of this tragic happening. The other version as allegedly given to H. A. Oressman, reporter for the Norristown Times-Herald, and to others was that O\u2019Neill had become intoxicated at Bungalow Inn and had quarrelled with Mrs. O\u2019Neill. He had driven her home, ordered her out of the car and he then drove away. Later after Mrs. O\u2019Neill had undressed, O\u2019Neill returned and in a belligerent mood, called to his wife to come downstairs. She refused to do so. She finally went downstairs, to try to quiet her husband. He struck her and put her out of the house, though she was clad only in undergarments. Mc-Ginley had awakened and heard O\u2019Neill strike Mrs. O\u2019Neill and heard him declare he was going upstairs to put McGinley out of the house. McGinley then seized his razor in self-protection and stood at the top of the stairs. After O\u2019Neill struck McGinley twice in the face, despite the latter\u2019s remonstrance, McGinley in self-defense struck at O\u2019Neill, causing the fatal injury described. Witnesses Harper, Murphy, Eiler and Flynn gave testimony substantially similar to Cressman\u2019s. Edward Murphy, an investigator for the defendant company, testified that in a conversation with Mrs. O\u2019Neill on or about August 26,1937, in which she told him about her husband\u2019s \u201cpushing her down the stairs\u201d on the morning in question and \u201cstriking her twice very severely and put her outside\u201d and that he threatened to \u201cgo upstairs and get that old man of yours and put him out too.\u201d Witness McGlathery testified that when O\u2019Neill left the Inn on the morning in question \u201che felt his drinks\u201d and \u201ctalked very nasty, seemed to be provoked\u201d. The jury found for the defendant.\nAppellant complains that the trial judge did not submit this case to the jury under proper instructions. The fifth assignment of error is based upon the instruction to the jury that \u201cthe plaintiffs must [in respect to policies B and C] show to your satisfaction by a preponderance of the evidence that Dennis A. O\u2019Neill in each of the policies as the provisions read, did not die while or as a result of participating in or attempting to commit an assault or felony\u201d and [in respect to policy A] that death was not \u201cthe result from bodily injuries ... or violation of law\u201d by the insured.\nRecovery of the sums sued for in this case required proof of the death of the insured, \u201cas a result, directly and independently of all other causes, of bodily injury sustained through external, violent and accidental means\u201d. In Watkins v. Prudential Insurance Co., 315 Pa. 497, 512, 173 A. 644 (where death \u201cthrough external, violent and accidental means\u201d was claimed) we held that \u201con plaintiff rests the burden of proving all the operative facts by a fair preponderance of the evidence.\u201d In Erb v. Commercial M. Acc. Co., 232 Pa. 215, 81 A. 207, this court declared that \u201cthe death of an insured would not be effected by accidental means if it were the natural and probable consequence of Ms own act, and should have been foreseen.\u201d In Horan, Jr., v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 104 Pa. Superior Ct. 474, 159 A. 69, the Superior Court in an opinion by Judge Baldiiige stated that in a case where the question is: Did the insured meet Ms death \u201cby accidental means\u201d? \u201cthe answer depends on whether the insured culpably provoked or induced the act which resulted in his death\u201d. In Camp. Ad. v. Prud. Ins. Co. of A., 107 Pa. Superior Ct. 342, 348, 163 A. 320, there was cited with approval the case of Taliaferro v. Travelers\u2019 Protective Association of America, 80 Fed. 368, holding that where the insured brings about an assault upon himself by his own wrongful act, or where he, under such circumstances that he would naturally be presumed to know that the injury is likely to be inflicted, voluntarily incurs an obvious hazard of this character, or places himself in a position that may be reasonably expected to bring about an assault upon him, the injury so received is not effected by accidental means.\nIn Hutton v. States Accident Ins. Co., 267 Ill. 267, 108 N. E. 296, it was held that the insured in a \u201cdeath from accidental means policy was bound to know that one of the natural and probable consequences of voluntarily engaging in an assault . . . was that he might be injured, although he could not, of course, foresee the exact form of the injury he might receive, or, indeed, be able to know certainly that he would be injured at all. . . . ; the injury which he received as a result cannot be said to have been caused by accidental means.\u201d In Rousseau v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 11 N. E. (2d) 921, the Supreme Judicial Court of Mass, held that where insured and others stole an automobile, and the automobile left the road in the course of escape and pursuit because of its high speed, and insured was killed, his death was not sustained by \u201caccidental means\u201d so as to authorize recovery of additional death benefits under life policies.\n\u201cDeath from accidental means\u201d being what the foregoing cases state it to be, plaintiffs had the burden the court below cast upon them. Furthermore, by their pleadings the plaintiffs assumed the burden of proof, as the quotation, supra, from the statement of claim shows. The affidavit of defense accepted the issue tendered by denying the plaintiffs averments as to the insured\u2019s non-violation of law, etc. \u201cThe fundamental principle is that the burden of proof in any cause rests upon tbe party who as determined by the pleadings or the nature of the case asserts the affirmative of an issue, . . . One alleging a fact which is denied has the burden of establishing it. . . . The affirmative of an issue, as thus used, includes any negative proposition which the person asserting the affirmative may have to show.\u201d: 20 Am. Jur. sec. 135, pgs. 138-9. See also Lillie M. Otto, Adm., v. Western Saving Fund Society, 343 Pa. 615, 23 A.2d. 462.\nIn Real Est. Trust Co. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 340 Pa. 533, 17 A.2d. 416, this court held that in an \u201caccidental death\u201d policy which provided that \u201cthis indemnity shall not be payable if the death of the insured results . . . from disease or from bodily or mental infirmity\u201d the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the death of the insured was caused solely by accidental means, and that it was not produced directly or indirectly by disease or bodily infirmity.\u201d In accord: Harrison v. New York Life Ins. Co., 78 Fed. (2d) 421.\nAppellant relies on the case of Bowers v. Great Eastern C. Co., 260 Pa. 147, 103 A. 536. There the insured, named in an accident policy for f5,000 lost his life in an automobile accident allegedly due to the excessive speed of the car. The beneficiary in filing her statement of claim simply pleaded to fact of the existence of the policy, attaching it to her statement of claim and a'/erred that her husband \u201cwas killed on August 27, 1913, while the said policy was in force and that she furnished the defendant with good and sufficient proof of the death of\u201d the insured. The policy contained a provision that \u201cthis insurance does not cover injuries fatal or otherwise\u201d resulting from the insured \u201cbeing affected by intoxicants . . . [or from] unnecessary exposure to obvious danger [or from] violating law.\u201d The affidavit of defense averred that the \u201cinsured\u2019s death resulted from his unnessary exposure to danger\u201d and that he \u201cwas killed operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, . . . this constitutes an unlawful act within the prohibition of the policy and by reason thereof plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Nothing was said in the charge of the court as to where the burden of proof lay on any phase of the case. The issues litigated were the allegation of the insured\u2019s intoxication, the excessive speed of the car and, chiefly, \u201cdid the violation of law by driving at an. unlawful speed have a necessary connection with the accident\u201d. Neither in \u201cthe statement of questions involved\u201d nor in the assignments of error was there the slightest reference to the question of burden of proof. On appeal to this court the judgment of the court below was affirmed. Appellant\u2019s contention that any intoxication of the insured while driving the car avoided the policy was rejected and it was held that the intoxication in order to avoid the policy must have been such as to affect \u201cthe assured\u2019s ability to operate the car\u201d. This court said: \u201cThe burden resting on the company in the matter of proof is not discharged by merely showing that shortly before the accident the insured had indulged in intoxicants, proper and competent as such evidence would be, but, except as the evidence goes further and establishes facts warranting a conclusion that the accident occurred as a consequence or result of the assured having taken intoxicants, the defense must fall.\u201d It was also said: \u201cThe defense being affirmative in character, the defendant assumed the burden of showing that the assured, when the accident occurred, was affected by intoxicants, was violating law and exposing himself to unnecessary danger.\u201d\nWhat this court there said about burden of proof was dictum; it was said on an issue not raised and on a matter not involved. If the defense was \u201caffirmative in character\u201d it was because the parties by their pleadings made it so; the parties here did otherwise, as is pointed out above. Furthermore, a defense affirmative in character does not always cast the burden of proof upon a defendant. Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd. ed., vol. 9, sec. 2486, p. 274, says: \u201cIt is often said that the burden is upon the party having in form the affirmative allegation. But this is not an invariable test, nor even always a significant circumstance; the burden is often on one who has a negative assertion to prove; a common instance is that of a promisee alleging non-performance of a contract.\u201d Another example is found in actions for malicious prosecution where a plaintiff must show want of probable cause for his having been prosecuted. See Altman v. Standard Refrig. Co., Inc., 315 Pa. 465, 477, 173 A. 411, where we said: \u201cThough such allegation [want of probable cause] is a negative one . . . , the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove [it] affirmatively.\u201d\nAppellants also quote in support of their position what we said in Watkins v. Prudential Ins. Co., supra, at p. 508 as follows: \u201cWhen a defendant seeks to avail itself of the substantive defense reserved in the policy that the loss was due to a cause or risk specifically excepted in the policy the defense becomes an affirmative one and has the burden of proof.\u201d We made a similar statement in Zenner v. Goetz (Travelers Ind. Co., Aplnt.), 324 Pa. 432, 435, 188 A. 124. We also said in the cases cited: \u201cAccidental death is in such cases an operative fact and on plaintiff there always rests the duty of proving all such facts in order to recover on a contract [of insurance].\u201d Under the cases we have earlier cited, plaintiffs had to prove that the insured did not culpably provoke the act which resulted in his death. If they failed to prove this fact they did not meet the burden of proving the operative facts of the policy sued upon. \u201cProof of tibe nature of the occurrence resulting in death is an essential part of plaintiff\u2019s claim for double indemnity\u201d in cases in which death from accidental means is pleaded: New York Life Ins. Co. v. Ollich, 6 C. C. A. 42 Fed. (2d) 399. In the instant case the proof of the nature of the fatal occurrence offered by the plaintiffs was such as might reasonably lead the jury to decide that the burden of proof resting upon plaintiffs had not been met. This was the situation at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 direct testimony as well as after Mrs. O\u2019Neill and her father had been cross-examined, and after it was testified to by other witnesses that shortly after the fatal occurrence a version of it had been given out by Mrs. O\u2019Neill and her father which showed that the insured had made threats to \u201cget that old man of yours\u201d (meaning Mr. McGinley), and that \u201cDennis [the insured] reached for the razor and then fell down stairs and in the fall Dennis was . . . slashed in the throat\u201d, the jury was warranted in reaching the conclusion that the insured\u2019s death was not \u201cthe result of bodily injuries sustained through . . . accidental means\u201d.\nThe first, seventh, eighth, and ninth assignments of error are based on the court\u2019s instructions as to the alleged unlawfulness of the insured\u2019s conduct at the time in question. The court said: \u201cHis acts, if you believe the witnesses for the defendant company, were in violation of law and constituted an assault or an attempt to commit an assault.\u201d Appellants argue that \u201cbefore the insured can be said to be guilty of a felony, or an assault, or violation of law within the meaning of the policies, he must have been such an aggressor that he could reasonably foresee that as a result of his own actions it was likely that he would be killed. Considering the evidence it is apparent that the insured in the present case was not such an aggressor.\u201d We cannot agree that the evidence does not show the insured to have been the aggressor on the morning in question. It was his acts which caused his father-in-law to believe that \u201ca kidnapping or robbery\u201d was taking place downstairs and to pick up his razor and open it, \u201cthinking there was something radically wrong\u201d. Nor can we agree that in order to adjudicate the insured as a violator of law within the meaning of the policies, he had to be so aggressively lawless as to make him \u201creasonably foresee that as a result of his own actions it was likely he would be killed\u201d. If he had foreseen the tragic consequences of his acts, it is reasonable to believe he would have desisted from them. No one contends that the insured intended to invite his own destruction. Persons who drive automobiles at a lawless and excessive rate of speed usually do not intend to kill themselves, but nevertheless if their death does result from such an action, it cannot be contended that they were not engaged in a lawless act. \u201cTo avoid liability [in a case like this] it must be established that the violation of law was the cause of, or had some causative connection with the accident\u201d: Couch Encyclopedia of Ins. Law, Vol. 6, p. 4512, sec. 1736. Wells v. New England M. L. Ins. Co., 191 Pa. 207, 43 A. 126. Travellers Ins. Co. v. Seaver, 19 Wall 531. In the instant case \u201cthe causative connection\u201d of the insured\u2019s unlawful conduct \u201cwith the accident\u201d was a legitimate inference for the jury to draw.\nThe sixth and seventh assignments of error are based upon excerpts from the charge which according to appellants amounted to a submission of the defendant\u2019s testimony to the jury \u201cwith the same weight and value as plaintiffs\u201d. We see no merit in these assignments. The trial judge made it clear to the jury that the credibility of the witnesses was \u201cthe most important question in this case\u201d. The testimony of the witnesses called by the defense to show that Mrs. O\u2019Neill and her father had given versions of this fatal affair which varied from the story they told on the witness stand and which was less favorable to plaintiffs\u2019 claim was competent to affect the credibility of these two witnesses. The verdict of the jury indicates that it concluded that plaintiffs had failed to meet the burden of proof resting upon them, and we find that on this record the verdict was contrary to neither the law nor the evidence.\nAll the assignments of error are overruled.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\n\u201cThere is a well-defined distinction between a death resulting-from an accident and one resulting from accidental means. As is well said in 3 Joyce on Insurance, sec. 2863, p. 208: \u2018A person may do a certain act the result of which act may produce unforseen consequences, and may produce what is commonly called accidental death, but the means are exactly what the man intended to use, and did use, and was prepared to use. The means were not accidental, but the result might be accidental.\u2019 \u201d: Fidelity & Casualty Co. v. Stacey\u2019s Exr\u2019s., 143 Fed. 271, 274.\nPrudential Casualty Co. v. Curry, 65 So. 852, 853, 10 Ala. App. 642. Koester v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, 179 A. 327, 329, 6 W. W. Harr 537. Eraldi v. North American Accident Ins. Co., D. C. Cal., 20 F. Supp. 735, 736, are all in accord.\nThe applicable provisos in the policies sued upon, which provisos plaintiffs claim east the burden of proof upon the defendant, merely put expressly in the policies what under the decisions herein quoted were already there by law. \u201cJExisting laws giving rights to parties to a contract or limiting their rights, become a part of the contract as though specially set forth therein\u201d: Hutchinson v. Ward, 114 N. Y. App. Div. 156, 69 N. Y. S, 708.\nThe decisions on the question whether or not a plaintiff in actions based on insurance contracts like or similar to this one now before us must assume the burden of showing that the cause of action does not faU within the excepting clauses of the contract are in conflict in various jurisdictions. This conflict is well defined by the Supreme Court of Texas in Travelers Ins. Co. v. Harris, 212 S. W. 933, as follows: \u201cThose courts which treat the contracts as being general, and the clauses declaring what they shall not cover as \u2018stipulations added to the principal contract to avoid the promise of the insurer by way of defeasance or excuse,\u2019 hold that these clauses are defensive, and must be pleaded and sustained by the insurer; while the courts which construe the exception clauses as \u2018taking something out of the general portion of the contract, so that the promise is to perform only what remains after the part excepted is taken,\u2019 place the burden of pleading and proof upon the assured to negative them by showing that his cause of action does not come within the exception.\u201d Under the interpretation of \u201cdeath as the result of bodily injuries sustained through accidental means\u201d, prevailing in Pennsylvania, there is no occasion for any confusion or conflict as to where the burden of proof lies in eases like the one now before us.",
