        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Patteeson,\nThis was an action in trespass for injuries allegedly resulting from negligence in the operation of a street railway car.\nEthel I. Hufnagle, the plaintiff, testified that she boarded a street car of Pittsburgh Railways Company, entering at a door in the center of the car; that as she was walking towards the rear of the car to find a seat it started with a \u201cvery violent lurch\u201d; that the lurch was \u201cthe most violent\u201d she had ever encountered in riding street cars; and that she fell or was thrown to the floor of the car, sustaining injuries. At the time Miss Hufnagel was carrying an umbrella, a pocketbook, a package of mail in a large envelope, and a book. She admitted she did not take hold of any support as she proceeded towards the rear of the car, although she testified she had one arm free. Another witness, one Thompson, testified that the car \u201cstarted with a lurch, kind of a jump\u201d; that the lurch was \u201cmore severe\u201d than usual; and stated it \u201cjerked me back on the seat.\u201d Trube, the only other witness, testified the car \u201cstarted off with a jerk\u201d; that it was \u201cone of the most violent jerks I have experienced in a street car\u201d; that \u201cthere seemed to be a little confusion, people slipping about in their seats\u201d; and that the jerk knocked a package off his lap.\nAt the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the whole of which is as above stated, the Railways Company moved for binding instructions on the ground that the evidence was not sufficient in law to sustain a charge of negligent operation. Binding instructions were refused and the jury returned a verdict against the company in the sum of $4500. The Railways Company then filed a motion for judgment n. o. v., which was likewise refused, and judgment was entered against tlie company, in the amount of the verdict, from which it appeals.\n\u201cIn a long line of decisions, reviewed by us in Smith v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 314 Pa. 541, this Court and the Superior Court have held that statements that a street car \u2018started violently,\u2019 \u2018started with a violent jerk,\u2019 \u2018started with a sudden, unusual, extraordinary jerk,\u2019 \u2018stopped with a jerk,\u2019 \u2018came to a hard stop,\u2019 \u2018started up all of a sudden, with an awful jerk, and stopped all of a sudden,\u2019 and the like, are not of themselves sufficient to show negligent operation of the car, but there must be evidence inherently establishing that the occurrence was of an unusual and extraordinary character, or evidence of its effect on other passengers sufficient to show this\u201d: Endicott v. Phila. R. T. Co., 318 Pa. 12, 14. Or, as expressed more recently in Staller v. Phila. R. T. Co., 339 Pa. 100, 103-04: \u201cIt is well established by a long line of decisions that testimony indicating that a moving trolley car jerked suddenly or violently is not sufficient, of itself, to establish negligence in its operation. There must be a showing of additional facts and circumstances from which it clearly appears that the movement of the car was so unusual and extraordinary as to be beyond a passenger\u2019s reasonable anticipation, and nothing short of evidence that the allegedly unusual movement had an extraordinarily disturbing effect upon other passengers, or evidence of an accident the manner of the occurrence of which or the effect of which upon the injured person inherently establishes the unusual character of the jolt or jerk will suffice.\u201d See also Hill v. West Penn Rys. Co., 340 Pa. 297, 298.\nFar from showing an occurrence that could have been caused only by an extraordinary jolt or jerk, appellee\u2019s evidence as to the happening of the accident and its effect upon her is entirely consistent with a mere loss of equilibrium brought about by a movement of the car of the type she was bound to anticipate and guard against. Encumbered with packages and walking unsupported in the car, she was obviously in a position to be toppled over by an ordinary jerk such as is incident to the usual operation of trolley cars, and her fall, occasioned under these circumstances, was not so unusual or violent as to permit a jury to predicate thereon a finding that the jerk was the result of negligent operation. \u201cIt is common knowledge that a passenger can be thrown out of his seat only by an unusual or extraordinary jerk, whereas it is not unusual for persons to lose their balance while standing or walking in a car if an ordinary or moderate jerk occurs\u201d: Smith v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., supra, 544. See also Endicott v. Phila. R. T. Co., supra; McClusky v. Shenango Val. Traction Co., 105 Pa. Superior Ct. 275. Nor is the deficiency in appellee\u2019s evidence supplied to any extent by the testimony of the witness Thompson that the jolt \u201cjerked me back on the seat\u201d or that of Trube that he observed \u201cpeople slipping about in their seats.\u201d In Smith v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., supra, it was held a statement that other passengers were \u201cjolted about\u201d did not constitute evidence of negligent operation, and a like conclusion was reached in McClusky v. Shenango Val. Traction Co., supra, where it was testified \u201ceverybody in the car lurched.\u201d Similarly inconclusive is the testimony that the start knocked a package off the witness Thompson\u2019s lap, since it may have been so balanced that the slightest movement would have caused it to fall. To permit of an inference that the jerk or jolt was excessive, based upon the effect on other passengers, it must clearly be shown not only that they were affected by the movement, but to a greater extent than is usual, and this appellee\u2019s evidence obviously fails to do.\nViewed in its most favorable light, the evidence clearly falls short of the standard required to establish negligence in cases of this character; and the conclusion of the court below to the contrary antagonizes all our eases on the subject. We might add that no authority is cited as supporting the view of the court below, either in its opinion or in the paper book of the appellee, and no attempt has been made to distinguish Endicott v. Phila. R. T. or McClusky v. Shenango Val. Traction Co., both cited supra, which cases we deem absolutely controlling here.\nThe judgment is reversed and judgment is here entered for appellant, Pittsburgh Railways Company.",
