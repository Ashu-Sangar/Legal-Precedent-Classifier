    "head_matter": "Darrah, Appellant, v. Darrah.\nDeed \u2014 Trust and trustee \u2014 Children\u2014Heirs\u2014Habendum.\nAn owner of land executed a deed to his son by which he conveyed to his son \u201chis heirs and assigns in trust for the children and heirs, share and share alike of the said\u201d son, all that certain messuage, etc., reserving one room in said house and a living with the said son so long as the grantor shall survive, \u201c to have and to hold the said premises with all and singular the appurtenances, unto the said party of the second part in trust for his heirs and assigns, to the only proper use, benefit and behoof of the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d Held, (1) that-the son took no interest whatever in the property conveyed ; (2) that, the son\u2019s children in existence at the date of the deed took title to the property without reference to any after-born child or the grantee\u2019s widow.\nArgued Feb. 3, 1902.\nAppeal, No. 306, Jan. T., 1901, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. Montgomerjr Co., June T., 1901, No. 1, on bill in equity, in case of Mary Darrah, widow of Samuel Jones Darrah, deceased, and the Albertson Trust and Safe Deposit Company, guardian of Bessie L. Darrah, a minor, v. Percival W. Darrah, Thomas W. Darrah, Edna J. Darrah, James B. Darrah and Thomas Darrah.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Dean, Fell, Bkown and Mest\u00faezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for partition.\nDemurrer to bill.\nWband, J., filed tbe following opinion:\nThis case comes before us on a general demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 bill, which asks for partition of land conveyed by a deed whose peculiar phraseology has given rise to dispute as to ownership. The petitioners are the widow and minor child of Samuel Jones Darrah, and the defendants are other children of said Darrah. The parties to the deed are Thomas B. Darrah, grantor, and Samuel Jones Darrah, grantee. The deed sets forth that \u201c the said party of the first part, for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar, and the natural love and affection, lawful money of the United States of America, well and truly paid, etc., has granted, etc., unto the same party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, in trust for the children and heirs, share and share alike of the said Samuel Jones Darrah, all that certain messuage,\u201d etc., \u201creserving one room in the northwest corner of the second story of the dwelling house, and a living with the said Samuel Jones Darrah so long as the said Thomas B. Darrah shall survive, with all the comforts and conveniences he has ever enjoyed.\u201d\n\u201c To have and to hold the said premises, with all and singular the appurtenances, unto the said party of the second part in trust for his heirs and assigns to the only proper use, benefit and behoof of the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d\nThe tenendum also uses the words \u201cheirs and assigns\u201d in connection with the party of the second part.\nThomas B. Darrah died intestate in 1889 unmarried and without issue, and leaving to survive him no brothers or sisters of the whole blood but the issue of a deceased brother, James Darrah, who died intestate in 1868, to wit: Samuel J. Darrah, now deceased (grantee in the deed), and James B. Darrah and Thomas J. Darrah, both living.\nSamuel Jones Darrah died intestate on September 16, 1897, in California, leaving to survive him, a widow, Mary Darrah, plaintiff first above named, and four children, to wit: Bessie L. Darrah, Percival W. Darrah, Thomas W. Darrah and Edna J. Darrah, all of whom are of full age and sui juris, except the said Bessie L. Darrah, who is a minor, having for her guardian \u201c The Albertson Trust and Safe Deposit Company \u201d of Norristown, Pa.\nBessie L. Darrah, one of the plaintiffs, was born October 4, 1897, of a second marriage of said Samuel Jones Darrah and consequently was not in being at the date of the deed.\nPercival W. Darrah, Thomas W. Darrah and Edna J. Darrah, three of the children of Samuel Jones Darrah, deny the jurisdiction of the court to make partition as prayed for upon the ground, (1) That Samuel Jones Darrah did not have any estate or interest in the land and therefore his widow has no standing to ask partition, and (2) that as Bessie L. Darrah was not in esse at the time of the grant she cannot be included under the designation \u201c children \u201d as contemplated by the deed and therefore she has no standing to demand partition.\nIt is our duty so to construe this deed as, if possible, to carry out the intention of the parties and to give to each part its proper and legal effect. The frequent use of the words \u201c in trust\u201d rebuts the idea that an absolute estate was intended to be granted to Samuel Jones Darrah, for, if the grantor intended an estate in fee simple the words \u201c in trust \u201d would be inconsistent. See Warn v. Brown, 102 Pa. 347. Nor are there any words or terms used which give him a life or other estate to his own use : Warn v. Brown, 102 Pa. 347.\nA conveyance to the heirs of a living person is void for uncertainty (Morris v. Stephens, 42 Pa. 200), and therefore no estate passed to any person under that designation. If we strike out the word \u201c heirs \u201d in the premises it leaves the grant to the children of said Samuel Jones Darrah; or if we construe the word \u201c heirs \u201d as used indiscriminately and synonymously with \u201c children \u201d we have the same result. In Huss v. Stephens, 51 Pa. 282, where the grant was \u201c to the heirs of Andrew Lantz, Jr.,\u201d \u201cin consideration of the natural love and affection he hath for his grandchildren \u201d the conveyance was held good, and the word \u201c heirs \u201d applied to the grandchildren as persons, in being and competent to take. We cannot, see, therefore, why the conveyance up to this point was not good to Samuel Jones Darrah in trust for his children.\nDo the words in the habendum \u201c in trust for his heirs and assigns, to the only proper use, benefit and behoof of the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns forever,\u201d change or destroy the estate first granted ? The purpose of the habendum is to define the extent of the interest granted, if that interest has not already been defined, and whilst it may be used to explain or qualify the grant, as set forth in the premises, it cannot be used to defeat it: Tyler v. Moore, 42 Pa. 374. If the habendum be absolutely repugnant to the premises, if it cannot be reconciled with them, so that full effect can be given to both, it must give way, and the premises must stand. In a deed the premises will prevail: Tyler v. Moore, 42 Pa. 374.\nIn this case, therefore, if the habendum by the use of the words \u201c his heirs and assigns \u201d is repugnant to the premises which give the land \u201cin trust for his children,\u201d the premises will prevail; but in addition the habendum in one part is \u201c in trust for his heirs and assigns.\u201d\nIn Warn v. Brown et al., 102 Pa. 347, it was said: \u201c Where in a deed the word \u2018 children \u2019 and \u2018heirs \u2019 are used indiscriminately in order to harmonize the two parts of the deed, the word \u2018 children \u2019 will be substituted for the word \u2018 heirs \u2019 in the habendum.\u201d\nAs we view the case this grant was to Samuel Jones Darrah in trust for his children, their heirs and assigns, and the only remaining question is as to the interest of Bessie L. Darrah, and, this will depends upon whether Samuel Jones Darrah took any interest in the land.\nIt is contended by plaintiffs that the condition or reservation \u201c reserving one room in the northwest corner of the second story of the dwelling house, and a living with the said Samuel Jones Darrah so long as the said Thomas B. Darrah shall survive, with all the comforts and conveniences he has ever enjoyed,\u201d conveys a life estate to Samuel Jones Darrah; if so his after-born child would be included amongst his children. But we cannot so construe the grant. No mention is made of any title or interest to vest in him. True the natural love and affection is that existing between Thomas and Samuel, but this may be a good consideration for the gift to the latter\u2019s children. Samuel is but a dry trustee, or conduit, through whom the estate vests in his children.\nThe deed may reserve a room in the house and a living and maintenance by Thomas with Samuel at another place, and if Samuel accepted the deed for his children he might be liable for the condition, but it gives him no interest in the land itself.\nMay 19, 1902:\nThe law is well settled that \u201c where there is an immediate gift to children those only living at the testator\u2019s death will take; but it is now well settled, that where a particular estate is carved out, with a gift over to the children of the person taking that interest, or of any other person, the limitation will embrace not only the objects living at the death of the testator, but all who shall subsequently come into existence before the period of distribution: \u201d Minnig v. Batdorff, 5 Pa. 508; Gross\u2019s Est., 10 Pa. 360; Landwehr\u2019s Est., 147 Pa. 121.\nHere the grant is immediate. There are persons in being competent to take and there is no particular estate with a gift over. The estate granted vested immediately upon the execution and delivery of the deed, and only those then in being who answered to the description, could take as grantees.\nAs the widow is not entitled to dower and as Bessie L. Darrah, the other petitioner, has no estate or interest in the land, their request for partition must be denied.\nAnd now, April 16, 1901, the demurrer is sustained and the bill is dismissed at costs of plaintiff.\nError assigned was decree dismissing bill.\nMontgomery Evans, with him James B. Holland and John M. Bettra, for appellant, cited :\nWager v. Wager, 1 S. & R. 374; White v. Williamson, 2 Grant, 249; Goursey v. Davis, 46 Pa. 25; Wolford v. Morgenthal, 91 Pa. 30; Hague v.
