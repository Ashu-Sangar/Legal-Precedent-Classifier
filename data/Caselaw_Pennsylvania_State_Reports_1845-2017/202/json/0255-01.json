        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Brown,\nIn her bill for an account of the rents, issues and profits of the real estate of her deceased husband, and for the assignment of her dower, the appellee included an undivided sixth in what was known as the Putnam street property, of which he had not died seized, but which was conveyed to his estate on June 19, 1890, more than ten years after his death. The consideration was $1.00 and \u201c other property deeded \u201d to the grantors, and it passed to them from the decedent\u2019s estate. The master was of opinion that the presumption was that the \u201c other property deeded \u201d in exchange for this one-sixth interest was land of which the husband had died seized, and that neither F. W. DeWitt, the son of the decedent, nor the estate of Perry S. Billings, his successor in title, could be heard to question the right of the widow to demand her dower in it after it had been so taken in exchange for land of which she had been dowable. This conclusion of the master, sustained by the court, was based upon the analogy of the common-law rule, that, if the husband seized of an estate of inheritance, exchanged it for other lands, the wife should not have the dower of both estates, but should be put to her election: Co. Litt, 31 b.; 2 Bl. Com, 129; 4 Kent, 59; 2 Kerr on Real Property, 797. With us, as long ago as Kelly v. Mahan, 2 Yeates, 515, it was held that dower lay for lands held by improvement right alone, the court saying, \u201c We have gone too far into the improvement doctrine, to exclude a widow from her claim of dower of lands, held under such equitable, though imperfect title, so frequently recognized by the laws and usage of this state; \u201d and in Pritts v. Ritchey, 29 Pa. 71, it was held that an equitable title was equivalent to a legal seisen. The finding that the appellee was dowable of this sixth interest was correct, and, but for error in directing that she was entitled to an account of the rents, issues and profits from the death of her husband, committed in view of a fact which ought to have been found, the decree appealed from would not be disturbed.\nCounsel for the appellant, W. P. Billings, administrator of the estate of P. S. Billings, deceased, asked for a finding of the fact that, from the death of D. D. DeWitt, on February 19, 1880, to the death of F. W. DeWitt, his son, on June 12, 1899, the widow had allowed and trusted the son, as her agent, to collect the rents, issues and profits of the real estate; and, having assumed that the finding of fact would be as requested, the master was asked to conclude, as a matter of law, that, the widow having elected to take her share of the rents, issues and profits accruing from the death of D. D. DeWitt to the death of F. W. DeWitt, the son and heir, who had collected the same as her agent, she is not now entitled to an account of them during that period. If the fact should have been found as requested, the legal conclusion asked for would inevitably have followed; for it would be most inequitable to compel the purchaser of the real estate of D. D. DeWitt, deceased, to pay his widow the rents, issues and profits for twenty years, after she had allowed her son, as her agent, to collect them during that period and undertook to repudiate his agency only after he had died and she discovered that he had squandered or misappropriated what he had collected. The widow herself was the witness upon this question of the agency of her son, and but one inference can be drawn from what she says. Her testimony was as follows: \u201c Q. You permitted your son, F. W. DeWitt, to collect all the rents and take all the purchase money and all the issues and profits -from the real estate that your husband owned at his death, in 1880, up to the time of the death of F. W. DeWitt, in 1899 ? A. I permitted him to because he was administrator and done the business. He didn\u2019t ask me whether he could do it or not. I permitted him to go on and do it. I didn\u2019t make any demand on him to pay them over, but I expected him to. I expected him to pay my share some time. ... Q. If Frank DeWitt had not died, it was not your intention, was it, to demand any part of the rents, issues and profits out of these lands in controversy from F. W. DeWitt? A. I expected, if he lived, to have something left for me. I allowed him to collect these rents, issues and profits because he was doing the business, because he was administrator of the estate. Q. He was collecting the rents as your agent, was he ? A. I suppose that was what it would be, wouldn\u2019t it, Mr. Frear? I didn\u2019t make him pay my share, I suppose, because I was too easy with him.\u201d She further testified: \u201c 1 didn\u2019t object to his taking the rents, issues and profits, and purchase money, because he did the business, and I supposed he would do what was right. He was administrator.\u201d\nThere is nothing doubtful in what the widow says about the son\u2019s collection of the rents and profits ; and, if the only conclusion that could be drawn from her testimony was not drawn in the court below, we must draw it here. It is not the case of a finding on disputed facts, or involving the credibility of witnesses, which will not be disturbed except for clear error committed; but it is a manifest failure to find the only thing that could have been found from the admissions of the widow. True, she may not have formally, nor by any writing, constituted her son her agent; but she so regarded him and allowed him to so act for her in the collection of the rents and income from her husband\u2019s estate. It is, then, our duty to correct the reasoning and conclusion of the master and court below on the appellee\u2019s admissions: Phillips\u2019s Appeal, 68 Pa. 130; Sproull\u2019s Appeal, 71 Pa. 137; McConomy v. Reed, 152 Pa. 42. The master\u2019s second finding of fact, confirmed by the court, is reversed, and the finding now is, that, between the death of D. D. DeWitt, February 19, 1880, and June 12, 1899, F. W. DeWitt, as the son and agent of the appellee, collected the rents, issues and profits arising from the real estate.of the deceased. The fifth, sixth and tenth assignments are sustained. The twelfth assignment is sustained to the extent of directing that the appellee pay all the costs in the accounting branch of the case and one third of the costs in the partition branch.\nThe decree is reversed find the record remitted, that the errors in the account stated may be corrected in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion, the costs on this appeal to be paid by the appellee.",

DeWitt, Deceased, Decker DeWitt, Clinton DeWitt, Melissa DeWitt and Perry S. Billings.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Dean, Brown and Mestjrazat, JJ.\nReversed.\nBill in equity for an account and assignment of dower.\nThe case was referred to E. J. Jorden, Esq., as master, who reported in favor of the plaintiff.\nExceptions to the master\u2019s report were dismissed, and' a decree was entered in favor of the plaintiff.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing exceptions to the master\u2019s report.\nC. O. Dersheimer, for appellant.\nThe widow\u2019s right, her \u201c statutory share \u201d in lands, sometimes called statutory dower, attaches only to lands of which her husband died seized: Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 315, sec. 15; Gray v. McCune, 23 Pa. 447; Riddlesberger v. Mentzer, 7 Watts, 141; Leinaweaver v. Stoever, 1 W. & S. 160; Gourley v. Kinley, 66 Pa. 270; Benner v. Evans, 3 P. & W. 454.\nThe widow of D. D. DeWitt elected to take the annual rents, issues and profits from these lands, collected by herself in part, and the balance by her son, F. W. DeWitt, as her agent, in lieu of having her share set out under the statutory proceedings.\nThe auditor\u2019s finding of fact based upon insufficient evidence will be reversed on appeal: Fehl's Est., 13 Pa. Superior Ct. 601.\nThe widow cannot collect the rents herself or by her agent, and still have damages for detention of dower, from the same lands, any more than she can collect damages for detention of dower from lands occupied by her as widow: 1 Cord on Legal and Equitable Rights of Married Women, sec. 544; Paul v. Paul, 36 Pa. 270.\nA widow may estop herself from right to claim dower by her positive acts: Cunningham\u2019s Estate, 137 Pa. 621; Share v. Anderson, 7 S. & R. 43; Zeigler\u2019s Appeal, 1 Chester County Rep. 515; Evans v.

Frear, for appellee.\nA joint owner can demand in equity an accounting from the other owners for profits under Statute 4 Anne: Frisbee\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 144; Enterprise Oil & Gas Co. v. National Transit Co., 172 Pa. 421.\nThis additional remedy of the widow as joint owner explains the cases of Sandback v. Quigley, 8 Watts, 460, and Zeigler\u2019s Appeal, 1 Chester Co. Reps. 515.\nThe action of the widow for her dower rights is de terris. The tenant or owner at the time of suing out the writ is liable for the rents received by the owners before him: Brewster\u2019s C. P. Practice, sec. 1097; Seaton v. Jamison, 7 Watts, 533; Heller\u2019s Appeal, 116 Pa. 534.\nApril 21, 1902:\nMere forbearance or laches will not deprive the widow of her right to an account for rents and profits: Worthington v. Worthington, 9 Kulp, 513; Karstein v. Bauer, 4 Penny. 366; Heller\u2019s App., 116 Pa. 534.\nEven if the widow did not sign the deed given in exchange, she can elect which land she will claim her dower from: 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 59."
