But as the court below found upon ample evidence \u201cthat Sutcliffe knew what he was doing, that he had capacity to decide for himself, that he was not, in fact, overreached at all, but made just the kind of bargain he desired, and his partner agreed to,\u201d there is no basis for the application of the principles invoked by appellants.\nDecree affirmed.",
