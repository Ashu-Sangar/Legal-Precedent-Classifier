    <p class="summary" id="b449-13" data-blocks='[["BL_449.18",449,[138,2123,1178,251]]]'>Tbe right to erect poles on the streets in question may be in tbe defendant; but the right to say where and liow such poles shall be erected, is in the plaintiff. And the sixth section of the ordinance of 1899 provides a reasonable manner for the exercise of such right by the city.</p>

The defendant may have acquired certain vested rights by virtue of the ordinance of 1882, and acts done pursuant thereto; but the right to extend its lines and erect new poles upon the public streets wherever it may desire and in defiance of the city authorities cannot be conceded. It is no hardship for the defendant to apply to the city councils for the location of the new poles for the proposed extension of its lines. And should such application be refused, a different question would be presented.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[289,825,1187,457]]]'>The proviso to the ordinance of 1882 “ that the poles of said company shall be located and erected under the supervision and approval of the city engineer,” did not, in my opinion, vest in the defendant the right to have them so located for all time. For while the right to erect poles majr be vested, yet, the right to have any particular official supervise such _ erection, is not. Surely any rights that the defendant may have acquired in streets, not yet occupied, would not be lost by the abolishing of the office of city engineer.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[287,1290,1187,460]]]'>Nor can the erection of the poles in controversy be justified by the fact that, prior to the passage of the ordinance of 1899, the city engineer may have approved of such locations, for such approval was withdrawn before any of said poles were erected. And in my opinion such approval by the city engineer was rendered invalid by the said ordinance as to poles not erected before its passage. And, besides, the poles here in dispute were not erected under the supervision and control of the city engineer.</p>
