The reason, mode of operation and limitation of the doctrine of conversion are stated by Mr. Justice Mitchell thus: “ The doctrine of equitable conversion is based on the rule that what is to be, or ought to be done, shall be treated as if done already. It is a fiction, therefore, invented to sustain and carry out the intention of the testator or settler, never to defeat it. Its application requires constant watchfulness to guard against the tendency to become a formal rule de jure without regard to its real purpose and necessity. It should never be overlooked that there is no real conversion; the property remains all the time in fact, realty or personalty as it was; but for the purpose of the will as it may be necessary, and only so far it is treated in contemplation of law as if it had been converted. New testators have any knowledge of the doctrine, or any actual intent to change the nature of their property, except when and to the extent that may be required to carry out the special purpose of the will. The presumption, therefore, no matter what the form of words used, is always against conversion, and even where it <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>is required it must be kept within the limits of actualnecessity:” Yerkes v.

Having given his wife the house on Court street, and such kitchen furniture as she should “ think necessary to keep house,” and the $600 a year charged as “ dower” on 515 and 517 Penn street, he proceeded as follows: “ I order and direct my executor to take an inventory of all the house and kitchen furniture that my wife may want to keep house. I further direct and order my executor to sell my real and personal property what is not in the dower aforesaid.” He had devised 520 Court street to his wife for life and had charged 515 and 517 Penn street with the $600 bequeathed to her annually as “ a lien or charge of dower; ” and it is not clear that the testator did not have in his mind, when he framed his direction to sell his “ real and personal property what is not in the dower aforesaid,” only the residue of his real estate, exclusive of that devised to his wife for life, and made subject to the $600 charge as “ a lien or charge of dower.” The positive direction to sell applies clearly to the South Eleventh street property, and any other real estate not included in or affected by the provision made for his wife ; but it does not so clearly apply to the premises affected by those provisions, especially when we consider the discretion reposed in the executor by the following provision: “ and in case my executor shall see proper to sell my said real estate or property” (515 and 517 Penn street) “before the decease of my wife, I order and direct that the sum of $10,000 out of the purchase money shall then remain in said property on Penn Street; ” and the following provision: “ Item. After all my real and personal property is disposed of as aforesaid, and thereoitt all my just debts and other reasonable expenses are paid and satisfied, I give and bequeath the net balance thereof unto my five children or their lawful issue, in equal proportions share and share alike.” It is evident that the subject in the testator’s mind, when the <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>last quoted provision was framed, was that part of his estate which could be divided immediately after his death; and that certainly embraced the personal property not taken by the widow, and the proceeds of the real estate “ not in the dower aforesaid <em>; </em>” and when this view is taken of the subject of the provision, and it is considered in connection with the following clause, “ but in case my executor do not sell said real estate or property” (515 and 517 Penn street) “ before the decease of my wife, my executor shall, from time to time, collect the rents of said real estate and property and thereout pay said quarterly yearly pajunents to my wife, as aforesaid,” it is quite apparent that when the testator framed the provision, “I further direct and order my executor to sell my real and personal property what is not in the dower aforesaid,” he may have meant, and probably did mean, only that portion of his real estate which was in no way connected with the widow’s dower.</p>

The testator’s objects in making the codicil were apparently three : 1. To make his daughter, Mary, executor, instead of his son George; 2. To place the share of George in the hands of Mary as trustee; and 3. To remove the obscurity pervading his original will as to the sale of the real estate located between Penn and Court and Fifth and Sixth streets by restraining its sale within five years after his decease and by giving his executrix a discretionary power to sell it at any time after that period. As stated in the beginning of this opinion, the Penn street real estate is located in the heart of the city, at its business center^ where real values are most affected by the growth of the city; and it is probable that he deferred the exercise of the power of sale, and made the ultimate exercise of the power dependent upon the discretion of his executrix in order that his estate might have the benefit of any enhancement of value which might accrue.</p>

Caldwell, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20Pa.%2045" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="97 Pa. 45">supra,</a> “it must not rest in the discretion of the executor, nor depend upon contingencies; ” if, as was said by Judge Penrose, in Curry’s Estate, supra, “ the heir shall not be disinherited, except by express devise or necessary implication, and all doubts are to be resolved in his favor; ” and if, as decided in Henry v. Mc-Closlcey, supra, where there is no positive direction of a testator to sell his real estate, but a mere power, dependent for its exercise upon the volition of the executor, or the consent of a third party, and before a sale in pursuance of such volition or consent, there is a devolution or transmission of one of the shares, by the death of one of the persons originally interested under the will, the share so devolved or transmitted passes to the heir of the deceased owner as real estate, the premises described in the petition cannot be considered as converted by the codicil.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[330,1575,1187,870]],["BL_221.1",221,[154,356,1182,1497]]]'>It is contended on behalf of the respondents that there is a blending of the real and personal estate of the testator for distribution, and that there is therefore an implied conversion. But I do not thinb that construction of the codicil is correct with respect to the real estate described in the petition, for it seems to me clear that the testator had in his mind a separate subject of distribution, composed of the proceeds of the personalty and of the real estate not located between Penn and Court and Fifth and Sixth streets, in the distribution referred to. The rule of law relied upon to sustain the contention that the premises in question are converted because of blending has not much vigor and is never to be applied in a doubtful case. In Perot’s Appeal, supra, Mr. Justice Paxson said: “The blending of real and personal estate by a testator, in his will, is not of much significance unless it clearly appears that he intended thereby to create a fund, raised out of both raal and personal estate, and to bequeath such fund as money.” There is a <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>total absence, in this codicil, of such specific intention to blend the real estate in question with the personal, in distribution, as to render the rule of law relied upon applicable in this case. The case of Roland v. Miller, <a href="/pa/100/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="100 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="498411" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0047-01">100 Pa. 47</a>, has been cited as an authority for conversion in this case, but I think the case differs in material facts. In that case the testatrix directed as follows : “ Item. My real estate shall not be sold until ten years after my decease. But in case my executors hereinafter named, shall lease it, or any part or parts of it, to any body, or bodies, private or corporate, for a term of fifteen years, they may do so, and shall not be compelled, by my heirs or any of them, to sell said real estate, or any part or parts thereof, so leased, until the expiration of the term of said lease.” Mr. Justice Trunkey, at p. 59, said: “ The natural and reasonable intendment of this will is that the realty shall be sold and the proceeds equally divided among the legatees. Within a limited time the executors have unlimited discretionary power to sell; after that time they are bound to sell. A provision that the executors shall not be compelled to sell by the heirs until the expiration of a stipulated term implies that they may be compelled. In this will the word heirs means legatees. The power vested in the executors, discretionary for a certain time, thereafter is unconditional, not dependent on discretion or contingencies, nor upon the consent or agreement of any person ; and if they neglect or refuse to exercise it they may be compelled to perform their duty by legal process at the instance of any legatee.” The palpable difference between that case and this, where there is an absolute and indefinite discretion, is too obvious to justify comment.</p>

Maxwell, mother of the petitioner, in 1898, her one-fifth share devolved, as real estate, to the petitioner and his two sisters; and, having vested in them in that character, it remains so. But if that were not so, the petitioner would still be entitled to partition, for the reason that the mere discretionary power of sale vested in the executrix has not been exercised.</p>
