The rule is that the market value is estimated upon a fair consideration of the land, the extent and condition of its improvements, its quantity and productive qualities and the uses to which it may reasonably be applied, taken with the general selling price of lands in the neighborhood at the time. In order to take into consideration the general selling price of lands in the neighborhood at the time, the witness must show that he knows such selling price by knowing of sales which have taken place and the prices which they brought and that the lands were similar to the lands in question and that he received his information from the buyer or the seller. This witness has sworn that he only knows of three sales of land in Jackson township, two of them to the defendant company. He can’t tell the acreage of the one nor the price of the other and he does not know who told him about either sale. The third sale he knows of in Jackson township, he can’t tell the acreage, he doesn’t know the seller, he does not know the character of the land, he does not know how much it brought and he received no information relative to it from either the buyer or the seller. The information which he has as to sales in other parts of the county are as to sales too far remote from the lands in question, nor are they lands similar to the lands in question. In addition to these objections the witness has not shown that he knows the uses to which the tract of land may reasonably be applied.</p>

The specifications of error relate to the incompetency of the plaintiff’s witnesses to testify as experts, and to the reception of testimony as to value which it is claimed was purely speculative. The land in question was part of the bottom of a natural basin situated in an elevated and mountainous section of country, and it was taken by the corporation, defendant, for the purpose of building a reservoir for the collection and storage of water. It had but little value as farm land, or for any purpose other than that for which it was taken, but for that purpose it was valuable as without it a reservoir could not be built at that place.</p>

The plaintiff’s witnesses were men who were engaged in the ice business in the county. There was a demand for land on which pools for the formation of ice could be made, and they knew the market value of land adapted to this use while they had but little knowledge of the value of land for farming. It is evident that they were competent witnesses. Here was a new use which created a market for land, with which its value for cultivation had nothing to do. The location alone fixed the value. Whether the land was available for the use testified to was a question of fact, and the argument directed to the court against the admission of the testimony should have had great weight with the jury in determining the value. The question was submitted with instructions that if the land by itself could not be used for building a reservoir, an estimate of its value for that use in connection with other properties which the plaintiff did not <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>own and could not acquire, should be disregarded by the jury.
