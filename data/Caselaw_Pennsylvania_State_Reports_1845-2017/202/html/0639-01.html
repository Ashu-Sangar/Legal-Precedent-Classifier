The navigation company occupies the position of a stakeholder of the money in con tro<a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>versy and as being ready to pay same upon delivery of the certificate or to whoever may be legally entitled to receive the same. The complainant has in her possession the certificate and claims ownership of same, as having been given to her by Patrick McGee in his lifetime. The administrator of the estate of Patrick McGee, deceased, denies the ownership of complainant and claims that she holds the certificate in trust for the estate of Patrick McGee. A suit, in trespass, was brought by the administrator against complainant to No. 209, March term, 1900, for the certificate, which resulted in a verdict for complainant, but which verdict has been set aside and a new trial granted on December 23,1901. The administrator also brought suit to No. 195, January term, against the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company for the amount of money represented by the certificate of deposit, and Mary Andrews, the complainant, upon her petition, was permitted to come in and defend.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b664-4" data-blocks='[["BL_664.4",664,[263,1240,1185,240]]]'>A verdict was rendered in favor of the administrator on November 27, 1901, for the sum of $12,194.20, and a motion in arrest of judgment and for a new trial, made by Mary Andrews, is overruled at the time of filing the opinion in this case.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b664-6" data-blocks='[["BL_664.6",664,[261,1758,1186,662]]]'>The jury having found in the trial of that case in favor of the estate of McGee for the amount of money on deposit with the navigation company, the only remaining question for disposition is the effect of the verdict of the jury in No. 209, March term, 1900. In this last mentioned case, the suit is brought in trespass for the possession of the certificate issued by the navigation company to Patrick McGee. It was brought against Mary Andrews, complainant, by the administrator of Patrick McGee’s estate and a verdict rendered in her favor. This verdict, upon motion and argument, having been set aside by the judge who presided at the trial and a new trial ordered, cannot have any weight in disposing of the question at issue in the present case.</p>

Her present appeal is from a decree made on a bill which she filed, alleging that the certificate issued to McGee belonged to her, and praying for an injunction to restrain the defendants from doing anything inconsistent with her ownership of it; that the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company be enjoined from paying to any other person than herself the sum due on it, and that the company be directed to pay the same to her. Answers were filed by the defendants, and, on final hearing, it was agreed that the testimony taken in the preceding case should be considered by the court in this proceeding in equity as if taken in it. The same learned judge presided in each case, and, having approved the <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>finding of the jury in the common-law suit, he properly adopted it for the purpose of a decree in this one. It was not only his finding, but that of a jury as well, and, in view of it, the complainant was entitled to no relief. Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs.</p>
