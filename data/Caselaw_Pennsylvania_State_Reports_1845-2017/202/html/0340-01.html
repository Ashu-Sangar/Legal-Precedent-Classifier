Patterson &amp; Company for the erection of a sawmill, the manufacture of building materials, and the storage of lumber, and continued to be so occupied until near the close of 1871; whereupon it became a waste place, used in some measure as a landing place and largely as a dump for garbage, and to a <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>limited <em>extent </em>(as it had previously been) as a play ground, and occasionally as a place for the exhibition of circuses, military trainings, celebrations, and the like.

J. Osterling was adopted by a majority of the board of commissioners. Subsequently, this plan was submitted to the judges of this court, and approved by them. Whilst it was understood that the Osterling plan contemplated an erection upon the site of the present courthouse, neither the submission to the judges nor their approval making any point of the matter of location, that question was neither directly or inferentially before the court at that time.</p>

Were we called upon to-decide this question now, when it can scarcely be said to be involved in the issue before us, we would be inclined to hold, with the learned judge of the court below, that a proper interpretation of the intent of the grant did not release the grantor from the usual implied obligation of surface support.</p>
    <p id="b372-5" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[296,840,1188,809]]]'>But we will not discuss further the objections raised to the conclusions of the court below, except to say in answer to appellant’s fifth assignment of error, that we are of opinion, the transaction was not a purchase of land by the county for courthouse purposes. The necessity to build being established by two grand juries, and their reports being approved by the court, the act of 1901 expressly conferred upon the commissioners authority to accept other public ground as a site for the new buildings. No previous consent of the grand jury to merely a change of location was necessary. In fact, it may be doubted whether the discretion of the commissioners, as to a change of location, could, even with legislative sanction, be usurped by the grand jury. But it is useless to decide this point, for neither the act of 1883 nor that of 1901, undertakes to interfere with the discretion vested in the commissioners by the act of 1834.</p>
    <p id="b372-6" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[342,1668,783,33]]]'>The decree of the court below is affirmed.</p>
