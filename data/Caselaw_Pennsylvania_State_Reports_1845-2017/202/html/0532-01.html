In none of the cases was the ordinance declared void for unreasonableness, although it was inferentially conceded that a case might arise where the license fee would be so grossly disproportionsd to the burden imposed upon the municipality in consequence of the erection and maintenance of the poles and wires as to warrant the court in presuming that the ordinance was a revenue measure, not a police regulation. None of the cases laid down a fixed and invariable rule by which that question is to be determined, but, after a comparison of the facts developed on the trial of this case, with the facts of some of the <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>cases above cited, we have been led by the conclusion that the court would not have been justified by the precedents in declaring the ordinance void. Tbe facts being undisputed, we take it tliat the question of the validity of the ordinance was for the court to decide. But, if on the undisputed facts, the court would not have been warranted in declaring tlie ordi nance void, the submission of the question of tbe reasonableness of the fee to the jury was an error of which the defendant has no just cause to complain.</p>
