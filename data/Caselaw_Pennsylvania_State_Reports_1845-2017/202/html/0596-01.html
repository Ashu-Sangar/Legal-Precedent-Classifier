For the purpose of meeting the cost of the erection of the electric plant, the Klapperthal Company borrowed $28,000 upon its notes indorsed by George Brooke, William D. Smith, Geo. F.

In this emergency, George Brooke, William D. Smith, George F. Baer, Richard T. Leaf and Morton C. Mcllvain agreed to become indorsers of the company’s notes for the purpose of raising the money that would be needed from time to time, the understanding common to all parties being that the loan of their credit was made for the carrying out of the projects of the Klapperthal Company; that whoever indorsed should bear his proportionate share of' the total liability whatever it should sum up to, without regard to the individual indorsements of each one, and that the indorsers should be protected; and as expressive of that understanding, a stockholders’ meeting of the Klapperthal Company, at which the plaintiff was present, on November 21,1891, without dissent adopted and put upon its minutes a resolution declaring that the notes of the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company, and the indorsements thereof by the parties above named, were made for the benefit of the Klapperthal Company, and that the latter, in consideration of the continuance of said indorsements, “ do hereby agree to guarantee the payment of said notes, and to indemnify and save harmless the said indorsers from all liability by reason of said indorsements.”</p>

The Neversink Mountain Railroad Company having placed a mortgage upon its property securing bonds of §1,000 each to the amount of §100,000, succeeded in selling fifteen and in placing as collateral for notes executed by and discounted for it thirty-six more, prior to June 18, 1892, at which date the indorsements made for its benefit by the parties named in Findings, No. 7, amounted to §101,500, all of which was applied to the legitimate purposes of its incorporation. In order to secure the indorsers, a resolution was on that day adopted by the directors of said company directing the deposit with the Pennsylvania Trust Company, the holder of the notes thus indorsed, in order to secure payment of them and in relief of the indorsers, of (a) the forty-nine remaining first mortgage bonds (the resolution erroneously speaking of sixty-nine, but the number actually available and deposited in pursuance of the resolution being forty-nine) which the trust company was to sell, and also (5) 240 shares of the stock of the Neversink Light, Heat &amp; Power Company held by the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company (see Finding, No. 8). Of the forty-nine bonds four were subsequently pledged to the trust company as additional collateral, one was handed over to plaintiff as security for his collateral indorsement of a §500 note of the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company, and one was passed over to a contractor for work done bjr him for the company. The trust company being unwilling to carry the notes any longer, without reduction; the amount of the indebtedness upon new indorsements by the same parties having been increased in order to meet the expenses of the road by §11,000 ; additional notes for the same purpose, not indorsed by said parties, of §2,000 having been also discounted, and there being a large amount of interest in arrears, the forty-three remaining bonds were taken by the indorsers at par, which was more than double their value then and at any time since, and so paid for by them, the proceeds being turned over to the <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>Neversink Mountain Railroad Company, and applied by it under resolution of November 15, 1893, as follows : $25,500 on notes of the company issued before November 1, 1891, and indorsed by said parties ; $8,500 on notes of the company issued after November 1, 1891, and so indorsed; $7,000 for interest accrued ; $2,000 on notes not indorsed by said parties. Said indorsers also subsequently, in pursuance of a general understanding, took the 240 shares of the Neversink Light, Heat &amp; Power Company’s stock off the hands of its pledgee, at $200 per share, the $48,000 thus paid in by them being employed in taking up further notes of the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company, originating before November 1,1891, and indorsed by them (see Finding, No. 12). In this way the indebtedness of said company was reduced by $91,000. The balance of it, for which the indorsers were liable, was paid by them out of their pockets, they receiving the notes from the trust company, and holding the forty-three bonds as an equivalent for the $25,500 of notes paid out of the proceeds by their purchase of said bonds.</p>

On January 10, 1896, the directors of the Klapperthal Company at a regular meeting of the board unanimously passed a resolution, which, after reciting the resolution of the company of November 21, 1891 (see Finding, No. 7), and the fact that the indorsers of the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company’s notes were still liable for a large sum by reason of their indorsements, directed that, in order to carry out the spirit and object of the guaranty evidenced by the resolution of Novem<a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>ber 21, 1891, the Klapperthal Company purchase the notes of the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company from the indorsers, paying therefor in stock of the Neversink Light, Heat &amp; Power Company owned by the Klapperthal Company at the rate of $200 per share. Of this action the plaintiff had notice in advance, when it was discussed and explained among the parties interested, and from it, as a proposition, he did not dissent. The purpose of it, as understood and recognized as equitable on all hands, was to reimburse the indorsers for the loss incurred by them by reason of their indorsements, which, having been made and continued in the pursuit of the original projects of the Klapperthal Company and supposedly for its ultimate advantage, that company justly stood to make good.</p>

In pursuance of the resolution of January 10, 1896, and in accord with the original agreement of the indorsers’ interest (see Finding, No. 7), a scheme of partial distribution among them of shares of the Neversink Light, Heat &amp; Power Company was prepared and agreed to on August 1, 1896. Going back to the purchase of the 240 shares pledged to the Pennsylvania Trust Company (see Finding, No. 9), these shares, as well as those presently held by the Klapperthal Company, were treated as available for distribution on the basis and in the proportion of the contributions made by the several indorsers. It was ascertained that the amount of notes antedating November 1, 1891, paid out of the proceeds of that purchase was $46,894.57 (approximating most closely the value of 285 shares at $200 per share); that the amount of later notes paid by the indorsers was $11,000; that the advances made by them for discounts, etc., was $9,278.02; and that the addition of interest from the dates of such payments to August 1,1896, swelled the total of their outlay in these particulars to $67,172.59. The indorsers were then charged with $48,000, the value of $200 per share of the 240 taken by them, and these were distributed among them in the proportion in which they furnished said $48,000. Deducting this sum from the total of $67,172.59, there remained a balance representing now notes, discounts and interest, of $19,172.59, the equivalent of something more than ninety-five shares at $200 per share. Accordingly, ninety-five shares of the Neversink Light, Heat &amp; Power Company were taken out of the holdings of the Klapperthal Company and dis<a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>tributed to tbe indorsers in the proportion in which they had contributed to the payment of the items represented by said balance, and in liquidation of the same. Thus, under the distribution of August 1, 1896, the indorsers became the holders of Neversink Light, Heat &amp; Power Company stock as follows: George Brooke, eighty shares; Geo. F. Baer, eighty-eight; Fm. D. Smith, sixty-eight; Richard T. Leaf, thirty-one, and Morton C. Mcllvain, sixty-eight, and there remained in the hands of the Klapperthal Company, 165. There also remained due to the indorsers, the balance of the notes antedating November 21,1891, not paid out of the proceeds of their purchase of the forty-three Neversink Mountain Railroad bonds, but out of their pockets (see Finding, No. 9).</p>

The plaintiff voted for the resolution directing the transfer of said shares, with knowledge of the approximate cost and value of the pavilion, having been one of the persons who had made themselves liable for the expenditure, but refused to pay his proportion. The number of shares remaining in the hands of the Klapperthal Company was thus reduced to 153.</p>

Plaintiff did not avail himself of this option, but still holds said note and bond. The distribution to the indorsers was made as directed, according to the sums contributed by each in taking up said notes, paying said discounts, etc., thus leaving twenty-eight shares of said stock in the hands of the Klapperthal Company.</p>

Out of it, however, there were paid $11,000 of new notes indorsed by them, $2,000 of notes indorsed by the Klapperthal Company, and $7,000 of accrued interest, thus reducing the $101,500 notes by only $25,500, and leaving $79,500 of them still payable by the indorsers. Upon payment of this balance in 1893, their claim in 1896 was swelled by about $12,500 of interest, making it at the date of the first distribution $92,000. Deducting therefrom the value at $200 per share of 240 shares of the Neversink Light, Heat &amp; Power Company belonging to the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company, their claim to reimbursement was reduced to $44,000, which, by the transfer of ninety-five more of said shares at the same rate belonging to the Klapperthal Company, was brought down to $25,000, and was wiped out by the transfer and acceptance of 125 further shares from the Klapperthal Company as its equivalent.

About June 12, 1897, the plaintiff began protesting against the reimbursement of the indorsers by the Klapperthal Company for the losses sustained by them in connection with the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company, as well as the payment of the pavilion; declaring that these acts involved a misappropriation of the assets of the former company in which be was and is a stockholder, and that the methods pursued were stripping it of its most valuable possession, the stock of the Neversink Light, Heat &amp; Power Company, and thus operating to his individual injury. A proposition was made to him on behalf of the indorsers to buy his stock in the Klapperthal Company for $6,000, about half its par value, which was understood to be sufficient substantially to reimburse him for all he had paid in, including his original investment in the land association (see Findings, Nos. 1 and 2). The offer was, however, rejected by him. On his motion, a committee was appointed to investigate his complaints, but no action was ever taken by it.</p>

The property of the company, apart from its holdings of Neversink Light, Heat &amp; Power Company stock, has for years past been practically valueless. There being no prospect of obtaining payment of the amount owing to them in any other way, the said defendants determined to reduce their claims to judgment, and in order to save costs transferred them to the defendant, Heber Y.

A court of equity does not take a skin-deep view of a situation like that here presented. It looks to the substance of the transaction, not to its mere form or color (Solarte v. Melville, 1 Man. &amp; R. 204, per Lord Tenterden), and sees things as ordinary men do: Warner v. Armstrong, 3 M. &amp; K. 45, per Lord Brougham.

Looking at the situation in this common sense way — the way in which all these people, including the plaintiff, themselves looked at it and the way in which any person of ordinary intelligence would naturally look at it — the contention that these defendants, after having put their money into the development of one branch of the joint undertaking at the manifest risk of losing nearly all, should, when certain assets formally in the hands of the parent organization having in its immediate charge the pursuit of another branch of the same undertaking, have by a lucky accident acquired some value, not be reimbursed as far as possible out of such assets simply because of the absence of strict legal identity between the two organizations, is one which is wholly barren of real merit in a court of equity.

It is needless to point out how much less a court of equity would undertake to compel persons in the situation of these defendants to surrender what they have obtained except upon similar conditions, which of course, it would be idle to impose because impossible to perform.</p>

That the deposit of bonds with the Pennsylvania Trust Company by the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company under the resolution of June 18, 1892, was not for the sole purpose of protecting notes previously discounted, and was not so understood to be, is shown not only by the subsequent application, unopposed by plaintiff at the time, of part of the proceeds of their purchase by the indorsers to other and later indebtedness under the resolution of November 15, 1893, but by the fact that plaintiff himself took and still holds one of them as collateral security for a note of $500 indorsed by him and not in existence at the time of the deposit. It is, to be sure, not at all clear upon what principle a deposit by the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company, on June 18,1892, of these bonds as security for notes previously negotiated and a subsequent withdrawal by said company of part of their proceeds from that purpose could have relieved the Klapperthal Company of liability pro tanto upon its guaranty given on November 21, 1891. But supposing that it could, it does not lie in plaintiff’s mouth to assert that such was the purpose of the deposit or that the Klapperthal Company’s guaranty was in any way affected by the subsequent change of purpose. As understood by him as well as his associates at the time, the interests of all concerned were best served by the application of the bonds and their proceeds as it was actually made, and participating in that arrangement, he is estopped from denying that it was a proper one: Mercer Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. v. McKee, <a href="/pa/77/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="77 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="436312" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0170-01">77 Pa. 170</a>, 173. When we come to the distribution of Neversink Light, Heat &amp; Power Company stock in relief of the indorsers, we find that the first distribution, of every feature of which the plaintiff was cognizant in advance, included an equivalent for $&gt;11,000 of notes paid by the indorsers which originated subsequently to the resolution of November 21, 1891. Evidently <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>they did not understand the effect of that resolution to be restricted to liabilities then already incurred, and evidently the plaintiff himself had not yet become conscious of such an understanding of it; for he made no objection to it upon any ground of that, sort, nor, indeed, any objection at all when the figure at which the shares were to be taken by the indorsers had been fixed at $200 as he thought it ought to be; all of which goes to show that the real intention of the resolution of November 21, 1891, was to evidence a contract of indemnity between the Klapperthal Company and the indorsers in respect of future as well as past indorsements. And considering the contract, not only in the light of what the parties did under it, but also, as all contracts must be considered, in the light of the surrounding circumstances and the objects manifestly to be accomplished (Callen v. Hilty, <a href="/pa/14/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="14 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="405867" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0286-01">14 Pa. 286</a>, 288; Allison’s App., <a href="/pa/77/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="77 Pa. 221" data-case-ids="436340" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0221-01">77 Pa. 221</a>, 236; Richardson v.

The railway enterprise was regarded as essential to the development of the Klapperthal Company's property. Its hold upon the “ Big Dam ” under the agreement with the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company depended upon the construction and maintenance of the railway; and as involved in the continuance of that arrangement, so did the whole future of the electric plant which was then still owned by the Klapperthal Company and has virtually remained its property and become its most valuable asset. The railway, however, was unable to pay not for its construction merely, but for its operation, and the likelihood was that, before it could pay for either, it would require renewed assistance, the means of providing for which were not in sight, neither the stock nor the bonds of the company finding a ready market. In these circumstances, the purpose of the resolution of November 21, 1891, most obviously was, not only to make those who had the ability and had given proof of their willingness to carry the enterprise along safe in respect of what they had already done, but to secure their further aid by guaranteeing them reimbursement for future outlays as well. That was the understanding between the parties, that the meaning and effect of the resolution of November 21, 1891, and that, therefore, the <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>contract which it evidenced. From that contract there was no deviation in any part of the distribution of August 1, 1896; whilst the distribution of 125 shares on June 12, 1897, was justified by the very letter of the resolution of November 21, 1891, construed as plaintiff himself now contends it ought to be. The only possible ground on which the distribution of twelve shares, on the same day, in payment of the pavilion can be attacked, is that the value of it to the Klapperthal Company was not equal to $2,100. Possibly not; but neither were the twelve shares paid for it worth $2,400, and there is nothing to show that the value which the parties who had put their money into the thing was greater than their expenditure, which ordinary good faith and business honor required to be returned to them. Besides, the plaintiff voted for the measure, with every reason to know what ho was about.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b635-3" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[124,1156,1184,1077]]]'>It is claimed in plaintiff’s behalf that he ought to be treated, not merely as suing for himself, but as representing the rights of the Klapperthal Company against its officers because of acts on their part which were beyond their powers and injurious to the stockholders of the company. Ordinarily, doubtless, the plaintiff in a bill of this kind is to be so regarded: 3 Pom. Eq. Jut. sec. 1095. But one of the peculiarities of this case, so far as the evidence goes, is that the persons accused of wrongdoing and alleged to have been unduly benefited, together with the plaintiff, hold all the stock of the Klapperthal Company, and that the former are all on one side, and the plaintiff is alone on the other opposing them. Hence his suit is simply in his own behalf and for his own benefit, and there can be no good reason for holding inapplicable to it the principles of estoppel, etc., which ordinarily obtain as between parties litigating strictly on their own account. If, however, it were true that this action is to be looked upon as one by the Klapperthal Company against defendants, it would hardly be in any better case, in view of the virtual identity of all the companies involved.

On the contrary, remembering that the resolution of November 21, 1891, the contract of guaranty, was the action of the stockholders of the Klapperthal Company, that decision makes in favor of the defendants here and not of the plaintiff. It must certainly be conceded that the conscience of a chancellor cannot be strongly moved to declare unfaithful to their trust or unduly grasping a set of directors, who, for the sake of keeping alive the common enterprises engaged in by them and their associates, put into those enterprises of their own money sums aggregating with interest upwards of $160,000, risking at the time, and for years thereafter facing the probability of, the loss of at least two thirds of it, and who eventually, upon the fortunate appreciation of one of the properties, have made themselves repaid out of it to the actual amount of about $82,000, accepting that value together with securities worth perhaps $21,000 more, in full satisfaction of nearly or more than $128,000 of their outlay, and who are now seeking to recover as much as they can of the balance of about $33,000 advanced by them and confessedly applied for the benefit of the company they are suing, and that, with the practical certainty that if compelled to return any of the property applied to their reimbursement, their losses will be increased to just that extent. See Froment v. Lessig, <a href="/pa/174/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="174 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="878506" data-case-paths="/pa/174/0487-01">174 Pa. 487</a>. Such, in brief, has been the conduct and is the situation of these defendants. Surely, the facts developed in this case disclose no equity in plaintiff beyond that which defendants themselves recognized in tendering to him on June 12, 1897, two and one half shares of the Neversinlc Light, Heat &amp; Power Company’s stock held by the Klapperthal Company in exchange for the $500 note of the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company, paid by him and the $1,000 bond of said company he holds as security therefor. He complains, in one of his letters to the defendants, that their offer did not embrace any al<a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>lowance for interest. But neither was any distribution of said stock made to the indorsers on account of interest upon notes paid for by them for which they held bonds of the Neversink Mountain Railroad Company. Indeed, no stock was given to them at all for those notes, but only for such as they had paid and held without security or equivalent of any kind.
