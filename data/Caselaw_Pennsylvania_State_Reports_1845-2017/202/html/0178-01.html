      <em>A </em>resort to professional advice does not necessarily establish a conclusive presumption against malice and in favor of probable cause, and hence does not constitute an independent and substantive defense to an action for malicious prosecution. Such evidence is admissible, however, as tending to establish a defense. Whether or not the defense is established is a question of fact to be found by the jury from all the facts and circumstances taken in connection with such advice. Thus it is for the jury to determine whether the party has fairly and fully communicated to his counsel the facts within his knowledge, and used reasonable diligence to ascertain the truth, as also whether he acted in good faith upon the advice received from counsel.</p>

The law says it is absurd to accuse a man of malice who has submitted his case to a lawyer, and the lawyer has given his opinion that he should bring suit. It is essentially so, not only in an individual but in a corporation. They present their case fairly before an estimable gentleman, in the present case, a gentleman who has been twenty years at the bar in the neighboring state of New Jersey, who appears before us, of the highest character and attainment. He comes before you and <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>states tliat this matter was presented to him and he advised this man it was his duty to take action in this matter, and in consequence of this advice he did so. I say the law is positive and beyond doubt that where a man does that, it absolves him from prosecution. Nothing has been shown here that anything was improperly held from the lawyer when the statement was made to him. Mr. Miller testified that he took all the papers to him and gave him all the information in his power, and after hearing that he formed his judgment; and I think, therefore, that it is a complete defense in this case, and I shall have to take the responsibility myself and direct you to bring in a verdict for defendant.</p>

Previous to the institution of this suit Bell was an employee of the Atlantic City Railroad Company for six years or more when he was selected by the company to be chief ticket agent at Camden, New Jersey, over its Atlantic City branch. He accepted the position tendered him and entered upon the performance of his duties at once. He continued in the discharge of them until November, 1892, when he was arrested by the defendant for forgery and embezzlement. He was placed in jail where he remained until he was released on bail. On November 15, he was brought before the magistrate who bound him over and demanded bail in <em>$1,000, </em>which he was unable to obtain until November 16 at noon, when he effected a release by securing the bail the magistrate required. On February 28, 1893, he was tried in the court of quarter sessions and acquitted.</p>
