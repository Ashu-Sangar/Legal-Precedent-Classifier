    <p class="summary" id="b445-9" data-blocks='[["BL_445.14",445,[130,1498,1181,717]]]'>From the record it appeared that on May 6,1901, the directors of the Athens borough school district voted to purchase two lots of land in the borough adjoining the high school lot for the price of 82,200. On May 17,1901, the same resolution was passed with a provision for the issuing of bonds for the payment for the lots. In neither resolution was the exact quantity of land specified, the lots being described as “The Mathewson and Gregory Lots.” The proof showed that these lots together with the high school lot made altogether about one and three quarter acres. It was claimed by the plaintiffs that this amount of land was excessive, that the directors had abused their discretion, and that the record of their proceedings was insufficient, since it did not disclose the quantity of land purchased. The court dissolved the preliminary injunction.</p>
