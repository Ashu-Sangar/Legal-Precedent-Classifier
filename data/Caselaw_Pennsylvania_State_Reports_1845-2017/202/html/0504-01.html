The point was so clearly stated by Mr. Justice Dean in Newhard v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=158%20Pa.%20417" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="158 Pa. 417">158 Pa. 417</a>, as to require no elaboration on our part. There is no rule of law which defines the rate of speed allowed a passenger train, although, of course, there must in certain cases be limitations, but in this case it was the ordinary running of a passenger train at a rate which, if it amounted to that claimed by plaintiff, could not be claimed as unusual. There was not a single fact or circumstance, except the rain, which could by any process of reasoning require the engineer to lessen his speed, and depart from his running schedule.</p>

The movement of trains must be regulated by the railroad companies in the exercise of a business discretion, and upon consideration of the competition they have to encounter and the necessities of modern business. We do not think a jury majr fix the maximum rate of speed at which a train shall be moved in the open country, or that a high rate of speed is negligence per se.</p>

But there.was no competent proof of excessive or improper speed. The only witness for plaintiff who testifies to speed was a passenger, Mr. Daniel Steinmetz, who testifies page (5) : “ After the train left Quakertown, that day and on down to Krupp’s crossing, it was going very rapidly. I could not tell how many miles an hour because I have no means of measuring that, but I was cognizant of the fact that the train was moving very rapidly from the rapidity with which we were passing objects and the jerking of <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>the train. The train was running very rapidly.” And page 16: “ Between those times, the train was running at the rate of sixty miles an hour. It was raining very hard; it was one of those sudden storms that we have sometimes, that come up very suddenly, and it was raining bucketfuls, a very severe storm.”</p>

To allow a jury to decide this question upon the evidence before them, would lead to the usual result of a verdict against the defendant. To say that a passenger whose training or experience has not qualified him to judge of speed run on a rainy day, as described for the reasons given by this witness, can judge and testify with any degree of accuracy that a train is running at forty-five or sixty miles an hour is absurd, and when opposed to the schedule of the train and the positive evidence of the engineer, ought to have no weight with court or jury.</p>

Here again we have the case of a passenger whose attention was not directed to signals, and yet might well say that he heard none. How many in a train do hear the whistle or can with certainty say that none -was sounded ? In Hauser v. Central R. R. Co. of N. 'J., <a href="/pa/147/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="147 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="829803" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0440-01">147 Pa. 440</a>, the witness was asked: “ Q. Did you hear the blowing of the whistle that night on the train ? A. No, sir; if I did, I did not hear anything. Q. Did you hear the ringing of the bell ? A. No, sir.” The court said, “ She simply says she did not hear any whistle or bell, and as against the positive affirmative testimony of six witnesses who did hear it, her omission to hear is simply a scintilla of evidence, which is not enough to make out a charge of negligence in that respect,” and the case was reversed without a new venue. If but a scintilla, and not sufficient to justify a charge of negligence, why should the court submit it to the jury? In this case we adopted the conclusions given by the Supreme Court and instructed the jury that both the evidence as to speed and as to signals being insufficient to charge defendant with negligence, the verdict must be for the defendant.</p>

We recognize the fact that the higher courts have ruled that whether the point at which the “ stop, look and listen ” took place was the best place, is a question for the jury, but when plaintiff shows that after leaving that point 125 feet distant, until a traveler gets on the track, no view of the road can be had until you get on the track, it ought not to he held unreasonable that the traveler should again stop. In this case, having stopped at a point seventy-five or 125 feet from the crossing, in a heavy rain, with the wagon curtains down and with the view obstructed until he reached the tracks, it might well be said that he was negligent.</p>

Much, in fact, most of the testimony, describes the difficulty of seeing toward Lansdale, but all plaintiff’s witnesses admit a better view toward Bethlehem. The only witness to the accident describes the decedent as stopping at a point sixty or seventy-five feet from the crossing. Then he started his horse and drove pretty fast. “ At that moment I looked up the track and saw the train coming in a hurry. At that moment I heard a whistle, and the strike both together.” This witness was 200 feet from the crossing. Some of the other witnesses for plaintiff fix the stopping at 125 feet from the crossing. If this was the best point from which to look, he would have seen as far as the signal <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>post, 500 feet distant from the crossing. He then drove rapidly, with curtains down in a severe rain, and was struck as soon as he got on the bracks. He .must have seen the train, for it could not have been beyond the. signal post or at least not far from it. If prevented from seeing it by the rain, the duty to proceed cautiously and again stop was the greater; and it almost seems incredible that a man can be within twenty feet of a railroad and not hear an approaching train even although no whistle was sounded or bell rung.</p>
