    <p class="summary" id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[130,514,1182,197]]]'>1. Was a trust vested in James Preston by the order of court of May 81, 1870, for his three children as to the remainder? And 2. If such trust was created, is it barred by act of 1856, P. L., sec. 6, 532?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b547-6" data-blocks='[["BL_547.6",547,[129,722,1183,304]]]'>Before entering on the discussion of the above questions, there is one point which first calls for our attention. Mary Preston is named as one of the defendants in the caption of the case, though it appears she was not served, neither is she a devisee under the will of James Preston, and, in consequence, we will make no decree as to her, she not being a party to the suit.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b547-7" data-blocks='[["BL_547.7",547,[129,1035,1181,1387]]]'>In considering the first question, we say that such a trust is established from the evidence by proof, “ clear, explicit and unequivocal.” James Preston himself was a party to the creation of this trust, for his counsel participated in the proceedings which made Ketnor trustee, and also in the later proceedings, when the order of court was made directing O. P. Bechtel (counsel for James Preston) to invest the said money in the house and lot purchased from P. W. Sheafer and C. T. Wilrich, upon which a house has been built, and take the property and title thereof in the name of the children with a life estate in the father of said children, James Preston. Preston unquestionably had knowledge of this order of court, for it is in the handwriting of his own counsel, and the subsequent testimony shows that Bechtel purchased lot No. 13, block 127, Shenandoah, but directed that no deed, shorrld be made or delivered at that time. Preston took possession of this lot, and, undoubtedly, under these facts, took, but a life estate, and was trustee for his three children, these complainants, as to the remainder. He lived on the premises and improved them until 1884, and had rented one of the properties to his son, John Preston, and a dispute arose as set forth in the finding of facts, and John filed a bill in equity on October 9, 1884. While this dispute was in progress, James Preston came to Pottsville, and with the knowledge that he only had a life estate in these premises, procured a deed from Sheafer and others in this lot and a receipt is signed by Sheafer for $200 purchase money in full, as paid by James Preston.</p>

      <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>What was the effect of this deed ? Clearly it created him a trustee ex maleficio. In the hands of an innocent purchaser, the effect would, possibly, have been different, but James Preston having full knowledge of his life tenancy, and the trust reposed in him for the children, could not, by his wrongful act, in taking a deed in fee, relieve himself of this trust, and the law would impose one on him.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[304,715,1183,137]]]'>But we do not think it necessary to hold him as trustee ex maleficio, for the facts present him in even a stronger light than this.</p>

These complainants had no right of possession, no right of entry until that life estate was terminated by the death of the life tenant, James Preston, and were hound to proceed no further until a higher estate was set up ; or one adverse to their own, which never occurred until the death of James Preston, November, 1899.
