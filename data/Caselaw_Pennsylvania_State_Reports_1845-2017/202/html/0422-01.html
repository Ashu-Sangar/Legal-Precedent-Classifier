When he left office he was indebted to the commonwealth in a large sum of monej'. In 1850, Ash conveyed to a trustee certain lands in Passyunk township in trust to sell the lands, and apply the proceeds to the payment of the debt of the commonwealth. Some of these lands were sold in 1855, and the proceeds paid to the commonwealth. In 1895, the substituted trustee received a large sum of money from the city of Philadelphia, when the remainder of the lands were taken for League Island Park. This fund was claimed in part with the commonwealth, and by Eliza Daley, administratrix of Ash.</p>

It must meet the burden of proof, its evidence must be relevant, material, the best attainable, and must be presented in due order under the regular rules of procedure. In all such respects it stands upon the same footing as ordinary litigants. Statutes of limitation do not apply to it, because the maxim nullum tempus occurrit regi though probably in its origin a part of royal prerogative has been adopted in our jurisprudence as a matter of important public policy. But rules of evidence and legal presumptions are not changed for or against the state as a suitor. A statute of limitation is a legislative bar to the right of action, but the presumption of payment from the lapse of time is not a bar at all but simply a rule of evidence, affecting the burden of proof: Miller v. Williamsport Overseers, <a href="/pa-super/17/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="17 Pa. Super. 159" data-case-ids="835158" data-case-paths="/pa-super/17/0159-01">17 Pa. Superior Ct. 159</a>. It is of equitable origin, founded on experience of the ordinary course of business and human affairs, and adopted by the law in the interests of repose and the ending of litigation. There is no good reason why it should not apply to the commonwealth just as other legal rules and presumptions do.
