Father Dougherty and Rev. Father Fitzmaurice aforesaid.’</p>

The codicil was dated May 28,1899. The testator died August 14, 1900. His heirs at law are brothers and sisters, Bernard, Matthew, and Patrick Corr, Catherine Mallon, and Margaret Doris, and nieces, Sarah J. Conran, Margaret T. Logue, and Mary A. Corr (children of his deceased sister, Sarah Corr). . . .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b416-4" data-blocks='[["BL_416.4",416,[287,768,1186,561]]]'>“It was contended that the gift of the residuary estate was upon a condition which has failed, and that hence as to such residue the testator died intestate. This proposition was based upon the wording with which he prefaced the gift. ‘ If any of the legacies I have given should lapse for any reason and become part of my residuary estate, then I order and direct that my said residuary estate shall be divided,’ etc. Ignoring the rule of law which seeks, whenever practicable, to avoid an intestacy, the author of the proposition displayed the utmost ingenuity in the endeavor to ferret out an intestacy, against which the testator appears to have carefully guarded.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b416-5" data-blocks='[["BL_416.5",416,[283,1336,1189,820]]]'>“ Ordinarily, a testator who dies intestate as to his residuary estate makes no mention of such residue in his will; here, however, the testator not only referred to it, but actually divided it, and, as if to banish all possible doubt, provided liberally for each of the persons who would have been entitled, if an intestacy had occurred. These, therefore, cannot seriously allege that the testator intended an intestacy in order to benefit them. The question is hardly open to sober argument. The testator very naturally directed that any lapsed legacy should become part of his residuary estate, and then, or next, he directed that his residuary estate should be distributed. The word ‘ then ’ has been put to a variety of uses, but has never, it is believed, when used to denote merely a numerical arrangement (as of paragraphs), been made to figure as marking a condition precedent. The residue is awarded in equal parts to Archbishop Ryan, Rev. Fathers Dougherty and Fitzmaurice.”</p>

The will of this testator bears evidence of having been drafted by a lawyer learned in the law and skilled in the proper use of language. The residuary clause, so called, is of a most unusual character. It does not say, what, indeed, would be wholly unnecessary to say, that all legacies which lapse shall fall into and become part of the residuary estate, but as preliminary to what follows, “if” any should become part of the residuary estate, “ then,” that is, in that event, the residue thus created shall go to the eminent officials of the Catholic church who are there named. That in expression, at least, the gift is contingent, only taking effect if the event spoken of should happen, cannot be questioned; and that the testator intended precisely what his words indicate is demonstrated by the first codicil.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b417-5" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[168,1187,1180,923]]]'>This codicil, executed a few days after the execution of the will, provides that if by reason of the death of the testator within the statutory period his numerous gifts to charities (all charities of the Catholic church) should fail, the amount so given should go to his executors — obviously in order that his purpose might be carried out notwithstanding the statute (Schultz’s Appeal, 30 P.

It is inconceivable, therefore, that the provision in which they were thus named was intended as a general residuary gift, or that it was to operate except as expressed, viz., in the event there mentioned: “ if” pecuniary legacies should lapse by the deaths of the legatees, and to the extent of the residue so arising.</p>
