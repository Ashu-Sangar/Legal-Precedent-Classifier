I took the car at 22d and Lombard, and I went to 5th and Tasker, and there I wanted to alight, and as I went to go out, my foot caught in the step of the car and I was violently thrown and injured the kneecap, so that I have to wear, at the present time, and have to wear it always, a rubber stocking. Q. Tell us a little more fully how that foot was caught and what you did. A. I had one foot on the ground, and as I went to pull the other from the car, that was what threw me. Q. Which foot was on the ground ? A. The left. Q. And the right was on the step ? A. The right was on the step. Q. How much of it was on the step ? A. Two thirds of it was on the step. Q. In what position was your foot on the step ? A. The foot was flat. Q. What caught? A. The heel. Q. What efforts did you make to free yourself ? A. Well, the foot being on the ground, I made a sudden effort to get the foot loose, and the first time I didn’t get it loose, but the second time it came loose. Q. How did you take the foot off — in what way ? A. The foot came off flat, you know. Q. Did you lift your foot or did you slide it ? A. Why, I lifted it or tried to lift it. Q. And the last time you lifted it? A. It came loose and I fell; and as I fell, I came very near being crushed under a milk wagon at the same time.”</p>
