He has become thoroughly familiar with th e action and methods of the other players in the club, and his own work is peculiarly meritorious as an integral part of the team work wdfich is so essential. In addition to these features which render his services of peculiar and special value to the plaintiff, and not easily replaced, Lajoie is well known, and has great reputation among the patrons of the sport, for ability in the position which he filled, and was thus a most attractive drawing card for the public.

The action of the defendant in violating his contract is a breach of good faith, for which there would be no adequate redress at law, and the case therefore properly calls for the aid of equity, in negatively enforcing the performance of the contract, by enjoining against its breach.</p>

The seventeenth paragraph also provides for the termination of the contract upon ten days’ notice by the piaintiff. But the eighteenth paragraph is also of importance, and should not be overlooked.: It provides as follows : “ 18. In consideration of the faithful performance of the conditions, covenants, undertakings and promises herein by the said party of the second part, inclusive of the concession of the options of release and renewals prescribed in the seventeenth and nineteenth' paragraphs, the said party of the first part, for itself and its assigns, hereby agrees to pay to him for his services for said term the sum of 12,400, payable as follows,” etc.</p>

We have the further fact that the contract has been partially executed by services rendered, and payment made <em>therefor; so </em>that the situation is not now the same as when the contract was wholly executory. The relation between the parties has been so far changed, as to give to the plaintiff an equity arising out of the part performance, to insist upon the completion of the agreement according to its terms by the defendant. This equity may be distinguished from the original right under the contract itself, and it might well be questioned whether the <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>court would not be justified in giving effect to it by injunction, without regard to the mutuality or nonmutuality in the original contract.

Upon the other hand, the plaintiff retained the right to terminate the contract upon ten days’ notice, and the payment of salary for that time, ánd the expenses of defendant in getting to his home. But the fact of this concession to the plaintiff is distinctly pointed out as part of the consideration for the large salary paid to the defendant, and is emphasized as such. And owing to the peculiar nature of the services demanded by the business, and the high degree of efficiency which must be maintained, the stipulation is not unreasonable. Particularly is this true when it is remembered that the plaintiff has played for years under substantially the same regulations.</p>

It is true that the terms make it possible for the plaintiff to put an end to the contract in a space of time much less than the period during which the defendant has agreed to supply his personal services ; but mere difference in the rights stipulated for, does not destroy mutuality of remedy.

But we are not satisfied with the reasoning intended to support that conclusion. We cannot agree that mutuality of remedy requires that each party should have precisely the same remedy, either in form, effect or extent. In a fair and reasonable contract, it ought to be sufficient that each party has the possibility of compelling the performance of the promises which were mutually agreed upon.</p>

Union Buttonhole, etc., Co., Holmes’ Reports, 253,’ Judge Lowell says, with reference to that case: “ I cannot think that the court intended to announce any general proposition that they would never enforce a contract which one party had a right to put ah end to in a year.

It is certainly competent to the parties to make a contract which will be equitable and reasonable, and in which their rights ought to be protected while they last, though it may be terminable by various circumstances, and though one ;party may have the sole right to terminate it, provided their stipulation is not one that makes the whole contract inequitable.”</p>

If the case is one in which a negative remedy of injunction will do substantial justice between the parties, by obliging the defendant either to carry out his contract or lose all benefit of the breach, and the remedy at law is inadequate, and there is no reason of policy against it, the court will interfere to restrain conduct which is contrary to the contract, although it may be unable to enforce a specific performance of it.”</p>

The defendant sold to the plaintiff for a valuable consideration the exclusive right to his professional services for a stipulated period, unless sooner surrendered by the plaintiff; which could only be, after due and reasonable notice and payment' of salary and expenses until the expiration. Why should not a court of equity protect such an agreement until it is terminated? The court cannot compel the defendant to play for the plaintiff, but it can restrain him from playing for another club in violation of his agreement. No reason is given why this should not be done, except that presented by the argument that the right given to the plaintiff to terminate the contract upon ten days’ notice destroys the mutuality of the remedy. But to this it may be answered, that as already stated, the defendant has the possibility of enforcing all the rights for which he stipulated in the agreement, which is all that he can reasonably ask; furthermore, owing to the peculiar nature and circumstances of the business, the reservation upon the part of the plaintiff to terminate upon short notice, does not make the whole contract inequitable.</p>

This is a necessary inference from its action in asking the court to exercise its equity power to enforce the agreement made by the defendant not to give his services to any other club. Besides, the remedy by injunction is elastic and adaptable, and is wholly within the control of the court. If granted now, it can be easily dissolved whenever a change in the circumstances or in the attitude of the plaintiff should seem to require it. The granting or refusal of an injunc<a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>tion or its continuance is never a matter of strict right, but is always a question of discretion to be determined by the court in view of the particular circumstances.</p>
