The insured had been appointed a local agent of the company, and the policy was delivered to him under the agreement that the commissions that he should earn should be applied by the company to the payment of the premium. He died suddenly a few weeks after receiving the policy and while in the service of the company, but before he had earned any commissions. The agreement as to the delivery of the policy and as to the manner in which the premium was to be paid was made either with the general agent of the company, which is a foreign corporation, or with a subagent with the full knowledge and approval of the general agent, to whom the premium was charged by the company. The company could waive the stipulation, made solely for its protection, that no liability should attach until the first premium was actually paid to it or to its authorized agent, and its general agent could bind it in this regard: Elkins, etc., Co. v.
