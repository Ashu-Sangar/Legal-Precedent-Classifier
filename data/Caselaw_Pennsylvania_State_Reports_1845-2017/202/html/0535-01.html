    <p class="summary" id="b563-6" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[178,860,1181,1544]]]'>The first contention made touching this point grows out of the first finding of fact above set forth. It was urged that because the donor at the same time gave $10,000 absolutely to each of his nephews, that it must have been his intent that the properties conveyed by this deed — aggregating in value as they did the same relative amount for the five nieces — should go to them and their issue to the exclusion of the nephews thus already provided for, who were his other heirs. This presupposes an intent to place all his heirs upon an equality. But the execution of this deed negatives that supposition. Had that been tbe intent tlie deed of trust would never have been made. Had there been an ulterior intent that tbe inequality which he thus made w’as not to extend beyond the life of the nieces named, it would have been easy to say so, but it was not said. Such a supposition is the purest speculation, for the attempt thereby to place tbe issue of the nephews and nieces on an equality requires not only that tbe donor should know that tbe nephews would retain tbe money paid them and bequeath it to their issue, but that relatively the same number of nephews and nieces should die without issue. It is unquesabiy true that the circumstances existing at the time of execution are always pertinent to be considered in construing any writing: Postlethwaite’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20Pa.%20478" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="68 Pa. 478">68 Pa. 478</a>; Follweiler’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/102/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="102 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="502670" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0581-01">102 Pa. 581</a>; Seybert v.

But that rule has no relevancy when attempted to be applied to possibilities as yet resting in the worn!) of time. The auditor therefore holds that the fact that the nephews of the donor each received $10,000 in cash does not aid in interpreting the deed now under consideration, though the fact that it was a family settlement is a matter to he considered.</p>

We are not here seeking to substitute one word for another, but to find the primary intent of the donor. That intent, when once found, in equity, in such cases as this, is always enforced. The words “ surviving sister or sisters ” are evidently intended only to segregate the families, not to members of the same family, and whether we say that those who left issue .survive in their issue, or whether we say that the words “ surviving sister or sisters ” are used in contradistinction <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>to “ sister so dying without issue,” precisely the same result is reached.

Cross remainders are in terms provided for, as was pointed out by Lord Chancellor Cottenham: in Cole v. Sewell, 2 H. of L. Cases, 186, and the only question is, Is the precedent estate of a surviving sister necessary to effectuate the cross remainder to her issue ? The auditor thinks not, but whether or not he be right in this, none the less cross remainders within the family lines are distinctly provided for.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b574-6" data-blocks='[["BL_574.5",574,[297,995,1188,708]]]'>So long as language is simply the means of, and oftimes a very imperfect human device for, conveying thought and intention, it will be useless to halt over the dictionary meaning of a single word; if upon taking every word in the instrument into consideration, and drawing conclusions therefrom, a result is reached which gives to some word or words a meaning other than normal, still must that result be accepted? So here the auditor thinks that upon the whole deed it was the intention of the donor that the issue of the other named daughters of his brother David should take if any such issue there were at the time of the death of any daughter of David leaving no issue. Hence, when Mary Bacon died on December 17, 1898, leaving no issue, her share vested in the issue of her sisters Susan P. Hancock and Anna B. Watson.</p>

Hancock’s issue take one half and Anna B. Watson’s the other. The auditor is not certain that he understands the basis of the contention that the issue take in equal shares. Had Mary Bacon died first, leaving no issue, than clearly under the trust deed one half of her share would have passed to Susan P. Hancock and one half to Anna B. Watson, with remainder to their issue respectively. The words “ upon the same trusts as are above set forth ” can have no other meaning. If, then, they do not have the same meaning, because Mary Bacon died last, then the accident of one or the other dying first has affected the grant, and the argument upon which is founded the right of <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>either set of issue to take must go for nothing. In none of the eases cited was the per capita claim ever urged, and if it were not in England surely it could not be here, where the per stirpes rule is the policy of our law. Taking by representation is with us the rule, and it is being extended and not contracted. It is never departed from unless the relationship is remote, and no reason appears here why it should be, but, on the contrary, the deed negatives such a thought. The auditor, therefore, decides that Susan P. Hancock’s issue get one half and Anna JB. Watson’s issue get the other half of the Mary Bacon share.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b575-5" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[176,883,1179,717]]]'>It was argued also by Mr. Hancock that the grandchildren of Susan P. Hancock, whose issue take a one half share on the death of Mary Bacon, could not participate with the children of Susan P. Hancock. No reason was given for the assertion, and none is known to the auditor. Were this a devise by the donor to Mary Bacon for life, remainder to Susan P. Hancock for life, remainder to the issue of the latter, the same result would be reached either under the English or Pennsylvania rule, for all Susan P. Hancock’s children survived her. The remainder in this deed is to the issue of Susan P. Hancock, and “ the word issue occurring in a deed prima facie means descendants ; but the context may show that it means children: ” Elphinstone on the Interpretation of Deeds, rule 128; Ralph v.

Hancock and Anna B. Watson take the shares of Mary S. Bacon and Sarah W. Bacon under the deed of trust ? These latter ladies were children of the donor’s brother Thomas, and Susan P. Hancock and Anna B. Watson were children of his brother David. In the auditor’s opinion the accident that Mary S. Bacon and Sarah W. Bacon survived both Susan P. Hancock and Anna B. Watson plays no part in the consideration of this question. It seems clear, however, that the grantor studiously kept these family interests separate. He apparently seemed to think it improbable that both Mary S. Bacon and Sarah W. Bacon would die without leaving issue, but in no <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>contingency did he provide that the nieces who were daughters of his other brother, or their issue, should have any interest in these shares. The rights of the two families are just as distinct as if he had made two separate deeds one to each class, and in legal contemplation the effect is precisely the same. As was pointed out by Chief Justice Tllghman as long ago as Lessee of Hall v. Vandergrift, <a href="/binn/3/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="3 Binn. 374" data-case-ids="1791075" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0374-01">3 Binn., 374</a>, “the desire of confining property to a particular family seems deep-rooted in the human breast.

L. 170, and section 3 of the Act of May 6,1887, P. L. 79. Under these circumstances the auditor is of opinion that the more sensible and equitable method of distribution would be to treat the life estate as equal to one third of the fund which would otherwise be held for life, and the remainder estate as equal to two thirds thereof. It is true that this method of calculation is at best but an arbitrary one, as are all attempts by the Carlisle Tables or otherwise to determine the duration of a given life : Kerrigan v. Penna. R.
