    <p class="summary" id="b350-6" data-blocks='[["BL_350.12",350,[279,1131,1189,1023]]]'>From the record it appeared that in 1884 the Globe Building &amp; Loan Association made a loan to Francis Vanderherchen and took as security therefor a mortgage for $4,400 and twenty-two shares of stock of the association. In 1890, the defendant executed to Bartram Ashmead-a mortgage for $2,300. In June, 1901, Ashmead began a foreclosure suit on this mortgage resulting in a sale of the mortgaged premises to him on October 7, 1891. On October 9,1901, judgment was entered against Vanderherchen in a suit by the building and loan association on its mortgage. Subsequently Ashmead took a rule to show cause why the latter judgment should not be opened, alleging that in 1894 the association had settled with Vanderherchen, and had taken from him a mortgage for $1,800, the balance then due by him, and that this was in substitution of the prior mortgage. The association denied that there had been any such mortgage executed, and the secretary of the association testified that there had been negotiations for such a settlement but that they fell through when the association discovered the existence of other mortgages on the premises. The court discharged the rule to open judgment.</p>
