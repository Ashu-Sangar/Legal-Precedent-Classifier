Monroe S. Eby, Esq., testified that the signature on the note was the signature of decedent.</p>

Zeigler and Harry M. Deem, all of whom testified that they were familiar with the signature of the decedent, and that in their opinions, respectively, the signature of the note in dispute was not in the handwriting of the decedent. The administrator produced, and introduced in evidence, twelve admittedly genuine signatures of the decedent, for the purpose of comparison with the disputed signature.</p>

If I understand the proposition contained in the exception, it is this: that the court erred in putting upon the claimant the burden of proving her case. Certainly there was no presumption, either of law or fact, that the decedent executed the note or authorized some one to do it for her; and unless there was such a presumption, it was incumbent upon the claimant to establish a prima facie case by proof of execution of the note; and this duty she properly took upon herself by an attempt to prove that the signature of the note was in the handwriting of the decedent.</p>

On the other hand four witnesses, all of whom were familiar with decedent’s signature, testified that the signature on the note was not in her handwriting; and they produced a dozen of her admittedly genuine signatures for comparison. A careful study of the signature on the note and comparison of it with the genuine signatures, satisfied me that it had not been written by the decedent, and I so decided. In so deciding, the court simply found that the prima facie case of the claimant had been overcome by the direct and positive contradiction of four witnesses, and by a comparison of the signature in dispute with a dozen confessedly genuine signatures of the decedent; and which comparison, in the opinion of the court, demonstrated the inability of the decedent to have written the signature in dispute. Now, in this, there was no burden put upon the claimant but that of proving her case.</p>
