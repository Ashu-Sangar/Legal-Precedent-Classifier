Darrah was not in esse at the time of the grant she cannot be included under the designation “ children ” as contemplated by the deed and therefore she has no standing to demand partition.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b518-7" data-blocks='[["BL_518.6",518,[258,1141,1191,454]]]'>It is our duty so to construe this deed as, if possible, to carry out the intention of the parties and to give to each part its proper and legal effect. The frequent use of the words “ in trust” rebuts the idea that an absolute estate was intended to be granted to Samuel Jones Darrah, for, if the grantor intended an estate in fee simple the words “ in trust ” would be inconsistent. See Warn v. Brown, <a href="/pa/102/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="102 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="502748" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0347-01">102 Pa. 347</a>.

If we strike out the word “ heirs ” in the premises it leaves the grant to the children of said Samuel Jones Darrah; or if we construe the word “ heirs ” as used indiscriminately and synonymously with “ children ” we have the same result. In Huss v. Stephens, <a href="/pa/51/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="51 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="999768" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0282-01">51 Pa. 282</a>, where the grant was “ to the heirs of Andrew Lantz, Jr.,” “in consideration of the natural love and affection he hath for his grandchildren ” the conveyance was held good, and the word “ heirs ” applied to the grandchildren as persons, in being and competent to take. We cannot, see, therefore, why the conveyance up to this point was not good to Samuel Jones Darrah in trust for his children.</p>

The purpose of the habendum is to define the extent of the interest granted, if that interest has not already been defined, and whilst it may be used to explain or qualify the grant, as set forth in the premises, it cannot be used to defeat it: Tyler v.

But we cannot so construe the grant. No mention is made of any title or interest to vest in him. True the natural love and affection is that existing between Thomas and Samuel, but this may be a good consideration for the gift to the latter’s children. Samuel is but a dry trustee, or conduit, through whom the estate vests in his children.</p>
