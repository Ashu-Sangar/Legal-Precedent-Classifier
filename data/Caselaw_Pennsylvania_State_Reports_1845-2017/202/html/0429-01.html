Such crossings were almost universal from the introduction of railroads until very recently, and they are not even now unlawful. But with the growing density of population and the development of high speed of trains the dangers had become so manifest that the Act of June 19, 1871, P. L. 1360, conferred jurisdiction over the mode of crossing one railroad by another. Under that statute it was said in Perry Co. R. R. Extension Co. v. Newport, etc., R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/150/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="150 Pa. 193" data-case-ids="834378" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0193-01">150 Pa. 193</a>, that “ the time for grade crossings in this state has passed. They ought not to be permitted except in cases of imperious necessity.” The policy thus expressed has been steadfastly adhered to, but it has also been explicitly declared that the authority of the courts does not extend to <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>grade crossings of railroads over ordinary streets and highways: Bryner v.
