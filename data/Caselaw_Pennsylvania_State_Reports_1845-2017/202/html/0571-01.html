Co., and as perfectly consistent with that in Philadelphia v. City Pass. Ry. Co., supra, it would appear that the company’s duty to repair does not exist — in the sense that it calls for no action on the company’s part — while the condition of the pavement as originally required on that portion of the street occupied by the right of way is such that it needs no mending, and that in such case the city has no right to call upon the company to replace it with a different and better one, i. e., to engage in what then would be more properly termed reconstruction than repair. Accordingly, in Elliott, Roads and Streets, pp. 594, 595, the doctrine is laid down as the one deducible from the authorities, that a railway company, in respect to the condition of its right of way upon the streets of a city, is bound to repair but not to improve, but that the duty of making repairs requires them to be made in such manner and with such materials as will correspond with the general condition of the street at the time the repairs are needed ; so that, whilst the company is not compellable to tear up a sound pavement of antiquated style and replace it with a different and better one, yet if a necessity for repairing the pavement within the right of way arises after an improved pavement has been laid in the remainder of the street by the city, the latter may require the company reasonably to confirm with such improved pavement.

Of course, all this refers solely to the company’s right of way, its duty to repair which exists with or without contract, and with or without express legislative declaration, that is to say, exists as a common-law duty. No such duty is imposed upon it as to the remainder of the street.

When this railway was constructed, the streets of Reading were mac<a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>ademized. The requirement to pave with cobblestones was intended to exact from the company something more, not something less, than a reasonable correspondence with the rest of the street. There was no thought of relieving the company from any obligations devolving upon it under the law, but to impose upon it a duty greater than, in view of the then condition of the streets, the law would have imposed upon it. Indeed, of the contention that it may have been intended to settle, as between the city and the company, that the maintenance of a cobble stone pavement should forever be the measure of ■the latter’s service in return for the grant of the former’s streets, it may be said in the language of the Supreme Court in Philadelphia v. Ridge Ave. Pass. Ry. Co., supra, at p. 472:</p>

That being so, the liability of the defendant in this ease is precisely the same as that which rested upon the appellant in McKeesport v. Pass. Ry. Co., supra, under the ordinance there produced, which therefore must be regarded as simply declaratory of the company’s common-law liability. Hence the decision in that case virtually settles the rule to be applied in this. And when it is further remembered that the notice given by the city of Reading to the defendant was substantially like that given by the borough of McKeesport to the defendant in that ease, and that the verdict here, based upon abundant evidence, establishes all the essential facts there shown, viz : that an improved street pavement upon those portions of the streets outside of defendant’s right of way had been determined upon by the city, that the pavement upon said right of way was in a state of dilapidation so that it was the duty of the coinpaiiy presently to repair, that defendant was notified of the adoption of the new street pavement and of the fact that the city was about to lay it, and was required by that notice to conform thereto, that it refused so to do, that the city then proceeded to do the work for it, that a continuance of the previous cobblestone pavement was incompatible with the improved street pavement, that the pavement put down upon the company’s right of way was a reasonably proper and economical one in correspondence with the paving of the remainder of the.street, and that the work was done by the city at the same cost per unit as the paving upon the remainder of the street, there seems to he no question left upon this main branch of the case which is not fully disposed of by the express or implied rulings in that decision. It may be added, however, that this case is stronger in favor of the plaintiff than the McKeesport case in this, that by the bargain between the city and the paving contractor, not only was the work done more cheaply than the company could have procured it to be done under an independent contract, but the repairing of the entire street, including the right of way, was assumed for a period of ten years by the contractor, thereby easing the defendant, for that length of time, of a burden which confessedly lay upon it.</p>
