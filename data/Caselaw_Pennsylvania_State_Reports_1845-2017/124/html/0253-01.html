But take the rule at its worst, as stated in Sugden on Vendors, 578, i. e., taking into account what the opinions of competent persons may be, is this court prepared to say that a power such as this terminates with the vesting of an estate in fee simple under the will ?</p>

It is not disputed'that all powers are necessarily limited, for a really absolute power unlimited, must be void, as tending to create a perpetuity. And we admit that the power, the exercise of which is in question, is of course limited. On the other hand, the words of the will creating the power are extremely inconsistent with an intention to restrict the execution of the power to the lifetime of the widow. They are: “ I authorize and empower my executors, and the survivors or survivor of them, any time after my decease, in their discretion, to sell,” etc. If the testator had any thought on the subject and had intended to restrict the exercise to the lifetime of his widow, the common-place words, during my wife’s life, would have been inserted. But it is urged that there was a necessity for such a power during the life of the widow, but not after-wards, yet there was no necessity or utility for a power to exist before, that did not exist after the death of the widow. Her life estate could not clog the selling, as she was sui juris, and the power could not have been exercised without her consent ; that is, there was the same clog, with or without the power, to wit, the necessity for the widow’s consent.</p>
    <p id="b282-6" data-blocks='[["BL_282.6",282,[258,2067,1183,352]],["BL_283.1",283,[187,365,1182,617]]]'>3. What, then, is the real limitation of the power given to the executors in the most unlimited language ? The object of the power of course limits the power, and there are two possible objects in all such powers: (1) The raising of funds to pay debts, if there are <em>any; </em>(2) The convenience of distribution, if an actual division is undesirable. The first certainly existed here, and the second existed quite as much after the <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>widow’s death as before. The evidence incidentally disclosed this; there was an infant devisee having a one sixth interest vested in possession. The giving of a power in such a case, (1) saves the expense of partitioning; (2), what is vastly more important, a power to sell makes the sale controllable by a party in interest and avoids the danger of a forced public sale. The consequences of rejecting this ground for keeping alive a power are most serious. It is nothing more or less than laying down as a rule of property in this state, the hitherto unheard of rule that a power to sell in executors ceases by implication on the vesting of the estate in fee in devisees, though they are not sui juris.</p>

    <p id="b283-6" data-blocks='[["BL_283.7",283,[185,1096,1184,1024]]]'>The controlling question in this case is upon the true construction of tho last will and testament of llobert Buist, the elder, deceased. The power of sale to the executors, apart from the other provisions of the will, is framed in the most general terms; it is wholly without limitation as to time, and taken alone was exercisable iu their discretion “ at any time ” after the testator’s decease. But although the time for its exercise is not limited by any words used in its creation, the limitation to which it is really subject may appear upon a consideration of the testator’s general design in the disposition of his estate, as shown by the will; for although the power was to be exercised “ at any time ” in the discretion of the executors, yet this may be ascertained tp mean, at any time within some period fixed in the testator’s mind, but not fully expressed, ascertainable however from the manifest general scheme and purpose of his will. Whether this was a power which the executors might exercise in the lifetime of the widow, or at any time afterwards, is therefore a mere question of intention, to be ascertained from a study of the entire instrument by which the power was created.</p>

After providing for the payment of his debts, etc., he gave to her the furniture, provisions, etc., on hand, and directed his executors to pay to her, semi-annually, for and during the term of her natural life, the entire income and interest of the residue of his personal estate, and then in <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>the fourth clause devised to her, directly, for life, all his real estate. The fifth clause contains the power of sale, which gives rise to this contention; it is in the following words: “ I authorize and empower my said executors, and the survivors or survivor of them, at any time after my decease, in their discretion, to sell and convey, in fee simple, to any person or persons, for such price or prices as they shall deem sufficient, all or any portion of my said real estate whatsoever, and wheresoever situate.”</p>

The testator provides, that, “the proceeds of <em>all </em>such sales of my real estate, whenever made, shall be held by my executors, in trust, for the uses and purposes declared in this my will, in relation to the said real estate ; ” that is to say, the proceeds shall be held for the use of his wife, the interest and income thereof payable to her, during her life. In confirmation of this, the testator further provides, as follows: “ And I further direct that all investments and re-investments of the proceeds of such" sales, as well as of my personal property and estate, shall be made in first mortgages of improved real estate, situate in the city of Philadelphia, in the public loans of the state of Pennsylvania, or of the United States, of the city of Philadelphia, or in such other securities as may be authorized by law; ” with power to change the investment, etc.</p>

The manifest design of the testator was, that in the lifetime of the widow the best interests of his estate should be protected and promoted by his executors, one of them being his widow, the life-tenant, the other two, his children, devisees in remainder; that the real estate should be subject to sale, in their discretion, at any time during the life of the widow, but at her death the whole estate, as it then existed, should be distributed to those entitled.</p>

A power of sale without limit would doubtless be bad, under the rule against perpetuities, and a testator will not be presumed to have intended anything so absurd. Such powers, when framed in general terms, may therefore in some cases, as stated by Sir George J essel, in Peters v. Lewes etc. IL Co., L. R. 18 Ch. D. 429, be limited by the limitations of the settlement contained in the will. But this is merely upon the presumption that the testator so intended, for in the very case cited, although the life estate had actually terminated, the power was upheld, it appearing from the will that the testator had created it for the purpose of division. Upon the same principle, although the power may be expressed in the most general terms, yet if the purpose of its creation appears, and that purpose has ceased, there can ordinarily be no further execution of the power, as it will be presumed that the testator did not intend that the power should be exercised after the accomplishment of that purpose: Wheate v. Hall, 17 Ves. 86; Wolley v. Jenkins, 23 Beav. 53; Swift’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/87/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="87 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="1057806" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0502-01">87 Pa. 502</a>.</p>

When the limitations contained in a settlement by will have expired, and absolute interests in fee have vested in possession in persons sui juris, it may well be supposed that the testator intended that a power <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>of sale will not after that be exercised; but if, on the construction of the instrument, it appears otherwise, and that the testator intended it should be afterwards exercised, the power will of course be upheld, unless it is obnoxious to the rule against perpetuities, or the cestuis que trustent have elected to take the property as it stands: In re Cotton’s Trustees, etc., L. R. 19 Ch. D. 624.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[244,735,1184,871]]]'>On the other hand, as was said by Sir Edward Fey in the case just cited, “It is well ascertained that when there is a settlement of real estate, either by will or by deed, and the settlement ultimately carries the land to a person entitled in fee simple, and there are powers couched in general words and without limitation as to time, which are nevertheless obviously intended to be exercised only during the subsistence of the intermediate limitations, there, the moment the estate in fee is vested, the powers are at an end, because it was the intention of the settlement that they should subsist only during the intermediate limitations.” The vesting of the estate absolutely in the persons ultimately entitled is an indication, merely, that according to the true construction of the settlement, the intention of the settlor was that the powers would, in that event, come to an end. To the same effect, although the cases are not wholly similar, is our own case of Kaufman v. Hollinger, 4 <em>W. </em>N. 27.</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[243,1613,1186,349]]]'>The validity of the title here, as stated by the counsel for defendant in error, depends upon the construction of this will; it is either certainly good or certainly bad, as the law may be determined one way or the other. It is not a question, therefore, of a doubtful title dependent upon disputed facts. If we are right, however, the title is defective, and the plaintiff, Robert Buist, is not entitled to recover.</p>
    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.7",286,[883,1972,498,47]]]'>The judgment is reversed.</p>
