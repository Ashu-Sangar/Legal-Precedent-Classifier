They at once leased certain coal lands in Lackawanna township and commenced to sink a shaft and build a breaker. A contract was made with A. B. Tyrrell for the erection of the breaker, according to plans prepared in the office of the Pittston Engine and Machine Co. Under his contract Tyrrell was to build the breaker for thirteen dollars per thousand feet of all lumber which should be used, the company furnishing all materials. Arrangements were made by S. N. S teller, the chairman, and E. L. Fuller, the secretary and treasurer of the Amity Coal Company with the firm of A. Iiyman &amp; Sons, lumber dealers of Wilkes-Barre, to furnish the lumber required for the breaker, as it-should be needed, at the rate of fourteen dollars per thousand feet for hemlock, delivered upon the ground. The orders for the lumber were some<a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>times received from officers of the company and sometimes from Mr. Tyrrell. The first lumber was shipped August 7, 1883, and the shipments continued from time to time until December 12, 1884. The aggregate amount of the lumber bills of Ilyman &amp; Sons was $21,543.57, which includes some items of discount, etc., which are not proper subjects of lien. They acknowledge to have been paid $17,582.89, leaving their claim $3,960.68. All of the lumber which went into the breaker building was furnished on the credit of the building.</p>

So far as it was used by Tyrrell before he left, it is improperly charged as of a date in 1885, as Tyrrell left in November, 1884. So far as it was used in the subsequent constructions testified to by Lutz and Fuller, its value for the purpose of extending the time for filing the lien depends upon the question whether those constructions were or were not essential to the completion of the breaker, which question will be hereafter considered.</p>

Mr. Tyrrell, the contractor, at that time removed his poles, ropes and scaffolding, but continued to do some work, by day’s work, until November 21, 1884, when he finally left.

The ventilation of the mine vras supplied bjr a downcast of air into the shaft. When the severe cold of winter began to be felt, a great deal of trouble was experienced from the freezing of water in the guides of the shaft carriage during the night, thereby causing it to bind and stick to such an extent as to interfere with the hoisting of coal. The first expedient resorted to for obviating this difficulty, was to line the shaft with timbers so placed that the water would run down between the walls and the lining. This proved to be insufficient. A fire in a stove or grate was then placed upon the carriage, which was lowered part way down the shaft during the night. The evil being still unabated, the shaft on the breaker side and the open archway spoken of were boarded down to tbe ground and two stoves placed inside near the opening of the shaft.</p>

Nearly all the witnesses testify that many devices are resorted to for this purpose, and that it is very difficult to entirely avoid trouble from the freezing of water in a shaft with a down-cast of air and a large amount of water. E. J. Evans says that the evil is not yet entirely removed at the Amity mine, and Mr. Storrs says that it is sometimes necessary to change the plan of ventilation so as to make an up-cast in the hoisting shaft.</p>

The length of the intervening period is of little, if any, importance. That the erection of some portion of the building, as originally designed, is delayed for a considerable period after the rest of the building is completed and put in use, makes it no less an essential part of the building. That something not originally designed as part of the building is found to be necessary and is supplied almost immediately after the building, as planned, is completed, makes it no less an addition. The opinion of expert witnesses as to the necessity for certain appliances is not a safe guide in the determination of the question whether a building is completed. Were it accepted as a guide, new and rapidly growing industries, such as electrical plants, could never be considered completed. Every new discovery in the art leads to the adoption of new and improved appliances, which, when adopted, are rightly regarded as necessary and essential to the structure. And even in old and familiar industries, unexpected and unanticipated exigencies are constantly arising, which require new and improved methods, which, when adopted, seem to be and actually are as necessary as any of those which were originally planned. ■ An unskillful designer may plan a building which would seem to an expert an abortion, to adopt the phrase <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>of one of the witnesses, yet, when finished according to the plan, it is as much a completed building as if it were perfect in all its appointments. And if, after a few weeks or months of unsuccessful experiment the requisite changes are made, they are not the less alterations or repairs, because they ought to have been anticipated and included in the original design : Thoma &amp; Blandy’s Estate, <a href="/pa/76/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="76 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="1038870" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0030-01">76 Pa. 30</a>.</p>

It was found after it was put in operation that the hot water ran down into the cellar and increased the temperature to such a degree as to sour the beer there stored, in consequence of which he was obliged to, and did in 1868, erect another connecting building. Diller furnished the machinery for both buildings and filed a lien therefor. In a contention between Diller and a creditor, whose judgment was entered after the commencement and before the completion of the first building, the issue was determined against the lien. In its ansrver to the plaintiff’s second point the court below said: “ If the jury should consider the two buildings as constituting one, and both buildings were originally designed and intended to be one building when the first building was erected, then we answer this point in the affirmative. But if the second building was erected after the first building was erected, and was a building not designed to be erected when the first building was erected, and the lien was not filed within six months from the completion of the first building, then we answer this point in the negative.” And in the general charge, “If.....when the first building was erected, it was designed and intended that the additional building was to be part of it.....then the plaintiff was in time in filing his claim.” These portions of the charge were assigned as error and affirmed by the Supreme Court in an opinion in which the case is made to turn on the fact that “ the addition was a new building, the result of a new plan, and a new undertaking.”</p>

If this is a matter of discretion, and 1 am of the opinion that it is, then I deny the issue for the reason that these claimants have had their day in court before the auditor, where witness after witness was called and voluminous testimony taken pin and con. in reference to the very matter asked for by them to be tried before a jury in their demand for an issue.

The testimony was somewhat conflicting, but, upon a careful consideration of all the evidence, bearing on the subject, the learned auditor reached the conclusion that the claim was not filed in time, and he so found as a fact. That and other subordinate findings of fact were approved by the court, and, of course, the result was that appellants were not permitted to participate in the distribution.</p>
