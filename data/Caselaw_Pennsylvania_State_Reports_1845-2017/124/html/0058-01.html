Is the Reading Railroad Company as surety on the bonds in any better position? We think not. As such surety the company is bound to the full extent that the principal is bound. This is the general rule in regard to sureties, and there is nothing in this case to limit this liability. The plaintiffs in error knew when they guaranteed the bonds that they had coupons attached, and that if the coupons were not paid at maturity interest could be recovered thereon. Their contract was an original undertaking, and the holders of the coupons had a right to proceed at once against the surety.
