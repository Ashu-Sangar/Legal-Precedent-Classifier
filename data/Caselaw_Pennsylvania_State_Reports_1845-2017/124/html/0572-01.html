At about 11 o’clock at night on March 26, 1887, there was an alarm of fire, and the plaintiff with another jumped upon the steps at the rear end of a hose carriage. In that position he could not see over the seat in front, where the driver sat. The hose carriage was driven rapidly down Fifth street for half a square and then turned up Welsh, proceeding without being checked towards the railroad crossing. Though the plaintiff had control of the hose carriage, he gave no directions to the driver.</p>

On the night in question, the working parts of the gateway were out of order and the bars elevated, without the red light upon them. There was an ordinance forbidding the approach of trains to crossings at a greater speed than five miles an hour. On tire side of Welsh street towards which a train was approaching, the street was built up with houses. There was evidence on the part of the plaintiff that no watchman was out at the crossing; that no bell was rung, and that the train approached at over ten miles an hour.</p>

I hold that it is the duty of every traveler upon a public highway crossed by a railroad, before <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>attempting to cross the road, to stop, look and listen. If he hears no approaching train or sees none, then he may cross.' Any traveler who neglects that duty is guilty of negligence, and when there is contributory negligence — when both parties are negligent — the law does not permit a recovery by either, as it does not pretend to measure the amount of negligence, so as to ascertain whether one party is more negligent than the other. The only question in my mind, when the first motion was made for a nonsuit, was whether the fact that the company had undertaken to erect safety-gates at these crossings, did not make it their duty to so guard the road as to relieve travelers from their duty of stopping, looking and listening; but, upon reflection, and after hearing all the evidence in the case, I ain of opinion that that was intended as an additional safeguard of public travel, and not to relieve the traveler from any previous care for his own protection. The duty still remains, although the gates be there. Although extra precautions are taken by the railroad, the duty still exisfe for every traveler in crossing the railroad to stop, look and listen. If he does not do that, he cannot recover. It will, therefore, be your duty to find a verdict for the defendant, and if the coru’t is wrong, the plaintiff will have his redress either by a new trial granted by this court, or by a reversal of this judgment by the Supreme Court. You are, therefore, directed to render a verdict for the defendant.</p>

Having shown that the rule is not inflexible, another principle applies: Whenever the plaintiff is thrown off his guard by the acts or omissions of the defendant he is not held to the same rule as to negligence that would otherwise be imposed upon him: Penn.

The facts in the case which apply to this rule, are <em>(ci) </em>the disregard of the ordinance as to speed; (5) the absence of the usual signal and gates, and the white light instead of the red one. Moreover, another rule is applicable: As the defendant could not use the ordinary signals, the gates being broken, they were bound to use extra precautions: Phil. &amp; R. R. Co. v. Killips, <a href="/pa/88/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="88 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1061265" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0405-01">88 Pa. 405</a>; Penn. R. Co. v.

The court below gave a binding instruction to the jury to find for the defendant. Under such circumstances, we must assume not only that all of the plaintiff’s testimony is true, but that he is entitled to every inference fairly to be drawn from it.</p>
    <p id="b600-7" data-blocks='[["BL_600.9",600,[246,1447,1186,972]],["BL_601.1",601,[166,359,1178,456]]]'>The facts of the case, as we gather them from the evidence, may be briefly stated as follows: The .plaintiff was’ a member of the Hanley Hose Company in the city of Chester. On the night of March 26,1887, he was at the hose house and informed one or more members that there was a fire; to use his own language: “It looked from Edgmont avenue to be over at Mr. Eyre’s house, around Seventh street. That is where I seen the fire.” No other person in Chester appears to have seen this alleged fire; nor was there any alarm given at any of the other engine houses. The result of the plaintiff’s announcement at the Hanley Hose Company’s house was that the company immediately turned out. The plaintiff and one or two others got on the hose carriage, and with a spirited horse started out to find the fire. The horse was driven at a rapid rate of speed for some distance along Fifth street and then turned up Welsh street. The railroad of the defendant company was one square from the corner of Fifth and Welsh. At the- railroad crossing the company had for some time kept a watchman, and safety-gates, which were lowered upon the approach of <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>trains. Upon the night in question, when the hose carriage approached the crosssing, the gates were not lowered; they had become out of order that morning and had not been repaired. The watchman displayed no light and gave no warning. The hose carriage did not stop as it approached the track, in order to afford an opportunity to look and listen; nor did it even slacken its speed, but continued on, was struck by the train, and the plaintiff was thrown off the carriage and injured. ,</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[165,824,1179,355]]]'>Under such circumstances does the case come within the familiar rule, “stop, look, and listen” ? It was strongly urged upon the argument that the rule referred to does not apply for the* reason <em>(a) </em>that the plaintiff had a right to rely upon the fact that the safety-gates were up, and (5) that the said rule is not applicable to towns and cities where trains are constantly crossing streets.</p>
    <p id="b601-6" data-blocks='[["BL_601.6",601,[160,1187,1182,1231]],["BL_602.1",602,[269,351,1187,150]]]'>I do not understand the law to be that when a railroad company adopts safety-gates or any other appliance for the protection of the public, that the public are thereby absolved from the duty of taking any care of themselves. Conceding that the company was required to take extra precautions by reason of the gates being out of order, yet the plaintiff was also bound to do his part. He has no right to omit the ordinary precautions when approaching a railroad crossing merely because he finds the gates up. Machinery of all kinds is liable to get out of order, and may do so just at the critical moment of the approach of a train. In all such cases the safety of the traveling public requires that each party shall be held to the exercise of due care. Had this hose carriage stopped near the crossing instead of rushing on at reckless speed, this accident would not have happened. The train could have been seen for one hundred feet before the crossing was reached. If the rule to stop, look, and listen were always observed, an accident at crossings, now so frequent, would rarely occur, whether in town or country. It is difficult to see why the rule is not as important in towns and cities as in the country, where in many instances the track can be seen for a long distance. The rule itself is so valuable; is sustained by such abundant authority; and is moreover founded upon such excellent common sense reasons, that we will neither depart from it, nor allow it to be <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>undermined by exceptions.
