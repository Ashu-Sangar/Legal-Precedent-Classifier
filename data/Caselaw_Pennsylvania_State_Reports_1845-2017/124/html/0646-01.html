The question arose in the Orphans’ Court in connection with the distribution of the property of William JR. Thomas, in which the court had to decide whether this plaintiff was his widow or not.

Now, this raises two questions of fact. First: Have the defendants proved to your satisfaction that the David Jones she married forty-nine years ago, and was proved to be living some four years ago, the two persons, if I may use the expression, were the same person ? You will recollect that one of the witnesses testified that she saw this woman and David Jones living together, and she afterwards saw David Jones twenty-one years afterwards, or four years ago, sitting by the roadside. She gives you to understand that it was the same person; she was fourteen <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>years old or thereabouts when she first saw David Jones, the husband of this woman; she didn’t see him again for twenty-one years, and then she says she saw him sitting by the roadside. There are other witnesses who testified they saw David Jones in Wales at other times. I do not propose to go into the evidence, because it has been ably argued on both sides, and I prefer that you should look at the case from the evidence itself.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b672-5" data-blocks='[["BL_672.5",672,[240,758,1187,664]]]'>The question of identity, which is that which determines that the same person is existing at two different times, is a very troublesome question, and it is a question, it is proper for us to say, in regard to which witnesses may be mistaken. We do not say this now to control you, but simply to give you that sense of care in examining this case which it requires. It is an important case, because if this plaintiff did marry when she had a husband living, or when she had reason to suppose she had a husband living, then she has been guilty of a crime, under the laws of the commonwealth. You will see that it is an important question, and of course the evidence should be looked at, and scanned, and weighed, with the utmost care on the part of the jury.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b672-6" data-blocks='[["BL_672.6",672,[240,1430,1186,456]]]'>You will bear in mind that it is possible that witnesses testifying to seeing the same person at two different times, a long distance apart, may be mistaken; even if they are of the same name, they may be mistaken as to their being the same person. I call your attention to this once for all, so that in examining and considering the testimony of the witnesses you may satisfy yourself as to whether they <em>do </em>give you sufficient circumstances, so that you can determine that they are testifying in regard to the same person at two different times.</p>

If you come to the conclusion that he was living, that the David Jones she married forty-nine years ago was alive at the time she contracted the second marriage in 1875, then that raises the next question. If you come to the conclusion that he was not living in 1875, that ends the defendants’ case, because, if he was not living at the time she contracted the second marriage in 1875, she had the right to contract that marriage beyond a question, and it was a legal and a valid marriage. But if you come to the conclusion, after weighing all the testimony, taking into consideration that witnesses may be mistaken, that they testified to what they did see and know, and were correct in their observation, and that they did see this same Mr. Jones, after she had contracted the second marriage, in life, then the question arises : Did Ann Jones, in 1875, when she contracted the marriage with William R. Thomas, did she contract it in good faith, under circumstances in which she had the right to believe that David Jones was dead ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.5",673,[163,1293,1185,910]]]'>The rule of law with regard to that is this : that when a man is absent from bis home for a period of seven years, unheard from, under circumstances from which it would be presumed that he would be heard from if living, and remains away unheard from for a period of seven years, the law raises a presumption of his death. It is supposed that a man who has a family, has a wife and has children, and goes away, will, before the period of seven years has transpired, either communicate with them or let himself be known, in some way, to be in existence. And if he does not, from various reasons which you can think of yourselves — the fact that he has a wife, the fact that he has children, the fact that he has a home — the law presumes that he will in some way correspond with his family, and let it be known that he is alive. If he does not, and remains away for a period of seven years, under circumstances from which, if alive, he would be presumed to communicate with his family, and is not heard from, the law raises a presumption that he is dead.</p>

The rule is now well settled, for most judicial purposes, that the presumption of life, with respect to persons of whom no account can be given, ends at the expiration of seven years from the time they were last known to be living: Esterly’s App., <a href="/pa/109/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="109 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="542329" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0222-01">109 Pa. 222</a>; Best on Presumptions, §§ 140, 334, 408; 2 Greenl.

After so long a time, the law treats the presumption of the legality of the second marriage as overcoming that of the continuance of life, and requires that direct proof should be made that the former husband or wife was living at the date of second marriage: Dixon v.

Tlie former case is not ruled by the dictum of Justice Knox, and it was there admitted that the first husband was living at the time of the second marriage. The latter case was a proceeding in divorce, and the first husband was known by libellant to be in full health at the time the suit was instituted. In this case the jury found that David Jones, the first husband of Ann Thomas, was dead at the time of her second marriage. Her good faith in the second marriage was also established by the verdict, and her civil rights as the widow of the deceased secured.</p>

Thomas, the decedent, at the time of his death; the plaintiff affirming that she was the lawful wife of William R. Thomas, and the defendants affirming that she was not his lawful wife.” The considerations that moved the court to send this issue to the Common Pleas for trial sufficiently appear in the opinion just filed in Thomas’s Appeal, No. 180 of this term, but they have little, if anything, to do with the consideration of the questions presented by this record. Those questions relate solely to the instructions of the learned president of the Common Pleas as to the effect of the evidence before the jury, and the character of the proof necessary to overcome the prima facie case that was made for the plaintiff below by the introduction of Alderman Jay’s certificate of her marriage to William R. Thomas on January 16, 18T5. It is not even alleged that there was any error in the admission or rejection of evidence.</p>
    <p id="b678-5" data-blocks='[["BL_678.5",678,[239,1443,1189,817]]]'>To rebut the case thus made in her favor, and to maintain the issue on their part, the defendants below introduced evidence tending to prove that about forty years before her alleged marriage to William R. Thomas, plaintiff was married to David Jones, at Llaneatog, Wales; that for many years thereafter they lived together as husband and wife at Aberdare and at Falda, in same country, and that at the time of her marriage to Thomas, and even after his decease, David Jones, her first husband, was in full life. In response to this, the plaintiff, in turn, introduced evidence tending to show that Jones left Wales and had been unheard of by her for more than seven years before her marriage to Thomas, and that prior thereto, as well as thereafter, she had reason to believe and did believe that Jones was dead. As to all these allegations of fact, on the part of plaintiff as well as defendants, in the issue, there was more or less conflict of testimony.</p>

    <p id="b679-5" data-blocks='[["BL_679.5",679,[174,510,1182,769]]]'>Assuming the jury were satisfied that plaintiff was first married to Jones, and in the absence of any evidence that she was legally divorced from Mm, the proposition was correct, and with that qualification it should have heen affirmed. Instead of that, the learned judge said: “We affirm this, unless you find from the evidence that he was absent for a period of seven years, unheard from, and under circumstances which raise the presumption of his death, as wo have already charged you.” He had already charged, as complained of in the first specification of error: “ Now, under all the circumstances of the case, had she the right to presume when she married William II. Thomas, that her husband was dead under the law ? If she had, then her marriage was legal, and, so far as this case is concerned, she is entitled to her civil rights as the widow of William It. Thomas, and should not be deprived of them.”</p>
    <p id="b679-6" data-blocks='[["BL_679.6",679,[174,1290,1183,1180]]]'>The vice of this instruction is that it gives the presumption referred to, all the force and effect of actual death; in other words, it makes the presumption of death conclusive proof of the fact, and therefore irrebuttable. But, the presumption of death, arising from absence, etc., stands as competent proof of death only until it is successfully rebutted by competent and satisfactory evidence. If that was successfully done in this ease, and the jury were fully satisfied that at the date of plaintiff’s marriage to Thomas, in January, 1875, she had a husband in full life, viz.: David Jones, from whom she had never been divorced, that fact, without more, rendered the second marriage null and void. It matters not that she had reason to believe and did believe that he was then dead. If, in truth and in fact, he was then in full life, she was incapable of contracting the second marriage, and it was therefore void: Kenley v. Kenley, <a href="/yeates/2/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2 Yeates 207" data-case-ids="812714,812733" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0207-01,/yeates/2/0207-02">2 Y. 207</a>; Heffner v. Heffner, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20104" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="28 Pa. 104">28 Pa. 104</a>. In the first case the court said “though the circumstances attending this case might exempt the defendant from the pains of bigamy, yet her first husband being in full life, and their marriage not annulled by any competent jurisdiction, the marriage was ipso facto void and null.” In the latter it was said: “ A man having a wife in full life is utterly powerless to make a valid contract of marriage, and his attempt to do so is utterly nugatory.”</p>
    <p id="b680-3" data-blocks='[["BL_680.4",680,[245,347,1193,870]]]'>
      <a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>While a well-founded belief in the death of her first husband (if in fact she had one) would have relieved plaintiff from the penalty for adultery, etc., it could not validate the second marriage, if, in fact, her first husband was living when it was solemnized. The act of March 13, 1815, § 6, provides: “ If any husband or wife, upon any false rumor, in appearance well founded, of the death of the other (when such other has been absent for the space of two whole years), hath married, or shall marry again, he or she shall not be liable to the pains of adultery; but it shall be in the election of the party remaining unmarried, at liis or her return, to insist to have his or her former marriage dissolved,” etc. The presumption, especially in criminal proceedings, is always in favor of innocence. When a marriage has been regularly solemnized, it is presumed to be valid until the contrary is shown. When that has been done by competent and satisfactory evidence the presumption of fact, in civil cases, must give way to the actual fact thus established.</p>

    <p id="b680-5" data-blocks='[["BL_680.6",680,[240,1328,1190,456]]]'>In defendants’ third point the court was requested to charge: “ A presumption of death, if proved, may be rebutted by evidence showing that the man was in full life during or after the period of seven years.” The learned judge qualified his affirmance of this, as a general proposition, by saying: “ But, if the presumption has arisen, as to the wife’s subsequent marriage, that he was dead, she is not deprived of her civil rights thereby.” This qualification was erroneous, and in its application to the case at bar was practically a refusal of the point.</p>
