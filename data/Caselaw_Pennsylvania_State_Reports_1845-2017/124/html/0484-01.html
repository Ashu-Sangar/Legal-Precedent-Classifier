The witness proceeded : “ About April, 1880, I became its agent for certain purposes. I had no certificate of appointment from the company. I never saw one. I wrote the company in reference to doing business. The secretary called to see me. It was arranged that I should send it business. In pursuance of that arrangement I sent applications for insurance, subject to their approval. All applications they approved they wrote up the policies and sent them to me as their agent or representative. They sent mo the Elkins policy. I received it in December, 1880, by mail from the company. I delivered it to Mr. Lancaster, as I received the order from him, and from him I collected the premium. I received §100 on March 8th on account of my bill, and on March 15th received the balance. I charged him with all the policies I delivered. I credited the company with all the policies sent and charged myself with the premiums. I was responsible for the premiums. They looked to me for the premiums. 1 placed the checks of Lancaster to my credit. I sent the company my check for the balance of my account on March 16th, which they returned to me. When I received the policy, I recorded it in my register and sent it to Mr. Lancaster. I examined the applications and forwarded this one to the Susquehanna M. Insurance Company, with a description of the property. They approved it and wrote the policy. After recording it in my register, I delivered it to Mr. Lancaster and charged him with the premium. At the close of the month I sent him a bill. We, the company and I, usually settled about the 15th of the month. I have in some cases remitted to the Susquehanna M. Insurance Company before I received premiums, to close the account. I was responsible to the company for the premium or the return of the policy.” On cross-examination, the witness stated that he had received a letter from Mr. Huntzinger, “ informing me that the company was not keeping a general running account with mo. They wrote for my account. They asked for reports and remittance of premiums. I cannot now produce the letters making these requests, but I kept an account on my books and sent statements and checks for balances.”</p>

If Mr. Crane therefore was an agent of the company, “ duly appointed and authorized ” to receive premiums on policies delivered by him, it involved no waiver of any condition, contained in the policy itself, to bind the company by his act in so doing.</p>
    <p id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[162,938,1196,1225]]]'>It is argued, however, that as the company is a mutual company, the plaintiffs are presumed to be acquainted with the bylaws, and therefore had notice by the 24th section, that his insurance was not binding until the cash premium was actually paid to some duly authorized and commissioned agent of the company. The by-laws were made, however, solely for the protection of the company, and, as we said when the case was here before, the company was not bound to adhere to them. If they chose to dispense with the protection thus offered, it was competent for them to do so. If the company had issued this policy to Elkins, and expressly agreed to give him time on the ■payment of the premiums, taking his promissory note for the amount thereof, payable at a future day, it would not be pretended, we think, that because the premium was not actually paid, there was no liability in case of loss, during the period of credit. Or, if the company had placed the policy in the hands of some person expressly for delivery, with instructions to receive the premiums, and the premium was paid and the policy delivered accordingly, it would certainly not avail the company anything, in case of loss, that the premiums had not been paid to “ a duly authorized and commissioned agent of the company.” These by-laws were made solely in the company’s interest, and it was competent for the company in a particular case to waive strict adherence thereto.</p>

This caso <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>is readily distinguishable from Marland v. Royal Ins.

In each of these cases, the company rested upon the positive provision of the policy, that it was not to be binding until the actual payment of the premium, and in none of them was the premium paid, or pretended to be paid, either to the company or to any of its agents. In this case, however, the agency of Crane was established by proofs satisfactory to the jury, and there was evidence from which the jury was justified in inferring that the company authorized the delivery of the policy and accepted the responsibility of their agent, in lieu of the security afforded by this provision of the policy.</p>
