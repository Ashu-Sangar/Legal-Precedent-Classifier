In May, 1879, the borough council adopted a resolution requiring the water company to furnish a supply of water at the corner of Ann and Sixth streets, at the corner of Catherine and Fifth <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>streets, and at the corner of Harford and Front streets, and gave notice to the water company of this demand.

That they did not do so was a failure on their part to comply with the terms and provisions of the contract which they had themselves entered into, and it was the privilege of the borough, when the water company refused to comply with these notices, to rescind their contract, because of the failure of the other party to perform. They could have rescinded this contract, and given notice to the water company that they would no longer take the water under its terms; that they would no longer recognize any obligation existing under that contract, or recognize the contract as existing between themselves and the water company in any manner. Whether it would be necessary, or not, that they should go further, and cut off their hydrants from connection with the mains of the water company it is not necessary to consider, now, because they took no steps to rescind that contract. They gave no notice to the water company of an intention on their part to release the water company from any obligation to supply water, nor to indicate a purpose on their part to discontinue the use of the water from that time.</p>

They must do one thing or the other. They must recognize this contract as existing, and involving an obligation upon both parties, or else declare this contract at an end, releasing both parties from its obligations. If it remained a contract for one party, it remained a contract, for both parties. The benefit to the borough <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>did not depend upon the quantity of water actually used. Whether the borough should pay the consideration named in this contract or not, does not depend upon, the question whether fires occurred in the borough during the year, nor whether they actually had occasion . to use this water or not. The borough might have been free from fires for years, and may not have had occasion to draw a drop of water from these hydrants for years; but so long as by their contract they could require the water company to maintain a supply of water at these points, in order that it might be available in case a fire should occur, they were deriving a benefit to which they were entitled under the contract, and they were bound to pay for that benefit. So that, so far as this year is concerned, it is not material to inquire whether there was a fire, or any actual use for the water or not. The question is, did the parties continue in the same relation this year as they did before? Was the water company required by this contract to furnish a supply of water for those hydrants, and did they do so ? There seems to be no question about that. It was only at the end of this year that the borough notified the water company that they would not use the water, and that they -would not pay for it.</p>

It is almost needless to say that a contract so prohibited by law is utterly void, and there is no power that can breathe life into such a dead thing.</p>
    <p id="b647-4" data-blocks='[["BL_647.5",647,[149,605,1184,509]]]'>It appeared, however, upon the trial below, that the borough had been using and paying for this water for several years; that upon some occasions when the bills were passed there was less than a majority of councils who were members of the water company, and some years in which there were no members of councils who were also members of said company. From this it was urged that there was a ratification of the contract by councils. The learned judge below adopted this view, and entered judgment non obstante on the verdict in favor of the water company. This will not do.</p>

The water company never contracted with the borough. They contracted with themselves to supply the latter with water; to that agreement the borough was not a party in a legal sense. It is true, the boroxigh might, after its councils bad become purged of the members of the water company, have passed an ordinance similar to ordinance No. 2, and thus have entered into a new contract. But no such ordinance was passed, and neither councils nor the officers of the municipality can contract in any other way. It is one of the safeguards of municipal corporations that they can only be bound by a contract authorized by an ordinance duly passed. The act of 1860 is another and a valuable safeguard thrown around municipalities. It was passed to protect the people from the frauds of their own servants and agents. It may be there was no fraud actual or intended in the present case, but we will not allow it to be made an entering wedge to destroy the act of 1860. Of what possible use would that act be if its violations are condoned, and its prohibited, criminally condemned contracts allowed to be enforced under the guise of an implied ratification ? It is too plain for argument that the payment by councils for some years for water actually furnished created no contract to accept and pay for it in the future. Nor was this suit brought upon any such impli ed contract.
