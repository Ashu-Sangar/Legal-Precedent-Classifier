The plaintiff testified: “ The defendant loaned the $6,000 to me and gave me a year to repay. The $6,000 was paid over to the Bradley heirs. Defendant received the title to my properties in West Philadelphia. The title was accepted by the defendant and approved by Mr. Masson. I received all but the Ohio farms. The security I gave the defendant for the loan was the farms.” He then proceeded to testify to efforts made to meet the defendant, to tender the $6,000 and interest, but thatthe defendant kept out of his way so that he did not meet him until April 17, 1878, when the defendant refused the money, saying he was too late. On cross-examination, the plaintiff testified: “ I called it a loan from the defendant to me, because he loaned it on the security of the farms. We fixed $6,000, because he had advanced that amount.”</p>

I said yes, if you will pay in a year the $6,000 and one per cent interest.” He denied that he had avoided a meeting with the plaintiff when the latter wished to tender the money, and testified that plaintiff had come to him and asked for an extension of the time ■: “I replied, I wont extend.

The owner of part of the tract had died and the heirs of this decedent would not accept what the ancestor had agreed to take. Plaintiff then told the defendant that the transaction must fall through if he could not get about $6,000, which was necessary to pay off taxes and other incumbrances. The defendant said, I will advance $6,000 and we will drop the Ohio farms out of the bargain. This was done. Plaintiff then drew up another agreement to enable him to purchase the Ohio farms. This was an entirely new and distinct transaction, because it would be incredible, if the four farms were worth the $76,000 mentioned in the first agreement. In these bargains, however, it depends upon what you get in exchange, as a man may sell his horse for $1,000 and get two dogs valued at $500 each. Plaintiff was told that the whole rent of the farms was about $700, and it is therefore almost incredible that they thought them to be worth $76,000 in cash or its equivalent. After the first agreement had been fully completed, the second paper was made, by which the plaintiff was to purchase the farms for the price of $6,000.] 1</p>

Defendant said he refused another extension of time. Plaintiff admits that he asked an extension, but says it was in June. Of course, if the plaintiff made no tender during the year stipulated in the agreement, your verdict should be for the defendant. As to the tender, it is proper to say that it is the duty of the plaintiff to be prepared to make a full tender, and it was, therefore, plaintiff’s duty to tender the whole amount that was due under the agreement; but if the defendant kept out of plaintiff’s way after agreeing to meet him, he cannot take away plaintiff’s rights by doing so; and, if one should refuse the tender on the ground that it was too late, before you produce the money to make the tender, he would afterwards not be permitted to say that the amount was not a true one. In this case the defendant denies that any tender whatever was made, and you must determine that fact under the evidence.</p>

The jury also found that a proper and legal tender of the amount due to the defendant had been made by the plaintiff, and that the defendant had fraudulently and wilfully refused to convey the property as covenanted by him. There was evidence of the value of the Ohio farms. In the first agreement that value was fixed by the parties at $76,300. The tax assessments were upwards of $12,000, presumably as unproductive farm lands.

No evidence was given on the trial as to the value of the property, and the conduct of the parties shows that the value of the farms fixed in the first agreement was understood to be speculative, “ an exaggerated swap.” Whatever may be the rule in other states, there is no uncertainty in this state, as to the measure of damages on a refusal to convey, under the facts of this case. The plaintiff at most was entitled to recover only damages equal to the loss actually sustained by the non-fulfilment of the contract: Burr v. Todd, <a href="/pa/41/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="41 Pa. 206" data-case-ids="480072" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0206-01">41 Pa. 206</a>; Meason v. Kaine, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20Pa.%20339" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="63 Pa. 339">63 Pa. 339</a>. The case of Jack v.

Hertzog, <a href="/pa/34/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="34 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="417991" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0418-01">34 Pa. 418</a>; Ewing v.

As the plaintiff never paid anything for the farms, and as there was no fraud in the making of the agreement to convey them for the sum of $6,000, the damages were to be recovered only on the rule laid down by the trial judge.</p>

They were made more than nine months apart in time; each is complete in itself and neither contains any reference to the other; even the lands which are the subjects of them are prima facie not the same, for, though in the same counties, they are described in the first as “ four farms containing seven hundred and sixty-three acres,” and in the second as “ the several premises containing in the aggregate seven hundred and forty-seven- and two thirds acres, more or less,” and finally they were valued in the first at $76,300, and in the second at $6,000. If it be conceded, as probably the fact was, that the lands referred to were the same in both, even then the learned judge might well say that it was “ incredible ” that the two agreements were intended to be but one and the same.</p>

      <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>It being thus clear as a matter of law that the two agreements were separate and distinct, the evidence presented to show that they were in fact intended to be one, was entirely lacking in the essentials of clearness, precision, and convincing force, necessary to reform a written instrument. But this need not be discussed, as in the entire absence of any ground laid of fraud, accident or mistake, in the making of either agreement, parol evidence was not admissible at all to affect their legal construction.</p>
    <p id="b33-5" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[196,830,1175,199]]]'>The only question remaining is the measure of damages, and we have gone carefully through the bill of exceptions to see if there was any evidence upon which the jury should have been allowed to go beyond a nominal verdict. We do not find any.</p>
    <p id="b33-6" data-blocks='[["BL_33.6",33,[196,1036,1178,601]]]'>Two items only could be pointed out by the counsel for plaintiff in his argument. First, the valuation put on the farms by the parties themselves in the first agreement. This agreement however was one for a trade. It dealt in very large nominal figures, of which only a trifling part was to be cash, the rest being a miscellaneous assortment of merchandise, and the Ohio farms, at a valuation of seventy-six thousand three hundred dollars. Yet, when in the second agreement the parties come to a cash valuation they reduce the figures to six thousand dollars. It is plain that the first agreement affords no competent evidence of the cash value of the Ohio farms.</p>
    <p id="b33-7" data-blocks='[["BL_33.7",33,[200,1656,1175,613]]]'>Secondly, it is argued that the tax bills were evidence of value. We cannot so regard them. They had none of the essential elements of evidence. They were not under oath, were not shown to have been based on the actual cash value, or made by a person competent to make such valuation; nor, lastly, were they admissions against interest, which might dispense with the necessity of an oath. They were not offered as evidence of value, but to show certain expenditures to which defendant had been put and which plaintiff’s tender should have covered, and they were admitted against plaintiff’s objection, for that purpose alone. The resort to them as evidence of value is an afterthought which cannot be successful.</p>
