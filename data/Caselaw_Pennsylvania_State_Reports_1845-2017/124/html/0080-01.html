Bladen, a literary lady, to whom he rehearsed the history of his gift, and said to her “that he had engaged Mr. Keyser to write a history of the State House, the importation of the bells, and the things connected with them, and. his father and mother — I think he mentioned that particularly, but that he wanted some more elaboration about his personal family, and that possibly I could do it; .... . then he said to me would I go down and see Mr. Keyser, and see how cheaply I could get this work from him.....I went down and called on Mr. Keyser.....I went back. Mr. Seybert was still in his parlor. I said to him, ‘ Why, Mr. Keyser says he would not give you that for less than $2,000; that is his lowest price for it.’ Mr. Seybert said, 4 Oh, no, no, no; the occasion for it has gone by; go back and see him again, he will give it for a few hundred.’ I then observed that he was weak.

Referring specially to the testimony of Mrs. Bladen, the adjudication proceeded:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b106-4" data-blocks='[["BL_106.5",106,[245,573,1188,510]]]'>This testimony, in the opinion of the auditing judge, completely negatives the idea of the existence, at the time to which it relates, of any obligation on the part of the decedent to pay for the work done by Mr. Keyser. Mrs. Bladen was sent, not to bring about a settlement of a claim, but to purchase a work which could not have been sold by the author if he had written it simply as an employee; and his refusal to sell at less than $2,000 is inconsistent with the idea that the decedent was already bound to pay for his services what they were reasonably worth.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b106-5" data-blocks='[["BL_106.6",106,[242,1090,1191,862]]]'>The decedent was a man of large fortune, and any obliga-tion on his part could readily be enforced. So far as appears there was at no time while he lived an assertion of liability or a. demand upon him by the claimant. It would seem that the work was in shape for publication at least as early as 1882, and possibly a year or two before that. If the decedent was to pay for the composition and writing of the book, the manuscript and copyright would of course become his; but the manuscript was not tendered to him in his lifetime or to his executors after his death. The evidence of Mr. Edwin E. Simpson, another witness for the claimant, shows that as long ago as 1878 or 1879 the decedent refused to recognize the right of the claimant to call upon him for the payment of expenses contracted in the preparation of the book ; while the following receipt given by Mr. Simpson as agent for the claimant establishes affirmatively the fact that the author was regarded as the owner:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b107-5" data-blocks='[["BL_107.5",107,[167,730,1183,561]]]'>Before confirmation of the adjudication, the hearing was opened upon the petition of the claimant, for cause therein set forth, whereupon the claimant showed that on January 17, 1874, his counsel had addressed a note to the executors of Mr. Seybert stating that he held the claimant’s demand against the estate for literary services, which were fully described, and that a few days thereafter the counsel for the executors had called and stated that payment of the demand was refused and that they would accept service of a writ. Other testimony was presented sufficiently appearing in the supplemental adjudication by Penrose, J., which was as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b107-6" data-blocks='[["BL_107.6",107,[167,1300,1181,199]]]'>Upon the testimony submitted, apart from the question of the propriety of considering it at all, under all the circumstances of the case, the auditing judge sees no reason for changing the views expressed in the original adjudication.</p>

The witnesses simply say, perhaps with more emphasis than when they first testified, that the claimant was employed at the instance of the decedent, and that there was a contract between them with regard to the writing and publication of the work in question. But they are no more able to tell the terms of that contract now than they were six months ago, and it is precisely here that the difficulty expressed in the adjudication lay. There is still nothing to show “ that the decedent was to pay for and become the proprietor of the work, or that the compensation of the claimant was to be derived from any other source than sales made after the publication.” “ And claims against the estates of dead men, not asserted while the alleged debtor is living, ought to be supported by the clearest and most convincing evidence.

But the fact of the agreement was promptly and emphatically denied by Mr. Seybert, who, as far as appears, took no notice of the suggestion in the letter of January 18th, that the question should be referred to competent arbitrators. He lived for more than four years after this, viz., until March 3, 1883. He was possessed of large means, and was abundantly able to respond to any claim that might be recovered against him; but during all this period no steps were taken to establish such claim, and each day, as the recollection of the centennial celebration became dimmed, the value of the work and the chances of deriving profits from its publication grew less and less. The inaction of the claimant while the decedent lived, though it may not now estop him, is cogent evidence of his own belief that his claim was incapable of enforcement. If the arrangement was as alleged by the decedent, the obligation has been fully discharged; if, as asserted by the claimant, the time for publication has been suffered to pass before the completion of the work, the profits would have been nothing and the damage to be recovered, therefore, merely nominal.</p>

The auditing judge is of opinion, irrespective of the plea of the statute of limitations now set up on behalf of the estate of the decedent, that this cannot be done ; nor if done, can it avail the claimant, there being no evidence that profits would have been earned by the publication of the work. The existence of such a contract, which would have been fatal to the claim as asserted in the original demand upon the executors, in the petition upon which the citation for an account was issued, and in its presentation to the auditing judge when the matter first came before him, was wholly ignored and kept out of sight.

It is not pretended that the obligation of the decedent arose from any instrument under seal; and, unless something has occurred to relieve the claim from the bar of the statute of limitations, it is clear, whatever may have been its original merits, there can be no recovery at the present time. There is nothing, in the opinion of the auditing judge, which arrests the running of the statute. The decedent lived for over four years after the cause of action arose. About ten months after his death, notice of the claim was given to the executors, who promptly denied any liability and, through their counsel, invited the bringing of a suit at law and offered to accept service of a writ. The course thus suggested was not adopted, the claimant preferring, but without any encouragement or inducement whatever on the part of the executors, or their counsel, to come into the Orphans’ Court when an account should be filed. It was said that this was because, as the law was then understood, it was not supposed that the statute of limitations could have any operation. It may be that suitors who, relying upon the doctrine of McClintock’s Appeal and the cases which followed it, had forborne to proceed against the estates of decedents, would, after the change announced in Yorks’ App., <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>, be afforded a reasonable time, under the principle of Menges v.

That the work was performed, and that it was worth the sum demanded was not seriously controverted. The difficulty in the case lies deeper.</p>

The court below, however, has distinctly found that the relation of the parties was not that of <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>employer and employee; that there was no contract by which the decedent was to pay for and become the proprietor of the work, but that on the contrary, the appellant's compensation was to be derived solely from the profits arising from sales thereof after publication. We will not review the evidence in detail by which this result was reached. We must accept the findings of the court upon questions of fact, as we have repeatedly said, unless error is clearly made to appear. This has not been done, nor do I see how it could have been in view of appellant’s statement of the contract as contained in his letter to Mr. Seybert of January 17,1879. The letter was as follows:</p>
    <p id="b114-5" data-blocks='[["BL_114.5",114,[258,942,448,32]]]'>“Mr. Henry Seybert :</p>

I am still willing to do so, and would be pleased to hear from you at your earliest convenience, if the names of these gentlemen meet your approval.”</p>
    <p id="b114-9" data-blocks='[["BL_114.8",114,[254,1692,1186,601]]]'>This is an entirely different contract from the one set up in the Orphans’ Court, and precludes a recovery upon a quantum meruit. An action would indeed lie upon the contract proved, but its breach would be the refusal of the decedent to publish tire book. A claim for this breach might have been made in the Orphans’ Court, but it was not, nor was there any evidence by which the damages could have been measured.- Speaking for myself, I do not see why a work upon such a subject, written by a gentleman of the appellant’s known literary ability, should not prove of general interest and command a ready sale, if too much prominence is not given to the decedent and his bells.</p>

There is, however, another difficulty, equally serious, in the way of the appellant. The appel<a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>lees set up the statute of limitations. Mitch more than six years had elapsed from the completion of the work and the presentation of the claim in the Orphans’ Court. Mr. Seybert flatly repudiated it in 1879. Thus the matter rested until his death in 1883. After that event a demand was made in writing on his executors for the payment of the sum of $3,000 as compensation for writing the book. This was on January 17, 1884. The executors refused to recognize the claim, and offered to accept service of a writ. Nothing further was done until the citation was asked for in 1887, after which the claim was presented to the Orphans’ Court for adjudication. It will thus bo seen that for at least eight years the claim was ripe for suit and was all that time repudiated. The statute commenced to run not later than 1879. It was not stopped by the death of the decedent as all the authorities show. Was it stopped by the demand upon the executors in 1884, a demand not recognized by them and not followed up by any aggressive measure until 1887 ? It is not pretended that a mere demand upon Mr. Seybert in his lifetime would toll the statute. Was a demand upon his executors after his death of any greater effect? If so, it is an anomaly.</p>
    <p id="b115-5" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[161,1450,1178,199]]]'>It was urged that Yorks’ App., <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>, sustains the contention of the appellant in this respect, and that a mere demand upon the executor tolls the statute. If this be so Yorks’ Appeal needs amendment.</p>

But the first opinion is not Yorks’ Appeal, it is only a part; and the least important part of it. In the first we tried to avoid overruling McClintoek’s Appeal, and the line of cases following it. Speaking for myself, I felt averse to reversing the opinion of so eminent a jurist as the late Chief Justice Black. It was this feeling which prevented our going as far in the first decision as we felt the law would justify. Subsequent reflection satisfied us that it was a mistake to temporize, and we applied the knife. We intended to cut this judicial excrescence out of our system of law, and we are not convinced that we did not succeed. The language quoted by the appellant from the first opinion is as much overruled by the second as was McClintoek’s Appeal itself, and the broad principle was distinctly <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>asserted that the statute of limitations may be set up in the Orphans’ Court precisely as in a court of law. Nor can the statute be tolled by anything short of a suit at law or what is its equivalent in the Orphans’ Court. A mere demand upon an executor is not such equivalent and it does not toll the statute. This is as plain as I can make it.</p>
