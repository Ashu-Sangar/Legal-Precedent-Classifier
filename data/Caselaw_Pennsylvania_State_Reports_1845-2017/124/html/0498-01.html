The articles provide they “ shall each receive one half of the profits and sustain one half of the losses of the business.” They are to share equally the losses in the business. The |5,000 capital was invested in the business, debts were contracted, and to pay these, the plant, machinery, book accounts, and all other assets were swept away. They lost 85,000 in the business; this was a money loss. The defendant claims lie is only to share in the losses resulting from bad debts and like misfortunes. These are the very losses he is called upon for contribution; if he pays his share of the losses from bad debts, losses on sales, losses on goods manufactured and losses from kindred misfortunes, the capital will not be impaired. If each partner pays over one half of these business losses, the capital will remain intact.</p>

The error of the court below lay in not apprehending clearly what constituted the capital of the firm. The capital consisted not merely of §5,000 in money, but of §5,000 in money, or the cash capital, and, in addition, the skill and judgment of Emerick, when that skill was actually applied to the affairs of the firm. It then represented money and money’s worth, in an equal degree with coin or currency. In the construction of a written contract, the aim must be to consider it with reference to a reasonable intention of the parties, and not to follow a strict construction which would work inequitable results, if the language of the contract is not inconsistent with an equitable <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>construction fair to both parties: 2 Whart. on Cont., § 641; Com.

The court below also erred in considering the fact that Emerick was to receive a salary, as affecting a construction as to what his share of the losses should be, under the other terms of the contract. Nothing in the case stated shows whether Emerick did or did not receive full payment. The clause by which Moir agrees that Emerick shall draw $1,000 per annum, in monthly payments, simply amounts to an agreement that his share of the profits should not be less than $1,000 per annum. Any surplus put to his credit, it is fair to presume, would have been at the risk of the business; but as he was given as a partner no part of the money contributed by Moir, and no part of the assets purchased by that money, he should not be held liable to Moir for the loss of money or assets.

But if his annual dividend of the profits should equal $1,000 per annum, this sum should be charged to him in the division of the profits ; and, if Emerick’s portion of the profits should exceed $1,000 per annum, the excess should be funded into capital, belonging exclusively to Emerick, “at the end of each year of the term of this copartnership, until the amount so placed to his credit equals the amount of cash capital contributed by the said Roscoe K.

The partnership agreement expressly stipulates that each partner shall receive one half of the profits and sustain one half of the losses of the business. There were no profits to divide, but there was a loss of $5,000 in money. In point of fact Moir has paid the whole of this loss, because he is the only person who contributed any money to the firm, and all the money has been lost. Emerick has paid no part of the loss. He contributed his skill and labor, as he agreed to do, but for this he was entitled to be paid $1,000 per year. If there had been profits in excess of this, sufficient to enable him to contribute $5,000 in money out of his share of those profits, he was bound to do so. But this was never done. The business only continued for one year and nine months, and Emerick never performed his part of the agreement by contributing his skill and labor for five years, as he had agreed to do. There was no equality therefore in the performance of the terms of the partnership by the two partners, so far as the question of contribution is concerned. Moir performed the whole of his part, and Emerick performed none of his, in the matter of raising capital. His actual service was paid for during the time it was rendered, by force of the agreement that it should be paid. Whether it was actually paid is immaterial in the mere interpretation of the contract. It was his right to have it, and that is sufficient. In actual result, therefore, the firm lost -$5,000 in money while engaged in business, and the whole of this has been paid by Moir. Emerick agreed to pay half the losses and he has paid none. Clearly he must pay it in this action if the contract is to be enforced. The case of Yohe v. Barnet, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 81" data-case-ids="1854605" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0081-01">3 W. &amp; S. 81</a>, is entirely in point. There, two of the partners contributed money and the third contributed nothing but service. It was not clear under the written and unsigned memorandum what he was to contribute, but it was perfectly clear that the profits and losses were to be equally divided, and we held he was bound to pay his share of the losses. In delivering the opinion Kennedy, J., <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>said: “Now it must be observed here that the profits and losses are coupled together and to be shared in like manner. That the profits, if they consisted of money, were to be divided and shared in money equally between the three will not, I think, be denied; and why shall not the losses, if they consist of money, be divided and shared equally also in like manner, that is, in money, between the three ? ” The theory that Emerick is to be exonerated from all liability for the losses, because ho agreed to contribute skill and labor as against capital, is entirely untenable in view of the facts of the case. He never made the contribution. Even if he had done so, however, for the whole five years, that alone would not have been sufficient, under the agreement, to equalize him with Moir, unless there were profits enough actually realized to his share to produce the same money contribution that was made by Moir. We think the learned court below was entirely right in entering judgment for the plaintiff on the case stated.</p>
