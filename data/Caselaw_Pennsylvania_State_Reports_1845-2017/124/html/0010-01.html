Their right to take thus depends upon a contingency. The gift is not direct to the grandchildren unconditionally, but upon the condition that they reach a prescribed age. The vesting is consequently postponed, and if this be beyond the period allowed by law, the estate in remainder thus attempted to be created is void. The remainder to be valid must surely take effect within twenty-one years after the termination of the life estate: Davenport v. Harris, <a href="/grant/3/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Grant 164" data-case-ids="229131" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0164-01">3 Gr. 164</a>.

It could not be ascertained whether they would inherit any portion of their parent’s share until they lived to attain the age of twenty-five years. And thus the parent’s share might possibly be withheld from distribution almost the whole period of twenty-five years. This result it must be conceded would be a palpable violation of the rule against perpetuities. The gift in this instance is to a class, all the grandchildren, their parents being living; and the members of this class cannot be ascertained within the limits of perpetuity. In such case, the gift is void : Leake v. Robinson, 2 Mer. 363, and other eases cited in Theobald on Wills, 436.

But where the gift is a unit because to a class, its validity will depend upon the eligibility of every member of that class, prospective as well as present, and possible as well as actual, to take under the rule. The reason, as given in Leake v. Robinson, 2 Mer. 362, is the difficulty of determining what would have been the intention of the testator, if he had been advised of the existence of the rule; whether, for instance, he would have left out after-born grandchildren rather than abridge the period of vesting at twenty-' <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>five, or have postponed it only until twenty-one, and so have included all who should have been born before that time; and because, where the gift operates by way of executory devise, the devise itself being an infringement of common law rules, and allowable only on condition that it shall not exceed established limits, the gift is wholly void if it violates that condition at all.</p>

Robinson was followed in a long line of cases, many of which are cited in a note to § 374 of Gray on .Perpetuities, and it is authority to this extent on both sides of the Atlantic. But the rule is not infringed where the time for vesting falls within the prescribed limits, however greatly the time for payment may transcend them; and it is to that point that the inquiry must be directed. It weighs for nothing that all of the grandchildren happened to have been born in the lifetime of the testator, that all have reached the age fixed by his will, and that there is, moreover, no reasonable likelihood of an accession to their number. Unless by the terms of the will they must all have taken within the period allotted by the rule, the accidental circumstance that they came in fact within it, will not validate a limitation which was void at the moment it was written. The question, we think, is answered in favor of vesting by several provisions in the will and in the codicil. In the latter the reference by the testator to certain of his grandchildren would seem to preclude the idea that he was thinking of them as a class. His designation of his four grandchildren, the children of his daughter Anna, was as distinctively individual as if he had named them seriatim. The gift, then, was to several persons answering to one description, and its amount to one of those persons was not affected by the existence or non-existence of the others : Boughton v. James, 1 Coll. 26; Storrs v. Benbow, 3 DeG. M. &amp; G. 390; Wilkinson v. Duncan, 30 Beav. 111. It is more important, however, because it recognizes the vesting of the interests during the lifetime of the parent. At her death and solely for the protection of the grandchildren, he directs that their shares shall not be paid to them if their father shall be living, but that such payment shall await his death. This individual reference to the members of a class is made, it is true, only to the issue of one child, but it is the key to his inten<a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>tion respecting the other children. He foresaw that, as to the portions of the children of that daughter, it would be prudent to postpone payment until the death of the father; but he made no distinction between the vesting of those portions and the shares of the other grandchildren. All were to vest at the same time. If, then, he declared in express terms that the then living issue of one child were the only parties who could succeed to her share, and if all the grandchildren took together, how can it be said that the legatees were not ascertained? .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b42-5" data-blocks='[["BL_42.5",42,[255,887,1188,1321]]]'>The conclusive answer is found, however, in the limitation over to the testator’s surviving children upon the death of a child without issue living. Under the authorities, the effect of that limitation was to show that the attainment by the grandchildren to the age of twenty-five years, was not a condition precedent to the vesting of their interests, but was simply a designation of the time at which those interests were to be paid. This suspending of possession did not affect the integrity of the gift, and could not defeat its vesting: 1 Jar-man on Wills, 252-3. In Bree v. Perfect, 1 Coll. 128, the gift over was to such of the children of B., the life tenant, as should be living at the time of her death, as they attained twenty-one ; but if B. should die without leaving issue, then to C.; and it was held that a chiíd of B., who died after her under twenty-one, took a vested estate. See also Ashhurst’s Est., 17 W. N. 538. In Smith’s App., <a href="/pa/88/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="88 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1061267" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0492-01">88 Pa. 492</a>, where the appointment by the daughter was to a class wdiich might have included members born after the death of the donor of the power, whose will and that of the donee were to be read as one instrument, there was no such limitation over, and the decision which was rendered is inapplicable here. That the limitation over converts -what, without it, would have been a condition precedent into a condition subsequent, see Edwards v. Hammond, 3 Lev. 132; Jarman on Wills, 809.

The validity of such a gift is to be tested by possibilities, not by actual results. Unless tbe limitation be such that it must, inevitably, vest within a life or lives in being and twenty-one years, etc., after tbe death of tbe testator, it fails in its inception and is bad altogether; and, if to a class, as to some members of which it might possibly not vest until after tbe prescribed period, it is void as to all if the shares cannot be defined or separated, as they cannot be where all who are intended to take must be considered in estimating them. Nor would tbe difficulty be overcome by the limitation over in the event of the death of a child of the testator without leaving “a child or issue of a deceased child,” withoiit reference to the age of such child. When it is doubtful whether the time appointed applies to the vesting' or merely to the payment, a gift over in the event of the death of the legatee before such time may imply a prior vesting, and so resolve the doubt: Bree v. Perfect, 1 Coll. 128; Finch v. Lane, 10 Eq. 501; Phipp v. Ackers, 3 Cl. &amp; F. 691; Ashhurst’s Eat., 17 W. N. 538; but this effect cannot be given where tbe attainment of the prescribed age forms part of tbe original description of tbe legatee: Smitli on Executory Interests, § 366 ; Theobald on Wills, 268; Bull v. Pritchard, 1 Russ. 213. That the limitation takes effect by way of remainder after a prior life estate is immaterial. A legal remainder in lands, whether vested or contingent, is not- affected by the doctrine of perpetuities; but this principle does not apply to personalty, as to which all bequests of future interests, whether with or without the intervention of a particular estate, are regarded, not as remainders, but as executory bequests: Gray on Perp., §§ 325, 326, 90, 117, 321.</p>

It may refer to the death of the testator and mean that the estate is to go to such grandchildren as at that time have attained or who shall attain, prior to the death of their parent (the time fixed for distribution), the prescribed age; or it may refer to the time of distribution, and intend only the grandchildren who have then or who shall thereafter attain such age. In the latter case, the gift will fail for remoteness and a partial intestacy will result. The former is therefore, under well-settled principles, to be adopted as the true meaning. “ It is a general rule,” says Sir Edward Coke, “ whensoever the words of a deed or of the parties without a deed may have a double intendment, and one standeth with law and right, and the other is wrongful and against law, the intendment that standeth with law is to be taken: ” Co. Litt. 42 b. Where the instrument, taken as a whole, is ambiguously expressed, or if it contain'conflicting and contradictory clauses, the construction which will make it valid will be preferred to that which will defeat it or lead to an intestacy: Williams on Ex., 1340; Ashhurst’s Estate, supra. Or, as it is expressed by Prof. Gray, “ The fact that a <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>provision would be too remote if construed in a certain way is a reason for supposing tliat it was not intended to be construed in tliat way, which although it cannot avail against a clear form of words may well be held to govern when the expression is ambiguous: ” Gray on Perpetuities, § 633.</p>

It is true, in contemplation of law, other grandchildren may be born hereafter; the fact that a woman is past the age of child-bearing not being considered in determining whether a gift is void for remoteness or not: Jee v. Audley, 1 Cox 324; Sayer’s Trust, 6 Eq. 319; but in applying the rule, the state of things existing at the death of the testator and not at the date of the will is to be looked at: Vanderplank v. King, 3 Hare 17; Cattlin v. Brown, 11 Hare 382; Peard v. Kekewich, 15 Beav. 173; and the gift to grandchildren living at his death will not fail unless so blended with gifts to others not then born as to be incapable of ascertainment and severance. The codicil, changing the will in this respect, provides that the grandchildren shall take per capita; and as they successively attain the age at which they become entitled to possession, their shares are to be determined, not by the number who may ultimately become so entitled, but by the number of grandchildren, etc., then living, without respect to age. The interests being thus severable, the validity of the gift to those born in the lifetime of the testator is not affected by its invalidity as to others born there<a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>after: Griffith v. Pownall, 18 Sim. 393; Cattlin v. Brown, 11 Hare 372; Wilson v. Wilson, 4 Jur., N. S., 1076; Storrs v. Benbow, 2 My. &amp; K. 46, etc., etc. It is immaterial that the will does not define the amount in dollars, or say that the shares shall be a certain fixed proportion, as one tenth, one twentieth, etc., if a method by which it is to be ascertained is pointed out and can be resorted to within the requisite limit. Id certum est quod certum reddi potest. “ Though the amount of each legacy is dependent upon the number of legatees, yet if the number must be determined within the required limits, the gift is separable: ” Gray on Perpetuities, § 389. The principle, of course, is the same where, as here, the amount is dependent not upon the number of legatees, but upon the number of individuals in being at a certain date within the limits. “ The cases as well as the reason of the tiling show that where, on a gift to a class, the number of the shares is definitely fixed within the time required by the rule against perpetuities, the question of remoteness is to be considered with reference to each share separately: ” Gray on Perpetuities, § 391.

If vested, the attempted withholding of the beneficial enjoyment after the legatees have attained the age of twenty-one years, is without recognized legal purpose, and void for repugnancy, and the right of possession will be accelerated accordingly: 1 Jarman on Wills, 252; Gray on Perpetuities, § 205.</p>

Taking the provisions of the will by themselves, without the modifications effected by the codicil, it seems very clear that the grandchildren were to succeed immediately, and not at any subsequent period, to beneficial interests in the shares of deceased parents who were children. The words used show that the testator anticipated that some of his grandchildren would be over twenty-five, when the life estates terminated, and to them, if that old, his gift in remainder is as direct and positive as language can make it. Not one of the life estates has terminated, and all the remaindermen are over the required age. There is no expression to indicate that upon the death of any one of his children, the grandchildren should not have the present use of the income. When a legacy is given to a grandchild, or one towards whom the testator stood in loco parentis, though payable at a future day, it will bear interest from one year after the death, by way of maintenance: Bowman’s App., <a href="/pa/34/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="34 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="418025" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0019-01">34 Pa. 19</a>; Cooper v.

The primary intent of the codicil was to change the succession of the grandchildren from the per stirpes system to the per capita system; to make the grandchildren direct donees of the testator; and, together with the change of distribution, there is a clear intention to define the rights of the grandchildren and to ascertain their separate and respective shares of capital immediately upon the death of each of the children successively. Where a bequest is to each of the members of a <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>class, or the language used indicates that the bequest was designed for the individual members of a class, it will be held to create a present vested interest, which will not be affected by any members of the class being disqualified by remoteness: Eckles v.

Ford, 7 W. N. 532. The limitation over to the issue of such grandchildren as may die in the lifetime of their parents, or before attaining twenty-five, is a powerful argument in favor of treating the legacies to the grandchildren as vested: Newport v.

On the other hand, we have a rule of property, founded upon the highest considerations of public policy, and too firmly imbedded in our system of jurisprudence to be disturbed save by an act of assembly, which requires that all future estates limited upon a life estate, which are not sure to take effect within twenty-one years and the usual fraction, after the determination of the life estate, are void in their creation: Davenport v. Harris, <a href="/grant/3/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="3 Grant 164" data-case-ids="229131" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0164-01">3 Gr. 164</a>. Where the language of a will leaves us in doubt whether this rule has been transgressed, we may well resolve the doubt in favor of vesting, especially when, upon a careful examination of the whole will, we may reasonably infer such to have been the intent of the testator. But where the language employed is not ambiguous and is clearly transgressive of the rule, it is useless to grope after a supposed intent of the testator. The <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>rule itself must be sustained in all its integrity or abandoned. We prefer the former course.</p>

It was said by Lord Mansfield in Baldwin v. Karver, Cowp. 309, that “ the point to be determined in gifts of this character, however general in their terms, is, when does the legacy vest?” In some instances it may be upon the death of the testator, in others upon the death of the first taker, and in yet other instances it may be upon the happening of a contingency. In either event it is the time of vesting which determines who shall take. In a note to Andrews v. Pattington, 3 Br. C. C. 404, Mr. Eden arranges the cases in three classes as follows:</p>

And if the gift is to a class, and it is void as. to any of the class, it is void as to all. Authority is scarcely needed for so familiar a proposition. It is sufficient to refer to Leake v. Robinson, 2 Mer. 363; Porter v. Fox, 6 Sim. 485; Blagrove v. Hancock, 16 Sim. 371; Dodd v. Wake, 8 Sim. 615; Newman v. Newman, 10 Sim. 51; Vawdry v.

    <p id="b55-5" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[160,466,1180,1230]]]'>We regard it as equally clear that the time when the gift must vest is the death of the life-tenants respectively. There is not a word in the will from which any legal inference can be drawn that the remainder was to vest in the grandchildren at the death of the testator. The language is: “ And upon the decease of either one of my said children, and successively of each of them, then as respects one equal fourth part of the corpus or principal of my residuary estate, to and for the only proper use of his or her child, or of all of his or her children,” etc. The word “then” in this connection is evidently not used as an adverb of time; it merely means “in that case.” But if we treat it as an adverb of time, it evidently refers to the death of the life-tenant. That is the period the testator is speaking of, and the gift is to all the grandchildren, whether born during the lifetime of the testator or at any time after-wards. A child born the day before the death of the life-tenant would come within the description. Moreover, we are in no doubt that such was the intent of the testator. Why should he cut off all grandchildren born after his death? They would have been as near to him in blood as those born during his life, and we cannot assume without reason, and in the face of the clear language of his will, that he intended to deprive after-born grandchildren of all share of his estate. Moreover, the gift to the grandchildren was to them as a class.</p>

Tate, <a href="/pa/25/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="25 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="975856" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0249-01">25 Pa. 249</a>, it was held that a gift to “my son Robert’s children, he and them enjoying the benefits of it whilst he lives,” gave a life estate to Robert, remainder to his children, and that children born after the <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>death, of the testator were entitled to share in tbe estate. This is in accordance with the rule laid down by tbe best text writers, and with many of the English and American cases. In the leading case of Leake v. Robinson, supra, it was said: “Whenever a testator gives to a parent for life, remainder to his children, he does mean to include all the children such parent may at any time have.” The doctrine was finally established in the House of Lords in Boughton v. Boughton, 1 H. of L. 406. See also Hall v.

The gift is to those “ who shall have attained or shall attain the age of twenty-five years.” It is unnecessary to discuss the long line of cases in which the time of vesting and the time of payment, and the effect of such words as “when,” “at,” or “if,” are discussed. Whenever possible the courts have held that these words refer to tbe time of payment, in order that the estate may be held to be vested. But in all such cases there has been some previous gift, express or implied, by which the narty was to have some benefit from the gift prior to the time fixed for payment; such as the payment of interest, a provision for maintenance, or other matters of a like nature. And it appears to be well settled that unless there be some gift, express or implied, in order to so apply the word, there is no vesting until the time of payment, and the person to receive must be ascertained at that time. “ A legacy shall be deemed vested or contingent, just as the time shall have been annexed to the gift or the payment of it. And where there is no separate and antecedent gift, which is independent of tbe direction and time for payment, the legacy is contingent: ” Moore v. Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.%20403" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="9 W. 403">9 W. 403</a>. In Hawkins on Wills, 241 — 2, it is said that the nice distinctions 'respecting vesting and payment do not <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>arise, “ where the attainment of the given age is made part of the description of the devisee; as if the devise be to all and every the children of A. who shall attain twenty-one, or to such children of A. as shall attain twenty-one, with a gift over on attaining that age.....Until they have attained that age no one completely answers the description which the testator has given of those who are to be devisees under liis will; and, therefore, there is no person in whom the estate can vest.....It is prima facie contingent notwithstanding a gift over in default of a child or children who should fulfil the required condition.”</p>

A grandchild who dies before arriving at twenty-five takes no interest; nothing which he can dispose of by will or otherwise; nothing which can descend to his heirs. It is true there is a gift over to the issue of a grandchild dying before reaching the specified time, but in such case the issue takes not as heir or next of kin of his parent, but as the devisee of Thomas Williamson. Nor is there any provision for the payment of interest to or for maintenance of a grandchild prior to his or her arriving at the age of twenty-five years. The provision in regard to age is descriptive of the persons who shall take under the will, for no one can tell until that time arrives who will be entitled. The gift to each grandchild is contingent upon his arriving at twenty-five years of age. In our own case of McBride v. Smyth, <a href="/pa/54/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="54 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="1006287" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0245-01">54 Pa. 245</a>, this subject was thoroughly discussed by Mr. Justice Strong, who said: “The first question raised by the bill and answer is, whether the children of Francis McBride, the testator, took under his will a vested interest in the land described, at his death, or whether whatever interest any of them took under the will, first vested when the youngest child attained the age of twenty-one years ? In regard to this we have no doubt. Tbe testator devised all the residue of his estate, including the property described in the bill as sold to the defendant, to trustees, to hold until his youngest child who might then be living should attain the age of twenty-one years, upon certain defined trusts, and upon the youngest of his children who might be living attaining the age of twenty-one years, he gave, subject to a provision for his widow, all his said <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>(residuary) estate, real, personal, and mixed, to such of his children as might be living at that time, their heirs, etc. This is not a mere postponement of the time of enjoyment. It is a selection of individuals from a class to be donees of a right; a description of persons, not a regulation of the interest given. It is impossible to admit that a gift to such a number of persons as may meet a defined description, is a gift to all the persons, whether they meet the description or not. The rule of legal construction, as well as the testamentary intent in such cases, is well stated in Smith on Executory Interests, 281. It is this: ‘ Where real or personal estate is devised or bequeathed to such children, or to such child or individuals, as shall attain a given age, or the children who shall sustain a certain character, or do a particular act, or be living at a certain time, without any distinct gift to the whole class, preceding such restrictive description, so that the uncertain event forms part of the description of the devisee or legatee, the interest so devised is contingent on account of the person. For, until the age is attained, the character is sustained, or the act is performed, the person is unascertained; there is no person answering the description of the person who is to take as devisee or legatee.’ If, then, we are to seek for the intention of the testator in the language of his will, we must conclude he gave no vested interest in his residuary estate to any of his children, that the devises were contingent and became vested only, when the youngest child living attained the age of twenty-one years, in such children as were then in life.” This case has been frequently followed; one of the later cases is Mergenthaler’s App., 15 W. N. 441.</p>

We may concede the latter part of this proposition. This is not a question of the suspending of the possession, but of the <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>vesting of the interest. If vested, the matter of the suspending of the possession or enjoyment could be easily disposed of. The first part of the proposition is an argument in favor of vesting, but it lacks the conclusive character claimed for it. In a doubtful case it would be persuasive, but where the nature of the interest is clear it is entitled to but little weight. There is abundant authority, some of which has been already cited, that where the attainment of a certain age forms part of the original description of the devisee, the vesting is suspended until the attainment of that age, even though the limitation over is only to take effect in case of his death under that age without issue: Smith on Executory Interests, § 366. In Leake v. Robinson, supra, it was said, referring to the implication from the gift over: “When the vesting is so clearly and expressly postponed, it is in vain to infer from other expressions used without any reference to that object, that the testator did not conceive himself to have postponed the vesting.” In Davenport v. Harris, <a href="/grant/3/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="3 Grant 164" data-case-ids="229131" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0164-01">3 Gr. 164</a>, there was such a gift over, but the interest was held to bo contingent on reaching the prescribed age, and therefore void because too remote. In Seibert’s App., <a href="/pa/13/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="13 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="964927" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0501-01">13 Pa. 501</a>, there was a gift for life to a daughter, remainder to her children as they arrived at the age of twenty-one, with a gift over in case the daughter did not have any issue living at the time of her death, and it was held contingent, and a grand-daughter who died after her mother (the life-tenant) under the prescribed age, took nothing under the will. See also Bull v. Pritchard, 1 Russ. 213; Hunter v. Judd, 4 Sim. 555, Judd v. Judd, 3 Sim. 565; Ring v. Hardwicke, 2 Beav. 352; Pickford v. Brown, 2 Kay &amp; J. 426; Vawdry v. Geddes, 1 Russ. &amp; M. 203.</p>

We are unable to see the force of this proposition. The provision that they shall take per capita does not make them so, nor can we attribute such an effect to the direction that as the grandchildren respectively attain the age at which they become entitled to possession, their shares shall be determined, not by the number who may become so entitled, but by the number of grandchildren then living. The fact remains that the gift is to a class, and not to particular persons of a class, and whether a <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>member of the class can take, depends upon the contingency of his or her arriving at the age of twenty-five years.</p>

We must be careful not to strain the law so as to avoid this rule. It is founded upon a sound principle of public policy and should be rigidly enforced. We are constrained to hold that the gift to the grandchildren is void, and that the estate must be distributed to the children who have the life estates.</p>
