It appears that the corporate officers of said borough surveyed, laid out, enacted and ordained the streets and alleys in question, and, being about to open the same, and being unable to secure from the land-owners releases of damages, applied to the court for the appointment of a jury to assess these damages. The court thereupon, under the provisions of the act of 1856, appointed seven disinterested freeholders of said borough to view the premises described in the petition, and assess the damages, if any, sustained by the owners. The jury performed this duty, and reported to the court an assessment of damages sustained by certain land-owners, by reason of the taking of their land alone, for the use of said streets and alleys. These land-owners now ask the court to approve and confirm said report, and further, to make an order directing the county treasurer to pay the damages thus assessed, out of the comity stock. The county commissioners deny the right of the court to make such an order upon two grounds: (1) because the county is not liable to pay such damages for the opening of streets and alleys, in boroughs incorporated under or subject to what is known as the general borough law; and, (2) because the court has no power to make or enforce such an order.</p>

It is a fundamental principle of our government that private property shall not be taken for public use without fully compensating the owner. With this principle in view the legislature has, from time to time, provided that the owner of land taken for public roads shall be paid by the comity for all damages sustained by him. In the Newville Road Case, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%20177" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 W. 177">8 W. 177</a>, the court say: “ Whatever may he the nature of the loss or damage which the owner of the land sustains by the road passing through his land, he is to be compensated for it, and it cannot be pretended that occupying his land for a public road, and <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>lessening the value of the remainder, is not a damage to him. It is unnecessary to inquire what might be the right of the commonwealth to take the land of individuals for public highways without making compensation, under the original reservation of six acres in every hundred for roads, etc. It is sufficient to say that they have not chosen to do so, but have directed compensation to the owner, since the year 1700, for taking improved land.....and have awarded compensation for whatever damage or injury he may sustain.”</p>

It is also applicable to the payment of all damages occasioned by the laying out and opening of all streets in boroughs not incorporated under or subject to the provisions of the general law relating to boroughs.

    <p class="summary" id="b539-5" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[160,781,1185,924]]]'>It has been held that this act changes the mode of laying out streets in boroughs. Under it the borough authorities have the power to lay out and ordain streets without the intervention of a jury from the Court of Quarter Sessions. It is clear that, so far, the only change made in the act of 1836, by these provisions of the act of 1851, was as to the laying out of the streets. No change was made in the manner of opening them. It is true, as we have already said, that the third proviso of the third division of the 27th section provides that “ upon any amounts due or to become due by borough corporations for the purposes aforesaid, interest shall be allowed and paid from the date of the adjudication of said damages.” Tt is difficult to determine what this proviso means, but we think it is clear that it does not impose the payment of any damages for the opening of streets upon boroughs. Such a liability cannot be created by implication. It should be created by a clear and positive enactment, and especially is this the case where it has already been imposed directly upon the county.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b539-6" data-blocks='[["BL_539.6",539,[157,1713,1180,456]]]'>We are therefore justified in saying, that the provisions of the act of 1851 make no change in the road system of the commonwealth, except in the matter of laying out the same, and if the provisions of the act of 1836 are applicable to boroughs, the damages occasioned by the laying out of streets therein are still to bo paid by the county. The same act, however, further provides “ that all damages assessed, beyond the value of the land thus appropriated to public use, shall be paid by the corporation, and the jury shall separately assess the same.”</p>

What had theretofore been regarded as one subject for consideration by the jury, was hereafter to be divided into two subjects; the value of the land appropriated to public use was to be one object of assessment, and all darn-<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>ages beyond this was to be another object. The jury must separately assess these objects. The latter assessment must be paid by the borough. Who is to pay the other ? Upon this point the act is silent. It makes no provision for the payment of the same, and unless the land thus appropriated to public use is to be paid for under the provisions of the act of 1836, it cannot be paid for at all. The act does not impose this liability upon boroughs. In fact, the language used justifies us in saying that the legislature did not intend boroughs to pay this character of damage.</p>

The legislature did not intend it should be taken without compensation. Such legislation might be regarded as unconstitutional, under the ruling in Pittsburgh v. Scott, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pa.%20314" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Pa. 314">1 Pa. 314</a>, and would certainly be against the settled policy of the commonwealth from its early foundation, and is not to be established by inference alone.

L. 525 ? This act recognizes the right of the town council to open streets in boroughs, as well as lay them out, and also defines the method of assessing the damages resulting therefrom. It is to be by a jury of the freeholders of the borough, appointed by the proper Court of Quarter Sessions, and this jury is clothed with authority to make assessments for contribution upon all such properties as may be benefited, over and above all disadvantage. In these particulars it changed the act of 1836 and the act of 1851. It then provides that the jury shall report their proceedings specifically to the court, who may subsequently modify, approve, and confirm their report, and, upon it being so disposed of, the burgess and council may proceed to collect all such damages and assessments for contribution, in the same manner as other debts due boroughs are by law collectible.

    <p class="summary" id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[175,678,1182,1337]]]'>The act of 1836 prescribed a general system for laying out and opening roads and streets throughout the commonwealth, and provided for the assessment and payment of the damages occasioned thereby. All its provisions are as applicable to boroughs as they are to townships: Newville Road Case, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%20172" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 W. 172">8 W. 172</a>. The acts of 1851 and 1856 are interposed as a substitute for the act of 1836, as far as they go and no farther.

We are therefore of opinion that the county is the proper and only corporation liable to pay the damages occasioned to land owners in a borough incorporated by the court, by reason of the taking of their land for the use of streets and alleys. All damages beyond the value of the land thus appropriated to public use are to be paid by the borough. The damages assessed in the case in hand are for the taking of land alone.

The second inquiry is, has the Court of Quarter Sessions power to make and enforce an order against the county treasurer for the payment of such damages ? It might be regarded as better practice, to enforce in the Common Pleas the payment of the damages when ascertained. The parties here interested, however, have thought proper to ask the Court of Quarter Sessions to make and enforce such an order, and the only question now for our consideration is, can we do so ? The <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>confirmation of the award of the jury amounts to a final judgment of the court for the amount of the assessment. It cannot be questioned collaterally in any subsequent proceeding. The rights of all parties then become fixed; it is a judgment of the Court of Quarter Sessions for the payment of money. It is an inherent right in every court to enforce its own judgment, and the payment of such judgments is enforced by an order. Such orders have been issued by the Court of Quarter Sessions from the foundation of the government: Price v.

By the corporation. It is the corporation, in such case that proposes to take the property, and it is to the corporation, therefore, as we understand it, that this restriction and requirement of the statutes apply. The duty to pay attaches, of course, to the party proposing to take the property. “ The powers and duties of the corporation” are expressly “subject” to this provision of the statute; that is to say, the borough may not exercise the power without performing the duty enjoined. The 27th section further provides, “ that such streets, lanes, and alleys, footwalks and pavements shall not be opened for public use until the damages shall be liquidated, and upon any amounts due, or to become due, by borough corporations for the purposes aforesaid, interest shall be allowed and paid from the date of the adjudication of said damages.”</p>

In the case of a public road, laid out under an order of the Quarter Sessions, the county is responsible for the damages under the act of 1836, and there no such restriction exists; the road may be opened without prepayment of the damages; indeed, the assessment thereof cannot be made until the road is opened, and then proceedings may be instituted at any time within one year.</p>

The Court of Quarter Sessions has undoubted authority in such cases under the general road law of 1836 : Somerset and Stoystown Road, supra. In such cases, however, it is provided by the 27th section of the act of 1851, as follows : “ That every jury appointed to view, review, lay out, widen, straighten, or to vacate any road, or part of a road, in any borough in this commonwealth, shall have due reference to the town plot, herein authorized and directed, and to the general arrangement, plan, convenience, and advantage of the borough, and shall set forth-the facts fully in their report.”- Thus it is apparent that whilst, under the act of 1851, the corporate authorities have exclusive power to lay out, enact, and ordain streets, etc., within the corporate limits, the county, or the state rather, through the <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>instrumentality of the Quarter Sessions, may still proceed, under the act of 1886, to lay out and open roads through or into any part of any borough for public use.

The proviso applies generally to all roads, streets, etc., within the borough, whether laid out under the act of 1836, in the manner already stated, or under the act of 1851. The damages for laying out public roads are in general imposed on the county, and when laid out partly within a borough the same rule obtains; in such case the land of private owners is not taken by the municipality but by the state, and in the absence of any provision to that effect, there would be no liability on part of the municipality. But as the viewers in such cases are bound to have reference to the town plot and to the general arrangement, plan, convenience, and advantage of the borough, as to route, grade, etc., it was considered proper that the municipality should bear a just proportion of the damages ; hence, it is a general provision of the act of 1851 that all damages assessed beyond the value of the land thus appropriated to public use shall be paid by the corporation, and that the jury shall separately assess the same; and as the officers of the municipality have peculiar opportunities for knowing that erections or improvements are about to be made, they are thus charged with the duty of giving notice of the laying out of the road or street. This may probably explain the connection in which this provision is found in the body of the act.</p>

      <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>By the act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 525, however, further provision was made as follows : “ Whenever the burgesses and. town council of any borough shall open, or he about to open, any streets or alleys therein, or to widen or extend the same, it shall be lawful for said burgesses, etc., to apply by petition to the Court of Quarter Sessions of the peace of the proper comity, setting forth the facts, and describing the locality of such streets or alleys, and praying said court to appoint seven disinterested freeholders of such borough, who, after being first duly sworn, etc., shall proceed to view the premises described in said petition, having regard to both the advantages and disadvantages caused to the several properties along the line of and adjoining said streets and alleys, and shall assess and allow to all persons injured thereby such damages as they shall have sustained respectively over and above all advantages ; and shall also mate assessments for contribution upon all such properties as shall be benefited by the opening, etc., of said streets, etc., such sums respectively as they may have been benefited over and above all disadvantages.”</p>

It is plain, that the act of 1856 contemplates an assessment of all the damages against the municipality; the estimate of the advantages and the disadvantages, the assessment of damages to projorties injured, and for contribution upon properties benefited, is practically inconsistent with any other theory. It seems incredible, if any distinction is to be observed between the value of the land taken and other injuries sustained, that there was no provision to that effect in this act. The duties of the viewers are most minutely and particularly stated, and there is not the slightest suggestion to this effect. Cummings v. Williams-port, <a href="/pa/84/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="84 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1053550" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0472-01">84 Pa. 472</a>, was a case under this act, and it was there held, that in estimating the damages sustained by the opening of a street, the proper measure of damages is the difference between what <em>the property </em>would bring in the market before the improvement, and what after the improvement was made, <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>without reference to the purposes for which it may be used. No separate assessment was there made, none suggested, and the measure of damages adopted is wholly inconsistent with that mode of assessment.</p>
    <p id="b552-7" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[260,572,1186,302]]]'>As the streets and alleys, laid out and about to be opened in the borough of Parkesburg, were laid out, enacted and ordained by the burgess and council of that borough, and the proceeding to assess the damages is under the act of 1856, we are of opinion _ that the county of Chester cannot be held for any part of the damages.</p>
