I will endeavor in as few words as I can to call your attention to the points which belong to your province. This action is brought by the plaintiff, Mr. Gould, to obtain possession of two pieces of property, one No. 928 South Fifth street and the other No. 635 Lombard street. These properties were owned by Charles W. Hepburn, Jr. There were two judgments which were liens upon the property, one of $650 and the other of $500. Subsequently to these there was a mortgage for $1,200, which has been called the Betts mortgage, and subsequent to that there was another judgment held by Mr. William Brown. On two of these judg<a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>menta both of these properties were sold to Henry F. Hepburn, attorney. Now these sheriff’s sales, if they were made in good faith to a third party, would throw all these incumbrances out and give a perfect, good title to the purchaser. They were, however, bought at this sale by Mr. Charles W. Hepburn, the very man upon whose land they were incumbrances. He permitted the sale and bought them in when they were knocked down by the sheriff. In a case of that kind they do not discharge the incumbrances on the land, hut the title he acquires is for the benefit of his creditors. When, then, he bought those two properties, as the first two judgments had been paid, he still held it subject to the Betts mortgage. Subsequently this property he either sold or mortgaged to Mr. Gould, the plaintiff here, but if he had either actual or constructive notice of these facts he stands in no better position than Charles W. Hepburn, and the sale under the Betts mortgage has divested his title to this property.</p>

Hepburn and Charles W. Hepburn, he agreed to loan to the said Charles W. Hepburn the sum of $4,000, and on the same day paid to the said Henry F. ITepbum the sum of $2,000, and the balance thereof on June 22, 1873. That he swore was the transaction at that time, two years ago. At present be swears that he bought this property of Henry F. Ilepbnrn and had nothing to do with Charles W. Hepburn in the business. Now being confronted with that affidavit in this case and asked wbat it meant, that a man could swear to facts so utterly inconsistent, he has explained that that was done by his lawyer who drew up the affidavit. There are some things, gentlemen, wbicb a lawyer does for you for which you are not responsible, and it would be very unreasonable to hold you responsible. You do not draw up wbat are called the pleadings, tbe papers in a case which are filed in the office; and you do not select what mode or what kind of suit your lawyer is going to bring; that is a matter of discretion. But did any one ever hear that when you are required to make an affidavit of the facts in a case, you are at liberty to perjure yourself because the lawyer wrote the affidavit? Now it may be perhaps in order to take every reasonable view of the case, <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>that a man may have signed something drawn np by another which he did not intend to. In this case we are met with this further fact: the affidavit was made on January 12, 1883, and the application for an injunction was made on this very court two weeks afterwards, on January 24, 1883, in the presence of this very gentleman, and it was read to the court, and this court was asked to grant an injunction on the truth of that affidavit which he now swears was false. Now, this statement that he then made is corroborated by Mr. Hepburn as precisely correct, as what did occur at that time, and Mr. <em>Simpson, </em>the lawyer of this gentleman, testified that he wrote this paper at his dictation; that he knew nothing of the facts of the case; the facts were given to him by his client, and were sworn to by the client and not by him.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[267,1092,1189,1067]]]'>Now if he knew that this property had been sold as the property of Charles <em>W. </em>Hepburn and also knew that it had been bought in by Charles <em>W. </em>Hepburn and that his attorney was trying to sell it, these circumstances should have put him upon inquiry to discover exactly what he was buying and what were the circumstances surrounding the case, and he would at once have learned that Charles W. Hepburn was the purchaser and that the purchase by him would not divest these liens upon the property, although they were sold under incumbrances which were prior to them in date, and at the very time that he bought these properties, when he was asked yesterday how it was that when he bought them in 1873 he did not go into possession until 1874, he says, “I have given a consent, a tacit consent that Charles W. Hepburn might have the rents till the 19th of September, 1873, and I, by the manoeuvring of his counsel,- did not get possession till 1874, and did not collect the rents till that time.” So that in addition to what he consented to in 1873 he also tells us here that he allows this Charles <em>W. </em>Hepburn, with whom he said he had no connection whatever, to keep possession of the property and collect the rents.</p>

Hepburn benefit him. Any title which he could give after the sheriff’s sale to him, would still be subject to the Betts mortgage. Under the Betts mortgage both these properties were sold to the defendant in this suit. It is, how<a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>ever, contended by the plaintiff that the Betts mortgage did not cover the property 685 Lombard street, because two of the parties who had once owned it had released it from the lien of the mortgage. This they had the power to do if they had a power to do it absolutely, or if, while holding the legal title, it was an honest transaction. It is, however, contended here on the part of the defendant, that Mr. Smithers, who signed one release only, held it as collateral security, in which case he could not release the property; and that Mrs. Brooker, who was an administratrix, released it fraudulently and without any consideration whatever. If you find this to be so, it would not release the property, but would leave this property still subject to the Betts mortgage. In regard, then, to the house No. 928 South Fifth street, the purchase at the sheriff’s sale by Charles W. Hepburn, did not divest the incumbrances existing on the property, and if Mr. Gould was by the circumstances of the case of which I have spoken put upon inquiry, and knew, or was quite cognizant of the facts, he stands in no better position than Charles W. Hepburn. As to the property, No. 635 Lombard street, if you should think that the releases were not fraudulent, your verdict as to them should be for the plaintiff. If they were fraudulent, either through design or defect of power to release, your verdict should be for the defendant also for that property. If you find for the plaintiff, he is of course entitled to the damages of the rents or yearly value in this property during the time of which he was kept out of possession. If you should find, however, for the defendant in this ease, of course there would be no question of damages for you to consider.</p>

Hepburn; that in the month of February, 1873, the former, and in April following, the latter, was sold at sheriff’s sale as the property of Hepburn, and both were struck down to Henry F. Hepburn who says he purchased them in the interest of Charles W. Hepburn, for whom he was acting as an attorney. As to the legal effect of these sales, the learned judge of the court below instructed the jury, as follows: “Now these sheriff’s sales, if they were made in good faith to a third party, would throw all these incumbrances out, and give a perfect good title to the purchaser. They were, however, bought at this sale by Mr. Charles W. Hepburn, the very man upon whose <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>land tlioy were incumbrances. lie permitted the sale, and bought them in when they were knocked down by the sheriff; in a case of that kind they do not discharge the incumbrances on the land, but the title he acquires is for the benefit of his creditors,” etc. This portion of the charge we think results from a misconception of the case presented by the facts which are uncontradicted or admitted. It will be conceded of course that if Charles W. Hepburn himself had purchased at these sales, or Henry F. Hepburn, his attorney, had purchased for him, in his name and using his money for payment of the purchase money, the title would have been unaffected, and the liens undisturbed thereby. But that is not this case, as we understand it. The charge in this respect was much more favorable to the plaintiff in error than he deserved.</p>
    <p id="b273-5" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[162,1083,1184,1339]],["BL_274.1",274,[275,360,1186,446]]]'>There is no charge of fraud or unfairness in the sale ; it was regularly conducted, and was open to all. Whilst Henry F. Hepburn purchased the property, in the interest of his client, the evidence is wholly to the effect that he purchased in his own name and upon his own responsibility, for the purpose of securing the title to himself, free from all liens, so that he might sell one property at a time at a fair value, to prevent sacrifice. He was called as a witness by the plaintiff in error, and testified “ there was nothing dishonest about it so far as Charles W. Hepburn was concerned.” The interest of Charles W. Hepburn was tó be promoted by a re-sale or pledge of the property by Henry F. Hepburn, who, apart from the strict line of his professional duty, voluntarily assumed the responsibility and undertook to aid his client in this way. He says the reason he made the purchase in his own name, was to secure the money which he was obliged to advance in order to get the titles from the sheriff, and that he subsequently turned them over to Gould for the purpose of raising the money to pay the sheriff; to get the money by placing the property in the hands of bona fide purchasers. That this was a perfectly legitimate transaction cannot be questioned. That he was acting in the interest of Charles W. Hepburn he admits, but the sale was open to all, and was not under his control. He stood on the same plane with the creditors, who had a perfect right to and probably did compete with him in the biddings. Under these circumstances, he had a right to bid and buy, and <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>a right to be secure in his purchase, and to be protected in the purchase-money which he obligated himself to pay. There was at the time, it is true, a confidential relation existing between himself and Chas. W. Hepburn, his client. If he had taken advantage of that relation to obtain the title, and subsequently abused the confidence reposed in him by his client, the law might perhaps have affected him with a constructive trust ex maleficio, but he did not abuse it,, and no trust of that character arose.</p>
    <p id="b274-5" data-blocks='[["BL_274.5",274,[270,823,1190,873]]]'>But instead of taking the deed in his own name, Henry F. Hepburn, in furtherance of the original design, entered into an arrangement of some bind with Gould, by the terms of which, upon jsayment to him of from $3,600 to $4,000, Gould’s name was substituted in the sheriff’s return, and, the purchase-money having been paid to the sheriff out of the money received from Gould, the sheriff’s deeds to Gould were executed, acknowledged, and delivered. Under such circumstances, we think the judgments and all liens subsequent to those effecting the sale, were discharged. Henry F. Hepburn was a good-faith bidder, at a regular sheriff’s sale, and creditors, and others in interest, had full opportunity to protect their interests, if they chose to do so. There was no obligation on the part of Henry F. Hepburn to buy the property, or to incur the responsibility which he assumed, but if he or any other person chose to do so, it was in no sense an unlawful act on his or their part.</p>

Assuming that Henry F. Hepburn knew or had the means of knowing, that the money had been so applied, there is no evidence that Gould had any knowledge of that fact, and the state of the record was not such, we think, as to put him upon inquiry. Whilst a purchaser at a sheriff’s sale with knowledge that the judgment upon which the sale is effected has been paid, may acquire no title, it has been held to be otherwise with respect to a bona fide purchaser from him without notice: Hoffman v. Strohecker, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%2086" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="7 W. 86">7 W. 86</a>; Gibbs v.

    <p id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.5",275,[194,578,1185,1238]]]'>But it is alleged, oil tlie part of the plaintiff in error, that the deed to Gould was only a security for the money advanced by him, and that upon repayment of the money by Chas. W. Hepburn, to whose benefit the transaction was turned over, the land was to be conveyed to him; that the defeasance being by parol was not recorded, and that in equity the deed was nothing more than an unrecorded mortgage. The deed was made in Gould’s name in consideration of the money he paid to Hepburn; the money was therefore Hepburn’s money, and from this he paid his bid to the sheriff; if the facts are as alleged, therefore, the deed, although absolute in form, was in effect merely a mortgage: Boyd v. Taylor, 37 Leg. Lit. 424. An absolute deed and a separate defeasance, if the latter is not recorded, amount only to an unrecorded paortgage, as against subsequent lien creditors: Corpman v. Baccastow, <a href="/pa/84/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="84 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1053515" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0363-01">84 Pa. 363</a>; and, whilst an unrecorded mortgage is good against the mortgagor: Levinz v. Will, <a href="/dall/1/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="1 Dall. 430" data-case-ids="12149636,12149709,1408601" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0430-01,/dall/1/0430-02,/us/1/0445-01">1 Dall. 430</a>; Mellon’s App., <a href="/pa/32/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="32 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="986664" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0121-01">32 Pa. 121</a>; and against his heirs: M’Laughlin v. Ihmsen, <a href="/pa/85/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="85 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="440529" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0364-01">85 Pa. 364</a>; Tryon v. Munson, <a href="/pa/77/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="77 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="436339" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0250-01">77 Pa. 250</a>, it will be postponed to a subsequent judgment, unless the creditor had notice of the mortgage before his debt was contracted: Lahr’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/90/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="90 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="1065637" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0507-01">90 Pa. 507</a>. Upon this ground it is contended that the rights of Gould as a mortgagee must be postponed to the Betts judgment.</p>
    <p id="b275-6" data-blocks='[["BL_275.6",275,[191,1822,1185,615]],["BL_276.1",276,[227,358,1184,190]]]'>But it will be observed that by the original sheriff’s sales, owing to the order of the Simpson and the Brown judgments, which were the instruments of the respective sales, all the liens, excepting the Brown mortgage as to No. 928 South Fifth street, including the lien of the Betts judgment and mortgage, as we have already said, were discharged as against the premises in suit, and no other lien was afterward entered until in 1879, when the Betts judgment was revived. In the meantime, however, in the month of May, 1874, Charles W. Hepburn, having exhausted his efforts to pay the money, voluntarily executed and delivered to Gould a quit-claim deed, thereby surrendering the equity of redemption existing under <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>the parol defeasance, and abandoned his right to regain his estate in' the premises mentioned, intending, as upon a foreclosure, to vest the entire title, legal and equitable, in Samuel Gould.</p>
    <p id="b276-5" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[224,566,1187,509]]]'>We can see no good reason why the quit-claim deed was not effectual to accomplish this purpose of the parties. The liens had been discharged as stated; no new liens had been entered, and, as the good faith of the transaction is not impeached, it is plain that on and after the 26th day of May, 1874, Samuel Gould was the absolute owner in possession of these respective premises. An absolute deed, subject to an unrecorded defeasance,on the execution of a release of the equity of redemption before any other right has attached, vests an absolute estate in the grantee: Caverow v. Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/52/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="52 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="1002209" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0287-01">52 Pa. 287</a>.</p>
    <p id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.6",276,[223,1081,1188,452]]]'>If we are right in this, the question raised by the first and the eleventh assignments of error becomes unimportant, for it is no difference whether Gould claims upon an absolute sale in the first instance, or upon the title set forth in his bill in equity In either case he is entitled to recover; and as his recovery is upon the exhibition of his written and recorded title, the admission of the evidence complained of in the second, third, fourth and fifth assignments^ even if the objections taken thereto were well-founded, did Saunders no harm.</p>
    <p id="b276-7" data-blocks='[["BL_276.7",276,[223,1546,1187,147]]]'>The remaining assignments, in - so far at least as they have any relevancy or bearing upon the real questions involved in the case, are fully considered and disposed of in this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b276-8" data-blocks='[["BL_276.8",276,[224,1702,1186,508]]]'>The whole case turns upon the question whether the liens were discharged by the sheriff’s sales made in February and April, 1873, and as to this vre think there can be no doubt. Whilst we are unwilling tó adopt the reasoning of the learned judge of the court below, we are of opinion that the result reached at the trial was right. The charge throughout was much more favorable to the plaintiff in error than ho had any right to expect. The case is somewhat complicated in its facts, but after a careful examination of the whole matter we are of opinion the judgment should be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b276-9" data-blocks='[["BL_276.9",276,[999,2219,368,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
