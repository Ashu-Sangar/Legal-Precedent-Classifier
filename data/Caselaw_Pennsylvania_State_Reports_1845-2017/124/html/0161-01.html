L. 582, providing, “ That it shall be lawful for the plaintiff, at the third term of the court after the execution of the writ, as aforesaid, if he shall have filed his declaration, to take judgment thereon against the defendant, for default of appearance, unless the attachment before that time be dissolved.” The uniform practice in Philadelphia county, under this section, has been to grant judgment, if a declaration has been filed at any time before the motion for judgment is made, no matter whether before or after the return day, in accordance with the obvious meaning of the language used in said section. When an act is conceived in clear and precise terms, and when the sense is manifest and leads to nothing absurd, there can be no reason to refuse the sense which <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>the language naturally presents, or to go elsewhere in search of conjectures to restrain or extinguish it: Potter’s Dwarris, 126, 143.</p>
    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[193,518,1178,661]]]'>2. But the court below appears to have been led to hold the judgment erroneous by the following line of cases: Foreman v. Schricou, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 43" data-case-ids="483400" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0043-01">8 W. &amp; S. 43</a>; Dennison v.

Not one of these cases was a foreign attachment, but all related to actions by summons. The language of § 33, act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 578, relating to actions by summons, is not identical. The old practice act of March 20, 1724, § 1, 1 Sm. L. 164, resembles it still more closely, and under that act it Avas held that judgment might bo taken "for want of an appearance, notwithstanding the fact that no declaration had been filed until after the return day: Morrison v. Wetherill, 8 S. &amp; R. 502; Nice v. Bowman, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.%2026" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 W. 26">6 W. 26</a>.</p>
    <p id="b187-5" data-blocks='[["BL_187.6",187,[193,1191,1178,652]]]'>3. There is ample reason for a different interpretation of the two sections of the act of 1836. In an action by summons, after the service of the writ the plaintiff has the defendant in court. If the declaration has not been filed until after the return day, he can still rule the defendant to plead, and enter judgment for Avant of a plea, or, if a plea is filed, go to a jury for a verdict for his claim. But in a foreign attachment under the same circumstances, the plaintiff’s forward course is effectually blocked. The act does not provide, as in the case of a summons, for any further proceedings. He cannot rule the defendant to plead, because the latter is not in court; for the same reason, he cannot put his case at issue; his hands are tied.</p>
    <p id="b187-6" data-blocks='[["BL_187.7",187,[194,1862,1177,549]]]'>4. But there is another reason why this judgment ought to stand. The rule to strike off was taken by the garnishees, not by the defendants. The garnishees had already appeared to the scire facias, had ansAvered interrogatories and had pleaded. By so doing they waived any objection to the irregularity of the judgment against the defendants, and were estopped from denying its force and validity. It is a Avell established rule, that an application to set aside proceedings for irregularity should be made as early as possible, or, as is commonly said, in the first instance: Tidd’s Prae., 513; Poor v. Colburn, <a href="/pa/57/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="57 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="1010449" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0415-01">57 Pa. 415</a>.</p>

Carey, 2 <em>W. </em>N. 522, settle beyond a possibility of doubt, the time in which a declaration must be filed in a suit in a personal action commenced by summons : it must be filed before the return day of the writ.

That was immediately followed by scire facias against the garnishees, rule on them to answer, etc., and plea of nulla bona.

It is true, the defendant in foreign attachment has two full terms, after execution of the writ, in which to appear; but he may appear <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>on the return day, and. if he does, he ought to be able to find upon the record a declaration setting forth the cause of action.

While the garnishee in foreign attachment is not a p&gt;arty to the judgment against defendant in the writ, it is not quite accurate to say he is a stranger thereto in the sense intended by plaintiff. The judgment is necessarily the foundation of subsequent proceedings against the garnishee, by which it is sought to take the property or effects of the defendant, attached in his hands, and apply the same to plaintiff’s claim. As a general rule the garnishee is bound to see that the proceedings to that end are not illegal. In a legal point of view, his relation to the defendant in a writ of foreign attachment is not always the same. In some cases, he is simply bailee of defendant’s property. In others, he is his debtor, or he may be either bailee or debtor with a counter claim of his own, consisting of a special lien or a set-off; or, he may be a trustee of money or property under a valid trust created by the defendant in favor of another party. In either case, when he occupies the position of bailee or trustee, it is his right, as well as his duty, for his own protection if nothing more, to insist that no property or effects be taken out of his hands except upon valid process. That duty, if it has not existed before, certainly arises when the garnishee is called upon by scire facias to show cause why plaintiff should not have satisfaction of his judgment out of the estate or effects of the defendant in his hands or possession. The <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>scire facias is predicated of a valid judgment against the nonresident defendant, and if the garnishee is aware that no such judgment exists, or if he has any other just ground of defence, he has a right to interpose it. If he neglects to do so, and the attached property is taken from him, he may become personally liable to those whose interests he could and should have protected: 2 Tr. &amp; Haly Prac., § 2289; Serg. on Att., 113, etc.</p>
    <p id="b192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_192.5",192,[239,712,1189,400]]]'>It has been held that under the general plea of nulla bona the garnishee may, on trial of the issue, take advantage of the invalidity of the judgment on which the scire facias issued: Pancake v. Harris, 10 S. &amp; R. 109; Thornton v. Bonham, <a href="/pa/2/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="2 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="951344" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0102-01">2 Pa. 102</a>. If he can do that, there is no good reason why he may not apply to the court in behalf of the non-resident defendant, and have an improvidently granted judgment stricken off, as was done in this case.</p>

The decision overturned the settled previous practice, although that practice had been sustained, even under the act of 1724, by the decision of this court: Morrison v. Wetherill, 8 S. &amp; R. 502. How much more clearly the practice was correct under the act of 1836 than it was under the act of 1724, was demonstrated by the late Chief Justice Sharswood in May v. Sharp, 1 Tr. &amp; Haly, 274, ed. 1867. No answer to his argument has ever been attempted, though this court has on several later occasions followed the ruling in Foreman v. Schricon. But the bar has never accepted or followed the rule in Philadelphia, and the cases of Dennison v. Leech, <a href="/pa/9/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="9 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="960723" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0164-01">9 Pa. 164</a>, and Kohler v.

True the courts of these counties, when expressly called upon, have bowed to the authority of this court and followed Foreman v. Schricon; but in Philadelphia, certainly, they have rarely been called upon to do so. The rule of that case has been “ effectively repealed,” not, as the brilliant Chief Justice said of the act of <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>1724, “by the indolence of the profession,” but by its imperative convenience.</p>
    <p id="b193-4" data-blocks='[["BL_193.5",193,[175,465,1181,456]]]'>As it is a mere question of practice, involving no principle of law, and unsettling no legal rights by the change, I am of opinion, notwithstanding the lapse of time and the cases of acquiescence in this court, that Forqman v. Scliricon ought to be overruled and the true reading of the statute reasserted. But whether it be worth while to do this or not, I am altogether opposed to extending the rule to a new case to which it has not heretofore been applied, and to which its application would be especially inconvenient.</p>
    <p id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.6",193,[175,930,1181,291]]]'>There is no necessity to do so. The phraseology of the sections relating to actions commenced by summons and by foreign attachment is not identical. The natural meaning of the words, to be sure, is the same; but the fact that the natural meaning has been distorted in one case does not require that it should also be distorted in the other.</p>
    <p id="b193-6" data-blocks='[["BL_193.7",193,[176,1240,1179,239]]]'>Since the passage of the procedure act of 1887 the rule of Foreman v.

The experience of the members of this court shows three variations as to the time when a narr must be filed, according to the practice of the courts in their various districts: (1) Before the return day. (2) Before the defendant’s last day for appearing, i. e., before the third term. (8) Any time before taking judgment. In other parts of the state there may be other variations, but these are sufficient to show that foreign attachment has not been generally understood by the profession as coming within the rule of Foreman v. Schricon. There are reasons why it would be specially inconvenient. The writ is often issued hastily to catch goods while within the jurisdiction, and counsel frequently have to act at some distance from the plaintiffs and require time to get full information. Without enlarging upon these reasons I am of opinion that as the question has never been decided in this court, and the practice in the local courts is not uniform, we are not bound to take a second step in a wrong <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>direction, but are at liberty to make a new start and decide it rightly according to the natural meaning of the words used in the statute.*</p>
