Reading the agreement exhibit A between the lines, in connection with the fact which is in evidence, that the testator was exceedingly desirous of disposing of the mill property and had repeatedly offered to sell it for thirty-five thousand dollars, we cannot escape the conclusion that as between the testator and Edward Mendinhall, the consideration which tbe former was to rceeive for the mill, con<a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>sisted solely of the mortgage for twenty-five thousand dollars, the interest on the bond, of five thousand dollars during life, and the dividends on twenty-five shares of stock for a period of five years; that it was the intention of the parties to the agreement, from the outset, that Edward Mendinhall should have the stock, and that the issuance of the certificate to the testator was but a device whereby that intention could moré readily be effectuated. The transaction therefore, in which Edward Mendinhall acquired ownership of one hundred and fifty shares of the capital stock of the Marshall Iron Company was not in the legal acceptation of the term a “ gift.” A gift is defined to be “ the act by which the owner of a thing voluntarily transfers the title and possession of the same, from himself to another person who accepts it without any consit? eration.” The testator, however, never became under the agreement the actual owner of the stock; he was merely, so to speak, the conduit through which the stock was to be conveyed to Edward Mendinhall. Edward Mendinhall also paid a consideration for the transfer of the stock as specified in the agreement, a consideration which was in part payment for conveyance by John Marshall of the mill property to the Marshall Iron Company. The two essential requisites of a gift are therefore lacking, to wit, first, that the party transferring the title shall be owner, and secondly that the transfer shall be without consideration.</p>

The statement in the codicil, “ Whereas, I gave to Edward Mendinhall — one hundred and fifty shares of stock” etc., is therefore untrue if we are required to construe the word “ gave ” in its legal and technical signification. In the opinion of the auditor, however, we must construe the word, “gave ” with reference to the intention of the testator and the thought which he had in his mind, appearing by the will and by extrinsic evidence. In Wright’s App., <a href="/pa/89/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="89 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1063275" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0067-01">89 Pa. 67</a>, the words “ loaned ” and “ advanced,” in the testator’s will, were held to be used interchangeably. Mr. Justice Woodwaud in <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>delivering the opinion said: “ They are to be construed in view of the facts that have been either admitted or ascertained. It has often happened that the stringent application of even a strictly technical word has worked grievously unjust results. All mere technical rules of construction must give way to the plainly expressed intention of a testator: Shabswood, J., in Reek’s App., <a href="/pa/78/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="78 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1040350" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0432-01">78 Pa. 432</a>; and, when in aid of a written instrument, its intention can be gathered from undoubted proofs, the equity of parties claiming under it are not to be overthrown by a rigid adherence, to one alternative meaning of an equivocal technical word.”</p>

To his daughters Mary H. Brosius, Lydia S. Mendinhall, and Anna B. Fogg, he bequeathed to each twenty thousand dollars. To his daughter Elizabeth M. Hannum, he gave the income of eighteen thousand dollars for life, and the use for life of a house in Kennett Square worth about four thousand dollars, and at her death, to her children, thus making her share about equal to the shares of his other daughters. Then he states that “ in justice to his daughters ” he does not give a similar legacy to his son Calvin P. Marshall because he had paid debts of Calvin recently, to the amount of about twenty-two thousand dollars. He then divides the residue of his estate into five equal parts, and gives to each of his children one of these parts. After-. wards he entered into a written agreement with Edward Mendinhall, husband of his daughter, Lydia S. Mendinhall, whereby, through the sale of the rolling mill, his said son-in-law became the owner of stock in the Marshall Iron Company, worth, in the opinion of the testator, as well as in point of fact, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, the ownership of which the testator considered to be a benefit to his daughter and her family equal to its par value. The legacies to his other children could not take effect until his death. At the time of the execution of the codicil, the stock had been transferred to Edward Mendinhall, the mill was in active operation and the prospect was that the business would be profitable. In justice to his other children, the payment of whose shares in his estate was deferred until the testator’s death, he must <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>have regarded the consideration paid for the stock, as mentioned in the agreement, in the light of interest upon the amount of principal which it represented. The transfer of the stock was, therefore, from the testator’s standpoint, substantially a “gift.”</p>

He was a party to the transaction, and was necessarily familiar with its details. He was a man of intelligence and business capacity, and at the time of his death, was president of the National Bank of Keimett Square, a flourishing institution located in the borough in which he lived. It is not to be presumed that within two months after the transfer of the stock, he became by reason of advanced age or forgetfulness, mistaken as to the facts, and believed that he had actually made a present to his son-in-law, of fifteen thousand dollars in the stock of the Marshall Iron Company. No mistake is shown. On the contrary the evidence is very convincing that there was no mistake.....</p>

    <p id="b421-6" data-blocks='[["BL_421.7",421,[179,674,1179,1178]]]'>The learned auditor and court below held that the legacy to the appellant oí $20,000 was revoked by the codicil to the testator's will, and that she is only entitled to her share of the residue of the estate. The contention of the appellant is that this ruling is erroneous for the reason that the testator based liis revocation of the legacy on the ground that the facts alleged by him in the codicil were true ; that as the reason for the revocation has failed, the revocation itself falls, and the appellant is entitled to be paid the $20,000. The rule as laid down in the text books appears to be this: “ And here it may be observed, that, when a testator by a codicil revokes a devise or bequest in his will, or in a previous codicil, expressly grounding such revocation on the assumption of a fact which turns out to be false, the revocation does not take effect, being, it is considered, conditional and dependent on a contingency which fails: ” 1 Jarman on Wills, 357; Powell on Devises, vol. 1, 528; 2 Roberts on Wills, 210; 1 Williams on Executors, 208. The two cases especially relied upon by the text writers in support of this proposition are Campbell v. French, 3 Yes. 821, and Doe on the demise Elizabeth Evans v. Henry Evans, 10 Ad. &amp; E. 228. The learned auditor has collected a large number of cases, mostly English, upon this subject, which in the main sustain the text-writers.</p>
    <p id="b421-7" data-blocks='[["BL_421.8",421,[179,1870,1180,562]],["BL_422.1",422,[252,363,1188,1337]]]'>The principle referred to may be conceded to be correct when applied to cases in which the falsity or error of the alleged fact rested not in the personal knowledge of the testator, but was assumed upon information derived from others; as in the case of Campbell v. French, supra, where by his will the testator gave legacies to A. and B., describing them as grandchildren of C. and then residing in America. By a codicil he revoked these legacies, giving as a reason that the legatees were dead. That fact not being true, and being necessarily derived from information of other persons, the legatees were held to be entitled to the legacy, notwithstanding the revocation. In the <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>case in hand, the reason given by John Marshall, the testator, for the revocation of the legacy of $20,000 to his daughter, the appellant, was, that he had, since the execution of his will, given to his son-in-law, Edward Mendinhall, the husband of the appellant, one hundred and fifty shares of stock in the Marshall Iron Company, the par value of which was one hundred dollars per share, and had also loaned to him the sum of five thousand dollars. The appellant contends that this statement was untrue; that the transfer of the stock to his son-in-law was a sale, not a gift, and that he had never loaned him the five thousand dollars. The facts were that the testator transferred this stock to Mendinhall upon an agreement with the latter that he (Mendinhall) should “ execute and deliver to the said John Marshall his bond for the sum of $5,000, to secure the payment of interest on that sum at the rate of six per cent, payable semi-annually to the said John Marshall for and during the term of his natural life, and further agrees to pay to said John Marshall the dividends that may be declared on $2,500 of the capital stock of said company when and as declared for the term of five years from date of transfer as aforesaid, it being hereby agreed that if either the said John Marshall or Edward Mendinhall shall die within said five years, that then and in said ease said dividends shall not thereafter be paid to said John Marshall, but shall belong thenceforth to said Edward Mendinhall, his executors, administrators or assigns.”</p>
    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[258,1706,1186,716]],["BL_423.1",423,[182,365,1182,345]]]'>The object of this arrangement is apparent. The testator was conveying to his son-in-law $15,000 of stock which it was believed would be valuable, and which in point of fact proved to be worth more than its par value, the dividends thereon being from ten to fifteen per cent. It was an advancement during the lifetime of the testator, over and above what his other children received at that time, and the provision for the bond of five thousand dollars and for the dividends upon $2,500 of the stock was doubtless intended to produce equality between his children, taking into consideration the testator’s expectancy of life. Be that as it may, the testator regarded it as an advancement; in point of fact it practically was so; the testator had the right to so treat it; the facts \yere peculiarly within his own knowledge, and we cannot deny him the <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>right to do what ho pleased with Ms own property. Were we to reverse this ease and award the $20,000 legacy to the appel hint, we would cause gross inequality in this estate, the appellant would receive her full share, and her husband would get in addition $15,000 of valuable stock, for which he has paid nothing beyond a reasonable consideration for the advancement in the lifetime of the testator.</p>
    <p id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[448,727,912,94]]]'>The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>
