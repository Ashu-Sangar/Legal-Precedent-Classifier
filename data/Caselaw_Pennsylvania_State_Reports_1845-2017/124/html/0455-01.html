No present judgment could be rendered, for it would be uncertain whether the interest would ever vest, and it would be anomalous to allow the attachment to stand and suspend all proceedings until the happening of the contingency years afterward. The meaning of the word “interest” in the attachment act is put beyond doubt by the interpretation given by this court, in Keene’s App., <a href="/pa/60/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="60 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1014499" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0504-01">60 Pa. 504</a>, to the same word in § 52, act of March 29, 1832, P.

The will directs that it goes to her heirs. The will, moreover, directs that it goes to her assignees. As no one can have an assignee after he is dead, it shows that she has the disposition of the principal during her life, and if she sell or convey it during her lifetime, her assignee will take the estate at the expiration of the trust. Wherefore, if she may sell and assign this estate, it is certainly liable to attachment and execution, as an attaching creditor becomes in law the assignee of such an estate.

It constitutes a spendthrift trust, and it is conceded that the income thus secured to her is not within the grasp of this attachment.</p>
    <p id="b484-7" data-blocks='[["BL_484.9",484,[229,1146,1184,809]]]'>But it is claimed that she has an interest in the principal of the estate which may be attached and appropriated to the payment of her debts. The will appoints a time for the distribution and vesting of the principal of the estate. The persons who are then the recipients of the income of it will take it absolutely. But it is impossible to determine now who will at that time be entitled to receive the income and constitute the beneficiaries under the provisions of the will which dispose of the principal. We think, therefore, that Mrs. Lynde’s interest in the principal of the estate is contingent. These conclusions result from a consideration of the whole will and are in accord with the manifest intention of the testator.

In that case the testator, having nine grandchildren, directed his executors to sell a certain portion of his farm, to divide the net proceeds of the sale into nine equal parts, and for the period of twelve years from the time of Ms decease to keep said net proceeds at interest and pay one-ninth of the interest annually to each of said grandchildren, “ or, if any of them have died leaving hems, then pay the same <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>to said heirs and at the full expiration of twelve years from my decease shall in like manner pay over the principal.” In determining that the legacies to the grandchildren were vested at the death of the testator, it was said, inter alia, “ It is to be noted that there is not in this will the faintest trace of an intent in case of the death of any of the grandchildren before the expiration of the twelve years to give the shares of those so dying to the survivors. The share of a grandchild that shall ‘have died,’ is to go to his heirs.” But in our case, if Mrs. Lynde dies before the period appointed for the vesting of the estate, what she might have received had she survived that period, goes, not to her heirs, but, at a time fixed by the will, to persons designated by the null to receive it.</p>
