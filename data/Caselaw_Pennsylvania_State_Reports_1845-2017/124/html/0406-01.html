He was objected to as incompetent, because he was a party to the contract, and one of the other parties, to wit, Robert Neely, was deceased.

On the other hand, Elizabeth M. McClure covenants with Samuel M. McClure, as her trustee, that she will not make any claim of any kind, on Mr. Neely’s estate, save for the annuity, and then and there renounces all such other claims. Thereupon Samuel M.

We are unable to say whether such disclosures were made by the parties to the contract in question, as we have no proof as to what took place between them on this subject. In the absence of such proof we are entitled to presume that they did. It therefore becomes important to inquire, whether the provision made for the intended wife is manifestly unreasonable arid disproportionate to the means of the intended husband, so as to raise a presumption of the intended concealment, and thus throw on the executors of Ms estate the burden of disproving this presumption.</p>

The annual rental value of this real estate at his death is shown to be about nineteen hundred and fifty dollars. We have no testimony showing a change in its rental value since 1874, and therefore we may presume it was worth about the same at that time. At the same period of time, the estate of Elizabeth M. Neely was worth about twelve thousand dollars. Her estate, therefore, at the time the deed was executed, was about the one fourth part of his. The deed provided that she should retain absolute control of the estate which she then had, or might thereafter acquire. It was to remain hers absolutely, and be entirely independent of her intended husband. This estate was wholly personal, and was thus freed from a possible, not to say probable, inher<a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>itance by her husband.

McClure as á witness, it may be proper to consider what effect his testimony would have upon the proceedings. By his testimony it appears that Robert Neely was about sixty years of age and Elizabeth M. McClure about fifty at the time of the marriage. He was then living on his farm, about four miles from the <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>McClure homestead. He had always lived in that neighborhood. The parties are related, and he was intimate with the McClure family all his lifetime. He was frequently at their place when in active business, and he had been assisted pecuniarily by her father, when he was a young man. He was well known in the neighborhood as a successful man, and had the reputation at the time of this transaction of being rich. Elizabeth M. McClure had always resided with her father. She had little, if any, business experience, was of a nervous temperament and had no property, except what had been given her by her father, and which was in the stock of three banks. Part of this was given to her by him in his lifetime, and the rest bequeathed to her by his will. At the time of the marriage Robert Neely was an active, hearty man. He had been a drover, but was then out of active business, except as managing his own investments and the farm on which he lived. He began paying attention to Miss McClure in the fall of 1873. Their engagement was announced to Samuel M. McClure about the month of March, 1874. Some time prior to May 11, 1874, Mr. Neely consulted Mr. Wm. E. Barber, a member of the Chester county bar relative to a marriage contract, to be executed by him and Miss McClure. Mr. Barber prepared such a contract, and sent it to him by mail with a letter dated May 11,T874. The first knowledge Elizabeth M. McClure or Samuel M. McClure had of such a contract was on Saturday, May 16th. On that day Robert Neely came to the home of Elizabeth M. McClure before dinner. In the early part of the afternoon, he produced the marriage contract thus prepared and all complete, except its date, and the initial letter of Samuel M. McClure’s middle name, and asked Miss McClure to unite with him in its execution. This she apparently declined to do, for about three o’clock her brother, Samuel M. McClure, came into the room where these parties were, and found her in tears. He inquired the cause, and Mr. Neely pulled a paper out of his pocket, said that he had a marriage contract which he wanted Lizzie to sign. She declined to do so at that time, and in his presence, saying she thought it mean in Mr. Neely to ask her for a thing of that kind at this late day. He thereupon said to her, “If you don’t sign it there will be no wedding.”</p>

After some further conversation, Miss McClure consented to sign the paper, saying if there was time, and if it was not for the disgrace to the family calling in the invitations, she would never sign it. Mr. Neely, wishing to keep the execution of the paper within the knowledge of the family, suggested the calling in of James McClure and Joseph M. McClure as witnesses. They were seen by Samuel M. McClure, and informed of what was wanted, and about six o’clock the same evening came to Samuel M. McClure’s residence and witnessed the execution of the paper. When all these parties met together, Eobert Neely requested Samuel M. McClure to read the paper aloud in their presence. He did so, and at the conclusion of the reading the paper was executed. In the course of the afternoon, and before signing, Mr. Neely told Miss McClure that the purport of the agreement was, that he released all claim to her property, and she gave up all right to his property. In the course of the conversation the amount of the annuity was talked of, when she designated it as a very mean sum, as it would hardly pay her board. There appears to have been a good deal of conversation on the subject between the parties during the afternoon. She does not appear to have appealed to either of her brothers, or her uncle, for any advice on the subject, and they did not give her any. Her brother Samuel appears to have gone so far as to say to her that they two were old enough to attend to their own business, and she could do as she pleased about it. He understood at- the time the force and effect of the paper. Mr. Neely informed her, that if the paper was not executed it would upset all his plans. Samuel M. McClure appears to have had very little business experience, and no knowledge as to deeds, contracts, or wills. His business at that time was farming. lie had not been consulted by Mr. Neely as to acting as trustee for his sister, nor did ho know such was the intention until he read the paper that afternoon. He filled in the necessary blanks before it was executed. He was a man of forty-five years of age, while his brother Joseph was several years older. James McClure was over seventy years of age. Joseph M. McClure was then in business, and <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>had been in business for many years.

While it is true that this general information may not be sufficient to prove she had knowledge, approximating correctness, of the value of his property, still we can hardly believe Miss McClure was deceived as to his estate because of his silence. We no w find that her estate was then worth about one fourth of his, and that in this respect the contract was a fair and reasonable one, as she would inherit but one third of his estate. She criticised Mr. Neely’s offer of an annuity of six hundred dollars, after his death, as a mean offer, thereby indicating that she believed him able to do something better if he was so disposed. She was surrounded at the time by relatives, who must have had some knowledge of Mr. Neely’s circumstances, and who would have known, and remonstrated against any deception on his part, in this particular.</p>

He explained to her the purport of the instrument, and told her that by its terms he released all right to her property, and she gave up all right to his, and in addition to this, he was to secure her the sum of six hundred dollars annually, in the event of his dying first.

No case has yet been decided, of which we know or to which we have been referred, which asserts the doctrine that in all cases and under all circumstances, where an ante-nuptial contract or release of dower is produced against the wife or widow, as a defence to a suit brought by her, without more, there arises a presumption that her husband has wronged her in the procurement of the same. All the cases agree that the ground must be laid; that it must be shown that the intended husband plainly obtained the advantage in the contract, as that the provision for the wife was disproportionate to his means.

At the time she married Robert Neely the latter was a widower of about sixty years of age, had been twice married, and had issue living by each wife. The appellant was a spinster over fifty years of age. She had an estate of $12,000; her husband had an estate several times larger. They were cousins, and after a short courtship entered into an engagement of marriage. A few days before the time appointed for the marriage, after <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>the cards were out and a caterer engaged, Mr. Neely called upon his betrothed with an ante-nuptial contract, prepared by his attorney, in which he relinquished all claim upon her estate, and covenanted to give her six hundred dollars per annum after his death in full of all claim by her upon his estate. No disclosure appears to have been made by either as to the extent of his or her estate. The appellant objected to signing the paper, thought it was mean, and shed some tears. Mr. Neely was a keen, shrewd,’ firm, business man, and told her “ If you don’t sign it there will be no wedding.” Before the execution of the paper, however, he called in her nearest relatives, her uncle and two brothers; and the paper was fully read over and explained to her. One of her brothers was named as trustee in the contract. She does not appear to have asked any of them for advice. Several hours elapsed between the time Mr. Neely made known his wishes and the execution of the paper. She finally signed it. They lived together for some ten years, when her husband died, and by his will made a provision for the payment of the annuity of six hundred dollars, and left her in addition his mansion house and furniture so long as she desired to use it. The court below has found as a fact that there was neither actual nor constructive fraud in the execution of the contract.</p>

In Ludwig’s App., <a href="/pa/101/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="101 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="500918" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0535-01">101 Pa. 535</a>, a widower, fifty-seven years of age, and a poor widow of sixty-three years, being about to marry, executed an ante-nuptial contract, whereby the latter, in consideration of “ one dollar, and of a comfortable support during life, and at her death a decent Christian burial,” relinquished all her rights in the former’s estate. The agreement recited that the intended husband owned “ certain lands and tenements, also personal property;” the person who drew the document explained its effect to the woman before execution, and stated that the intended husband “ had a large property,” but the extent or value thereof was not made known to her. In fact it amounted to over $14,000, and it was held that she was bound by the contract and for this reason was not allowed the widow’s exemption of $300. It was said in the opinion of the court: “ From a sentimental standpoint the provision for the widow would not seem generous. But a widower of fifty-seven with eleven children, seldom contracts a second marriage from mere sentiment. lie may have thought it was enough, in view of her age and position, to give her a comfortable home, a decent support during her life, and a Christian burial after her death. At any rate it is very clear she was of that opinion, and that is an end of the case.” In Smith’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="115 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="551789" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0319-01">115 Pa. 319</a>, the ante-nuptial contract gave the wife $1200 a year. His will gave her the income of $15,000 additional, but that is immaterial. The estate of the husband for distribution was $334,-543.83. In that case the appellant was a second wife, past <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>middle age, and her husband was a widower, with children living by his first wife. We held that the disproportion of the provision for the wife to his means was not so great as to raise a presumption of fraud. There was no disclosure of the extent of the husband’s estate.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[253,615,1199,1274]]]'>Was the provision which Mr. Neely made for his intended wife so disproportioned to his means as to create a presumption of fraud or intended concealment? That the appellant knew when she signed the paper that he was a man of large means is clear from the fact that she objected to it on the ground of its meanness. When we consider the question of the adequacy of the provision we must regard all the circumstances surrounding the case. This was a marriage between persons well advanced in years. The appellant was not the mother of his children, nor was she likely ever to bear him any. She had not in any way aided him to accumulate his fortune. She had $12,000 of her own, all of which he relinquished. In additon he gave her $600 per year during her life. What claim had this old woman, marrying this old man, to come in and take one third of his estate away from his children, and yet retain the whole of her own ? She would of course have had a legal claim had he married her without an ante-nuptial contract; but she had no claim which made it in- • equitable or unjust in him to insist upon the execution of the contract before the marriage. It would have been a wrong to his own blood if he had not made some such arrangement. It was not a liberal provision, but it was adequate. She retains all of her own estate, and has now in addition $600 per year, besides a comfortable furnished home. Surely her last condition is better than her first.</p>

In the latter instance they grow up together; the wife is the mother of his children; she shares his burdens in his early struggles, and often by her thrift and economy materially aids him in the accumulation of his fortune. To cut off such a wife with a mere support during life would be as unjust as it would be ungenerous. But when a man in the decline of life, who has been twice a widower, and who has two sets of children, for the third time leads a woman to the altar, and an elderly woman <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>at that, it is very different. In such case the wife reaps where site lias not sown, and if she is provided with a comfortable support after her husband’s death she lias no just cause of complaint.
