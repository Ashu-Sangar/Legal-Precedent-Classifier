In passing upon the question of inconvenience in this case, arising from the increased difficulty of access to the property, the ordinary danger from accidental fires to buildings not resulting from negligence is all to be considered. You will observe that. “ The danger from accidental fires to buildings not resulting from negligence ” is the point. Where a fire results from the negligence of a railroad company, there is a special remedy given ; and therefore the law does not permit anything else but the ordinary danger from an accidental fire to be taken into consideration, and then only as it may affect the market value of the property. In a general way, you take into consideration all such matters as, owing to the peculiar location of the road, may affect the convenient use and enjoyment of the property. [There must be taken into consideration the effect of the railroad there, operated in the ordinary way, locomotives running over it, smoke and dirt that may be made by them; all such matters, however, only as they may affect the market value of the property;] 4 and all the advantages and disadvantages are to be considered in comparison only as they may affect the market value of the land. The object in every ease is to ascertain the difference in the market value. Everything which gives land its intrinsic value is a proper subject for consideration. Land may be applied to various purposes, and for various objects ; and the construction oí a railroad through a property may perhaps destroy its value as a dwelling-house, and yet it may increase its value for manufacturing purposes ; and therefore the law says that in considering the matter, it is the general market value for any purpose that will induce persons to purchase, that is the true test.</p>

The tenants have a right of action for any injury done to their interest. You will recollect the testimony of the <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>witnesses, that on certain parts of this property there were tenants for the period of one year. You will recollect the testimony on that point better than the court, but all those tenants would have a right to recover for the injury that might be done to their interests in that land which they possessed for that one year. You will, therefore, exclude from your consideration any possible injury which the tenants’ interests may have suffered; and you will consider, in estimating the amount of your verdict,- the amount of this just compensation which the law gives, the interest of the plaintiffs alone, carefully excluding any injury which the tenants may have sustained.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[276,928,1190,1337]]]'>On this question of market value in this case there is a wide difference of opinion. The plaintiffs base their estimates of the market value of the whole property, without any consideration of the interests which the tenants may have possessed in it for the one year. Their estimates upon that basis run from $2,500,1 believe there is one at $2,500, up to $3,500. On the other hand, the defendants say that the market value of this property has not been injured at all. Some of their witnesses say that it has been increased;-that previous to the construction of the defendant’s railroad there were two other railroads passing along there, which rendered the street dangerous, and which also subjected these properties to the annoyance of smoke and dirt; and that that may have affected their market value, and that the running of this railroad down the street, and the corresponding special advantages resulting specially to this property, were of such a nature that all disadvantages or annoyances are counter-balanced; and that, therefore, the general market value of this property has not been affected. Now, if that were so, the verdict should be for the defendant; if otherwise, then you will ascertain the difference in market value of the interests which the plaintiffs have in that property, taking as your guide the rules which I have laid down to you.

The road of the defendant company has been constructed at grade over the said Canal street, in front of plaintiffs’ property. The road takes a part of the pavement, and the track is within about twenty feet of one of the buildings, and it was alleged interferes seriously with the drainage, besides rendering access to a portion of the property dangerous.

The court rejected this offer. See first assignment. We think the evidence was properly rejected. The action was for consequential injuries. There was no taking of any portion of the plaintiffs’ property. The plaintiffs’ ancestor was not injured by the setting of construction stakes in a public highway. They were not set on his property, nor was anything belonging to him taken or injured thereby. In such cases there can be no legal injury for the erection or construction until such erection or construction has commenced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The work might have been abandoned before a beginning had been made.

The defendant company offered to prove what they had paid to other property owners along the same street for the privilege of laying their tracks upon it. The damages which the plaintiffs had sustained could not be measured by such a standard as this. What particular owners were willing to accept, or had accepted, from the company by way of settlement or compromise, could not affect the plaintiffs. Aside from this, to render such testimony of any value the conditions must be shown to have been similar.
