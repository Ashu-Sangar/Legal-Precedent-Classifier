While he was occupying the third or fourth seat from front end of the ear, left side, uext to an open window, and the train was running rapidly, some distance south of Trenton, he received a violent blow on the left eye, causing the severe and painful injury of which he complains. The nature of the injury indicated that he was struct by some hard substance, hurled with considerable force. Surgical examination of the eye, made on arrival at Philadelphia, showed that it' was probably a piece of coal. Small particles of some hard substance resembling coal were found and removed from the injured organ. Plaintiff testified the blow was so severe that it almost stunned him, and threw him back into his seat. He further said: “ As I recovered, to an extent, from the shock, I covered the right eye to see if the sight was entirely lost, as I presumed the blow had burst the left eye. I found I could see a little, but I was suffering excruciating agony.” The character of the injury and circumstances attending it were such that plaintiff had no opportunity for successful investigation, and of course, he was unable to explain how it occurred. All he knew was that, at the time he was struck, lie saw, through the open window at which he was sitting, one of tlie company’s trains passing in the opposite direction, immediately on the left of the train on which he was being carried: that, simultaneously with receiving the blow, the engine of that train was directly opposite the window, and was thus interposed between him and that side of the railroad and land adjacent thereto. That fact, it was claimed by him, negatived any inference that tlie injury resulted from tlie act of a stranger, or any one not connected with tlie operation of the road. His theory was that a piece of slate or coal was negligently thrown by the fireman or other employee on tlie passing engine, either in an effort to get rid of it, or in drawing or working at his fire, etc.; but, of course, that could not be assumed by tlie court as an admitted or established fact.</p>

In Laing v. Colder et al. the plaintiff’s arm was broken because the side of the bridge was dangerously close to the side of the track, but in that case there was evidence of contributory negligence, etc. The injury in Sullivan v. Railroad Co. resulted from collision of the train with an obstruction on the track. In Railroad Co. v. Pillow the injury was caused by an outbreak of violence among other passengers in the car; and in Spear v. Railroad Company the injury resulted from an unexplained explosion on board a crowded steamer.</p>
    <p id="b494-5" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[263,898,1194,1540]],["BL_495.1",495,[182,367,1182,1224]]]'>In the latter case our brother Williams summarized the controlling facts and applied the rule thus: “ The person injured was a passenger; the injury occurred after the carriage had begun, and the cause of the injury was an explosion on the boat, which was the vehicle or instrument of carriage, and which was under the exclusive care and control of the defendant’s servants. The rule of law is that the mere happening of an injurious accident to a passenger- while in the hands of the carrier will raise prima facie a presumption of negligence, and throw the onus of showing that it did not exist on the carrier.” Of course, the rule, as thus broadly stated, must be considered in connection with the facts which warranted its application; and this is so in regard to all the cases. The facts and circumstances connected with the injury complained of in each furnished the basis for a presumption of negligence. As was said in Railroad Co. v. Napheys, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20Pa.%20141" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="90 Pa. 141">90 Pa. 141</a>, the general rule undoubtedly is that the party who alleges negligence as the basis of a claim for damages must prove the fact alleged, and the extent of the injury, if more than nominal damages are claimed; but, in some cases, slight proof only is required to justify a presumption of negligence. The mere circumstance attending the injury when put in pi’oof may be enough to cast the burden of ■exculpation on defendant. If a passenger seated in a railroad car is injured in a collision, or by the upsetting of the car, the breaking of a wheel, axle, or other part of the machinery, he is not required to do more, in the first instance, than prove the fact and show the nature and extent of the injury. A prima facie case for plaintiff is thus made out and the onus is cast on the carrier to disprove negligence. It is reasonable that it should be so, because the company has in its possession and <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>under its control, almost exclusively, the means of knowing what occasioned the injury, and of explaining how it occurred, while as a general rule the passenger is destitute of all knowledge that would enable him to present .the facts and fasten the negligence on the company, in case it really existed. The contract to carry implies that the company is provided with a safe and sufficient road; that its cars are staunch and road-worthy; that every precaution which human skill, prudence, and foresight could suggest has been taken to guard against every apparent danger that may beset the passenger, and that the servants in charge are tried, sober, and competent men. When a passenger is injured by any accident connected with the means or appliances of transportation, there naturally arises a presumption that it must have resulted from some negligent act of omission or commission of the company or some of its employees, because, without some such negligence, it is very improbable that the accident would have occurred. That is the basis on which the presumption rests, and it stands as proof of negligence until it is successfully rebutted. It arises not from the naked fact that an injury has been inflicted, but from the cause of the injury, or from other circumstances attending it. As a rule of evidence the principle was approvingly recognized and applied in Railroad Co. v. Anderson, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20Pa.%20851" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="94 Pa. 851">94 Pa. 851</a>, and other cases.</p>

The Railroad Co., supra, a case in some respects similar to the one before us, it appeared that at the moment plaintiff’s arm was broken, the passenger car, in which she sat, was apposite a boarding car which had been placed on the adjoining track for the accommodation of the company’s workmen. A long horizontal mark on the passenger car and other circumstances indicated that plaintiff’s arm, as well as the car, had come in contact with some object of considerable size and strength, firmly fixed in its position and probably connected in some way with the boarding car, and at the same time tended to negative any inference that the injury could have been caused by a stone or other missile thrown by any person outside. The immediate cause of the injury, however, was not explained. The case having been submitted to the jury with instructions to ascertain from the evidence whether the injury resulted from anything disconnected with the com<a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>pany or not, etc., a verdict in favor of the plaintiff was rendered. After stating the general rule as to the burden of proof, etc., the Court of Appeals said: “ It generally happens, however, in cases of this kind, that the same evidence which proves the injury done, proves also the defendant’s negligence, or shows circumstances from which strong presumptions of negligence arise, and which cast on the defendant the burden of disproving it. For example, a passenger’s leg is broken while on his passage in a railroad car. This mere fact is no evidence of negligence on the part of the carrier until something further be shown. If the witness who swears to the injury testifies also that it was caused by a crash in a collision with another train of cars belonging to the same carrier, the presumption of negligence immediately arises; not, however, from the fact that the leg was broken, but from the circumstances attending the fact. On the other hand, if the witness who proves the injury, swears that at the moment when it happened he heard the report of a gun outside of the car, and found a bullet in the fractured limb, the presumption would be against the negligence of the carrier. It is incorrect therefore to say that the negligence of the carrier is to be presumed from the mere fact that an injury has been done to the plaintiff. The presumption arises from the cause of the injury or from other circumstances attending it, and not from the injury itself.”</p>
    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.5",496,[239,1597,1184,614]]]'>It follows from what has been said that the learned judge of the Common Pleas erred in directing the jury to begin their consideration of the case “ with the fact established that the injuries were the result of negligence of the defendant.” If the case had been submitted to the jury on the evidence and they had found therefrom that the plaintiff’s injury resulted from something connected with the operation of the railroad, and not from something entirely disconnected therewith, and with which neither the company nor its employees had anything whatever to do, that would have raised prima facie a presumption of negligence on the part of the company and thrown upon it the burden tif proving that it did not exist.</p>
