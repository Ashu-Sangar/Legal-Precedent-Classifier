    <p id="b291-7" data-blocks='[["BL_291.7",291,[166,835,1179,512]]]'>1. The defendant could not be compelled to file two affidavits in one action, because of the filing of an amended statement. To permit this would be to encourage fishing statements of claim. As a pleading, the statement may be amended within the limits of the rules of pleading, but as a statement, required by §§ 4, 5, 6, of the act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 271, as a prerequisite to the right to an answer under oath, it cannot be amended after one affidavit of defence has been filed, so as to compel an additional sworn answer. The act contemplates but one statement, and certainly but one affidavit of defence.</p>
    <p id="b291-8" data-blocks='[["BL_291.8",291,[166,1355,1180,653]]]'>2. The act of 1887 requires no affidavit of defence in an action of detinue. It abolishes the distinction between the various actions ex contractu, and between the various actions ex delicto, and directs that “all demands heretofore recoverable in debt, assumpsit or covenant shall hereafter be sued for and recoverable in one form of action to be called an action of assumpsit.” The action of detinue is not an action of debt, assumpsit or covenant: 1 Chitty, PL, 135-9. True, a count in detinue may be joined with one in debt. So a count in trover may be joined with one in case. But, despite the possibility of such joinder, detinue is a remedy entirely distinct from an action of debt, just as trover is an action distinct from one in case.</p>

The principle upon -which the court below acted in fixing the value of the detained title papers and in assessing the damages was erroneous. There was no title in the defendant to the bond and mortgage, except as an express trustee, and if the plaintiff was the regularly constituted successor, the title <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>to the same vested in him by act of the law.

    <p id="b292-9" data-blocks='[["BL_292.9",292,[254,1189,1186,555]]]'>1. Under the old law the copy filed, which was equivalent to the present statement, had to be lodged in court within a limited time, two weeks after the return day. During this period the plaintiff was at liberty to amend his copy and to require an affidavit or a series of affidavits to it. It was only after the two weeks had expired that it ,was held too late to amend and to require another affidavit, since this in effect would prolong indefinitely the statutory period within which a complete and final copy of the instrument sued on must be filed. This was well stated by Thavek, P. J., in Jones v. Gibson, 3 W. N. 329.</p>
    <p id="b292-10" data-blocks='[["BL_292.10",292,[243,1757,1196,652]]]'>2. Then came the procedure act of 1887, passed for the express purpose of facilitating the obtaining of a summary judgment in all cases of contract where a sufficient sworn defence was not filed by the defendant. Thus no limit of time is fixed by §§ 4, 5, 6, within which the plaintiff must file his statement. Whenever filed and served on the defendant an affidavit of •defence is required within fifteen days. How can it be argued, therefore, that the statement as the substitute for the old copy cannot be amended at any time, since even the copy itself could always be amended before the two weeks expired ? The right to amend at any time necessarily involves the right to demand an affidavit of defence sufficient to meet the statement as amended.</p>

      <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>8. The action brought, as originally set forth, though called assumpsit under the procedure act of 1887, was really one of debt to recover a specific sum of money due by reason of a contractual relation. At common law the statement of claim would have been a declaration in debt. The supplemental statement filed by way of amendment had precisely the effect of adding a count in detinue to a declaration in debt, which was always permitted: 2 T. &amp; H. Pr., §§ 1542, 1543. This right to combine detinue with debt arose from the history of these actions, which shows that detinue is no other than an action of debt in the detinet: 2 Reeves’ History of the English Law, Einlanson’s ed., 158. Moreover, the action of detinue is now classed as an action ex contractu: 2 T. &amp; H. Pr., § 1538; Maynadier v. Duff, <a href="/f-cas/16/1255-02" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Cranch 4" data-case-ids="6672234" data-case-paths="/f-cas/16/1255-02">4 Cranch C. C. 4</a>.</p>
    <p id="b293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_293.5",293,[176,1085,1180,509]]]'>4. In answer to the objection that the court had no right to assess the value of the bond and mortgage, it is only necessary to point out that the value of these papers was averred in the statement of claim to be $3,000, and the damage of the plaintiff by reason of the defendant’s wrongful holding of these papers amounted to that sum. This averment was not denied by the defendant, and therefore stood unanswered on the record. Upon the uncontradicted statement, the court was fully authorized to find the value of the bond and mortgage at $3,000.</p>
    <p id="b293-6" data-blocks='[["BL_293.6",293,[175,1602,1181,509]]]'>5. By his wrongful detention of this chattel the defendant has obviously deprived the plaintiff, his successor in office, first, of the interest on the mortgage received during the whole period of wrongful possession, and secondly, of any balance of interest remaining in defendant’s hands, or collected by him and not properly disbursed during the period of rightful possession. This forms the measure of plaintiff’s damage. The burden is on the defendant to discharge himself by showing any properly authorized disbursements of the income received during the whole period of his possession.</p>
    <p id="b293-7" data-blocks='[["BL_293.7",293,[176,2119,1177,238]]]'>6. The answer of the defendant that he held the fund as trustee thereof and had regularly paid the income of it to the boards of domestic and foreign missions, etc., was entirely too vague and indefinite: McCracken v.

And the suggestion that the treasurer of the corporation, and not of the Benevolent Fund, is entitled to the mortgage, is directly contradicted by the words of Mrs. Hertzog’s will, which directs the legacy to be paid “ unto the treasurer for the time being of the Benevolent Fund,” etc.</p>

The defendant set up the receipt of the money, as treasurer of the Benevolent Fund of the Third Reformed Dutch Church of Philadelphia, and its investment in a mortgage, in accordance with the purposes of the trust under which he held it. The plaintiff then filed by leave of court an amended statement claiming a right to have the mortgage delivered up to him.

To what extent or for what purposes the action of detinue still survives, is not a question now before us, but wherever an action of debt would lie before 1887, there assumpsit will now lie.</p>
    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[177,830,1178,819]]]'>The second question is equally free from difficulty. The act of 1887 authorizes the service of a copy of the plaintiff’s claim on the defendant, and requires him to answer under oath. Amendments are liberally allowed in our practice. Where an amended statement has been filed with leave of the court it is competent for the court to make such order for personal service thereof, and for the defendant’s reply, as the justice of the case may require. The plain purpose of the act of assembly is to reach the real point in dispute by the most direct road and in the most expeditious manner consistent with a due regard to the rights of the parties. We see no objection to such a construction as shall secure this purpose; and we accordingly hold that the court allowing an amendment in the statement, may provide by rule or order for its actual service, and for judgment for want of a reply within such reasonable time as it may fix.</p>
    <p id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.6",295,[170,1656,1182,770]]]'>The subject of controversy in this case is a legacy in the will of Mrs. Ann Hertzog given in the following words: “I give and bequeath to my executors the sum of $8,000, in trust to pay over the same unto the treasurer for the time being of the Benevolent Fund of the Third Reformed Dutch Church of Philadelphia, to be applied to the uses and purposes of said fund.” This legacy was to the church for use as part of its benevolent fund. Her executors were to pay it over to the treasurer who might be in office when the time for payment of the money came. The treasurer is charged with no duties or trusts under the will other than those which his office as treasurer of the Benevolent Fund imposed. It is to be paid to him as custodian of the fund for its owner, the church, and is “to be applied to the uses and purposes of said fund,” as those uses and purposes may be indicated by the church.</p>

      <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>This is the fair purport of the words employed by the testator. The church takes the title and the treasurer as the proper officer takes the actual possession. It is his duty to obey the directions of the organization whose servant he is, while his official term continues, and to turn over to his successor the books, papers, and moneys remaining in his hands. This was the duty of treasurer Jones, which he recognized as to all but the legacy of Mrs. Hertzog. He seems to have regarded himself as charged with such duties in regard to this fund as to entitle him to hold it notwithstanding the end of his term. The church directed his successor to institute proceedings for the recovery of it, and this he did in his own ■ name, instead of the name of the church. But like his predecessor he has no title to the benevolent fund or any part of it. When it comes into the treasury he will by virtue of his office have the possession and care of it, subject to the control of the church authorities so long as he remains in office and no longer. Now the facts showing the ownership of the church and the want of title in the plaintiff were set out in the affidavits. It is true that the defendant set up a title in himself which he could not sustain upon the facts presented to the court, but it is equally true, and was equally evident on the record of the court below, that the plaintiff had no title on which a recovery could rest, and for the same reason, viz., that the church and not its treasurer was the owner. The plaintiff was not entitled to a judgment, therefore, and his motion should have been denied for the reason we have stated.</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[520,1807,918,85]]]'>The judgment is therefore reversed, and a procedendo awarded.</p>
