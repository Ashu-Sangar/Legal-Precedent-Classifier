    <p class="summary" id="b463-6" data-blocks='[["BL_463.6",463,[200,656,1178,759]]]'>The question is : Has the interest in that $13,000 mortgage of John J. Ledward been satisfied before the assignment of his estate to Mr. Broomall ? And that is the only question in the case. You can talk about it a week; you can cover the jury with books and documents; but, after all, there is but one question before the jury: has John J. Ledward’s interest in that $13,000 mortgage been satisfied, in any way that was satisfactory to him, before he made his assignment to Mr. Broomall ? Ilis interest was the one fourth of it after his mother’s death. That is the only question in the case. If you find from the evidence that it has; if the evidence satisfies you to a reasonable intent that Mr. Ledward did receive satisfaction for that <em>mortgage </em>in some way before he made the assignment to Mr. Broomall, then the defendants here are entitled to your verdict.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b463-7" data-blocks='[["BL_463.7",463,[200,1432,1180,980]],["BL_464.1",464,[245,341,1192,973]]]'>Now, what is the evidence ? Mr. Ledward is dead; he cannot take the stand; the suit is between an executor and an administrator, and under the law the defendants cannot take the stand. The only witness who is free to tell you all he knows about it is Mr. Broomall. If he knows anything about if, it is his duty to inform you; if he does not do so, you are not to presume that he knows anything about it. It may be that he feels his duty as assignee is such as to prohibit him from voluntarily taking the stand and telling what he knows. In that event, when he was on the stand, the other side could have fully examined him; and I so expressed it. [Now the question is: From the evidence before you is there such evidence as to satisfy you to a reasonable intent — such evidence as will reasonably convince you — that that mortgage was satisfied, as far as Mr. Ledward was concerned, before he made his assignment.] 3 He has stated positively, by his ^solemn declaration under his hand, that it was satisfied; but unfortunately, when he made that declaration, he had no right to satisfy it unless it had been paid before. You are to decide that <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>question by the evidence in the case. It does not always follow that a mortgage is paid on the day it is satisfied on the record. Your experience will tell you that a mortgage may be paid for years before it is satisfied on the record. It must have been paid before you can compel the mortgagor to satisfy it, and even then the law gives him eighty days before he can be sued for not satisfying it. So, you see, the fact that the satisfaction was not made before, is no positive evidence that the mortgage hadn’t been satisfied before that. Now you understand me. The record shows an entry made by John J. Ledward that he acknowledges himself to have received full satisfaction for that mortgage. Now, the question is, when did he receive it ? and the mere fact that at the time he made that declaration he had no right to receive it, is no positive evidence that it had not been paid before, because a man is not bound to enter satisfaction on the record until after he receives actual satisfaction, and it often is the case, as I have just remarked, that mortgages and judgments are not satisfied of record on the day they are paid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-5" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[234,1322,1198,1077]],["BL_465.1",465,[173,356,1181,149]]]'>So you come back to the question: [Did Mr. Ledward receive actual satisfaction before he made his assignment to Mr. Broomall? If you find that he did, then your verdict ought to be for the defendants.] 4 [The first evidence that it has been satisfied at all is his declaration made at the time when he had no right to enter satisfaction on the record; but still, it is his declaration.] 5 He is dead; he cannot take the stand to explain it, but the fact is there. He acknowledges that he received satisfaction for that mortgage. Then, if that were the only occurrence, it might, perhaps, be too doubtful to convince you; and there ought, perhaps, to be some more evidence than the mere fact that he entered satisfaction at a time when he hadn’t the right to receive it. [If he had received it before, mark you, if it had been paid to him, or if it had been in any way satisfied by any family arrangement among those who owned the mortgage; if he had received satisfaction before he made the assignment, there was nothing wrong.in him coming into court and making that declaration just when he did; and, if he hadn’t satisfied it until to-day, but had received the money when he had the right to receive it; if he were alive to-day he would have the right to satisfy <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>that mortgage, susceptible to proof that it had been acttially paid or settled at a time when he had the right to receive the money. You have that fact to start with.] 6</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[169,512,1184,1333]]]'>[What else have you? You have the fact that after he made his assignment, he appointed as his assignee a gentleman familiar with his father’s affairs, the counsel of his father’s estate, a gentleman who ought -to have known, if he did not, how his father’s estate had been settled. If he was the counsel for the estate, and if he represented all the parties interested in that estate, he certainly ought to have known where that estate went, and how it was settled. He appointed a gentleman who had been, or was, the counsel of his father’s estate, as his assignee; he didn’t appoint a stranger that knew nothing about his property; he appointed Mr. Broomall. Mr. Broomall, 1 suppose, came into court and asked the court to appoint two appraisers, who should appraise the estate of the assignor. Those appraisers, I suppose, if they did their duty, inquired what estate Mr. Ledward had. They were sworn to do that. If Mr. Broomall did his duty, he informed them of all the estate he knew that Mr. Ledward had. If Mr. Ledward was honest, it was for his interest to point out all his estate, for it went to pay his debts; it was his interest in law to inform his assignee and inform the appraisers where his property was. An appraisement was made, and it was filed; and it does not say a word about this property being Mr. Ledward’s; not a word; it is perfectly silent. It tells you what personal estate he had; it does not name this.] 7 Now, that is the second piece of evidence that the counsel for the defendants rely upon.</p>

[The third piece of evidence that they rely upon is, that when the assignee had the property for sale, he advertised it subject to a $13,000 mortgage, but he did not say that the $13,000 was due upon that mortgage. He told the purchaser that there -was a $13,000 mortgage against the property find he must look out for that. It was the purchaser’s duty to go and see the holder and ascertain what was due. While he did say it was advertised subject to a mortgage conditioned for the payment of $13,000, he didn’t say it was subject to a $13,000 mortgage. He did not say that and didn’t, mean it. He meant that the mortgage was for <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>$13,000, and that the purchaser was taking it subject to what was due upon that mortgage, but in the same advertisement he names that property as belonging to the three children of Mr. Ledward, and does not name his assignee as having any interest in it.] 8 [Now that is the third piece of evidence upon which they rely; and it does seem to me that these three pieces of evidence in the canse have some, at least, persuasive effect upon the evidence as to whether the mortgage had been satisfied in any way before Mr. Broomall became assignee. It seems to me there was enough to call upon Mr. Broomall, or any other person who knew anything about the case, to take the stand and tell all that he knew about it; and if it has the same effect upon your mind as upon mine, you may consider it, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, sufficient to rebut the presumption that it was not paid. If yon find it sufficient to rebut that presumption, you may, in the absence of all evidence to the contrary, find for the defendants.] 9</p>

They bear upon that question, and you may consider that if they are sufficient to satisfy you that he did receive satisfaction before he made his assignment, then you may find for the plaintiffs.

That is the question. Just keep that before you and direct the evidence in the case to that point, and you ought not to have any difficulty. As before stated, the onus is upon the defendants; they must satisfy you by sufficient evidence that it has been paid, and if the evidence satisfies yon, you may act upon it.

On a scire facias in a court of law, three owners of land are sued by themselves and one other, as joint holders of a mortgage upon their own land. Having thus, in advance of even the wave of legislative reform, brushed aside any little technicalities that might be supposed to stand in the way, the parties went into court, and the original owner of the land and mortgagor being also a party defendant, an appearance and plea were formally entered for him, although it is spread out on the face of the proceedings that he <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>had. been dead more than eleven years before the writ issued. A jury was duly empaneled, and the parties, living and dead, entered on this mixed contest with themselves and each other. What the effect of a verdict and judgment against a dead man, under these circumstances, would have been, we are happily spared from considering, the jury having put an end to the contest by a verdict for defendants. A glimpse of other difficulties is also afforded, at the close of the charge, by the colloquy between court and counsel as to the form of the verdict, if foqnd for the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b472-5" data-blocks='[["BL_472.5",472,[243,881,1188,601]]]'>The proceedings, however, anomalous as they were, had a perfectly regular and legitimate object. Indeed they would have been highly creditable to the .ingenuity of counsel, had they been invented between the date when provincial simplicity put an end to Gov. Keith’s Court of Chancery, and the time when the legislature of the commonwealth waked up to the fact that equitable powers and process are a necessary part of legal machinery, in the complicated civilization of the present century. As it is, they seem to have been carried on by general agreement, and may stand as a survival of the makeshifts by which the early lawyers of Pennsylvania administered equity under the forms of the common law.</p>

A careful analysis, taking much more time than the case should have required, reduces the material facts to the following: John J. Ledward being the owner of certain mortgaged premises, became one of four joint owners of the mortgage, subject to a life interest in his mother; subsequently he made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, and still later, entered satisfaction on the record as to his fourth of the mortgage. The other three holders of the mortgage had, in the meantime, become the owners of the mortgaged premises, and the present roundabout substitute for a bill in equity, was really a proceeding by the assignee for creditors, to charge the land with John J. Ledward’s one fourth of the mortgage.</p>

Ledward’s interest in the mortgage. The learned judge promptly disposed of the legal <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>branch of the inquiry, by ruling that the intervening life interest prevented a merger; and then proceeded to state in very plain and forcible English, adapted to the understanding of the jury, all that was left for them: “The question is, has the interest in that $13,000 mortgage of John J. Ledward been satisfied before the assignment of his estate to Mr. Broomall ? And that is the only question in the case. You can talk about it a week; you can cover the jury with books and documents, but after all there is but one question before the jury.”</p>
    <p id="b473-5" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[164,815,1183,1181]]]'>The assignments of error may be grouped into three classes. The first and second assignments relate to the competency of the inventory of John J. Ledward’s assigned estate, and his entry of satisfaction on the record of the mortgage. The first was clearly competent. It showed that John J. Ledward, his assignee, and the appraisers, in making out a full inventory of his assigned estate, omitted any reference to his one fourth of the mortgage in suit, and thus tended to support the defendants’ contention that it had been previously satisfied. 'The entry of satisfaction by John J. Ledward, after the assignment, may be more questionable, as it was, in one aspect, the declaration of an assignor after parting with his title. But that was not its real legal aspect. Ledward was not a vendor who would be estopped from discrediting his vendee’s title, but an assignor, with a continuing resulting equity in the property, and his assignee had no independent rights of his own, but only those of his assignor and the creditors. Ledward’s entry of satisfaction was therefore a declaration against his interest, and as such admissible, not only against him but against his assignee. Its admission, therefore, was not error, and was carefully guarded by the positive instruction to the jury that Ledward had no right to make the entry at the time he did, unless he had received satisfaction before his assignment.</p>

Of the charge it may be said that some of the comments, notably those in the. eighth assignment, are rather refined and subtle, and that as a whole it may be called a leading charge, <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>as it indicates very clearly to the jury how the judge thought they ought to find. But it leaves the jury clearly free to exercise their own judgment, and therefore did not exceed the legitimate privilege of the judge, especially in a case where the evidence was so nearly all in writing, as to lead the plaintiffs in their second point to ask the judge to take it from the jury and construe it himself.</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[256,712,1190,755]]]'>The remaining assignments relate to the sufficiency of the evidence. It was wholly circumstantial, for the reason that all the parties to the transactions were either dead, or rendered incompetent by the death of the others. The only competent witness who might be supposed to have any personal knowledge was the assignee, who was the substantial plaintiff, and even if he had any knowledge he might well have considered himself restrained from testifying by professional obligations. The evidence therefore was naturally limited to a series of collateral facts, none of them conclusive, or perhaps very weighty, takeU singly, but forming as a whole the fair basis of a conclusive inference by the jury in favor of payment. The jury was properly told that the burden of proof was on the defendants, and there was more than a scintilla in support of the latters’ contention.</p>
