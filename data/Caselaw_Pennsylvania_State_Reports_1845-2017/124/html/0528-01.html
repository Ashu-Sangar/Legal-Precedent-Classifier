It was claimed in her behalf that the intention was manifest from the will, that Harry Maginnis, testatrix’s brother, should receive no other share of the decedent’s estate, than that bequeathed to him, and that the Connor family were to be excluded altogether.</p>

It may therefore be admitted that the testatrix did intend to dispose of her entire estate. Indeed, the whole tenor and scheme of the will indicates clearly that intention. In fact, she carried out that intention fully in the will, subject to a certain contingency: the sale of her property during her father’s lifetime, which, not having happened, the legacy lapsed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b554-9" data-blocks='[["BL_554.9",554,[242,2007,1187,405]],["BL_555.1",555,[174,379,1180,406]]]'>To whom did it lapse? To the other legatees? Not at all. If so it would go to them all alike in equal portions, thus including persons not related by blood or marriage. It could not be held to lapse to Mrs. Ryon, a sister, and not to Harry Maginnis, a brother, in the absence of provisions to that effect. It is undoubtedly true the legacy did lapse, but it lapsed to the estate. While admitting that testatrix intended to dispose of her entire estate, it is clear she failed in carrying out or <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>expressing such intention in language, under the contingency that subsequently arose. The question therefore is not one of intention, but one of fact. Nothing whatever is expressly said in the will, or can be legally implied, as to what disposition should be made of the portion bequeathed to testatrix’s father in case the property was not sold during his lifetime, and hence your auditor holds she died intestate as to that portion of the estate, and will make distribution accordingly.</p>

The estate having been sold after his death, the question arises, how shall the estate be distributed ? Is there sufficient in the will to govern the distribution? or must the fund be distributed according to the intestate laws of the commonwealth?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b555-8" data-blocks='[["BL_555.8",555,[171,1571,1180,562]]]'>The auditor comes to the conclusion that, the father having died before the sale, the legacy to him lapsed; and that his share must be distributed according to the intestate laws. But he also comes to the conclusion that the legacy to Mrs. Clara Ryon did not lapse, and that she is therefore entitled to one half, in addition to her distributive share in the other half as an heir of the decedent. I can see no warrant in coming to such a conclusion from the language of the will. It seems plain that if one legacy lapsed, then the others did also. They must both either stand or fall together. Otherwise from the same language we draw two inconsistent conclusions.</p>

It is a mere guess to say that the decedent intended that Mrs. Clara Ryon should at all events have the one half, or that she should have the whole of it, as is contended for by her counsel.

The court below, overruling <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>tlie auditor, adopted this construction of the will, and the distribution was made accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[182,460,1189,1741]]]'>The estate of the testatrix consisted wholly of her interest under her mother’s will, and it is very plain that her intention was to dispose of the whole. She says : “ As to such estate, as it pleased God to entrust me with, I dispose of the same as follows,” etc. After making certain specific bequests, she says: “ As to the remainder of my interest in the estate of my beloved mother, I direct that after deducting, etc., <em>it </em>shall be disposed of as follows,” etc. It is a matter of little consequence, of course, what her intention was, if she actually failed to make a full disposition; but her intention being manifest, in the words of the will, it would be our duty to carry that intention into effect, if the will is reasonably susceptible of a construction consistent with that purpose. Notwithstanding her obvious intention, we think she failed, in a certain contingency, to dispose of that half which her father was to have, if the sale was effected in his lifetime; but we are inclined to agree with the auditor as to the other half. If the estate should be sold before the death of her father, she directs that one half of the remainder be <em>paid </em>to her father, whilst the remaining half of the remainder of her estate she directs shall be <em>given to </em>her sister. The terms employed in this clause of the will, in view of all the circumstances, may well give rise to doubt as to the testatrix’s meaning. Her father had a life estate in the property, and if it should be sold in his lifetime, she may have supposed it proper, as well as just, that some provision should be made for him, but no such reason applied in the case of her sister Clara. The question is, .whether the contingency expressed in the beginning of this clause applies to the father’s legacy alone, or was intended to extend to the devise or bequest to her sister. The provision for her father is clearly conditioned upon a sale of the land in his lifetime, for his half is to <em>be paid </em>to him; but Clara’s half of the remainder of her estate is to be <em>given </em>to her, which is consistent with the idea that she was to have her half whether a sale was made or not.</p>

It must be conceded that this case is not free from doubt; we are of opinion, however, that we have given effect to the true intention of the testatrix, as it is expressed in her will.</p>
