But the lien of a judgment is one of its attributes, the existence and duration of which is limited by statutory enactment to a period of five years from the date of entry or revival, and no judgment shall continue a lien for a longer period than five years from the day of entry or revival, unless revived within that period. It being impossible to revive the Leiby judgment on Sunday, April 17,1881, the day upon which its lien expired, therefore Mr. Leiby had all of the next day in which to issue a writ: such is his contention. While it is true that the mere issuing of the writ was an act which in consonance with the decisions cited above, he would be entitled to do on the day following Sunday, yet, unfortunately for his contention, the lien of the judgment expired, by the express words of the statute, on Sunday.

Russell, <a href="/pa/40/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="40 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="478809" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0372-01">40 Pa. 372</a>.</p>
    <p id="b302-6" data-blocks='[["BL_302.6",302,[256,917,1186,1383]]]'>The act of May 28, 1858, provides that no action to recover back interest, voluntarily paid, in excess of six per cent, shall be sustained, “unless the same shall have been commenced within six months from and after the time of such payment.” In Edmundson v. Wragg, <a href="/pa/104/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="104 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="452116" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0500-01">104 Pa. 500</a>, a payment of interest was made, May 13,1881; the six months expired November 13, 1881, but that day being Sunday, the plaintiff began his action on the following day; held, that the action was commenced in time and within the limitations of the act. Our brother Steb-BETT, delivering the opinion of this court, in the case cited, says: “Whilst the rule, as a whole, has not always been consistently observed, that clause of it which includes the following Monday in the computation, whenever the last day falls on Sunday, has never been departed from. On the contrary, it has been approvingly recognized and applied in several cases, among which are McKinney v. Reader, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.%2034" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="6 W. 34">6 W. 34</a>; Harker v. Addis, <a href="/pa/4/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="4 Pa. 515" data-case-ids="401844" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0515-01">4 Pa. 515</a>, and Marks v.

A similar principle of computation is applicable to contracts for sale and delivery of goods. For the purpose of performance Sunday is considered dies non, and hence, if the last day happens to be Sunday, it is to be regarded as stricken from the calendar, though intervening Sundays are to be counted: 2 Benj. on Sales, 893, note. Performance of a contract which matures on Sunday may be exacted on the following day: 2 Whart. on Cont., § 897. But negotiable paper is an exception to the rule. When it matures on Sunday, payment should be demanded on Saturday.”</p>

Thus it will be observed, that under the act of April 16, 1827, an appeal to the Supreme Court was to be taken “within twenty days after such decision;” a writ of replevin, in case of distress “ within five days next after such distress taken,” etc.; an appeal from an award of arbitrators “within twenty days after the entry of the award,” and a suit to recover interest paid in excess of six per cent, is not sustainable, unless it “shall have been commenced within six months after the time of payment,” and a scire facias to continue the lien of a judgment must be sued out within said period of five years from the day of entry or revival.</p>
    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[194,1068,1180,601]]]'>Upon a somewhat careful examination of the authorities, we find no case which carries the rule in its entirety to a scire facias on a judgment. In Green’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20827" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 827">6 W. &amp; S. 827</a>, it is held, in partial recognition of the rule in Goswiler’s Estate, supra, that the five years within which a judgment must be revived by scire facias, are exclusive of the day on which it is entered. Our attention has not been called, however, to any case where the precise question under discussion has been raised. But the reasons for applying the rule to the issuing of a scire facias are the same, whilst the language of the act of 1827 is as fairly susceptible of this construction as that of the statutes referred to in the cases cited.</p>

Hampton, 1 S. &amp; R. 411; McKinney v. Reader, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.%2034" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="6 W. 34">6 W. 34</a>. The same result is liable to ensue in the case of a legal holiday. On such days, the office of the prothonotary may be closed; he is not bound by law to keep it open; a legal holiday is ex vi termini, dies non juridicus, and although the act to be performed might be legally done, the officer is not bound to perform it. Such a condition of affairs, when a valuable estate or property or a large sum of money is at stake, might lead to extortion or imposition, or produce the grossest injustice. It was the reasonable apprehension of such results, doubtless, which influenced the legislature in the passage of the act of June 20, 1883, P. L. <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>136. But this slip, if there was one, occurred in 1881, and as the act of 1883 is not retroactive, it can have no effect here. It is plain, however, from the cases cited that it is simply declaratory of the law as it existed prior to its passage.</p>
