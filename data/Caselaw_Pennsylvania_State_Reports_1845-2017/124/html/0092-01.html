J., the undisputed evidence showed that on Sunday morning, November 6, 1887, David Lewis was found dead, upon the upper floor of a stable at No. 447, North.Eighth street, Philadelphia. He lay upon a pile of robes, and one blanket covered all his person save his head. His hands, which were under a blanket when he was found, were stained on the inside with blood. There were several crushing wounds upon his head, and across his feet lay a blood stained stick of wood which had come off a bale of hay, and a heavy iron sash-weight, also stained with blood lay at his shoulder.</p>

The prisoner had also been so employed there a month or so before the homicide, still slept in the stable at night, and the night of the homicide stayed in the same room where the deceased slept, a room perhaps sixty feet square. When he was arrested the morning after the homicide, the prisoner gave contradictory accounts of himself during the night, whether he had slept in the hay-mow, or in a furniture wagon in the large room. The valise and two vests of the deceased were found empty, with blood stains on them: he had been paid some money the day before, and both his money and his watch were missing. No ill-feeling was shown to have existed between the prisoner and the deceased, nor was the conduct of the prisoner, who remained about the stable, in any way suspicious, but upon his clothes were found fresh blood-stains identified by experts called as of human blood.</p>

All homicide is presumed to be malicious, that is, murder of some degree, until the contrary appears in evidence.

Much confusion results from importing into the discussion of murder in the first degree, the principles of the common law relating to murder. The actual intent with which a fatal and unlawful blow was given, was no more a consideration in the common law, than the intent of the man who unlawfully took a bushel of potatoes. The requisite of a murderous blow was, that it should be given with malice aforethought. It is to murder at the common law, and to the “ malice ” contained in its definition, that the presumption of malice from the use of a deadly weapon arises. “ The very meaning of the fiction of implied malice in such cases at common law was, that a man might have to answer with his life for consequences which he neither intended nor foresaw: ” Commonwealth v.
