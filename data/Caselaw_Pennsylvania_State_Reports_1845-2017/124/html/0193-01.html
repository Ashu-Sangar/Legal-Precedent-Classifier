The work was accomplished, how<a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>ever, three years before the testator died, and the only indebtedness remaining was $144. During the time of its building, the testator contributed $728 to the church, which sum the auditing judge finds was meant for other purposes than that which was to be served by the legacy. Here was an ademption, it was contended, by the act of the legatee, by reason of which the church could justly claim only $144 of the sum bequeathed. It is true that a legatee may adeem a legacy to himself, as by paying a debt in testator’s lifetime, which was the subject of the gift: Hoke v. Herman, <a href="/pa/21/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="21 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="411557" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0301-01">21 Pa. 301</a>. But this testator seems to have intended that, to the extent of his legacy, the cost of erection should be paid. He could effect this after the church had been built and paid for, by directing that his gift should be applied to the building fund, and should thus ■ release a corresponding sum for the general purposes of the organization. He said this in almost so many words, when he prohibited the payment until the trustees should be satisfied that no debts remained on the church property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[272,1289,1192,1131]],["BL_221.1",221,[158,386,1177,152]]]'>We do not lay stress upon the fact that a will speaks only from the date of the death, and that the testator must have intended this gift to stand, although its purpose had apparently been anticipated in his lifetime. He may have rested in the belief that the legacy had been adeemed, and that the clause in his will did, not require to be revoked, because it had become, by his act, inoperative. But there was some proof that he regarded it as in full force. Shortly before his death, he replied to the statement which was made to him, that he had given his quota to the church, “ With what is back, I have given my share.” The auditing judge understood, and we think properly, by the words, “With what is back,” a reference to the legacy. Yet at that time the church had been built and paid for, even the small balance of $144 having been assumed by some of the members. While he limited his gift to the specific object of building, he, none the less, meant it for the benefit of the church. On that ground, a legacy to a priest and his successors, in trust to say masses, which in that shape was void as tending to a perpetuity, was upheld in McGirr v. Aaron, 1 P. &amp; W. .49, because it was actually intended for the maintenance of a priest, and was therefore in ease of the congregation. So in Foy v. Foy, cited in 3 Bro. G. C. 593, a gift towards the erec<a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>tion and endowment of a hospital in Dorset, Lord Kenyon said, might go in aid of the endowment of any hospital already existing in that comity.</p>

It is difficult to presume that while the testator contributed $728 towards defraying the cost of the church, he further intended to bequeath the additional sum of $1,000 for its benefit. On the contrary, the natural inference is, that having expended almost the amount he intended for the erection of the building, and thus almost entirely carried out the object contemplated by him, he considered the legacy having the same object in view as partially adeemed; that is, to the extent of $723: Taylor v.

The doctrine of the constructive ademption of legacies has never been applied to legacies to mere strangers, unless under very peculiar circumstances; such as where the legacy is given for a particular purpose, and the portion is afterward, in the lifetime of the party, given exactly for the same purpose and none other. Except in cases standing upon such peculiar circumstances, the rule prevails that such a legacy is not adeemed by a subsequent portion or advancement in the life<a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>time of the testator, without some expression of intent in the instrument or by some writing accompanjdng the portion or advancement. Legacies to children, or to those to whom the testator stands in loco parentis, have repeatedly been decided adeemed by subsequent advancements, on the ground that the law is opposed to giving double portions, where, under precisely similar circumstances, legacies to mere strangers were strictly upheld: 2 Story’s Eq.

In almost every instance, the cases cited by the exceptant, on examination, are found to be in support of exceptions to the rule; the legacies in dispute were held to be not adeemed, and, taken together, they prove conclusively that the legatee in this case is entitled to the full payment of his legacy. The intention of the testator clearly appears to be that the legacy should not be paid over until the church was fully completed and finished, for he so states in so many words; and further, that the church should receive the legacy in full, even after the debts and expenses incurred in the erection of the building were entirely extinguished. The language of the will proves this beyond a doubt.</p>
