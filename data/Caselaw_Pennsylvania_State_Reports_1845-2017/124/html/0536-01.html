Before the trial, the defendant filed a motion to quash without assigning any reasons. This was overruled. The evidence upon the trial clearly made out the case; the commonwealth proving a single illicit connection between the parties, and the defendant admitting he was a married man. The commonwealth thereupon rested. The counsel for the defendant thereupon asked the commonwealth to elect upon which count a conviction was claimed. The commonwealth, instead of resisting the claim, acquiesced in it, and elected to proceed upon the count for adultery. Why they should have acquiesced in this demand of the defendant, we are at a loss to understand.</p>

I cannot realize the force of this objection. It is a matter of every-day practice to join different offences in the same indictment when they are of the same nature; as in indictments for larcency or receiving stolen goods, etc.: Commonwealth v. Gillespie, 7 S. &amp; R. 469; Stevick v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/78/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="78 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1040395" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0460-01">78 Pa. 460</a>. A felony triable in the Quarter Sessions may be joined with a misdemeanor growing out of the same transaction and part of it, and the defendant may be convicted of the lesser offence: Hunter v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20Pa.%20508" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="79 Pa. 508">79 Pa. 508</a>. It necessarily follows that two counts for misdemeanors growing <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>out of the same transaction may be likewise joined in the same indictment, when but a single offence has been committed. It is very usual to charge it in various ways in two or more counts, so as to make the charge conform to any turn the evidence might take, as in indictments charging assault and battery, aggravated assault and battery, and assault and battery with intent to kill, or with intent to commit rape. This is recognized practice: Commonwealth v. Dobbins, 2 Pars. 380; Henwood v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/52/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="52 Pa. 424" data-case-ids="1002188" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0424-01">52 Pa. 424</a>; and the commonwealth is not put to an election on which count a conviction is asked. That is for the jury to say under the evidence. A conviction under the greater offence charged, including a conviction under the lesser, when both are of the same nature; a conviction for adultery, necessarily including the offence of fornication, because the lesser is included within the greater, the commonwealth may claim a conviction under both counts of such an indictment, when the offence has been made out by proper proof. Why should not this be the case when it has been decided that under an indictment charging adultery, the jury may convict of simple fornication ? Commonwealth v. Salman, 1 Leg. Chron. 320. For these reasons I think the commonwealth could not have been compelled to elect upon which count to proceed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b563-4" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[147,1553,1189,666]]]'>But it is useless to discuss this at any greater length. The commonwealth having made its election and the jury having convicted the defendant of adultery and bastardy, the defendant now asks the judgment to be arrested on the ground that the count charging adultery does not aver that Ellen Coliban, the prosecutrix, was not the wife of the said Thomas Gorman; the charge being that the said Thomas Gorman “ did commit the crime of adultery with one Ellen Colihan.....the said Thomas Gorman being then and there a married man and having then and there a lawful wife alive.” This is the question which now confronts us. It is absolutely necessary that there should be an averment that Ellen Cólihan w^s not his lawful wife, in order 'to exclude any inference that she might be.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b563-7" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[144,2224,1187,196]],["BL_564.1",564,[258,368,1187,408]]]'>I find no decisions in this state expressly upon this point, but I doubt whether any indictment was ever adjudged defective, after trial and conviction, which showed by necessary implication that defendant was not either the husband or wife of <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>the person with whom the offence was committed. The fact that the indictment charges the defendant, Thomas Gorman, to have committed the offence with a person by the name of Ellen Colihan would probably be not sufficient to raise such necessary implication; but I think it is necessarily implied in the charge that he did commit adultery with her, he being then and there a married man, the charge of adultery with her necessarily implying that she was not his wife.</p>

I find that the indictment in this ease follows the form as laid down in Wharton’s Prec. of Indictments, 584, and which, according to the foot note, was also the form as laid down in Reed’s Digest, a still earlier publication. I find also that in indictments for fornication in this state, a form of the same kind is used as in adultery, there being no averment that the party with whom the fornication was committed was not the wife or husband of the offender. If the position taken by the defendant in this case is correct, it would be as necessary to insert such an averment in an indictment for fornication as in one for adultery.</p>

This is especially the case when the objection to the form of the indictment is not exposed until after verdict. In the Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.6",566,[278,422,1190,1591]]]'>The indictment in this case contained two counts; one for fornication and bastardy, the other for adultery. During the trial the defendant called upon the commonwealth to elect upon which count a conviction was claimed, whereupon the commonwealth, not challenging the defendant’s right to make such a demand, moved the court to strike out the charge of fornication in the first count, and to amend the second count so as to include the charge of bastardy, which was done accordingly. The effect of this was to charge the defendant with adultery and bastardy, both of which offences had been charged in the indictment as returned by the grand jury. By the amendment nothing was added to, or altered in, the indictment, other than to withdraw the formal charge of fornication, (of which the defendant certainly could, not complain), and to unite the charge of bastardy with that of adultery. This simply affected the form of the indictment, altering no matter of substance. If the first count had been withdrawn wholly, and the defendant had been brought to trial on the charge of adultery, it would have been competent for the jury, in a certain condition of the proofs, to have found him guilty of fornication: Dinkey v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/17/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="17 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="967628" data-case-paths="/pa/17/0126-01">17 Pa. 126</a>. Whether the charge be fornication and bastardy, adultery or seduction, the essential fact which constitutes the crime is fornication; these several offences exist by reason of the several peculiar aggravations, which in each case accompany the perpetration of the crime: Dinkey v. Commonwealth, supra. The charge of adultery, therefore, of which the defendant was found guilty, necessarily embraced the crime of fornication; and, as bastardy was also specifically charged and proven, in further aggravation of the offence, the just and appropriate penalties of the law were, we think, rightly imposed.</p>

That act merely gave us an authoritative definition of adultery, but it defined it according to the understanding which we had of that offence prior to its passage; the essential and characteristic features of the crime were precisely <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>the same before as since the act of 1860.

His case rests upon a sheer technicality. The defect, if there is any, affects the form, not the substance of the charge. That the defendant is a married man, and had at the time a lawful wife alive, is expressly charged, and the fact is admitted; that Ellen Colihan was not his wife is necessarily implied, if it is not plainly expressed, in the words of the indictment. The charge is that the defendant “ did commit the crime of <em>adultery </em>with one Ellen Colihan,” and “ a female <em>bastard </em>child on the body of her the said Ellen Colihan did beget,” etc. The omission of the name of the defendant’s wife is but a formal matter, which should have been objected to before the jury was sworn, and not afterward: Davis v.
