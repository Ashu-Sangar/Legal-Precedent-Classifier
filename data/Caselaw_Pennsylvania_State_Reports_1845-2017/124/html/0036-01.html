    <p class="summary" id="b63-5" data-blocks='[["BL_63.6",63,[214,1413,1178,510]]]'>The Keely Motor, if the proofs exhibited are to be relied upon, produces immense power, and the means used are a little air and water. It has also the self-creating reacting power. It would, therefore, seem to have a similarity with the machine of 1869. It is the principle of a machine, and its results, which give character to it, and not its physical conditions. The principle of steam as a motive power is the same, no matter what the form of the machine maybe in which or by which it is produced. It is still a steam-engine. And so with electricity, or anything from which power is produced.</p>

The evidence of all other's must, in its nature, be useless or misleading. It is enough to say, in this connection, that we cannot regard as satisfactory any of the affidavits presented by the defendant, except his own. Ho says that his invention termed the Keely Motor, is based on the discovery of a scientific fact made long after he ceased to have any business relation with the complainant, and that the <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>said discovery, and the apparatus in which it has from time to time been embodied, has not the remotest similitude to or connection with the invention referred to in complainant’s bill or the assignments thereto annexed, and that the same was not the outgrowth of any experiments made by the deponent at any time during his association with the defendant, and that the complainant never contributed a dollar directly or indirectly connected therewith.</p>

The effect, however, which should be given to evidence, may depend upon not only what is averred, but also upon what is unsaid. The defendant has in no way stated what the principle and machine were which he assigned to plaintiff. He is the only one who could give any information upon this subject and enable us to judge correctly between the contradictory statements of the parties. This information would either corroborate him or corroborate the plaintiff. He has withheld it, and he may not complain if we. are compelled thereby to draw inferences unfavorable to his assertions.</p>

It appeared from some of the papers that, upon the appointment of the commission, the plaintiff had placed in the hands of Dr. Cresson, one of the experts, a sealed envelope containing a particular description of the assigned machine of 1869, which in the order of April 7th, the plaintiff was required to give to the said experts to enable them to make the comparison, which envelope, however, by direction indorsed by the plaintiff was not to be opened and its contents examined until after the experts had completed the investigation of defendant’s machine.

And even on bills of discovery, before discovery can be had, or an order for the production of documents made, an answer is always filed.

An implied proviso annexed to every order of court is, that it can be performed. The defendant protested that he had explained his machine to the best of his ability, and yet, because a majority of a body of strangers did not understand his explanation, he is committed to imprisonment. When a person charged with a constructive contempt, answers to a rule that the matters alleged against him are not true and sets out a state of facts consistent with his innocence and that there was no intention to interfere with the process of the court, he is to be discharged; and it is error for the court to proceed and hear evidence of the truth of the original affidavit and the falsity of the answer: Burk v.

But no court can arbitrarily make that possible, which is impossible. “ The judicial department has no will in any case. Judicial power, as contra-distinguished from the power of the law, has no existence. Courts are the mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing. When they are said to exercise discretion, it is a mere legal discretion; a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law, and when that is discerned it is the duty of the court to follow it. Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge, but always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the legislature ; or, in other words, to the will of the law: ” Chief Justice Marshall, in Osborn v.

The defendant demurred to the bill, thereby admitting all its allegations, which, as he never filed an answer, are still to be taken as admitted upon the pleadings. He at the same time moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction which had previously been granted and continued upon sufficient affidavits. Though the plaintiff had moved for an order to inspect, to enable him to call skilled witnesses to testify as to the identity of the two machines, the defendant became, at this stage, the actor on his own application for relief from a lawful decree of the court.</p>

In such a case as the present, the technical knowledge necessary could be obtained by a court only through a commission such as was appointed. The action of the court in making the order of inspection is sustained by precedents, and the authorities in support of the power of a court of equity to make such an order are neither few nor doubtful: Flight v.

    <p id="b72-5" data-blocks='[["BL_72.5",72,[272,454,1186,511]]]'>We might well discharge the relator upon the insufficiency of the commitment. It is not only vague, but it wholly fails to show the nature of the contempt for which he was committed. As we do not review such cases upon the merits, and only inquire into them so far as to ascertain whether the court had the jurisdiction or power to make the order, it is manifest that in many instances the parties would be remediless unless the commitment sets forth such facts as show jurisdiction. We are not asked, however, to decide this case upon technical grounds.</p>
    <p id="b72-6" data-blocks='[["BL_72.6",72,[267,970,1186,1126]]]'>A certiorari having been issued to the court below, we have before us the record of the case of Wilson v. Keely, and from it we learn that the alleged contempt consisted in a refusal to obey an interlocutory order. If the court had the power to make- the order, we have no doubt it possessed the power to enforce it by attachment, and, if necessary, by imprisonment. It is true, under thé act of June 16, 1836, the punishment of imprisonment for contempt is limited to such contempts as shall be committed in open court. . It is also true that obedience to the lawful process of the court may be enforced by attachment. Imprisonment for contempt committed in open court is imposed as a punishment, and is for a definite period. Imprisonment for disobedience to the process of the court is not so much for a punishment as to enforce such process, and ceases the moment the party purges himself of his contempt by obedience. The power in both instances is essential to the existence of the court. A court that has not the power to protect itself from public insult, or to compel obedience to its lawful process, would be beneath contempt. As to the authority of the court to enforce obedience to its process by attachment, I refer to Tome’s App., <a href="/pa/50/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="50 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="425143" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0285-01">50 Pa. 285</a>; Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>Bennett C. Wilson filed Ids bill in the court below against John W. Keely, claiming to be the assignee of said Keely of a certain principle or machine known (by Keely) as a reacting vibrating machine, “being an independent motor or self-acting, having a revolving globe and other appliances, the said globe being the centre for the dispensation of said motor and power, and where all the actual power is produced, dependent only on itself for this production and reaction unlimited.” The bill avers that since said assignment the defendant has received divers large sums of money from the exhibition of, and sale of interests in, and from the unlawful use of, said invention, and prays discovery relative thereto; that the defendant has neglected and refused to permit complainant “ to have access to and examine the drawings, models, and machines embodying the invention referred to in the assignment hereinbefore named in the possession and under the control of said defendant; ” that complainant believes that the defendant, unless restrained by an order of this court, will sell and assign said invention to others, and dismantle and alter said motor. The prayers for relief, briefly stated, are, that the defendant be enjoined from removing the machines or models known as the Keely Motor, from the shops where the same are now located; from selling, assigning, or using the same; and particularly that the defendant be compelled to forthwith “exhibit to your orator, and permit him to inspect all models, machines, drawings, and descriptions in the possession of the defendant, of the invention referred to in the above named assignments, and known as the Keely Motor.”</p>

A demurrer was filed by the defendant, which appears to have been overruled, with leave to answer over; a commission of experts was appointed to examine the machine, who reported to the court, on October 20, 1888; a rule for an attachment against the defendant was granted, on October 24, 1888, and upon the 25th of the same month the defendant took a rule to dissolve the injunction. I have referred to only a few of the docket entries; they are very numerous, and indicate an especially active and hostile litigation, culminating November 17, 1888, in the commitment <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>of the defendant to the county prison for contempt. The said commitment was based upon disobedience to the order of court of April 7, 1888. This order was as follows:</p>
    <p id="b74-5" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[282,538,1189,1333]]]'>“And now, April 7, 1888, in accordance with the opinion heretofore filed in this case, it is hereby ordered by the court that the defendant, the said John W. Keely, shall within thirty days exhibit to the said plaintiff, his attorneys, and to Charles M. Cresson, Thomas Shaw, Prof. Wm. D. Marks, and Jacob Naylor, Esq., who are hereby appointed by the court as experts, the inventions, machines, or devices referred to in the plaintiff’s bill, and now known as the Keely Motor, and shall then and there in their presence operate the same or cause them to be operated, and explain the mode of constructing and operating to them. And the said experts aré hereby authorized and directed to make such an examination of said machines as will enable them to inform the court as to their identity in construction, principle, or operation with the invention described in the complainant’s bill as having been assigned him in 1869 by the respondent, the said complainant giving the said experts such a particular description of the last mentioned invention as may be necessary to enable the comparison to be made; and the said experts shall further make such drawings of the machine known as the Keely Motor as they may consider necessary for the information of the court, and report jointly or severally; and it is further ordered that the information obtained by this inspection by the complainant and his counsel, or by the said experts, shall not be used for any other purpose than for the proper hearing and adjudication of the present proceeding.”</p>

No answer had been filed, and, of course, there was no examiner or master. At this stage no legal testimony could have been taken. The plaintiff had obtained his special injunction, which vlas duly continued within the five days. There was then no further step which the plaintiff could properly take, except to put the case at issue. After issue joined, an exami-' ner could have been appointed and the proofs taken in an orderly manner. Instead of so proceeding, a commission of experts was appointed to examine the defendant’s machine, and the order of April 7th was made by which the defendant, <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>in advance of any issue, was not only required to exhibit his machine, but also to operate it, and to explain the mode of its construction and operation, although it clearly appeared that it would require considerable expense to .clean the machine, put it together, and operate it. The defendant appears to have been willing to exhibit it, and in point of fact did so. In view of this I have not considered it necessary to review the authorities upon the question of the power of the court to compel him to exhibit his machine before issue joined. That he might have been compelled to do so at a proper stage of the cause, is conceded. But to make an order not only to exhibit, hut to operate it, the practical effect of which was to wring from him his defence in advance of any issue joined, was an excessive and improvident exercise of chancery powers.- It is the more remarkable from the fact that the plaintiff’s case, as shown by the exhibits and drawings, was sealed up in an envelope and retained by the court, access to the same being not only denied to the defendant, but even to the experts appointed by the court.</p>
