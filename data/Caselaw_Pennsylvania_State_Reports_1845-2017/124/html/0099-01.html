They not only had it in their power, but it was undoubtedly their duty to have so expressed it. They did not do so, and not having done so, every intendment is to be construed against them. This is not the kind of a claim that is looked upon with so much favor that it can be established by inferences drawn from ambiguous and uncertain language. Nor are the claimants to be given the benefit of any doubt which arises from the language used by themselves.

If there is any proof that no views and instructions were given to the executors, it must be found in the deed of May 25,1887, for no oral evidence of any sort was presented. It is impossible to gather such proof from the deed. Presumably the testator had communicated views and instructions broad enough to distribute the whole residue. And because the executors erroneously supposed that the will gave the residue to them absolutely, it will not do to hold that there were no views and instructions given to them, and that it is impossible for them to execute such instructions as were given.</p>

In the present case, the trust is an imperative power. Discretion is not given to alter a mode of distribution pointed out by the testator, if they shall see fit. The testator states that he has given certain views and instructions to his executors which will enable them to distribute his estate, and. he- directs them to distribute in accordance therewith.

The words raised a trust, but if a trust is ineffectually created, or not expressed at all, or fails, the next of kin takes. The remark of the testator that he intended that none of his property should pass under the intestate laws, is of little value in interpreting a will. Such an intention can be expressed in one way, only; by making a valid disposition of the whole estate by a will: Duffield v. Morris, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 348" data-case-ids="483295" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0348-01">8 W. &amp; S. 348</a>.

      <em>2. </em>The intent of a testator not to give the beneficial interest to his executors being established, all the learning concerning precatory words becomes useless. The technical term, precatory words, can only be applied to words accompanying a bequest which would be a complete gift of the beneficial interest, were the precatory words absent; but no case can be found wherein it was held that the testator’s words of desire or request addressed to a person from whom he has unmistakably withheld the beneficial interest, can create anything but a trust. Such words, under such circumstances, though precatory in form, are not precatory words technically so called. Hopkins v.

The cases cited by the appellants fail to weaken this proposition; but there are cases which show that where the testator’s intention is to be ascertained, the taker of the estate cannot enjoy it beneficially: Le Marchant v.

For this reason, they inject into their deed an argument that <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>the residue belongs to them; that question, however is a question of law.

    <p id="b136-7" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[248,920,1186,1024]]]'>I. The will of Henry J. Stout clearly created a trust as to the residuary estate disposed of by the fortieth clause. The language is “ I give and bequeath the same to my executors .....to be devoted and given by them to such institutions or uses, as they in their best judgment may consider the most compatible with the views and instructions which I have given them,” etc. What is given to the executors by this clause is not a discretion to distribute the estate according to their judgment, but a discretion to carry out the orders received from the testator. He had his own intentions and scheme of distribution, and he meant that they should control the disposition of his estate to the end. In the circumstances under which he made his will, being apparently apprehensive that his speedy death might avoid some of his bequests to charities, he was obliged not only to commit a large discretion to his executors as to the means to be employed to accomplish his wishes, but to trust entirely to their integrity for its exercise. But his intent that they should follow his judgment, not their own, is entirely clear, and his language to that effect is as mandatory as the nature of the circumstances permitted.</p>
    <p id="b136-9" data-blocks='[["BL_136.7",136,[249,1953,1184,405]],["BL_137.1",137,[158,368,1179,240]]]'>This plain intent clearly separates the case from the class of gifts of an unlimited discretion of disposal, of which Beck’s App., <a href="/pa/116/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="116 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="554331" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0547-01">116 Pa. 547</a>, is the latest illustration. In that case the testator gave his executor “full and unlimited power and authority to appropriate and dispose of the residue.....to such objects, persons, or institutions as in his discretion shall be best and proper.” By this language he clearly substituted the judgment and will of his executor for his own, not only as <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>to the methods of disposal and appropriation, but also as to the objects themselves. The distinction between this and the mere discretion as to the disposition most compatible with the testator’s instructions previously given, is too obvious to need further discussion.</p>

What the trust was, could only be learned through the conscience of the executors. It was not put in writing but communicated to them, presumably orally, in testator’s lifetime. The testimony of-the executors was therefore the only evidence attainable as to the objects of the trust. The testator died in February, 1875, and on May 25, 1877, both the executors being then living, they executed a declaration of trust under their hands and seals, in which after reciting that they had paid all the legacies presently due, and secured those to come due after termination of life estates, they set forth, “ that being the utmost extent (with exceptions hereinafter set forth) to which, after years of reflection, Mr. Stout wished his estate to be applied for either charitable purposes or the benefit of relatives, as he repeatedly declared to executors,” etc. They then set forth that the residue is their own by law, but that nevertheless they deem it their duty, and therefore do appropriate and devote certain sums to purposes that they declare to be in accordance with testator’s instructions, and then finally proceed to divide the remainder between themselves.</p>

By a solemn instrument under their hands and seals, against their interests, that is, against their asserted legal right to the whole of the residue, they declare that they have fully carried out, or provided for, all the objects of testator’s bounty, as expressed by him in his secret instructions to them. What further evidence is attainable ? One of the executors is since dead, and to send the matter back now to the survivor to say whether there are still any unexecuted instructions of the testator, would be to. do the vain thing of asking him to repeat his declaration made when the matter was fresh in his recollection, or to offer to self-interest a premium to stimulate memory to recall further instructions, which -twelve years ago, he and his co-executor <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>solemnly asserted over their hands and seals, not to exist.
