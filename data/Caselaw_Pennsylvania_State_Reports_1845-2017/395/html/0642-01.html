Ilis duties were to deliver coffee and sandwiches to various factories and garages where he could likely sell the food to employees in such factories. Defendants conduct a small auto body shop in a building made of cement blocks on East Washington Street Extension, next to the Ellwood <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>City-New Castle Road, a public road. For 6 days a week and for 6 months prior to the date of the accident on April 29, 1955, plaintiff had sold coffee and sandwiches in defendants’ shop to their employees. On the morning of the accident plaintiff arrived about 11 o’clock a.m., as was his custom, and called “coffee man”. It was a bright day, the sun was shining, the body shop was filled with light, and visibility was excellent. Plaintiff saw a large automobile about 4 feet ahead of him. He walked forward without looking at the automobile because his attention was directed to tools on the floor. As he walked along the floor looking at the floor, his head struck a large plank which was used to raise the body of the automobile from the frame or chassis in order to change frames or make necessary repairs. This 2 by 6 inch plank was 10 feet long. The ends of the plank were equipped with U-bolts attached to chains extending from a pulley which, in turn, was attached to a slide on the garage ceiling. By this means they were able to hoist the body of the automobile and thereby remove the chassis. It extended through the window of the automobile (which was being repaired) from 2 to 4 feet over the floor of the defendants’ shop between the automobile and the East wall of defendants’ shop. Plaintiff testified he struck his left eye on this plank and was knocked to the floor. No one saw the accident as defendants’ employees were at that time in the rear of the shop. There were 24 panes of clear glass in each of the two large gar-age doors in defendants’ body shop and the accident occurred about 15 feet from these doors.</p>

It is obvious from the testimony that he could have seen the plank if he had looked where he was walking. It is indisputable that plaintiff had actual knowledge of the kind of work that defendants performed in this auto body shop and the conditions under which the work was done, because he had come into the shop for 6 days a week for 6 months <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>before the accident occurred. A plaintiff cannot impose liability upon the owner of property if he walks thereon without using his senses; he cannot recover if he blindly walks into a projecting object which was obvious and which he could have seen if he had looked. Failure to look, under such circumstances, or failure to see what was obvious if he had looked, cannot absolve him from contributory negligence.</p>

There is no obligation upon the defendants, in the exercise of reasonable care, to íoIIoav the sun throughout the day to see if it might cast a shadow on any repair job upon which they are Avorking, or indeed upon any part of their shop. To require defendants to MIoav the sun throughout the day in order to attempt to prevent it from casting' a shadow in some part of their shop, or to warn a person in the shop against the shadows of the sun would be to impose a highly impractical and unjustifiable legal burden upon any property owner. Moreover, the fact that one employee and the defendants had on a previous occasion struck their head on this plank AVhile working on the repair of an automobile, neither proves negligence on the part of defendants nor absolves plaintiff from contributory negligence.</p>
