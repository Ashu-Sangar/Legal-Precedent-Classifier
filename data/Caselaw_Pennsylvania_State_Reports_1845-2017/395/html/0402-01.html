Plaintiff, Downing, who was a resident of Erie, acquired knowledge of the fact that defendant wished to sell its property and thereafter contacted the defendant corporation and its Cleveland realty agent, the Maerkle-White-Huxtable-Auble Co. He received, on January 31, 1952, a letter of authority from defendant’s real estate agent to offer the lot to prospective purchasers according to the terms set forth therein.</p>

L. 1216, 63 P.S. §432, as amended, provides, inter alia: “The term ‘real estate broker’ shall include all persons . . . who, for another and for a fee, commission or other valuable consideration, . . . shall negotiate the sale, exchange, purchase or rental, or shall offer or attempt to negotiate the sale, exchange, purchase, or rental, ... of any real estate, interest in real estate, the property of another, ....

He contends, however, that he comes within the exceptions to the definition of a real estate broker found in §2(c) of the act: “Neither of the said terms ‘real estate broker’ or ‘real estate salesman’ shall be held to include within the meaning of this act . . . any person holding in good faith a duly executed letter of attor<a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>ney from the actual owner of any real estate, authorizing the sale, conveyance or leasing of such real estate for and in the name of such owner, . . ., where only one transaction is involved, and where such letter of attorney is recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds, . . . .”</p>
    <p id="b427-3" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[183,704,1150,982]]]'>However, the letters hereinabove set forth are not “letters of attorney” within the meaning of this act. Only one reported appellate ease has interpreted this section of the act. In a per curiam opinion, the Superior Court, in <em>Freeman v. </em>Foster, <a href="/pa-super/121/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="121 Pa. Super. 595" data-case-ids="988348" data-case-paths="/pa-super/121/0595-01">121 Pa.

    <p id="b427-4" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[179,1706,1147,651]],["BL_428.1",428,[246,368,1143,485]]]'>Certainly, the letters received by plaintiff in this case did not give him the right to consummate all the terms of a sale, including the arriving at a price, deciding how the price should be paid or the type of warranties to be given. He had no right or authority to execute a deed “for and in the name of such owner”. As the court below said in its opinion: “An examination of the letter from H. Colin Wright dated August 11, 1953, reveals no resolution of the corporation,- no power to execute a deed and no power to receive the consideration paid. The plaintiff had obviously no power to sell for the sum eventually agreed upon in <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>the amount of $185,000.00, and had no power to do anything further than to negotiate for his principal. In other words, he was no more or less than a real estate salesman or broker in the usual sense of the words. This relationship is further made clear by the letter from Maerkle, White, Huxtable and Auble Co. referred to above which states, ‘This listing is not exclusive with you and subject to prior sale. This authority is for three months from date.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[245,873,1143,259]]]'>The letters held by plaintiff are the same sort as those held by any licensed real estate broker. To hold such letters take the place of a license would be to completely emasculate the Act of 1929 and defeat its purposes.</p>
    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.6",428,[240,1151,1147,1200]],["BL_429.1",429,[187,361,1146,208]]]'>Second, the letters authorizing the plaintiff to offer the real estate for sale were unrecorded at the time the plaintiff performed the services for which he is here seeking compensation. Downing allegedly acted in conformance with the authority contained in the letters during 1951, 1952 and 1953. The real estate was sold on December 18, 1953, at which time none of the letters which he had received were recorded. The alleged “letter of attorney” was not recorded until August 19, 1957, when plaintiff recorded the two letters from the defendant set forth in their entirety earlier in this opinion. Thus, when the plaintiff acted as a real estate broker, he did so illegally because the letter, whatever its nature or effect, was not recorded as required by the act. The later recordation, even if valid, would not make legal what was previously illegal. This Court has held that even obtaining a real estate license would not insulate against illegal acts done prior to licensing. “Subsequent compliance with the law will not vitiate illegality existing at the time of prior transactions, nor effect an enforceable cause of action to supplant one declared by the Legislature <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>to be unenforceable.” <em>Custis &amp; Co. v.

    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[186,590,1146,540]]]'>To hold that a letter of attorney could be recorded, as here, four years after the services for which compensation is sought, would effectively vitiate the purpose for which the statute requires that “letters of attorney” be recorded. The protection afforded to the public by requiring that these letters be recorded would disappear if the holder of such a letter could effectively record it prior to starting suit thereon and many years after the services for which he is seeking compensation had been performed.</p>
    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.6",429,[183,1152,1148,868]]]'>Plaintiff cannot recover in this action for an additional and perhaps even more fundamental reason, i.e. this present suit is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. In 1954, in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, this same plaintiff brought suit against this same defendant for compensation for services allegedly rendered by plaintiff in procuring a buyer for the same piece of land. In this suit plaintiff asserted “his claim for 50% of the realty commission which was payable to Mr. Auble [as aforesaid] for services rendered on a quantum meruit basis”. The court granted the defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiff moved to amend his complaint so as to state a quantum meruit action exactly as he now states it in this present complaint. This motion was denied. No appeal was taken.</p>

As we said in Hochman v. Mortgage Finance Corp., <a href="/pa/289/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="289 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="1103335" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0260-01">289 Pa. 260</a>, 263, ‘The thing which the court will consider is whether the ultimate and controlling issues have been decided in a prior proceeding in which the present parties actually had an opportunity to appear and assert their rights. If this be the fact, then the matter ought not to be litigated again, nor should the parties, by a shuffling of plaintiffs on the record, or by change in the character of the relief sought, be permitted to nullify the rule. This is a universal rule. . . . State Hospital v. Con.

However, it seems to us that both actions are between the same parties, cover the same transaction, and seek compensation on a quantum meruit basis. Even if the first action was on an express contract this second suit would still be barred. The crucial issue in both actions is whether the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for performing services which only .a licensed real estate broker may legally perform. Section 16 of the act, previously quoted, bars recovery of “compensation” by an unlicensed real estate broker on any theory. It makes no difference whether recovery be posited on an express contract or on a quantum, meruit basis.</p>
