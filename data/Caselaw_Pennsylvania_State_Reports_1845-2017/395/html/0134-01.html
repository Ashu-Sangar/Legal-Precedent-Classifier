After the new trial motion had been denied and sentence of life imprisonment, as fixed by the jury’s verdict, had been imposed upon the defendant, he appealed the judgment of sentence to this court. Here, he assigned as trial error the same reasons which he had relied upon in the court below.

    <p id="b156-6" data-blocks='[["BL_156.7",156,[237,1789,1145,431]]]'>Pursuant to the trial procedure which obtains in Greene County (where Fletcher’s trial was had), as well as in many other counties of the Commonwealth, a juror who has been examined on his <em>vow dire </em>and accepted by both sides is immediately sworn upon his being accepted and is not again sworn. In short, the jury, when completed, is not sworn as a body, each juror having been sworn separately.</p>

These matters, concerning jurors one and seven, were not known to the defendant at the time those jurors were selected and sworn. When the motion to challenge was made, the defendant had twelve peremptory challenges left. The trial judge ruled that the proposed exercise of challenges came too late and, accordingly, denied the motion. This ruling Fletcher assigned as trial error on his appeal to this court. It was then fully considered by us and rejected for the specific reason that “Since defendant made no objection to the Court’s failure to discharge these jurors until after the jurors had been sworn, the verdict cannot be challenged because of any juror’s disqualification ...” In the course of our discussion of the issue thus raised by the appellant we quoted from Section 9 of the Act of May 17, 1939, P.L. 157, 17 PS §1340, just as the court below had done in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial. Section 9 provides that “After jurors are sworn without objection all objections to their qualifications as prescribed by this act or to the manner of their selection, drawing, or summoning .shall be deemed to have been waived.” It so happens, however, that the Act of 1939 is applicable to third class counties whereas Greene County, the venue of Fletcher’s trial, is a sixth class county.</p>

As there enunciated, “The time to challenge is before the juror is sworn; if not exercised then, the right is waived. That waiver may be relieved against when the party affected has been intentionally misled or deceived by the juror or the opposite party. . . .” Then followed the observation that “it is not even pretended there was anything of the kind in this case” — a circumstance that is equally the situation in the case now before us.</p>

Here there was no deception by the juror or anyone as to the fact; no effort was made to elicit such information; the failure to do so and to make objection at the proper time operates as a waiver [citing authorities from various jurisdictions].” The <em>Walker </em>case was also an appeal by a defendant from a sentence imposed upon a conviction for murder in the first degree.</p>

It is to be observed in this connection that . . . when he was drawn as a juror in the defendant’s case he was accepted and sworn without being interrogated by counsel <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>on either side as to his qualifications .... [The disqualification] would have been disclosed, if he had been interrogated at the time he was sworn, but the defendant voluntarily omitted to avail himself of the means at his hand for informing himself and the court upon the subject. He preferred, perhaps, to hold them in reserve to be used in the event of an adverse verdict, as he had a perfect right to do, if the position of his counsel is correct. We think, however, that their position is not tenable.”</p>

This fully answered the defendant’s objection to juror number one who was a son-in-law of a county detective, a witness in the case. And, as to juror number seven, the relationship between her and the victim of the homicide was that of a second cousin, once removed; that she and the deceased had lived twenty-five miles apart; and that they had never visited each other during their lives.</p>

Speaking for the Court, Mr. Justice Holmes said, “There is no question that the State Court had jurisdiction. But the much abused suggestion is made that it lost jurisdiction by trying the two indictments together. Manifestly this would not be true even if the trial was not warranted by law. But the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has said that there was no mistake of law, and so far as the law of Pennsylvania was concerned it was most improper to attempt to go behind the decision of the Supreme Court, to construe statutes as opposed to it and to hear evidence that the practice of the State had been the other way. The question of constitutional power is the only one that could be raised, if even that were open upon this collateral at<a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>tack, and as to that we cannot doubt that Pennsylvania could authorize the whole story to be brought out before the jury at once, even though two indictments were involved, without denying due process of law. If any question was made at the trial as to the loss of the right to challenge twenty jurors on each indictment, the only side of it that would be open here, would be again the question of constitutional power. That Pennsylvania could limit the challenges on each indictment to ten does not admit of doubt.”</p>

I would also wonder, with two such interested persons on the jury, what has happened to the pristine neutrality that we always ascribe to an Anglo-Saxon jury.

In any event, if we erred then, there is no reason to repeat the error. It cannot, and should not, be said that there comes a time when a verdict cannot be challenged because of a juror’s disqualification.

We have authority under the powers of the King’s Bench to see that justice is done, and when a man is immured in the penitentiary for life on a verdict rendered by a jury, two members of which wore beneath their robes of supposed impartiality the badge of partiality, it is our function to reverse and not to say that “we can only look at the record to see whether a judgment exists, and have no power to say whether it is right or wrong.” A Court has no right to close its eyes to what is wrong.

The District Court denied the writ holding that the proceedings depriving petitioner of his constitutional right to assistance of counsel were not sufficient “to make the trial void and justify its annulment in a habeas corpus proceeding, but that they constituted trial errors or irregularities which could only be corrected on appeal.” The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, but the Supreme Court of the United States reversed, declaring in translucent and unmistakable language that: “True, <em>habeas corpus </em>cannot be used as a means of reviewing errors of law and irregularities —not involving the question of jurisdiction — occur<a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>ring during the course of trial; and the ‘writ of habeas corpus cannot be used as writ of error’. These principles, however, must be construed and applied so as to preserve — not destroy — constitutional safeguards of human life and liberty. The scope of inquiry in <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings has been broadened — not narrowed —since the adoption of the Sixth Amendment. In such a proceeding, ‘it would be clearly erroneous to confine the inquiry to the proceedings and judgment of the trial court’ and the petitioned court has ‘power to inquire with regard to the jurisdiction of the inferior court, either in respect to the subject matter or to the person, even if such inquiry . . .
