    <p id="b373-4" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[181,929,1148,1035]]]'>Article III, §20 prohibits delegation to any private corporation of “any power to make, supervise or interfere with any municipal improvement, money, property or effects, whether held in trust or otherwise, or to levy taxes or perform any municipal function whatever.” This provision has been discussed in a number of cases but <em>Lighton v.

There, a taxpayers’ suit was successfully instituted to enjoin the township from proceeding to float a bond issue which contained a trust indenture wherein the trustee, a private corporation, was appointed in the general role of paying agent with power to operate the municipal improvement in event of default. This Court held that the plain language of the Constitution prohibited the township from delegating any authority to the private trustee whether the municipal property was used in a governmental or proprietary capacity.</p>
