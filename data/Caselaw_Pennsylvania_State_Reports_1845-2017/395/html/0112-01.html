    <p id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.5",134,[229,732,1146,581]]]'>A lien was filed against the defendant-property owners for excess water and sewer rents pursuant to the Act of May 16, 1923, P. L. 207, as amended, 53 P.S. §7107. Subsequently, an amended Writ of Sci. Fa. was issued and served on defendant to which defendant filed an affidavit of defense and counterclaim. The City filed a motion for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defense and also preliminary objections to the defendant’s counterclaim. After both motions were sustained the defendant took this appeal from the judgment of the lower court.</p>

    <p id="b135-4" data-blocks='[["BL_135.5",135,[179,765,1147,1317]]]'>Appellant contends that the purpose of this section is to impose on the City a requirement of due notice before they can either shut off the water or assert a statutory lien for delinquent water and sewer rents. This contention is devoid of merit. Obviously, the purpose of Title 19, Section 1606(3) is to provide the City with an additional remedy if the water user refuses to pay the delinquent bills. In pursuit of that additional remedy and before water service may be discontinued notice is required. We do not find any relationship between this section and the power of the municipality to assert a statutory lien against the premises for the purposes of collecting delinquent water and sewer rates. Both remedies are separate, distinct, and alternative; the election of one does not preclude the other. It is clear, therefore, that the purpose of Title 19, Section 1606(3) was to authorize the Department to shut off the water in order to give the Department a lever which would enable it to force the payment of past due water rents as well as prevent the accumulation of a larger delinquency. The failure of the City to use this facility does not affect the enforcement of the lien since neither the legislature or the City Council made the legislation interdependent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <blockquote id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[236,796,1145,429]]]'>“There can be little doubt that an owner of real property is aware, or should be aware, that when water is being furnished to its premises by the Water Department of the City of Philadelphia a statutory charge is periodically made for its consumption and that if the owner is not receiving the bills for this charge they are most likely being delivered to the address of the premises involved.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[235,1238,1145,432]]]'>“Likewise, as between the owner and the City, the sole and primary duty for the payment of this charge is that of the owner.

If the owner desires to limit or curtail this agency relationship he may notify the City that he wishes all bills and communications concerning the water supply to be furnished to him, or make sure of the proper conduct of the agency by a periodic reading of a water meter located on its premises.</blockquote>

Co.)), Avhere the Court said: ‘We may add, however, that as between the City and the registered owner, it is the latter who is responsible for the tenant he places in possession of his premises.
