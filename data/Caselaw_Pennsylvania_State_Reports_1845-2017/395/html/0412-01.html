The Yellow Cab Company joined as additional defendants the City of Philadelphia, John P. Meehan &amp; Son, (herein called Meehan), Philadelphia Gas Works, Philadelphia Transportation Company and the Philadelphia Electric Company (herein called Electric Company). Prior to trial and by stipulation of the parties, the Philadelphia Gas Works was dropped as a defendant; during the trial, a verdict was directed in favor of the Philadelphia Transportation Company.

Chestnut Street, a one way street eastwardly, runs generally east-west, 33rd Street runs north-south and Woodland Avenue runs northeasterly-southwesterly and diagonally intersects both Chestnut and 33rd Streets. Immediately prior to the accident, the cab, in which Mrs. Rodgers was a passenger, was proceeding in a northeasterly direction on Woodland Avenue, and had stopped southwest of the west curbline of 33rd Street in the extreme right-hand lane on Woodland Avenue, for a traffic light. Directly in front of the cab a large truck had stopped and a trolley car had halted on its left. When the traffic light turned green, the cab driver, intending to turn east on Chestnut Street, followed the truck across the intersection, and,' at approximately the east curbline of 33rd Street, the right front, and subsequently, the right rear, wheel of the cab dropped into a hole or excavation. The size and width of the truck apparently permitted its wheels to clear the hole.</p>
    <p id="b435-5" data-blocks='[["BL_435.6",435,[170,1759,1147,589]]]'>The excavation, 6 to 8 inches in depth, had been dug by Meehan under a contract with the Electric Company for the relocation of one of its conduits. The Electric Company had been issued a permit for the excavation by the City of Philadelphia. Three employees of the Electric Company, apparently employed in a supervisory capacity, were at the work site, one of whom had plotted the course over which the ditch for the conduit was to proceed. The excavation ran from a point several blocks south of the intersection of Woodland Avenue and 33rd Street north to the intersection.</p>

Meehan and the Electric Company contend that judgment n.o.v. should have been entered in their behalf because the record clearly demonstrates, as a matter of law, that the negligence of the cab driver was the sole proximate cause of the accident. Yellow Cab argues in the alternative that a new trial should be granted since the court below erred in charging the jury on negligence and as to certain elements which were to be considered in assessing the damages. Meehan and the Electric Company argue that they are entitled to a new trial because the court below failed to adequately charge the jury on proximate cause and because the verdicts were excessive.</p>

He stated that there was nothing at the exact point where the accident occurred to indicate that a hole had been dug, and that, after the accident, he observed the hole, approximately 6 inches in depth and 10 inches in width and running about 2 feet into Woodland Avenue, and it seemed to be an extension of the ditch that ran along the east curbline of 33rd Street.</p>

He further testified that a crosswalk of timber would then be constructed for pedestrians, and that another barricade would be placed in the ditch from the end of the crosswalk to approximately the point to which the excavation had progressed. However, the witness stated that he had no knowledge as to how far the work had advanced on the date in question, whether or not the barricades that he described were there at the time, and did not know that an accident had taken place until a year later.</p>

Although the evidence raises the question whether or not the cab driver, having knowledge of some type of construction or excavation in the immediate area and within ten feet of the site of the accident, used sufficient care in his observation of the condition of the street, that question, as previously stated, was for the jury. There was no evidence whatsoever to indicate that the cab driver had definite knowledge of the perilous condition created at the point of the accident by the “first actor [s]” Meehan and the Electric Company. In fact, since the cab driver’s negligence is predicated upon his failure to use due care under the circumstances to observe the defect, it would be impossible to conclude that at that same time he had definite knowledge of this identical condition.

But if Johnson, through inattention to the condition of the highway or for any other reason, was negligent in failing to see the excavation until such time that the collision, even if Johnson had been careful thereafter, could not have been averted, such negligence on his part would not relieve Meehan and the Electric Company from liability for their original act of negligence — leaving an unguarded excavation in the highway — which would remain as an equally contributing cause of the accident.

The point read: “If you find that the Yellow Cab operator saw the piles of dirt and wooden barricades at or near the <em>northeast </em>corner of 33rd Street and Woodland Avenue when he was stopped for the red light at the <em>southeast </em>corner before crossing 33rd Street, and if you find that he thereafter drove into a hole or excavation at or near the <em>northeast </em>corner, then you may find that the Yellow Cab Company was negligent.” (Emphasis supplied) As a matter of- fact, the dirt and wooden barricade and the excavation into which the cab was driven were at the. <em>southeast </em>corner, while the cab was stopped for the traffic light at the <em>southioest </em>corner. Yellow Cab urges that because the court mistakenly referred to the <em>northeast, </em>rather than the <em>southeast </em>corner, the jury was left with the impression that the operator could be held negligent “. . . if he was aware that there was or might <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>be some construction under way somewhere in an undefined ‘area’, even if the physical evidence of the construction was outside the driver’s possible range of vision.” Aside from the fact that the court repeatedly and distinctly advised the jury that it alone was to determine the facts, and that counsel for Yellow Cab raised no objection to the reading of the point at trial, appellant’s argument as a practical matter is untenable. We cannot reasonably believe that the jury would completely disregard the testimony of three witnesses, a diagram of the area and a thirty-six page charge of the trial judge, all establishing the position of the barricade and the hole or excavation into which the cab was driven as being on or near the <em>southeast </em>corner, and from a single statement in a point for charge, which apparently passed unnoticed by all counsel, conclude either that the barricade or the situs of the accident were located at the northeast corner when it had not been previously mentioned in any of the testimony.</p>

On the contrary, the instruction . . ., in effect, told them they could award compensation for Mrs. Rodgers’ pain, suffering, and disability, past, present and future even if due to arthritis.” The justification set forth in the court’s opinion that “There went to the jury absolutely no evidence of any aggravation of a pre-existing condition” is a negative approach to the problem. What the trial judge should have done and completely failed to do was to instruct the jury in a positive manner that if Mrs. Rodgers’ injuries, with the exception of- the pain in the right shoulder, were due to an arthritic condition, no recovery could be allowed for such injuries. In this respect the trial court committed harmful and reversible error.</p>

Tbe <em>Longden </em>case; supra, relied upon by the court below, casts no doubt on the inadmissibility of such evidence. Not' only did the trial court admit such evidence but in its instructions to the jury <em>three </em>times in <em>one </em>paragraph of the charge the jury were told that they could take the decline in the gross receipts of appellees’ business- into consideration. No attentive jury could have failed, acting upon the court’s instructions, to give consideration to the decline in gross receipts of the appellees’ business in arriving at a loss of Mrs. Rodgers’ earnings or earning power. The justification given by the court below both for the admission of such evidence and the instruction thereon,— i.e. the failure to object by Yellow Cab’s ■ counsel — is without basis on the record. The record shows the following episode during the direct examination of Mrs. Rodgers: “Q. Do you attach any reason for the apparent decrease in the amount of gross receipts over those years? Me. Lexden : That is objected’ to. The Court : Objection overruled. The Witness: Well, I wasn’t there to help,, and, naturally, • the business deteriorated because, of the lack of my presence.” After-the court’s charge the following episode took place: “Mr. Veldoraue [Counsel for City of Philadelphia] : . . . I don’t think that partnership figures could be used as a basis for the loss of earnings. The partnership is not a litigant in this case. Therefore, the figures should not be taken as a standard of loss to the business. They, the partnership figures, show a steady decline, and this happened in March, 1955. I don’t see the relevancy of saying that was responsible for the decline of the business. .. . ’</p>

An examination of the charge indicates that the court clearly left the jury under the impression that it could consider any decline in the gross earnings of the business after Mrs. Rodgers’ injury in determining her loss of earnings or earning power.
