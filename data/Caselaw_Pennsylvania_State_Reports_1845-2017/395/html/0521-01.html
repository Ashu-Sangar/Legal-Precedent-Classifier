Page and Robbie Mae then went to her apart<a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>ment. Defendant spent much of the evening of August 24,1957, searching for Robbie Mae. At about 1 o’clock on the morning of August 25, 1957, defendant went to Robbie Mae’s apartment. Although Page was in the bedroom at that time, defendant stayed in the kitchen and did not discover Page, who was drunk and lying in his shorts across Robbie Mae’s bed. Robbie Mae testified she slept on a couch in the living room. Defendant questioned her and stated that if he found them together he could “promise a good killing”. Defendant then went home and loaded 8 bullets into an automatic pistol. After a restless sleep, he arose about 5 a.m., armed himself with his loaded pistol and walked nine blocks to Robbie Mae’s apartment. He was a powerfully built man and was a former sparring partner of ex-heavyweight champion Ezzard Charles. He entered the apartment by breaking the door with his shoulder and found Robbie Mae in the living room. Immediately upon his entrance he cocked his pistol. At gun point he forced Robbie Mae into the bedroom where he saw Page on the bed dressed only in his shorts. Putting the gun to Page’s face, defendant dragged Page by the neck onto the floor of the living room where a scuffle ensued. During the scuffle the gun was discharged and defendant shot himself in the finger. When Robbie Mae tried to dissuade defendant from his obvious purpose, defendant turned upon her and shot her through the shoulder, knocking her to the. floor. Page regained his feet and ran toward the only door of exit from the apartment. Defendant fired two shots at Page. The first shot missed but the second hit Page in the center of his back, knocking him to the floor, face downward. As Page tried to rise from the floor of the room defendant stood directly over him and shot him again, this time in the chest. Defendant then turned to Robbie Mae, who was prone on the living room floor (from <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>the bullet wound in her shoulder) but who was still pleading with defendant to stop shooting, and shot her again, this time in the lung. Bobbie Mae recovered from the shooting, but Page died from his wounds within a few hours.</p>

S. 74</a>, (decided November 24, 1958), the Court held that a wife could not testify against her husband who was charged with a violation of the Mann Act, although she could testify against him “where the husband commits an offense against the person of his wife.” Mr. Justice Stewart, in a concurring opinion, aptly said: “The rule of evidence we are here asked to re-examine has been called a ‘sentimental relic’. It was born of two concepts long since rejected: that a criminal defendant was incompetent to testify in his own case, and that in law husband and wife were one. . . . Any rule that impedes the discovery of truth in a court of law impedes as well the doing of justice. When such a rule is the product of a conceptualism long ago discarded, is universally criticized by scholars, and has been qualified or abandoned in many jurisdictions, it should receive the most careful scrutiny.”</p>

It was unequivocally and conclusively established that he killed Page by firing revolver shots into his body. An eyewitness testified to seeing Clanton’s revolver accomplishing the fatal deed. The defendant himself admitted firing the mortal shots. The corpus delicti was proved beyond question.</p>
    <p id="b549-5" data-blocks='[["BL_549.6",549,[193,904,1148,475]]]'>There was thus no necessity whatsoever of introducing photographs of the dead body. Nevertheless the Commonwealth exhibited to the jury two gruesome pictures of the corpse. The defendant objected on the ground that their introduction would inflame the jury against him. His objection was overruled and, on being convicted, he assigned this ruling of the Trial Court as a reason for a new trial. It is a reason which has merit.</p>
    <p id="b549-6" data-blocks='[["BL_549.7",549,[191,1402,1148,755]]]'>I believe that the time has arrived for this Court to declare that the exhibition of gruesome and repellent photographs, when they are not a necessary link in the chain of evidence against the accused, will constitute a trial error of sufficient gravity to require a retrial of the case. This case would have been an excellent vehicle for the promulgation of such a policy because the manner in which the objectionable photographs were displayed in the courtroom was especially reprehensible. Enlarged to poster size they were attached to a billboard next to the jury and there they remained <em>throivghout the trial, </em>unremittingly searing the eyes of the jurors with their horrible, provocative, and grisly appeal.</p>

What purpose could such an exhibit have except that of whipping up the resentment of the jury against the man charged with the anatomical mutilation they were never allowed to forget? The issue in the trial was not: Who killed Page? — Everyone knew it was the defendant Clanton. The issue was: Did Clanton have any justification in taking the life of Page? Clanton said he shot in self-defense. He explained why he thought he was justified in firing at Page. The eyewitness Robbie Mae related what she saw. What could be added to this definitive testimony by the unceasing projection of the photographs of the dead body? They could only produce an ever-increasing animosity against the perpetrator of the mortal act, whether he was justified or not.</p>

Even Marc Antony did not expose Julius Caesar’s wounds to the populace of Rome <em>that </em>long.</p>
