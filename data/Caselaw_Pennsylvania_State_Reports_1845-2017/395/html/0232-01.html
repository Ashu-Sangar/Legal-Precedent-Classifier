He was 21 years old, he had been to school only 6 years, and he was not represented by counsel. Eight years after his conviction, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging (1) that his pleas of guilty were the result of coercion and threats by State officers; and (2) that at no stage of the proceedings was he advised of his right to or given the benefit of counsel. His petition was dismissed by the hearing Judge without a hearing. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed the Order dismissing his petition on the ground that he was entitled to present evidence to support his allegations, since, if true, they showed that his right to due process had been abridged. The distinction between that case and the instant case is clear. In this case he Avas represented by reputable counsel, and his testimony that his conviction was obtained by coercion and threats was denied by the Commonwealth’s witnesses and was disbelieved by the jury. In the <em>Herman </em>case the allegations which were made by relator concerned matters which were dehors the record; whereas in this case defendant’s material allegations were refuted by the record and, we repeat, were decided adversely to him by the jury.</p>

This contradicts every rule of relevancy, it ignores every standard of competency, it strikes down centuries-old safeguards erected in behalf of the accused. We have always looked with horror upon ex post facto laws. To punish a man for an act which, when committed, was not part of the criminal code, is flagrantly unjust, but this decision goes further.

Why? The Majority Opinion says that the correction can only be made by the Legislature, but it was not the Legislature which made the error. The error was perpetrated by this very Court. In 1928, Chief Justice von Moschziskee led this Court astray in the case of <em>Commonwealth v.

The Act of 1925 merely said: “Every person convicted of the crime of murder of the first degree shall be sentenced to suffer death in the manner provided by law, or to undergo imprisonment for life, at the discretion of the jury trying the case, which <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>shall fix the penalty by its verdict.” It will be noted that the Act says absolutely nothing about investing juries with the same authority exercised by judges in studying a defendant criminal’s past. Chief Justice von Moschzisker read into the Act something which was not there, which was not contemplated by the Legislature, and which is contrary to the most fundamental concept of restricting a jury trial to but one issue, namely, innocence or guilt of the defendant.</p>

The criminal courts of the Commonwealth have not been vested with the powers of eternal judgment.

      <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>I said in the <em>Thompson </em>case and I will say today that the piling of error upon error does not finally add np to infallibility. And nntil this Court corrects the error of the past in mis-reading, mis-interpreting, and mis-applying the Act of 192o I shall continue to dissent each time the subject comes before us.</p>
