The robbery did not come to the attention of the police until several months later when a “fence” was apprehended in Cleveland, Ohio while attempting to negotiate a block of stock representing about one-third of the stolen stock.

Judged by this criterion the record amply justifies the instant decree. The court below well summarized Dr. Myers’ testimony: “The alleged incompetent testified in his own behalf. His testimony, in part, was coherent and responsive; in other parts, vague, meaningless, and unresponsive. He testified he never knew Dr. Holt; the name of Farmer was familiar to him, and he thought he knew him (Dr. Farmer) ; he did not remember the occasion of Dr. Farmer testifying in Court on October 17th; he did not recall signing a revocation of the letter of attorney; he could not recall, although ‘it may be though,’ signing a Trust Agreement (hereinafter commented upon); as far as he knew, he turned over his securities to the petitioner, Mr. Baer (actually, they were turned over to the trustee under the Trust Agreement) ; he could not recall the names of his attorneys; when asked by his counsel whether or not he signed the Trust Agreement and revocation of the Letter of Attorney, he replied, ‘it looks like mine’; when asked where he was when he signed the two documents referred to, he said: ‘I think it was at the police station, the two young men.’ Subsequent testimony indicates that the Trust Agreement referred to was signed in the office of his co-counsel, Mr. Coho. When asked whether he read the Trust Agreement, he replied: ‘I might have read it, I don’t know’; when asked by the hearing judge on November 17th whether <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>he recalled seeing him at the initial hearing, Dr. Myers replied, he could not recall; nor could he recall the occasion of the hearing Judge asking him whether he had any objections to Mr. Shreiner withdrawing from the case as his attorney.” This testimony clearly reveals Dr. Myers to be forgetful, disoriented, confused and so susceptible to suggestion that he has become, unfortunately, mentally incapable of handling his own affairs and likely to fall victim to designing persons. An examination of Dr. Myers’ own words and conduct, fortified by the opinions of two disinterested and qualified physicians, constitutes evidence of such quality as to clearly preponderate over both the presumption of and proof of mental capacity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In reaching this conclusion we place little weight upon the opinions of the petitioner and Officer Rineer whose opinions were based on legally unsubstantial factors nor upon the testimony of the nephew and nieces whose opinions, even though not colored by interest, were based on very infrequent observation and upon factors which are in no manner controlling on the subject of mental capacity. A review of this record clearly and convincingly indicates that the court below in finding Dr. Myers incompetent was fully justified by the evidence.</p>

Tbe exact amount paid by Dr. Myers for these installations is difficult to determine from tbe evidence. In any event, Robert B. McCullough, manager of tbe Lancaster Branch of tbe Holland Furnace Company, which installed tbe equipment, testified that tbe amount paid by Dr. Myers was $15,105. <em>A careful examination of the evidence can lead to no other conclusion hut that Dr. Myers was substantially oversold. </em>For example, a new hot air furnace (electrically operated) and a new automatic gas hot water heater were installed in Dr. Myers’ property at No. 410 N. Water Street at a cost of $1,315. Tbe property, however, is neither wired for electricity nor connected for gas. After the installation and the expenditure of $1,315, the property was appraised by a real estate broker at $2,750.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>
