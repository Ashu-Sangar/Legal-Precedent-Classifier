While the takers would not enter into enjoyment of his estate until his death the class closed as of the death of his wife.

The fact that for a period of approximately 19 years, well aware that the factual situation contemplated in the will could not occur, testator did not change his will does not alter the situation. We are bound to construe this will according to its language. In expounding a will the question is not what the testator meant but rather what is the meaning of the words which he employed. That is not to say that a testator’s meaning when apparent should <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>be disregarded.
