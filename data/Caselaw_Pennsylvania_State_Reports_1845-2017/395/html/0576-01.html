They have contracts with surrounding municipalities and townships providing for garbage removal and disposal on their land. In addition, numerous pieces of garbage removal equipment and storage facilities have been furnished by the appellees. Their land is situated one to three miles from the nearest neighbors and is principally a series of abandoned strip mine locations. They had been granted licenses to operate by the Township of Find-lay and also have licenses from Allegheny County and the Bureau of Mines of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>

However, Section 13 of the ordinance prohibits the hauling and disposition into Findlay of any of those materials which originate “from without the township.”</p>

The court granted a preliminary injunction, which became permanent after the chancellor’s adjudication that Section 13 was unconstitutional in its application to the appéllees.' The Township of Findlay filed exceptions which were dismissed by the court <em>en bane. </em>This appeal followed.</p>

Appellants Avould have us believe that they are regulating the quantity of garbage disposed in the toAvnship by. limiting the disposable garbage to that which originates within the township, and thus they are serving to protect the health and general welfare of the township residents. , Superficially, we cannot quarrel with this view, but in effect the ordinance as drafted declares that garbage from without, regardless of quantity, is harmful and deleterious, but that local garbage, regardless of amount, conforms more to the community’s health and general welfare standards. The distinction sought to be made is both artificial and.devoid of merit.</p>

As was said in <em>Ex parte Lyons, </em><a href="/cal-app-2d/27/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="27 Cal.

The existence of the county line in a particular position has no kind of ■relation to the evil which the ordinance apparently seeks to remedy. In these circumstances the ordinance provisions appear to us purely arbitrary, and by that token unenforceable. . . .” The court there held the ordinance unconstitutional, arbitrary and discriminatory. In <em>Wiggins v. Town of </em>Somers, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20N.E.2d%20869" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="149 N.E.2d 869">supra,</a> the Court of Appeals of New York held a similar ordinance to be constitutional by a four to three vote. The situation presented there can readily be distinguished from the one in Findlay Township because the New York record was replete with references to complaints, odors, insects, vermin, rodents, and smog and smoke from the burning of garbage. There are no such facts existing in this case. On the contrary, there is every evidence that the appellees received no complaints throughout the period in which they operated this garbage disposal area and it is also clear that every sanitary precaution was taken. Even so, three judges in their dissenting opinion in <em>Wiggins </em>said at page 874: “This prohibition against the dumping inside the town of Somers of garbage ‘originating’ outside this town and its attempted distinction between ‘local’ and ‘foreign’ garbage is obviously unrelated to public health or sanitation. It is, therefore, an unconstitutional interference with the lawful business conducted by plaintiff under permits issued by the County Health Department and in compliance with the rules of that department. The ordinance does not regulate the quantity of garbage dumped nor the manner in which it is handled, transported or disposed of . . . [citations omitted].”</p>

Here, the record remains barren of any evidence that disposal of garbage is a nuisance in fact or complained of or directly or indirectly depreciating the value of contiguous property, or interfering with the health standards of the community. Instead, the operation is conducted according to the sanitary landfill or trench burial method. At regular intervals the garbage is covered with soil bank that was taken from the coal strip mining operations in accordance with the method approved and used, by the United States Army, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the County of Allegheny. Numerous inspections have revealed no violation in appellees’ operations or that a nuisance is being conducted. Even though the sustaining of Section 13 would substantially curtail the appellees in their business, which might be offensive to aesthetic tastes, this is no palpable reason or justification which would uphold the validity of such an ordinance. It is arbitrarily capricious, discriminatory and unconstitutional.</p>
