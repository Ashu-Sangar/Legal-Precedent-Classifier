The complaint alleges that plaintiff, an individual residing in Hazleton, Lu<a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>zerne County, and trading as Craig Mack Truck Sales, entered into a contract with defendant, a Pennsylvania corporation having its principal offices in Johns-town, Cambria County, whereby defendant agreed to sell to plaintiff twelve truck bodies. These truck bodies were to be placed on trucks which were to be sent for that purpose by plaintiff to Johnstown. Plaintiff avers that the trucks were sent by him to defendant in accordance with the agreement, bodies were installed, and upon receipt by plaintiff he attempted to deliver them to a purchaser, Schuek, whose place of business was in Tamaqua, Schuylkill County, but the latter refused to accept them because of faulty construction.</p>

Venue, (a) Except as otherwise provided by an Act of Assembly or by subdivision (b) of this rule, a personal action against a corporation or similar entity may be brought in and only in (1) the county where its registered office or principal place of business is located; (2) a county where it regularly conducts business; (3) the county where the cause of action arose; or (4) a county where a transaction or occurrence took place out of which the cause of action arose.”</p>

If it was at the premises of the defendant or of the purchaser, S chuck, or at any other point not in Luzerne County, then the cause of action did not arise in Luzerne County.

However, all that plaintiff avers that might bring his complaint within this provision is that he, at Hazleton, “placed an order” with the defendant. This is not an averment that a contract was made there. Consistent with the complaint the order may have been placed by telephone, <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>letter, telegram or personal contact with an agent of the defendant. There is no mention of the time or place of acceptance. The place of making a contract is not where the offer is made but where it is accepted. Restatement, Contracts, §74; <em>Linn v.

See <em>County Construction Co. v. Livengood Construction Co., </em><a href="/pa/393/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="393 Pa. 39" data-case-ids="1279565" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0039-01">393 Pa. 39</a>, 43, <a href="/citations/?q=142%20A.2d%209" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="142 A.2d 9">142 A. 2d 9</a>, 13. Under the Illinois rule it has been held that venue does not depend on the place of execution of a contract but that venue will lie in the county in which either of the parties signs,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> although the mere mailing of an estimate and a letter preparatory to the making of a contract is not sufficient.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> But there is one significant difference between our rule and the provision in the Illinois Code. The Illinois Code provides venue may be in the county where “the transaction or some part thereof occurred”. If our rule so provided there would be no difficulty in confirming jurisdiction in Luzerne County, for it is obvious that the placing of an order is part of a transaction. It becomes significant, therefore, that while we adopted the rule from <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>Illinois we deleted that part of the rule which authorized venue in any county wherein a “part of the transaction” occurred. The framers of our rule must have intended to require that a transaction (in this case the malting of a contract) and not merely some part of the transaction, take place in the county where venue is laid. It would lead only to confusion and a practice which we have heretofore referred to as “forum shopping” if the law were to permit suit to be commenced against a corporation in any county where any facet of a complex transaction occurred.</p>
    <p id="b154-4" data-blocks='[["BL_154.5",154,[267,968,1145,369]]]'>Nor do we understand the word “occurrence” to mean “part of a transaction”. On familiar principles of <em>ejusdem generis </em>the word “occurrence” would not have a broader meaning than “transaction” so as to conform it to “part of a transaction”. Viewed in this light the complaint is not sufficiently clear to justify venue in Luzerne County.</p>
