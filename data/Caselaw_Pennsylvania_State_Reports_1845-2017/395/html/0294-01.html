Friedberg, Mollye Friedberg and Lee B. Friedberg trading as Harrisburg Window Cleaning Company (hereinafter referred to as “employer”). The second case involved a decision and order of the Board which found that the same employer engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act of June 1, 1937, P.L. 1168, 43 P.S. <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>§211.1 <em>eb seq., </em>in the discharge of one of its employees.

In <em>Martino v. Michigan Window Cleaning Co., </em><a href="/us/327/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="327 U.S. 173" data-case-ids="413870,413982" data-case-paths="/us/327/0173-01,/us/327/0816-04">327 U.S. 173</a> (1946) the Court held that a window cleaning company’s local intrastate work of cleaning windows on premises used by its customers in the production of goods for interstate commerce was an occupation <em>necessary </em>to the <em>production of goods </em>produced in those plants. This was a case interpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the question was whether the employee of the window cleaner was working in a “process or occupation necessary to the production” of goods for interstate commerce. In 1949 Congress saw fit to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act so as to exclude local window cleaners from its coverage, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20Stat.%20911" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="63 Stat. 911">63 Stat. 911</a> (1949), <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7203" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §203">29 U.S.C. §203</a>(j) (1952), <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7203" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §203">29 U.S.C.A. §203</a>(j). In the House Report on this amendment it was specifically pointed out that the result in the <em>Martino </em>case provided coverage by the Act for employees in occupations which were <em>too remote </em>and <em>merely incidental to interstate commerce, </em>H.R. Rept. No. 1453, 81st. Cong., 1st. Sess., 14-15 (1949). The situation we are faced with here is also distinguishable from that in <em>Kirschbaum v. Walling, </em><a href="/us/316/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="316 U.S. 517" data-case-ids="368176" data-case-paths="/us/316/0517-01">316 U.S. 517</a> (1942) and <em>Borden Co. v. Borella, </em><a href="/us/325/0679-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="325 U.S. 679" data-case-ids="6157634" data-case-paths="/us/325/0679-01">325 U.S. 679</a> (1945). <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>These were cases which arose under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the employees were engaged in general maintenance work, including operating elevators and making repairs, as opposed to only window cleaning. There is no other <em>judicial </em>authority for the proposition that this type of activity is included as interstate commerce. However, in 1955 the National Labor Relations Board without citing any authority decided that window cleaning for commercial and industrial establishments that were engaged in commerce would include the employer business as interstate commerce, <em>City Window Cleaning Co., </em><a href="/citations/?q=114%20N.L.R.B.%20906" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="114 N.L.R.B. 906">114 NLRB 906</a> (1955). It must be borne in mind that in this case the jurisdictional amount found by the Board was more than their established minimum. Although there is no doubt that the coverage of the National Labor Relations Act is considerably broader than the Fair Labor Standards Act, the <em>Martino </em>case and subsequent Congressional action taken as a result thereof points out the remoteness of the effect that window cleaning has on interstate commerce. This being the case there seems to be a real question as to whether or not the activity of the employer is such that “affects commerce,” but, even accepting the proposition that window cleaning of buildings involved in interstate commerce is an activity covered by the National Labor Relations Act, we still have the question of whether or not this particular employer’s activity is not excluded for another reason.</p>

    <p id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[181,567,1147,427]]]'>The <em>de minimis </em>doctrine has been adverted to on several occasions by the United States Supreme Court although it has not been called upon to stake out this lower boundary. <em>NLRB v.

    <p id="b319-5" data-blocks='[["BL_319.6",319,[180,1006,1149,1367]]]'>The court has never confirmed the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board over an enterprise as small as the one involved in this case. We are not concerned here with the production of goods by the employer, but rather his activity was a service. All the cases in which the theory of <em>de minimis </em>has been asserted involved a question of amounts of goods produced or purchased. Now we have a case of a local window cleaner whose total yearly business is $40,-165.70 of which only $12,462.00 even remotely has anything to do with interstate commerce. It is possible to say that every purely local business has some no matter how slight an effect on interstate commerce. But, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in <em>Polish National Alliance v. National Labor Relations Board, </em><a href="/us/322/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="322 U.S. 643" data-case-ids="6145074" data-case-paths="/us/322/0643-01">322 U.S. 643</a> (1944), at 650: “Scholastic reasoning may prove that no activity is isolated within the boundaries of a single State, but that cannot justify absorption of legislative power by the United States over every activity.” The present case would seem to be one to which Justice Frankfurter was alluding. Here the business of the employer is so small, so trivial, and so insignificant that if the courts do not characterize this business as <em>de minimis </em>then that doctrine has no meaning.</p>

This is not a valid argument. As has been pointed out before, the employer’s business was remote and incidental. The appellees urge us to envision a situation where the interstate transportation carried on by these companies is simultaneously tied up because of a labor dispute with the instant employer who is an independent contractor. The only situation which could bring about this type of tie-up would be one in which the employer, having a disagreement with his unionized employees, employs nonunion men to perform the work on these various companies’ windows and the employees in turn were to picket the jobs. Aside from this possibility being very remote, there need not be any tie-up because there is nothing in the record which shows that the railroad and the other companies could not engage another window cleaner contractor, thereby ending any right of employer’s union employees to picket these areas. Even so, labor disputes are not interminable; usually they are resolved within a comparatively short time. The effect that uncleaned windows will have on com<a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>merce pending settlement of the dispute is at most negligible.</p>
