Napoli, trading and doing business as Seven-Up Bottling Company of New Kensington, (hereinafter called employer), had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act of June 1, 1937, P. L. 1168, 43 P.S. §211.1 <em>et seq. </em>The second and third cases involved the dismissal by the board of a petition for investigation and certification of representatives which was filed by Brewery and Soft Drink Workers, Local No. 86, of the International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal, Soft Drink and Distillery Workers of America, AFL-CIO. Following these decisions, the employer' filed petitions for review of the board’s final orders in the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County. The court held that the board had no jurisdiction over the employer and set aside the orders.</p>
    <p id="b323-4" data-blocks='[["BL_323.5",323,[196,1581,1145,477]]]'>■ The facts are not in dispute. Employer is a distributor of Seven-Up soft drink in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and is franchised by the Seven-Up Company in St. Louis, Missouri. The franchise agreement provides that employer must purchase its Seven-Up from the St. Louis company. Also, the St. Louis conipany may cancel the franchise if the employer fails to comply with its policies relating to extract, quality control and cleanliness.</p>

    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.6",324,[221,1067,1149,649]]]'>Where the activity of an employer affects or may affect commerce, state labor relations boards do not have jurisdiction over labor disputes. As we pointed out in the <em>Friedberg </em>case, the field is pre-empted by the Federal Government which invested the National Labor Relations Board with exclusive jurisdiction and this exclusiveness exists even though the National Board refuses to assert its jurisdiction because of its self-imposed standards. <em>Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board, </em><a href="/us/353/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="353 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6159102" data-case-paths="/us/353/0001-01">353 U.

    <p id="b324-6" data-blocks='[["BL_324.7",324,[219,1729,1146,373]]]'>There is no question but that the employer in this appeal is engaged in an activity which materially “affects commerce”. <em>National Labor Relations Board v. Seven-Up Bottling Company of Miami, </em><a href="/f2d/196/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="196 F.2d 424" data-case-ids="499295" data-case-paths="/f2d/196/0424-01">196 F. 2d 424</a> (5th Cir. 1952).

      <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>Appellant argues that employer’s activities were <em>de minimis </em>and hence, is not included in the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. In the <em>Friedberg </em>case we held that a local window washers’ activities were <em>de minimis </em>and did not “affect commerce”, therefore, holding that the Pennsylvania Board’s jurisdiction was not ousted. The facts in the instant case clearly show that the employer’s business is quite different from that of the employer in <em>Fried-berg. </em>Here the employer is engaged in a non-retail manufacturing business while in <em>Friedberg </em>the employer was engaged in selling a service. Also, in <em>Fried-berg </em>the employer’s only connection with interstate commerce was indirect — he had no connection with nor was he under the control of any national business as the employer in this case. Here the employer is manufacturing and distributing a nationally advertised product and purchases approximately $44,000.00 worth of supplies from outside the state. These differences are basic in the determination of whether or not an employer is engaged in an activity “affecting commerce” within the meaning of the national act.</p>
    <p id="b325-3" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[195,1583,1145,319]]]'>For the above reasons it is clear to this Court that the employer is engaged in the business which “affects commerce” so that the National Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction over it in the matter of labor practices even though the National Board would not take jurisdiction because of its jurisdictional minimum.</p>
