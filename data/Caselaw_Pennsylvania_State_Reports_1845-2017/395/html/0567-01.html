Appellants contend that the <em>exclusive </em>method for the removal of school district officers, such as a secretary and treasurer, is provided by art. V, §514 of the School Code of 1949,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which states “The board of school directors in any school district, except as herein otherwise provided, shall after due notice, giving the reasons therefor, and after hearing if demanded, have the right at any time to remove any of its officers . . . for ineompetency, intemperance, neglect of duty, violation of any of the school laws of this Commonwealth, or other improper conduct.” On the other hand, appellee justifies appellants’ summary removal on the basis of art. VI, §4 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides “Appointed officers, other than judges of the courts of record and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, may be removed at the pleasure of the power by which they shall have been .appointed.”</p>

In the <em>Muir </em>case it was stated (pp. 235, 236) : “Though section 406 is new legislation, in that no provision like it appears in prior statutes, yet, . . . long before their mention in the Act of 1911, school treasurers were in the class of appointed officers recognized by the organic law of the State; so it cannot be doubted that article VI, section 4, of the Constitution, making such officers removable only at the pleasure of the appointing power, applies to them, and the law as ruled in the Sulzner Case controls: . . .” In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. v. Hiltner, </em><a href="/pa/307/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="307 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1138123" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0343-01">307 Pa, 343</a>, supra, we held that a borough treasurer could be removed at the pleasure of the body which appointed him, recognizing that the language of art.
