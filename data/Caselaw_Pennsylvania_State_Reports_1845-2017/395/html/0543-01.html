The facts therein were: Caldwell, from whom the plaintiff Caldwell derived his title, in consideration of $1800, conveyed to one Greer, his heirs and assigns, 2 parcels of land (described by metes and bounds) one a 6 acre parcel and the other a 10 acre parcel. The words of conveyance were: “Also, the full right, title and privilege of digging and taldng away stone coal, to any extent [Greer] may think proper to do, or cause to be done, . . .” under Caldwell’s land. Eleven years later Greer conveyed an undivided one-half of the premises to one Case and the other one-half to one McCune. Two years later Case conveyed to McCune his interest which McCune later conveyed to one Bell. Four years later Bell and McCune partitioned among themselves the entire 16 <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>acres together with the coal thereunder. Four years later McCune “leased” both his land and coal to Fulton and the latter began digging for coal. Caldwell sued Fulton in trespass for removing coal from the Caldwell land. The court below held that Caldwell’s deed to Greer did not constitute a grant of the fee in the coal. Mr. Justice Strong, speaking for this Court, thus analyzed the Caldwell-Greer deed: (1) in the description of the grant no limits were fixed upon the extent to which coal might be taken and Greer’s right to take the coal was “coextensive with his will”; (2) in view of the law’s recognition that one man may own the surface and another the mineral rights, both are landowners and both are holders of a corporeal hereditament, coal and minerals in place being considered land; (3) there are two methods in which the subject matter of a deed may be described; (a) by a description of the land itself (as by metes and bounds or by name) and (b) by a designation of the usufruct or dominion over the subject matter — “the grant of a thing can be no more than the grant of the full and unlimited use of it”; (á) the description of the coal in this deed by the designation of Greer’s dominion over it and by the conveyance of the whole use of the coal and the absolute dominion over it amounted to a grant of the coal itself; the language of Caldwell’s deed to Greer expressed absolute dominion and complete enjoyment over the coal, “1-Ie [Greer] could take out coal to any extent. He could cause it to be taken out to any extent, and at all times under any of the land. He was accountable to no one . . . but the right to take the coal itself was absolutely unlimited.”</p>

Mr. Justice Strong, in distinguishing decisions in other cases, particularly of the English courts, noted that (a) if the <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>grantee’s right to remove coal was only for a limited purpose, such as his own fuel, such limited right negatives the “exclusiveness” essential to a sale of coal in place; (b) if the coal was to be paid for by grantee <em>only </em>when mined and taken from the ground on the basis of each ton <em>taken, </em>then an element of a sale is lacking in that no consideration would have passed and there was no obligation nor undertaking on grantee’s part to “search for or take any [coal].” The test enunciated in <em>Caldwell </em>— long and well recognized — is that when “the intent [of the agreement] is to give the entire usufruct and power of disposal [of the coal], the legal title must be held to pass”; otherwise, not. •</p>

Although, at first blush, the test thus laid down would seem to have ignored the third principle initially enunciated, namely, that a stipulated consideration must have been paid or that the agreement must have contained an express provision requiring the mining or removal of coal in order to constitute a sale of coal in place, an examination of a related doctrine, apparently overlooked by earlier decisions, refutes this belief.

In the absence of any express covenant or obligation to mine with due diligence or of any minimum royalty provision, the lessors-grantors find themselves in the position wherein they have parted with title to the coal without having provided, through inadvertence, ignorance or improvidence, an obligation on the part of the lessee-grantee to actually mine and remove the coal and thus secure payment for the coal granted. If it were the law that the absence of either or both provisions leaves the lessors-grantors without any redress a grave injustice would result not only to them but also to the public interest which is concerned with the development of the natural resources of the state. The third requirement originally set forth, therefore, loses its significance when viewed in the light of the implied but nonetheless well-recognized and accepted requirement to mine with due diligence. Later decisions, moreover, have squarely placed the determination of the existence of a sale of coal in place on the language of the mining agreement rather than upon the existence of a definite term, lack of obligation or covenant to mine, or provision for payment on a tonnage basis as factors decisively negativing the existence of a sale of the coal in place.</p>
