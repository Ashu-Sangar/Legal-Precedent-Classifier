The General Electric Company stock distribution of 1954, presently in issue and described by the corporation as a “change and conversion”, involved the issuance of three new shares of stock with a par value of $5.00 for each old share of stock with a stated value of $6.25. The required par value of $15.00 for the three new shares was obtained by a “write-down” to the par value of the new shares of the stated value of each old share and a transfer of the necessary balance from “reinvested earnings” to the capital stock account. The life tenant urged and the court below held that this capitalization of earnings furnished a proper occasion for an apportionment.

In substance, the Rule provides that, upon the happening of an apportionable event, a life tenant is entitled to receive profits and earnings of the corporation accumulated and undistributed since the settlor’s death or the trust’s acquisition of the stock, so long as the intact value of the trust principal to be preserved for the remainderman is not impaired: <em>Earp’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/28/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="28 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="981664" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0368-01">28 Pa. 368</a>. The formula used to apply this Rule may be described briefly in the following steps: (1) the intact value of the stock held by the trustee on which the stock distribution was made must be determined;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>' (2) the intact value must be divided by a value per share assigned at the time of the apportionable event to determine the number of shares which must be retained to protect the intact value;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> (3) if intact value is protected, and additional shares remain, the dollar amount to which the life tenant is entitled must be determined, that is the amount of earnings accumulated and undistributed by the corporation since the acquisition of <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>the stock by the trust or the death of the settlor; (4) the value per share to be divided into this amount must then be ascertained to determine the number of shares to which the life tenant is entitled; (5) any shares remaining after this calculation are retained in principal. It is readily apparent from an examination of the Buie that its purported equitable propensities are governed entirely by the values that are assigned to determine intact value, the value per share used to preserve intact value, and the value per share used to distribute the accumulated earnings to the life tenant.</p>

The value selected should approximate as closely as possible the value per share used to determine the original intact value so that the <em>status quo </em>of the remaindermen may be maintained. As a matter of logic and consistency, we believe that for the purpose of preserving intact value, stock, after a stock dividend, should be valued at book value. Book values of the stock on the comparable dates — the date of testator’s death and the date of the apportionable event- — are more closely related since such values are based on the same provable and somewhat more stable elements than those upon which market values depend. As Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Stern stated in <em>King Estate, </em><a href="/pa/361/0629-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="361 Pa. 629" data-case-ids="476361" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0629-01">361 Pa. 629</a>, 635, 636, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.2d%2068" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="66 A.2d 68">66 A. 2d 68</a>: “The <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>necessity of preserving intact value does not mean a preservation in the sense of the estate’s actually obtaining the amount of that intact value in cash, but only a preservation of its book value; intact value and market value are, for this purpose, wholly unrelated; many stocks sell on the market for less than one-tenth of their book values, while other stocks, especially if speculative in nature, sell for many times their book values; the value of a stock in the market depends upon a myriad of factors other than the actual inventory value of the company’s assets as reflected in the books of the corporation”. <em>Booh value </em>of the stock at the time of the apportionable event is the yardstick to be employed to determine the number of shares of stock, if any, which must be retained by the trustee to protect the intact value. Such a conclusion is in line with our previous adjudications.</p>

The payment to the income beneficiary arises from the shares of stock distributed by the corporation as an extraordinary stock dividend after enough shares have been set aside to protect the intact value. The remaindermen argue that market value, not book value, should be employed in this calculation, while the life tenant argues the converse. The theory of the remaindermen is that if the life tenant were to immediately sell the shares apportioned to her, the amount of the accumulated earnings represented by such shares would theoretically be received. They lose sight of the fact that what is apportioned by the Rule are the <em>shares of stock </em>contained in the extraordinary dividend, and that the purpose of the Rule is to make an equitable and fair division between the life tenant and themselves of such shares of stock. In most <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>cases market value is higher, even substantially higher, than book value. When it comes to the protection of the intact value of the trust corpus the remaindermen are insistent upon the use of book value; when it comes to the ascertainment of the number of shares to be allocated to the life tenant they want as few as possible allocated, and urge market value as the measuring stick. With the employment of book value to preserve intact value, the remaindermen have received their share of protection; the same value should be used in the protection of the life tenant- — usually the primary object of the decedent settlor’s bounty. If we were to adopt market value as the criterion in this respect, the remaindermen may well receive additional shares of stock to which they are not rightfully entitled, namely any shares remaining after the life tenant has received the number of shares at market value equal to the accumulated and undistributed earnings. To avoid such a result and to deal as equitably as possible with both the life tenant and the remainderman, book, not market value, should be used to determine the number of shares to which the life tenant is entitled.</p>

The claim of the life tenant now is for unrealized gains; <em>and Ms error is in assuming that a paper profit is as good as a cash </em>profit, <em>and that the amount of the paper profit can be fixed with accuracy.” </em>(Emphasis supplied).

No hard and fast rule can or should be promulgated to the effect that the unrealized appreciation of a corporation’s assets should be considered in determining the book value of that corporation’s stock in <em>every </em>instance; in large measure, <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>each factual situation must be considered sui generis.

For instance, a fiduciary, in apportioning an extraordinary stock dividend of Corporation X payable on July 1, must ascertain the book value of Corporation X’s stock upon that date; Corporation X carries Whiteacre upon its books either at a nominal value or at cost-of-purchase value, but on July 1, the value of Whiteacre would be based upon opinion evidence as to the market value of Whitacre upon the record date; the establishment of such enhanced value would require the production of evidence and the end result would ordinarily be the establishment of a value based upon real estate experts’ opinions of what Whiteacre <em>might </em>be sold for on the record date. The inclusion of such enhanced value as an item to be considered in determining book value in such a situation would be productive of more, not less, litigation in the field of apportionment, of more expenses and costs to be borne by the trust estate and would render more unworkable than ever the Pennsylvania Rule.</p>

The yearly revaluation of the securities in the company portfolio ■ by the company represents a reappraisement of part of the company’s capital assets. An increase in such valuation is concededly not earnings but it does cause an increase in book value.
