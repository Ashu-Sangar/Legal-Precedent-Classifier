Whatever rights the widow might have therein arose only upon the death of the insured; and she then acquired, only such rights as the Legislature chose to give her by statute, and these statutory rights could, as we have seen, be changed or modified or increased or destroyed by statute.

The trustee had this policy in its possession at the time of Henderson’s death. Upon a proper accounting by the inter vivos trustee, the Orphans’ Court would have jurisdiction to determine title to this fund and the widow’s rights therein, since the Orphans’ Court is given jurisdiction over inter vivos trusts.</p>
    <p id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.6",251,[215,1303,1149,981]]]'>However, the question here involved arose before the Orphans’ Court not sur an account of the inter vivos trustee but sur the widow’s election to take against her husband’s will<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">*</a> and against his alleged testamentary conveyance of his assets,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">**</a> and therefore jurisdiction in the Orphans’ Court can attach only if it is granted by §11 (d) of the amendment to the Estates Act of 1947 dated April 1, 1956. One of the main purposes of the Estates Act of 1947 was, as its title recites, “Relating to the . . . rights of a surviving spouse in property as to which the decedent has retained certain powers”. The Act dealt, inter alia, with “conveyances to defeat marital rights”, and contained provisions in §11 with respect to “a conveyance of assets by a person who retains ... a power of revocation . . .”; and it provided for an election by a surviving spouse to take against a conveyance of assets by a deceased spouse.</p>

The Orphans’ Court has jurisdiction of the “deceased conveyor’s estate”. While the matter is not free from doubt, it would appear that the Legislature intended to give to the Orphans’ Court in cases such as this, jurisdiction to determine <em>the rights of the surviving spouse </em>in Henderson’s conveyance, namely, his deed of trust dated February 3, 1952, as amended in 1957, and in the proceeds of the life insurance policy which was included in Henderson’s conveyance.</p>
