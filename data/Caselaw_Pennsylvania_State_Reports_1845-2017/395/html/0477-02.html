Superior Ct. 67</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20A.2d%20540" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="1 A.2d 540">1 A. 2d 540</a>), because the facts developed at hearing may show it to involve fares and the servicing of a railroad facility and hence should be decided ultimately by the Commission. In holding it to be so as a matter of law we think that the court below was in error, as the case may turn out to resemble <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Shumaker v. N. </em>Y. <em>&amp; Pa. Co., Inc., </em>supra (<a href="/pa/367/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="367 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1228277" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0040-01">367 Pa. 40</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.2d%20439" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="79 A.2d 439">79 A. 2d 439</a>), and <em>Emerald Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Equitable Gas Co., </em><a href="/pa/378/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="378 Pa. 591" data-case-ids="1250895" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0591-01">378 Pa. 591</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20A.2d%20734" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="107 A.2d 734">107 A. 2d 734</a> (1954), both of which fell under the jurisdiction of equity.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[260,1535,1145,703]]]'>The complaint avers an uncontemplated use of the siding and an unreasonable increase of the burden on the land. These averments look both ways, towards the services rendered by the siding and towards a trespass to the extent of the excessive use. The relief asked is to restrain defendants from using the siding at all beyond the boundary between the twenty-four acre tract and the sixty acre tract, and this smacks of relief against a trespass. In upholding concurrent jurisdiction, we must remand the record for a hearing of the complaint. The basic right of defendants to have and use the siding on the sixty acres at all is a thing beyond the power of the Commission to decide.</p>
