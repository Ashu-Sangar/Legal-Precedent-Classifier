    <p id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.9",279,[183,674,1155,1248]]]'>This suit in equity was instituted by Dr. Harry S. Berberian against the Lancaster Osteopathic Hospital Association, Inc. and Dr. George C. Wolf, the medical director of the hospital, to restrain them from discharging the plaintiff from the hospitaPs staff and from depriving him of staff and hospital privileges. The plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction, to be made permanent upon final hearing. The complaint alleges that the plaintiff was removed as a staff member of the hospital without notice of charges against him and without a hearing as required by the by-laws of the hospitaPs staff. The court issued a rule on the defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted. After taking testimony and hearing oral argument on the rule, the court held that the plaintiff was not entitled to equitable relief and discharged the rule to show cause. From the consequent decree refusing a preliminary injunction the plaintiff took this appeal. As the material facts are not in dispute, and present for decision a pure question of law, nothing is to be gained by sending the case back for a final hearing on the bill in the court below.</p>

He testified that he has enjoyed a larger general practice in and about the City of Lancaster than any other osteopath and that his work has included a large number of obstetrical cases.</p>

Promptly after this arrest, the president of the staff requested Dr. Berberian to submit voluntarily his resignation as a staff member. That, he refused to do. On March 10, 1958, the executive committee of the staff held a meeting for the purpose of determining whether to recommend the plaintiff’s dismissal as a staff member because of the abortion charges that had been made against him. After notice of the call, Dr. Berberian and his counsel attended the meeting. The executive committee decided to make no recommendation pending final legal disposition of the abortion charges for which he never was indicted. On the day following the meeting called by the executive committee of the staff, the board of directors of the hospital held a meeting at which the individual defendant, Dr. George 0. Wolf, was requested to prepare a report concerning Dr. Berberian.</p>
    <p id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[242,1362,1147,700]]]'>On April 7, 1958, a combined meeting of the hospital’s board of directors and the staff executive committee was held for the purpose of considering Dr. Wolf’s report. The plaintiff received no notice of this meeting and did not attend. As described in the plaintiff’s brief, the Wolf report, which was read at the meeting, “contains many charges of grossly unprofessional conduct and of even criminal misconduct of a serious nature, involving moral turpitude.” On the following day, April 8, 1958, the board of directors of the hospital, after again hearing Dr. Wolf’s report, adopted a resolution depriving Dr. Berberian of all staff privileges and of the use of the hospital’s facilities.</p>

Although the plaintiff had been given a hearing in respect of the abortion charges he had never <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>been, given any opportunity to answer the report’s grave allegations, most of which were based on hearsay relayed to Dr. Wolf. In fact, at the time of the hearing in the court below on the preliminary injunction motion, the plaintiff had never seen a copy of the report and had no knowledge of its contents.</p>
    <p id="b281-4" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[191,702,1146,538]]]'>It is obvious that the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm unless injunctive relief be granted him. The corporate defendant is the only osteopathic hospital in Lancaster County. Elsewhere, the nearest of such hospitals is at York, some 30 miles distant from Lancaster, and at Harrisburg, approximately 40 miles away. For all practical purposes, therefore, the corporate defendant’s hospital is the only one to which Dr. Berberian can conveniently and satisfactorily have his many obstetrical and other patients admitted.</p>

Nor is there any doubt that Dr. Berberian was not given a hearing in respect of the charges contained in Dr. Wolf’s report. The only question for determination is whether the plaintiff was legally entitled to such a hearing before being dismissed as a staff member of the hospital and denied use of the hospital’s facilities.</p>

The Executive Committee reserves the right at any time, <em>hut only after adequate hearing and thorough investigation, </em>to recommend to the Board of Directors the suspension of any officer or member of the General Staff or to deprive any physician or surgeon the privilege of hospital use whenever in its judgment the good of the hospital, the patient, or community shall demand. 2.

Indeed, the president of the hospital’s board of directors unequivocally gave it as his opinion, when this matter was on hearing before the court below on the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction that the board of directors is bound by the by-laws of the general staff.

The court held that since the Hospital Association had approved the staff by-laws, it was bound by the provisions thereof. Therefore, the hospital could not refuse to reappoint the plaintiff until a hearing had been given. The opinion of the court stated that “The [Medical Staff] By-laws were ratified by the Board of Governors, and thereby became a constituent part of the Association’s elemental law.” The court went on to say that “A hearing on notice is of the essence of the cited provisions of the Constitution and By-laws. . . . The requirement of a hearing before ‘a man fails of reappointment’ is quite clearly intended to protect the staff member against arbitrary, capricious and oppressive action involving his professional qualifications, standing and prestige and the opportunity and facilities for continued service, and for the good of the Hospital as well. . . .”</p>

The Board took this action after carefully considering a report from Dr. Wolf, Medical Director of the Lancaster Osteopathic Hospital, which stated — in great detail — that Dr. Berberian for a number of years had often been guilty of “grossly unprofessional conduct and even of criminal misconduct of a serious nature involving moral turpitude.”</p>

While the privilege of being a member of the staff of a particular hospital or having hospital privileges is obviously very valuable, a doctor has no vested right therein or thereto. There are many doctors in the Lancaster area and in every large metropolitan area who do not belong to the staff of a particular private hospital and never acquire staff or hospital privileges therein.</p>

While we believe it would have been fairer and wiser for the Board to have given Dr. Berberian a hearing, even though he did not have any vested or lawful <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>right thereto, it is clear from the record that the Board and the lower Court had reasonable and ample grounds for their respective action.</p>
