McAvoy. The plaintiff company of which Mr. McAvoy was president was the designated beneficiary in his application to the defendant company for insurance. McAvoy submitted to the required physical examination and was approved by the defendant’s medical examiner for the insurance applied for. Following the medical examiner’s examination and approval of the applicant, the insurance company’s authorized agent accepted McAvoy’s payment in full of the first year’s premium on the contemplated policy and delivered to him a “deposit receipt” and an “interim assurance certificate”. Six days after his examination and approval by the insurance company’s medical examiner, McAvoy died and, following his death, the company rejected the application for the assigned reason that, under the company’s practice, the applicant was not an insurable risk for the amount of insurance requested.</p>

The trial judge held that the “deposit receipt” and the “interim assurance certificate” constituted integration of a contract of insurance <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>between McAvoy and the defendant company for the period between the agent’s delivery of the interim assurance certificate and the ultimate decision of the defendant company at its home office whether to issue the policy applied for or reject the application. Judgment for the plaintiff beneficiary was entered accordingly. The defendant filed exceptions to the judgment so entered, contending that, on the basis of the record and testimony, the trial judge should have found in favor of the defendant company and, in the alternative, that the defendant is entitled to a new trial because of alleged errors in the trial judge’s rulings on the admission of evidence.</p>

None of the alleged irregularities during the trial of this case are of sufficient significance to affect the result.

      <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>“McAvoy Vitrified Brick Company, desiring to expand its operations, sought to borrow $400,000 from Girard Trust Corn Exchange Bank. As an incident of this transaction, the bank requested that the company obtain insurance on the lives of the McAvoy brothers, Thomas B. Jr. and John C., respectively president and vice-president of the McAvoy Vitrified Brick Company, in the amount of $200,000 each. Through Messrs. Johnson &amp; Higgins, insurance brokers, the Mc-Avoys inquired of a number of life insurance companies regarding a plan of reducing term insurance to be coordinated with the amortization of the contemplated loan. Among these companies was the defendant, which, through its Philadelphia branch manager, submitted schedules of commuted values of reducing term policies of insurance. The McAvoys decided to apply for insurance with the defendant, and arrangements were made for them to undergo a physical examination by two physicians selected by the defendant. This examination took place on June 28, 1955. After the examination, on the same day, the brothers were informed by the defendant’s branch manager that Thomas, the elder brother, was physically acceptable at the standard premium rate but that the physicians had found John’s blood pressure too high for him to be so acceptable. Thomas B. McAvoy, Jr. thereupon, on June 28, 1955, filled out and delivered to the defendant’s branch manager an application, on the defendant’s printed form, for the desired policy of insurance, and handed to the branch manager a check payable to the defendant in the amount of $2,966.75, representing the full first year’s premium on the policy requested. The application designated the plaintiff company as beneficiary and was for a policy which would provide for the payment, in the event of the insured’s death during the term, of $1,455 monthly for <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>a period of fifteen years, the commuted value of which was calculated at $211,266. The branch manager of the defendant then signed and delivered to Thomas B. McAvoy, Jr. a ‘deposit receipt’ and an ‘interim assurance certificate.’ These two documents will have to be considered in detail, because they, with the application, constitute the integration of the contract between the parties if any contract existed.</blockquote>

The defendant, on the other hand, while conceding that the exchange of the application and premium payment for the deposit receipt and interim assurance certificate created a contractual relationship, urges that the defendant’s liability under the contract was subject to a condition precedent, the defendant’s determination that Thomas B. McAvoy, Jr. was an insurable risk under the defendant’s practice. The problem is not a new one. A substantial volume of litigation has come before the courts arising out of situations in which one who has applied for life insurance and paid a premium has died or suffered a change of physical condition before the issuance of the policy. We are all familiar with the usual practice of insurance agents to accept initial premium payments with <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>applications for the issuance of policies which cannot, in the very nature of the business, be made available until some time later. The policy itself, when issued, embodies the contract. But in the meantime, between the initial payment of premium and the issuance of the policy, what is the contractual relationship, if any? It is not possible to generalize; the courts have found the answer in each case in the wording of the receipt given for the premium payment, where the language clearly discloses the intention of the parties, and where the courts have found ambiguity in the language they have usually reached a construction against the insurance company which drafted the receipt.</blockquote>

A like result would be accomplished by a receipt stating clearly that no insurance shall be in effect until the time of the application’s approval by the home office of the company. The doubtful cases arise where a receipt is given stating that the insurance shall be in effect from the date of the premium payment, or the date of the application, or the date of the medical examination, provided, as in some instances, the application shall be approved and accepted at the home office, or, as in others, the home office shall be satisfied that, at the time of the payment, application, or examination, the applicant was an insurable risk.

In the next sentence it recites, ‘Should the assurance take effect under this certificate, it shall thereupon be deemed to have taken effect as from the date of the medical examination.’ Having determined that the certificate was intended to effect temporary insurance coverage, we can reach no other conclusion than that the applicant was covered from the time of its issuance.

His habits, his occupation, his family history, his physical condition, all factors of insurability, were satisfactory. The only reason which the defendant advances for which it maintains that it Avould have disapproved the application if the applicant had lived is that the application was for too large an amount of coverage; with his already existing insurance in other companies, a policy for $211,266 would have rendered McAvoy ‘over insured’ under the defendant’s general practice; and in <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>any event the company would not have issued a policy for more than $100,000 without reinsurance.</blockquote>

Mc-Avoy, Jr. not died when he did, would have moved the company ultimately to decline to issue the policy which had been applied for; but we cannot escape the conclusion that a contract had been entered into for interim insurance under which the company was bound until it signified its intention to reject the risk. It would have been easy, had no interim coverage been intended, for the defendant’s branch manager to issue a deposit receipt only. No question is raised of the branch manager’s authority to issue an interim certificate, nor does the defendant question that the certificate constituted a contract. The contract was entered into with knowledge on the part of the company’s representative of the amount of insurance being applied for, and with knowledge of the company’s general practice in this respect. We must hold that, regardless of the company’s right to decline to issue a policy and to terminate its liability by notice of such declination during the applicant’s lifetime, a legal and binding contract of insurance existed from the time of the issuance of the interim certificate and Avas in force on July 3, 1955, when Thomas B.
