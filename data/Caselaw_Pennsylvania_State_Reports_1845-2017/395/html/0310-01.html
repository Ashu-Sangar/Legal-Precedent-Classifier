On appeal to the zoning board of adjustment, a variance was refused because Dr. Schechter failed to establish any unnecessary hardship, and, in the opinion of the board, the request for a variance constituted in fact a request for a change in zoning, and, as such, was beyond the board's jurisdiction.

By that time, in view of the two oral communications, the two meetings of the supervisors, and the formal declaration of intent evidenced by the letter, Dr. Schechter-should have been well apprised of the township’s position. If Dr. Schechter at that point was so convinced of the legality of his position that he desired to continue the construction of the theatre, he was certainly entitled to do so but <em>only at Ms own risk. </em>The resulting cost, however, would not constitute expenditures incurred in a good faith reliance upon a validly issued permit so as to bring the present case within the meaning of the “vested' -rights” doctrine.

The contractor further- testified that the actual construction work did not begin until March 3rd or 4th, by which time Dr. Schechter must certainly have learned of the township’s decision'to revoke the permit. Prior to that time, the only work performed by tha contractor consisted of an examination of the premises and an ascertainment of the amount of material and the number of men that would be required to perform the work. The evidence produced by Dr. Schechter falls far short of the “change in position and substantial expenditures” required to sustain the action of the court below.

The rule further provides for argument and decision by the court <em>en </em>banc, and does not provide for the entry of final judgment on the trial judge’s order until the twenty-day period has expired without exceptions or unless a waiver of the right to enter -exceptions be .filed;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Although Dr. Schechter admits knowledge of this .rule, he urges that it would not have been applicable to the present case, because the board of adjustment, under a local court decision, had by the issuance, of -the permit waived its .rights, to file exceptions, and .had no right, because of its status as a board of adjustment, to appeal the waiver to this Court. However, Dr. Schechter was aware that the issuance of the permit had been contested by the township, solicitor before both the board of .adjustment and the court below. Numerous property owners, in the <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>vicinity of the premises, had also contested the proposed change in use. Prior to the entry of a final order dismissing the exceptions, either the township or the property owners could have been permitted to intervene and contest this determination of acquiescence in view of the Board’s inability to appeal. Cf. <em>Robinson Township School District v. Houghton, </em><a href="/pa/387/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="387 Pa. 236" data-case-ids="1271011" data-case-paths="/pa/387/0236-01">387 Pa. 236</a>, 240, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20A.2d%2058" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="128 A.2d 58">128 A. 2d 58</a>. However, Dr. Schechter, rather than delay an additional twenty days until the entry of a final non-contested and non-appealable order dismissing the exceptions, ignored the obvious probability of formal intervention, and entered into agreements with third parties in an attempt to establish “vested rights”, before the exceptions filed by the board were formally dismissed, on the premise that the board was unable to appeal, and the supposition that no one would be permitted to intervene. This does not constitute the good faith reliance on a validly issued permit as set forth in our previous decisions. See: <em>Riccardi v.
