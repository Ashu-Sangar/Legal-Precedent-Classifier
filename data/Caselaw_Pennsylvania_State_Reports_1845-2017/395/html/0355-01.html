Section 493 (47 PS §4-493) provides in material part that it shall be unlawful “(10) . . .for any licensee, under any circumstances, to permit in any licensed premises <em>any lewd, immoral or improper </em>entertainment, regardless of whether a permit to provide entertainment [required by this section] has been obtained or not . . . Any violation of this clause shall . . . subject the licensee <em>to suspension </em>or revocation <em>of Ms permit and Ms </em>license(Emphasis supplied) Enforcement officers of the Board stated that they visited the Tahiti Bar on April 3, 1956 and April 4,1956. They testified in substance that on those two occasions they observed seven “strip acts” which involved the removal of substantially all of the female performers’ apparel, and that “bumps and grinds” were performed by “moving the lower part of [their] body backwards and forward [in] both a fast and slow motion.” The same officers visited the Lehigh Casino on May 24, 1956 and May 26, 1956. The performances were similar to those observed at the Tahiti Bar. Neither appellant contradicted nor questioned the enforcement officers’ factual description of the performances. Appellants admit that the performances in both establishments were almost identical, involving in some instances, the same performers.</p>

Appellants assume, without discussion, that Section 493 is primarily directed toward prohibiting and restricting certain types of entertainment when such entertainment falls within the term expression as included within the free speech guarantee of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In so doing, appellants misconceive the basic issue upon which the validity of Section 493 rests. The significant and determinative question is whether or not a state in <em>its regulation of the privilege of dispensing alcoholic beverages </em>may condition that privilege by prohibiting types of conduct and action that in another setting might be constitutionally protected. It is within this narrow framework that Section 493 must be reviewed.</p>

Gelder, </em>supra, this Court upheld a regulation of the Board which required liquor licensees to obtain an amusement permit as a prerequisite to the use of television in licensed establishments and to pay one-fifth of the annual liquor license fee for the privilege of presenting such entertainment. Although the issue of free speech was apparently not directly raised, the language of the opinion is most germane in rejecting appellants’ present contention. We therein approved the following language of the court below (pp. 363-366): “‘[Plaintiffs’ contentions are] predicated on the fallacy that the license required for the privilege of providing televised, and no other form of entertainment, in establishments licensed under the Liquor Control Act is in a category entirely separate and distinct from the license required to be held for the privilege of selling intoxicating liquors. With this we cannot agree. On the contrary, it is the restaurant licensee who is granted under the Liquor Control Act the additional privilege, upon the payment of a further <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>license fee, of offering certain forms of entertainment to Ms patrons. The legislature had the power to deny this additional entertainment privilege to the Board’s licensees . . . just as under the Act of July 9, 1881, P.L. 162 ( 47 PS 181), it denied licenses for the sale of spirituous or malt liquors to proprietors of any theater, circus, museum or other place of amusement or to premises for the sale of such liquors which had a passage or communication to or with the same. . . . “The power of the state to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors, and, in the exercise of that power, to authorize the granting of licenses to fit persons under such conditions as the legislature may impose is too well settled to be open to discussion.” Accordingly, since the state may absolutely forbid or may license the sale of intoxicating liquors, it may impose such conditions upon the granting of licenses as it sees (it, and one who accepts such license must be deemed to consent to all proper conditions and restrictions which have been or may be imposed by the legislature in the interest of the public morals or safety. . . . “A transaction which is innocuous, if considered separately, may nevertheless be included in the scope of a general prohibitory measure designed to accomplish a purpose well within an admitted governmental power”. . . . Admittedly, plaintiffs exhibit televised entertainment in their licensed establishments, presumably for the purpose of attracting and holding patrons and thereby increasing sales. <em>The legislature had the power to absolutely forbid, or to grant under specified conditions, licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors. It had the power to absolutely forbid or to permit under specified conditions, entertainment in licensed establishments. . </em>. .’” (Emphasis supplied) Section 493 does not violate the right of free speech and expression as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>

The privilege of selling alcoholic beverages conditioned upon the presentation of a certain quality of entertainment in establishments where the privilege is exercised is not, as we have determined, an incident falling fairly within the protection of free speech. For this reason, appellants’ assumption that a state, in conditioning the issuance of a liquor license, may only prohibit entertainment in a licensed establishment that comes within the term “obscenity” as delineated by the United States Supreme Court in interpreting the state’s limitations under the First and Fourteenth Amendments is unwarranted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> If a state may prohibit <em>all </em>entertainment in an establishment where liquor is sold without violating the First and Fourteenth Amendments, it may fairly prohibit entertainment which may not necessarily be considered obscene without violating these same amendments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

It may be true, as counsel says, that 'men are differently constituted’, some being 'abject cowards, and few only are real heroes;’ that the brains of some people work 'rapidly and normally in the face of danger while other people lose all control over their actions.’ It is manifest that rules could not be prescribed to meet these varying qualities. Yet all must be brought to judgment. And what better test could be devised than the doing of 'all in one’s power’ as determined by the circumstances?” Such rules of conduct requiring individuals to pattern their actions upon general conclusionary terms are legion.

The principles, hereinbefore discussed in connection with Section 493 of the Code, relating to the absolute control of the state over the use and sale of alcoholic beverages completely refute this contention. Inasmuch as the state, in the exercise of its police power, may interdict the presentation of <em>any </em>entertainment whatsoever in an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages, it <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>follows as a natural consequence that, if the state does permit entertainment, the state may prescribe the type and character of such entertainment as well as the conduct of the entertainers while on the licensed premises without impinging upon the constitutional guarantee of the right to freedom of speech and expression. The sole impediment to such prescription by regulation is that the regulation must bear a reasonable relationship to the eradication of the evils so frequently and historically associated with the use and sale of alcoholic beverages. The grant of the privilege to dispense alcoholic beverages upon the condition that certain acts and conduct on the part of employees or entertainers be prohibited while on the licensed premises is outside the orbit of the constitutional provisions which assure to individuals the right to freedom of speech and expression. When the licensee accepts the imposition of such a condition as a prerequisite to the grant of the license he, in effect, voluntarily acquiesces in the limitation of his right to freedom of speech and expression to the extent implicit in the acts and conduct prohibited by the terms of the condition. This is a classic example of an instance wherein the state, acting for the common good in an area traditionally productive of grave social evils, may impose upon those who seek and are granted the right to transact business in that area <em>reasonable </em>limitations and restrictions on acts and conduct which, historically, have given rise to these social evils without offending the constitutional provision as to freedom of speech and expression.</p>

Such an argument is unsound. Appellants misconstrue the <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>evils sought to be eradicated and err in their assumption that by this section the legislature intended to completely define <em>all </em>the regulation necessary to remedy the evils. Section 493(25) prohibits the <em>hiring </em>of female employees <em>“for the purpose of” </em>the enticement of customers, the encouragement of such customers to drink and the making of assignations for improper purposes. It is directed at only <em>one </em>type of conduct on the part of the licensee which may lead to the evils sought to be eliminated; evils historically associated with the sale of alcoholic beverages. To hold that the legislature, by such a statutory provision, intended thereby to preclude the Board from the adoption of any regulation prohibiting <em>other, </em>types of conduct on the licensed premises which might lead to the same evils is clearly without justification. If appellants’ theory be correct, a licensee could knowingly permit females to frequent and utilize the licensed premises for the purposes interdicted by the statute, or could lcnoAvingly permit a female employee <em>not hired for such purposes </em>to indulge in such practices, or could hire a male employee to encourage customers to drink liquor or make assignations for improper purposes for a female and the Board .would be completely helpless to circumscribe such conduct by regulation. The legislature never intended by Section 493(25) either to .define the Avhole area of regulations necessary to cope with the evils sought tó be eliminated nor to place the Board Avithin the “strait-jacket” of the narrow and confining limitations herein advocated by appellants.</p>

After an enumeration of the Board’s general powers, the Board was granted the power “to do all such things and perform all such acts as are deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this act and the regulations made” without “in any way limiting or being limited” by the enumeration of the general powers conferred (Section 207(h), supra, 47 PS §2-207). Section 207(i), supra, further empowers the Board. “Prom time to time, to make such regulations not inconsistent with- this act .as it may deem necessary for the efficient administration of [the] act”. These provisions make evident the power of the Board to adopt any <em>reasonable </em>regulation the purpose of which is the elimination or restriction of the evils delineated in Section 493(25), without being held to have usurped the power of the legislature. ■</p>

Although we agree that- the principal- thrust of this regulation is to control the proscribed extra-curricular activities of female- entertainers, we do not believe that <em>only a, </em>female may. be guilty of the conduct prohibited by this regulation nor that the Board is arbitrary in its assumption that a male entertainer might be guilty <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>of the same conduct.

Aside from the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever that such were the instant circumstances, we find no invalidity on this ground. A regulation which contained the excepted conduct on the part of the entertainers advocated by appellants would by its very terms doom the regulation and render impossible its execution and enforcement. While the difficulty of enforcement alone is insufficient to breathe validity into an otherwise invalid regulation, yet such difficulty is extremely significant when the instant regulation is viewed in its proper setting. This regulation is directed against a well-defined group, namely entertainers in licensed establishments; its purpose is the abolition of certain well-recognized and prevalent evils historically associated with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages on licensed premises. Bearing in mind the evils sought to be controlled, the obvious difficulty of enforcement of a regulation containing such an exception and the limited class against which the regulation is directed, we do not believe it is unreasonable to deprive that class of the right “to discuss innocent topics over a drink” with wives, husbands, agents or friends while employed as entertainers in licensed establishments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

Casino objects to the innuendo of the Superior Court that the entertainers in its establishment were “nude or scantily clothed” while mingling with patrons because of the Superior Court’s <em>per curiam </em>affirmance of the suspension of its license and permit on the authority of the <em>Tahiti Bar </em>case where such conditions apparently existed. This factual difference is nei<a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>ther material or significant for present purposes. That the entertainers be nude or scantily clothed is not a <em>sine qua non </em>for a violation of regulation 110.</p>

Aside from the fact that the Board also found appellants had violated Section 493(10) which expressly provides for the suspension of a liquor license, Section 471 of the Code (47 PS §4-471) provides: “Upon learning of any violation of this act or any laws of this Commonwealth relating to liquor, alcohol or malt or brewed beverages, or of <em>any regulations </em>of the board adopted pursuant to such laws, . . . the board ... if satisfied that any such violation has occurred . . . shall immediately suspend or revoke the license . . . .” (Emphasis supplied). As to appellants’ “clear distinction” between a liquor license and an amusement permit, see <em>Cavanaugh v. Gelder, </em>supra.</p>
