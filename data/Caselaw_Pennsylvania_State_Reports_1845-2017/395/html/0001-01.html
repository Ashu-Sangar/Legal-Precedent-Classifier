To effect this distribution required $15.00 in the capital stock account for the three new shares issued (the difference between the par value of the three new shares [$15.00] and the stated value of the old share [$6.25] being $8.75). The new par value was arrived at by two corporate steps: (1) a “write-down” of the stated value of each old share from $6.25 to $5.00, thus making $1.25 of capital available for the “additional” new shares and (2) by transferring the balance required — $8.75—from “reinvested earnings” (earned surplus) to the capital stock account.</p>

The total cost was $8,736.50 and the aggregate book value as of the purchase dates was $8,997.96. In 1951 the Gulf Oil Corporation authorized the distribution — which it termed a dividend — to its shareholders of one additional share of the common stock of the corporation for each share of its outstanding stock, thus increasing the trust’s holdings from 125 to 250 shares.

In both instances, the life tenants rely upon this capitalization and alleged removal of earnings as a source of future dividend payments as justification for an apportionment. This fact was recognized by all the judges of the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County and we believe by all counsel, all of whom agreed on the facts although differing as to the results which legally flowed therefrom.</p>

Furthermore, it is entirely consistent to hold that an apportionable event takes place when the stock is sold or the corporation liquidated because such events represent the only and last opportunity for a life tenant to share in any corporate earnings accumulated since creation of the trust.

Prior to that merger the Union Trust Company had a capital stock account of $1,500,000 and an earned surplus of $108,-500,000 and the Mellon Bank had a capital stock account of $7,500,000 and an earned surplus of $40,000,-000. To accomplish the merger the capital stock account of the new corporation was increased to $60,100-000 from $1,550,000 and it became necessary to transfer from earned surplus to the capital stock account $58,550,000. For each share of stock held the Union Trust Company stockholders received 8 shares of stock of the new corporation and the stock of the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company held by Union Trust Company was cancelled. The earnings- capitalized were less than the earnings accumulated by the Union Trust Company between the date of decedent’s death and the merger date. Our denial of the occurrence of an apportionable event was not based simply on the existence of a merger as the court below indicated. Appellant’s argument in <em>Jones Estate, </em>supra, was exactly the same as the position taken by the Orphans’ Court in the instant case, namely that “the true test of whether an apportionable event occurs in a given situation is whether the transaction results in the capitalization <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>of any earnings in one form or another. If such is the result, there must be an apportionment”. We rejected this contention and in our determination that no apportionable event had occurred we said: “While there was no capitalization of surplus ... in that merger [Buist’s Estate, <a href="/pa/297/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="297 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1118271" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0537-01">297 Pa. 537</a>] that fact cannot change the principle there established”, (p. 478).</p>
