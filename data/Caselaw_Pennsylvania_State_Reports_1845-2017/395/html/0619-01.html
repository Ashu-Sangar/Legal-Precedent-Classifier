The net result of the proposed construction would be to eliminate the “L” by extending the eastern front wall north and the northern side Avail east until the walls joined so that the resulting structure would be square or rectangular in shape.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The area thus encompassed by the proposed construction, —currently being used as an open flagstone patio,'— would be converted into an additional apartment.</p>

The portions of the dwelling which are to be altered are presently nonconforming as to both the side yard and set-back requirements, and for all practical purposes are presently as close to appellants’ property as the entire building will be if the alteration is permitted. See: <em>Yocum Zoning Case, </em><a href="/pa/393/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="393 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1279703" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0148-01">393 Pa. 148</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.2d%20601" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="141 A.2d 601">141 A. 2d 601</a>. Under these circumstances we are in agreement with the zoning board and the court below that “the record clearly shows unique and undue hardship to the property unless such use is permitted and that there is no detriment to the public interest if it is altered and used in the manner proposed.”</p>

It appears that after a previous variance had been granted to appellee by the board, an appeal, taken by the present appellants, was sustained, and the action of the board in authorizing the variance set aside. Both parties admit, however, that the record of proceedings forwarded by the board to the court below consisted only of the minutes of board meetings indicating that the application was considered and granted. There were no transcribed notes of testimony, no specific findings of fact, nor any discussion of the reasons that influenced the <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>board to so act. As the court below in. its opinion in the present appeal stated: “Without argument or appearance of counsel for anyone except appellants the appeal was sustained without opinion, there being no record supporting the Board’s action.” Under such circumstances we cannot fairly hold that the appellee had an opportunity to properly litigate the issues, nor that there has been a prior adjudication on the merits of this case. The doctrine of <em>res adjudicata </em>has no application to the facts of the present case. See: <em>Scharf v.
