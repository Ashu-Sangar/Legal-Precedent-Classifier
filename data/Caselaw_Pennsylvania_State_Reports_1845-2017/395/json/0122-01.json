        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThe lower court incorrectly granted a variance from a thirty foot set back requirement in an R-4 residential district in Lower Merion Township, permitting the enclosure of a front porch which would encroach upon the required minimum front yard line by approximately three and one-half feet. The zoning board having determined that no unnecessary hardship had been shown denied the variance. The lower court decreed that the board had abused its discretion and granted a variance to appellees.\nThe applicant desires to enclose the front porch because his wife suffers from asthma and hay fever and his young son has a severe respiratory ailment and likewise suffers from hay fever. By enclosing the front porch \u201cadditional room\u201d for the comfort of his family will be provided. On the basis of this testimony the lower court did not \u201c. . . see how the granting of a variance will in any way be detrimental to the public interest\u201d since the encroachment was only a distance of three and one-half feet and granted the variance.\nSince the appellee has failed to show any unnecessary hardship to Ms property which would merit the granting of a variance, we conclude that the lower court was in error. To hold otherwise would do violence to a large number of our decisions.\nChief Justice Horace Stern in Michener Appeal, 382 Pa. 401, 406, 115 A. 2d 367 (1955) said: \u201c. . . a variance may be granted only where a property is subjected to a hardsMp unique or peculiar to itself. . . .\u201d Mr. Justice Bell in Volpe Appeal, 384 Pa. 374, 378, 121 A. 2d 97 (1956) said: \u201c. . . a person who seeks a variance has the burden of establishing unnecessary hardship; . . . .\u201d Justice Benjamin R. Jones in Richman v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, 391 Pa. 254, 259-60, 137 A. 2d 280 (1958) said: \u201cThe sole justification for the grant of a variance is that a strict application of the terms of the zoning statute will result in an \u2018unnecessary hardship\u2019, and, even then, the variance can be granted only if \u2018the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed; the public health; the public safety; and the general welfare secured; and substantial justice done.\u2019 He who seeks a variance has the burden of proving justification for its grant. The \u2018hardship\u2019 which must be proven must be an \u2018unnecessary\u2019, not a \u2018mere\u2019 hardsMp, as well as \u2018unique or peculiar to [the property involved]\u2019 . . . .\u201d In Gold v. Zoning Board of Adjustment et al., 393 Pa. 401, 143 A. 2d 59 (1958) Justice Arnold said that nothing less than a showing of hardship special or peculiar to the property will empower the board to allow a variance and the applicant\u2019s physical condition is not the hardship forming the basis for a variance. And in English v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, 395 Pa. 118 (1959), we again held that the hardship must be one that is peculiar to the applicant\u2019s property to merit the allowance of a variance.\nThere is no testimony in the record which meets the burden required by those cases. Indeed, the record is even barren of competent medical testimony that the enclosed porch would contribute to the improvement of the physical condition of appellee\u2019s son and wife. Again we must reiterate what we have said on innumerable occasions \u2014 zoning boards and the courts must not impose their concept of what the zoning ordinance should be, but rather their function is only to enforce the zoning ordinance in accordance with the applicable law.\nOrder reversed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents.",
