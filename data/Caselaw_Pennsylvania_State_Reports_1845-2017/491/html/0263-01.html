Appellees presented a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction to the Chancellor seeking to enjoin the closing of Retreat, which motion was granted following hearings and argument. The Chancellor issued an order on April 14, 1980 preliminarily enjoining appellants from transferring mentally disabled patients at Retreat to other mental health facilities without the express consent of the patient or his or her guardian and enjoining appellants from reducing the staff or level of operations at Retreat.

First, the object of all statutory interpretation and construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly, giving effect, if possible, to all provisions of a statute. Section 1921(a). Section 1921(b) further provides that “[w]hen the words of a statute are <em>clear and free from all ambiguity, </em>the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” (emphasis added). Applied to pending transfers of voluntarily committed patients from a facility in the process of closing, section 207 of the Mental Health Procedures Act (the Act) is certainly not “clear and free from all ambiguity.” Thus, we must go beyond section 207 to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.</p>

Appellees’ interpretation of section 207 would lead to the unreasonable result that a few patients could, by withholding their consent to transfer, prevent the closing of a particular facility which had been deemed unsafe, uneconomical and unnecessary by those who are charged with the responsibility to make such decisions, and are in fact, in a better position to evaluate and analyze the needs of the entire mental health system.</p>

The sources claimed as the bases of that entitlement were similar to those claimed by appellees herein; namely, a statutory entitlement (from three Medicaid provisions including one which prohibited transferring patients except for certain specific reasons not applicable therein) and life and liberty interests which they claimed were jeopardized by the trauma that would accompany transfer. The transfers in <em>Town Court </em>were necessitated by loss of federal funds because the facility had lost its Medicaid certification. The United States Supreme Court phrased the issue as “whether the patients have an interest in receiving benefits for care in a particular facility that entitles them, as a matter of constitutional law, to a hearing before the Government can decertify that facility.” The Court was not persuaded by either asserted justification for the “right” to remain in a particular facility.</p>

Our review of the record, however, reveals substantial evidence that the fears of “transfer trauma” are largely unfounded. Several expert witnesses for the Commonwealth, including the superintendents for the receiving state facilities, testified as to the actual “track record” of prior transferees from Retreat. That “track record” contradicts that transfer risks asserted by appellees as justification for the preliminary injunction. The principal evidence offered by appellees to support their claims of “transfer trauma” danger was that of a Dr. Norman C. Bourestom, a Michigan psychologist. Dr. Bourestom visited Retreat for three days, studied the patients’ histories and charts, then concluded that, based upon his research and findings of certain nursing home facilities, a substantial danger of “transfer trauma,” including lethal consequences, existed for Retreat patients. Dr. <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>Bourestom testified the dangers of “transfer trauma” were significant only when the danger involved a “radical change” which occurs when there is a substantial change in (1) the staff, (2) the patient’s peer group, (3) the program of treatment and (4) the physical environment. Dr. Bourestom then stated he felt the proposed transfers would involve a radical change. As Dr. Bourestom had never visited the receiving facilities, and as appellants’ witnesses testified that, to the fullest extent possible, peers and staff would be relocated in the same wards and that the respective treatment programs and physical environments were similar, Dr. Bourestom’s characterization of the proposed changes as “radical” is dubious, and is certainly contradicted by Retreats’ prior experience.
