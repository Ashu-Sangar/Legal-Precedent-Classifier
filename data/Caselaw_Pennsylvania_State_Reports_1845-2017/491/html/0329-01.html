The attending physician prescribed percodan, a painkiller which does not reduce an individual’s sensorium,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> to reduce Webb’s discomfort. Webb was advised, if the pain persisted or increased, he could have a sedative; but he made no such request. The attending physician spoke with Webb several times on December 16, and 17, 1976 and concluded Webb’s sensorium was clear and well-oriented. A detective, at 10:35 a. m. on December 17, 1976, requested and received permission from the attending physician to speak with Webb. The detective advised Webb he was to be questioned about the arson death of Clarence Keyes which occurred on December 15, 1976. The detective read the Miranda<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> warnings, and, after Webb indicated he understood the warnings and was willing to answer questions, he was questioned by the detective until about 10:53 a. m. Although in discomfort, Webb appeared lucid, alert and cooperative, and not under the influence of narcotic medication. Webb was considerably improved on December 18, 1976, and his sensorium remained clear and well-oriented. Another detective interviewed Webb in the hospital on December 18, 1976 from about 9 a. m. to 9:35 a. m. after obtaining permission from the supervising nurse. Webb was again advised he was going to be questioned about the arson murder, was warned of his rights, and again indicated he understood. Webb answered some questions but then invoked his constitutional privilege to remain silent, and the interview ended. We find ample support for the foregoing findings of fact in the record.</p>

    <p id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.5",382,[265,610,1146,994]]]'>The suppression court concluded the Commonwealth proved by a preponderance of the evidence that, on December 16 and 17, 1976, Webb’s physical condition did not interfere with his ability to exercise an unfettered will. This conclusion is fully supported by the following facts. On both December 17 and 18, 1976, Webb was informed of his constitutional rights and indicated he understood those rights before submitting to the detectives’ questioning. The drugs used in his treatment did not affect his ability to think clearly. His pain was apparently tolerable since he was offered a sedative but declined it. Finally, numerous conversations with the attending physician led that physician to conclude his sensorium was not impaired. Moreover, Webb exercised his right to remain silent during the second period of questioning. Given these facts, we are not persuaded the suppression court erred in concluding Webb’s hospital statements were voluntary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

This argument fails because a review of the record demonstrates a motion to suppress the evidence <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>of this clothing was in fact made and denied. During the direct examination of Nathan Webb, appellant’s brother, the Commonwealth sought to introduce into evidence the clothing worn by Webb when he was burned on December 15, 1976. At that time, Webb’s counsel objected to its introduction, and the trial judge, in the interest of justice, entertained a motion to suppress. See <em>Commonwealth v. Cooke, </em><a href="/pa-super/260/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="260 Pa. Super. 528" data-case-ids="108724" data-case-paths="/pa-super/260/0528-01">260 Pa.Super. 528</a>, <a href="/pa-super/260/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="260 Pa.

The testimony already introduced at trial provided the facts and circumstances surrounding the seizure, and the court considered this testimony and allowed argument on the motion. During argument, additional evidence was presented by the Commonwealth, and the defendant was afforded the opportunity to present evidence. After hearing the evidence and argument, the court denied the motion. Furthermore, the propriety of the order denying suppression was also raised by trial counsel in post-verdict motions and considered by the court on its merits. Therefore, trial counsel cannot be found to have been ineffective for not seeking suppression since he did so. Since present counsel has not raised the merits of the court’s ruling denying the suppression, we need not consider it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

    <p id="b383-5" data-blocks='[["BL_383.5",383,[223,1481,1142,244]]]'>Webb’s next contention of ineffectiveness stems from trial counsel’s failure to object to the Commonwealth’s impeachment and cross-examination of its own witness without first pleading surprise.

Prior to trial, he had given a statement in which he said that Webb had admitted setting the fire. The Commonwealth called him as a witness and asked whether Webb had made any statements concerning the origin of the fire. He replied no, but Webb had indicated he was at the scene at the time of the fire. At that point, the prosecutor began asking whether the witness had given a different <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>statement to the police investigators; he admitted he had and finally testified that his brother, the accused, had told him he set the fire.</p>

It is well-established that counsel cannot be ineffective for failing to make baseless or fruitless objections. <em>Commonwealth v.

However, during redirect examination, she corrected herself and stated that morphinbutal, morphine, and nembertal were administered on December 16,1976 only. In reviewing the exhibits entered into evidence at trial, the hospital records show that morphine, nembertal, and morphinbutal were administered only once, at the time of his admission.

Hence, the record shows that counsel, rather than weaken this corroborative testimony by having the brothers testify at the suppression hearing that Webb was incoherent when he made statements which corroborated his own testimony, chose to forgo this cumulative testimony regarding Webb’s condition in order to preserve the credibility of the corroborative testimony.
