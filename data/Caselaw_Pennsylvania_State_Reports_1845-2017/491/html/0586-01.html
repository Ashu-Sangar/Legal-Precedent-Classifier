    <p id="b643-9" data-blocks='[["BL_643.10",643,[181,1120,1139,192]]]'>I agree with the majority that the judgment of sentence must be affirmed. I write to clarify the proper standards to be applied in testing appellant’s ineffective assistance claims.</p>
    <p id="b643-10" data-blocks='[["BL_643.11",643,[178,1350,1144,633]]]'>First, for appellant to prevail on his claims of pre-guilty plea ineffectiveness, the record must establish that the alleged ineffectiveness induced his plea. See e. g., <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/477/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="477 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1738245" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0266-01">477 Pa. 266</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="477 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1738245" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0266-01">383 A.2d 926</a> (1978). Second, under Pennsylvania’s test of ineffective assistance of counsel, see <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, 605, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a>, 352-53 (1967), the inquiry is not whether prejudice ensued from counsel’s action or inaction. As <em>Washington </em>states, we do not employ a “hindsight evaluation of the record.” Rather, the inquiry is whether “the particular course chosen by counsel had <em>some reasonable basis </em>designed to effectuate his client’s interests.”</p>
    <p id="b643-11" data-blocks='[["BL_643.12",643,[177,2012,1142,192]]]'>This record reveals neither ineffective assistance inducing appellant’s plea nor ineffective assistance in post-plea proceedings. Thus the judgment of sentence may not be disturbed.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b643-12" data-blocks='[["BL_643.13",643,[219,2281,771,42]]]'>NIX, J., joins in this concurring opinion.</p>
