The second course would be to do nothing since Attorney Epstein has assured me he will contact me before moving in the matter, if he, in fact, will move at all. I believe this course would be advisable at the moment, since the interpretation of Rule 3148(b), providing for execution “generally” on the judgment, in my opinion permits such execution only to the extent of the amount of the deposit and not to the entire amount of the judgment. It is the interpretation of this Rule that presently is delaying any action on the part of Attorney Epstein.</blockquote>

Steckel failed to communicate Epstein’s position to the bank until May 18, 1976, following receipt of a letter dated May 7, 1976, in which Epstein <em>for the first time in twenty months </em>threatened execution if the judgment was not paid.

By order dated April 27, 1977, the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County dismissed the petition on the ground that the bank’s failure to act until June 1976 was “inexcusable and of such duration as to recommend the permanency of plaintiff’s [Queen City’s] judgment.” <em>Queen City Electrical Supply Co. v.
