      <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>Following sentencing, privately-retained trial counsel withdrew from the case and the Dauphin County Public Defender was appointed to assist appellant on his direct appeal. Subsequently, appellant filed a motion for a new trial on the basis of after-discovered evidence. Following two days of hearings on the motion, it was denied and this direct appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b273-5" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[230,655,1141,522]]]'>The facts as adduced at trial are as follows. In the early morning hours of August 20, 1978, at approximately 6:15 a. m., a fire broke out at appellant’s residence at 1625 Bamburger Road, Susquehanna Township. Firemen were notified by a neighbor, Bernice Shutt, who was awakened by the fire. Ms. Shutt ran outside where the victim, Jimmy Hugney, appellant’s sixteen-year-old son, had collapsed with 98% of his body covered with third-degree burns. The victim told Ms. Shutt, “I was sleeping, there is something wrong, that fire was too fast, maybe it was electrical.”</p>
    <p id="b273-6" data-blocks='[["BL_273.6",273,[229,1195,1143,572]]]'>The first official on the scene, Township Fire Marshall John Brindle, Sr., was directed to the victim by Ms. Shutt. The victim told Brindle that he had been awakened by what he thought was a fire bomb and had immediately run out of the house. When Detective Paul Kinsinger of the Susquehanna Township police arrived shortly thereafter, the victim told him he heard a loud bang and upon waking up, everything was on fire. The victim was removed by ambulance to a local hospital and subsequently was transferred to the Burn Center of St. Agnes Medical Center in Philadelphia, where he died five days later.</p>
    <p id="b273-7" data-blocks='[["BL_273.7",273,[229,1785,1140,311]]]'>Four experts testified at trial, all opining that the fire was of incendiary origin. William Sweet, a qualified expert, testified that he noticed “flow patterns” in the victim’s bedroom and in adjacent rooms; these patterns led to Sweet’s conclusion that a flammable substance had been poured on the floors and set ablaze.</p>
    <p id="b273-8" data-blocks='[["BL_273.8",273,[229,2115,1141,200]],["BL_274.1",274,[290,273,1143,466]]]'>Margaret Hugney, wife of appellant and mother of the victim, testified that she and appellant had been married for seventeen years; the pair, however, had separated two months before the fire. On the night of the fire, Mrs. <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>Hugney had returned home with appellant from their jointly owned used car lot. She testified that appellant had purchased a can of gasoline, allegedly for use in appellant’s motorcycle. Mrs. Hugney further testified that she and her youngest son, Scott, spent the night at the house of Harry Whitman, Sr., her boyfriend. The following morning at the Whitman residence, she was notified of the fire by township police officers. Mrs. Hugney’s version of the evening’s events were verified by Mr. Whitman.</p>
    <p id="b274-5" data-blocks='[["BL_274.5",274,[288,757,1143,307]]]'>Mrs. Hugney, who was later recalled to testify, stated that the relationship between appellant and the victim was not “friendly. It was rather hostile.” She testified about constant fights between the pair. In fact, she related an incident where appellant had struck the victim with a board which had a screw in it, puncturing the victim’s shoulder.</p>
    <p id="b274-6" data-blocks='[["BL_274.6",274,[285,1083,1141,306]]]'>Patricia Bonacci testified that she had been involved with appellant and had, in fact, borne him two children, one eleven months old and another born a week before the trial. She testified that she and appellant had made plans to move to Clearfield County and had in fact signed a sales agreement for the purchase of a house in that area.</p>
    <p id="b274-7" data-blocks='[["BL_274.7",274,[280,1408,1144,725]]]'>Ms. Bonacci further testified that on the night of the fire, she had intermittently been with appellant. She told how shortly before 6:00 a. m. appellant drove off by himself, returning some time later. Ms. Bonacci testified that appellant had told her that he had driven to the Bamburger Road residence. She was then asked: “Did he indicate that he had gone inside the house?” Ms. Bonacci replied “No.” The Commonwealth then pleaded surprise and asked that Ms. Bonacci be declared a hostile witness. After a sidebar conference, the Commonwealth was allowed to establish that in a statement given to police shortly after appellant’s arrest and at appellant’s preliminary hearing, Ms. Bonacci had indicated that appellant told her that he had, in fact, gone inside the house.</p>

Because of appellant’s failure to pay property taxes on the home for 1976-78, the residence had been posted for a tax sale. Further, the Dauphin County Prothonotary testified that various judgments had been entered against appellant’s used car business, M &amp; J Auto Sales and against appellant personally.</p>
    <p id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.5",275,[238,625,1141,314]]]'>Finally, Harry Whitman, Jr., the son of Mrs. Hugney’s boyfriend, testified that he had been incarcerated in the Dauphin County Prison at the same time as appellant. Whitman testified that appellant had told him that he had set fire to the Bamburger Road residence because he was “fed up with everything.”</p>

See, I Henry, Penna. Evidence, § 466 (1953). Such evidence is limited to declarations supporting the conclusion that the statements were spontaneous utterances of thought created by, or emanating from, the litigated act, and so near in time thereto as to exclude the possibility that they were the product of premeditation or design. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Noble, </em><a href="/pa/371/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="371 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1237062" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0138-01">371 Pa. 138</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.2d%20760" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="88 A.2d 760">88 A.2d 760</a> (1952); <em>Commonwealth v.

While this could have shown that Mrs. Hugney had a possi<a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>ble motive to set the fire, it would have had little if any effect, as both Mrs. Hugney and Harry Whitman, Sr., testified that they spent the night of the fire at Whitman’s apartment.</p>
    <p id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.5",279,[213,551,1143,475]]]'>Appellant finally claims that counsel was ineffective for failing to put forth a certain defense, i. e., that the victim started the fire himself. The decision not to present a defense is a tactical one and will not be deemed ineffective assistance if there is a reasonable basis for that position. See <em>Commonwealth v. Rice, supra. </em>We believe it would have been fruitless in light of the victim’s classic <em>res gestae </em>declarations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Counsel was not ineffective for failing to put forth the proposed defense.</p>

Appellant argues that the statements should have been found unreliable because the victim had past history of playing with fire bombs and gun powder. In fact, the victim had, some time before the fire, suffered the loss of his hand in an explosion of his own making. As the victim may very well have been a suspect in the instant fire, appellant argues that the victim’s statements were self-serving.</p>
