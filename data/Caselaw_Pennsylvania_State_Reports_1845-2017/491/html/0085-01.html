The two had recently returned to their joint home in East Berlin, Pennsylvania,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> from Las Vegas where they had lost most of their money in an attempt to implement Allen’s scheme for winning at dice. Allen already owned a .22 calibre pistol, and the two men purchased a rifle. They practiced firing the weapons that afternoon. After placing the weapons in the Allen car, the two men and their families drove to the home of a friend in Williamsport where the <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>family members were dropped off. During the drive and several stops at homes of acquaintances, both men consumed alcoholic beverages.</p>
    <p id="b137-5" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[189,450,1143,1103]]]'>Allen and Waters then proceeded to the Williamsport apartment of Diane Buck who was known to Allen. Allen suggested they go in “and maybe get a piece of ass and little bit of money.” When Allen was unable to break in the door, Waters opened it with a karate kick. Once inside, the men proceeded to a bedroom where they found Diane Buck and Terry Brennan in bed nude. Allen fired a shot between the couple, took Diane Buck from the bed, and, for the next one and one-half hours, pushed, beat, and shoved her around the apartment while attempting, unsuccessfully, to rape her. During this time, Waters kept guard over Brennan and took his cash and watch. At some point, when Waters left the room to get a cigarette, Allen entered the bedroom and shot Brennan in the neck with the pistol. Later, when all four persons were in the bedroom, Allen forced Diane Buck onto the bed with Brennan, who was injured and bleeding, and ordered her to ask him about his injuries. He also ordered Waters to rub Diane Buck’s stomach and Buck to “shake it ’round like you enjoy it.” He then took Buck out of the room and continued his efforts to rape her leaving Waters in the room with Brennan.</p>
    <p id="b137-6" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[189,1580,1144,523]]]'>Waters whispered to Brennan he would get him help and would try to mislead Allen by saying in a loud voice that he was going to finish Brennan off. He did so and shot his weapon into the air. He exited the room, told Allen he had killed Brennan, and encouraged him to leave. Allen went to check whether Brennan was really dead. By Diane Buck’s account, Allen threatened to kill both her and Waters if Brennan was not, in fact, dead. As Allen entered the bedroom, Waters shot him from behind. Allen died instantly-</p>

His pleas of guilty to these charges were accepted by the court on May 21, 1976, and sentence was deferred. However, when Brennan died on May 29 from the gunshot wound inflicted by Allen, Waters was rearrested and charged with the murder of Brennan.</p>

In support of its position, the Commonwealth cites language found in many of our decisions.

In short, in most instances where the language appears, whether the act causing the death had to be done in furtherance of the felony was not at issue. Indeed, in <em>Commonwealth v.

Hence, while cases may contain language which at first blush supports the Commonwealth’s position, the language was never meant to dispense with the requirement that the slayer’s act be in furtherance of the felony.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

Were it otherwise, an accomplice to a robbery would be guilty of felony-murder if one of his cofelons during the course of the robbery looked out a window, saw a passerby down the street, and shot and killed him even though the passerby had no connection to the robbery whatsoever. Obviously, even though an accomplice knows or should know those connected to a robbery may be killed during the course of a dangerous felony, see <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth argues no evidence existed to support a claim that the act was not in furtherance of the felony, and no charge was therefore necessary. We must disagree.
