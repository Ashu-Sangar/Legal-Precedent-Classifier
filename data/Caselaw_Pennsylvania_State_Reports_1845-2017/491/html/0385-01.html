First, we found that on the theoretical plane, the Act and its procedures did not violate any guarantees of the constitution. Second, we held that the Act was too new to properly determine whether the Act’s actual operation resulted in an unconstitutional infringement upon the right to jury trial.

In this Court’s decision in <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>1 Binney 416 (1808), Justice Yeates ruled that an increase in the jurisdiction of justices of the peace which caused certain matters which previously required resolution by a jury to be disposed of in a summary proceeding was not violative .of Article I, section 6 since the right of trial by jury was available on appeal, “though the party may be subjected to some inconvenience in making his election.” <em>Id. </em>at 425.

The first weakness in appellants position is the assumption that there will necessarily be a need for the second proceeding to obtain a fair recovery for the injured party’s loss. The legislative intent was to provide a more expeditious disposition to enable the victim to avoid the interminable delays that all too frequently occur in the regular court process. Nor is there any basis for concluding that the awards rendered in arbitration would not fairly compensate the victim to the full extent to which he or she is entitled. Further, the Act mandates the necessary insurance that virtually assures the satisfaction of the award of damages that are determined to be appropriate. Rather than imposing a burden, this legislation is designed to afford the plaintiff a swifter adjudication of his claim, at a minimal cost and guarantees the satisfaction of the judgment obtained. The Act further discourages dilatory and frivolous appeals by parties by providing for the imposition of all costs of both arbitration and trial, which includes the expenses of <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>expert witnesses on the losing party if the trial court finds that the basis for the appeal was capricious, frivolous and unreasonable. We are therefore satisfied that any theoretical burden upon the victim’s right to trial by jury is counterbalanced by the substantial advantages provided to him or her under the Act and is not the type of ‘onerous’ restriction alluded to in <em>Smith.</em>

Delay routinely occurs between the decision to prosecute a claim and the trial. Expenses for investigation and preparation attend the pre-trial preparation of all claims. The panel submission requirement generates evidence admissible at a future trial of the claim. The delay in the trial occasioned by this process and the cost attendant to it are in major part like those to be expected in any case. The participation by the parties in the panel processes will satisfy to a great extent their preparation needs. Such satisfaction will tend to reduce total aggregate time for trial preparation. Thus, the delay complained of will be offset to an appreciable extent. The cost to the party in whose favor the opinion is rendered would be in the range that such party would expect to pay to develop such evidence individually. And the . . . party against whom the opinion is rendered has been subjected to a cost by the process which would be much the same as he expects to pay to discover his opponent’s evidence. The panel submission requirement does impinge upon the right to trial by jury, but in so doing does not alter or change and does not impair the right contrary to constitutional limitation. The delay and expense complained of does not alter or change the substantial elements and incidents of the jury trial right for either party.”</blockquote>

There is every reason to believe that relief is now here. In December of last year, our Legislature by Act 1979-128 made several significant adjustments of the Malpractice Act. Arbitration panels have been reduced in size from seven members to three. § 308(b). The “strike list” method of selecting panel members has been eliminated. In its stead the Legislature has established a system of Administrator-appointments. § 308(a). Parties’ peremptory challenges to panelists have been reduced from six to one. § 308(c).
