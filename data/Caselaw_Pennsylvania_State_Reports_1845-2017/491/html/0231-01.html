    <p id="b282-6" data-blocks='[["BL_282.6",282,[293,898,1146,789]]]'>Appellant, Donald R. (Skip) Fisher, was married to Joanne Fisher for seventeen years, separated in 1978, and divorced in July 1978. After the separation, Joanne maintained an apartment and was seeing the victim, Danny McLaughlin. In June 1978, five months before the incident involved in this case, Fisher arrived at Joanne’s apartment to pick up their youngest daughter for an outing and saw McLaughlin on the couch. Following that chance meeting, Fisher twice stated to Joanne that he was going to kill her “nappy-haired bearded hippie boyfriend.” In September 1978, approximately two months before the incident, Fisher spoke to Joanne by telephone and stated that he knew who her boyfriend was. He warned her not to see him and threatened “to blow him away.” In October 1978, Joanne began living with McLaughlin at his apartment.</p>

The calls to Fisher’s home were initiated by McLaughlin who believed Fisher was responsible for vandalizing his garage and tried to get him to admit it. Beginning about 8 p. m., McLaughlin made five or six calls to Fisher’s residence and two calls to Fisher at other locations. Furthermore, several calls were made that evening by Fisher to McLaughlin. Following the last call, which occurred around 11 p. m., McLaughlin stated he was going to his garage to meet the police. Joanne Fisher testified that McLaughlin was intoxicated <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>that evening and did not have complete control of his mental faculties. “[H]e was acting different from what he normally acted; he was very angry. I had never seen him like that before.”</p>
    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[227,493,1143,674]]]'>Although no Commonwealth witness testified to overhearing McLaughlin and Fisher make plans to meet that evening, they did, in fact, meet shortly after midnight, presumably by prearrangement, on the Iron Bridge in Fairview Township, York County. Fisher arrived first and parked off the bridge instructing his sixteen-year-old son to remain in the car. He proceeded onto the bridge and waited for a time until McLaughlin drove up in his Scout, stopped on the bridge, got out carrying a .38 magnum pistol, and approached Fisher, who was unarmed and standing to the rear of the Scout. When McLaughlin was approximately four to six feet away, he shot Fisher in the right leg slightly above the knee.</p>
    <p id="b283-6" data-blocks='[["BL_283.6",283,[226,1195,1143,674]]]'>The shot, which forced Fisher to the ground, was followed by a scuffle during which a second shot was fired which hit neither Fisher nor McLaughlin. At some point during the scuffle, Fisher grabbed the barrel of the gun and began hitting McLaughlin about the head with the pistol butt. Fisher left the scene aided by his son. Immediately thereafter, McLaughlin was found on the bridge roadway behind the Scout. He was lying on his stomach with his head in a pool of blood but still alive. He died shortly thereafter in a hospital. Fisher and his son returned to their home and immediately telephoned Chief of Police Smith who arrived eight minutes later and took possession of the gun which Fisher had carried home with him.</p>

McLaughlin suffered fourteen blows about the face, forehead, and back of head. Ten of the blows, described as direct, rather than looping, were to the back of the head and caused multiple skull fractures. There was medical testimony that the blow or blows which caused the fractures would <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>have left McLaughlin prostrate with little capacity for movement.</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[293,374,1144,254]]]'>It is undisputed that Fisher delivered the fatal blows to McLaughlin. Fisher maintains, however, that the killing was committed in self-defense and was, therefore, justifiable. Statutory authority for the defense of self-protection is found in section 505(a) of the Crimes Code which provides:</p>

The witness stated that, as he reached the other side of the bridge, he heard a shot and shortly thereafter, a second shot. The second Commonwealth witness, who was also a passing motorist, testified that she heard the first shot and saw the flash of gunfire as she turned and looked directly at the scene.

United States, </em><a href="/us/256/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="256 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="3678877" data-case-paths="/us/256/0335-01">256 U.S. 335</a>, 344, <a href="/us/256/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="256 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="3678877" data-case-paths="/us/256/0335-01">41 S.Ct. 501</a>, 502, <a href="/us/256/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="256 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="3678877" data-case-paths="/us/256/0335-01">65 L.Ed. 961</a> (1921); <em>Inge </em>v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/f2d/356/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="356 F.2d 345" data-case-ids="3655091,839160" data-case-paths="/f2d/356/0345-01">356 F.2d 345</a> (D.C.

Since there was no direct evidence of deliberate excessive force and since the pathologist offered no opinion as to which of the fourteen blows fractured McLaughlin’s skull and thus, subdued him, the Commonwealth failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that Fisher’s belief as to the amount of force necessary to protect himself from imminent death or further serious bodily injury was unreasonable. Clearly, provocation by the victim was serious enough to cause a reasonable belief of imminent danger. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helm, </em>supra. Further, the immediate circumstances surrounding the altercation, <em>viz. </em>that Fisher and the victim were struggling for control of a gun and that Fisher was stunned and incapacitated by serious injuries inflicted only moments before by the victim-were adequate to justify Fisher’s belief that the amount of force he used was necessary.</p>

        <em>. </em>Fisher testified that he agreed to the meeting for the purpose of discussing the effect on his children of McLaughlin’s harassing telephone calls to his home. He stated that McLaughlin assured him he would come to the bridge unarmed and alone. Fisher stated further that he would not have gone to the scene if he had known McLaughlin was armed although he acknowledged that he was prepared for a fist fight if that became necessary to settle things.</p>
