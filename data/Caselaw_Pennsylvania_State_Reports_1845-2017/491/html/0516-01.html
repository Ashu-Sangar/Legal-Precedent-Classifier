Certainly nothing in the language of section 7, 66 Pa.C.S. § 1103(c)(7), <em>see </em>text <em>supra, </em>can be read to place time constraints on PUC proceedings on transfer applications. Act 69 does contemplate that the PUC will give priority generally to the taxicab service in Philadelphia, but it does not purport to, or even suggest that, transfer applications should receive priority over new applications for certificates.</p>
    <p id="b568-5" data-blocks='[["BL_568.6",568,[272,903,1147,998]]]'>Rather, Act 69 directs the PUC to “issue promptly such additional certificates as are necessary to insure that 1,400 taxicabs have authority to operate. . . . ” To achieve this goal, the PUC has decided to process applications, whether for new certificates or for transfer, on a chronological basis in order of filing. Some applications date back to 1975. This agency decision is an eminently reasonable one, and Yellow Cab has not introduced one iota of evidence to indicate their transfer application should receive special consideration over all other previous applications. Yellow Cab and the PUC stipulated that Yellow Cab would suffer immediate and irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction were -not granted, but there has been no attempt to demonstrate that any such harm would be unique to Yellow Cab. It can be reasonably assumed that similar harm would attend delays in processing for <em>all </em>applicants and that the harm would be proportionate to the time period elapsed between filing of an application and final PUC action upon it.</p>

Despite Yellow Cab’s protestations to the contrary, the preliminary injunction herein has disrupted, rather than restored, the status quo. The status quo is: Yellow Cab holds a certificate of public convenience, wishes to transfer that certificate to Duke Cab Company, and must pursue normal PUC procedures for transfer. The preliminary injunction has imposed a duty on the PUC to accelerate its procedure for one particular application, thus granting that application exalted status as compared with all other applications. It is fiction to suggest, as does Yellow Cab, that the mandatory preliminary injunction “restored the status quo.”</p>
    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.5",569,[210,1000,1144,786]]]'>Yellow Cab has also cited numerous federal court cases for the proposition that “a party may obtain relief against undue or improper delay in the action of an administrative agency.” Brief for Appellee at 13, <em>citing, e.g., Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., </em><a href="/us/270/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="270 U.S. 587" data-case-ids="6142550" data-case-paths="/us/270/0587-01">270 U.S. 587</a>, <a href="/us/270/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="270 U.S. 587" data-case-ids="6142550" data-case-paths="/us/270/0587-01">46 S.Ct. 408</a>, <a href="/us/270/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="270 U.S. 587" data-case-ids="6142550" data-case-paths="/us/270/0587-01">70 L.Ed. 747</a> (1926). We have no quarrel with this argument, but find it impossible on this record to establish <em>any </em>delay, let alone any undue or improper delay. Yellow Cab filed its complaint in equity a <em>mere 8 days </em>after the joint application for transfer was filed. The hearing on the complaint was held <em>only 12 days </em>after the joint application was filed. It is simply <em>unreasonable </em>for Yellow Cab to expect to have their application considered within 12 days of its filing, especially in light of the hundreds of applications which preceded its own.</p>

On July 9, 1980, Yellow Cab entered into an agreement of sale to transfer the certificate to Duke Cab Company (“Duke”). One day later, a joint application was filed with the Public Utility Commission (“P.U.C.”), requesting (1) approval by expedited review of the transfer of operating rights, and (2) temporary authority for Duke to operate under one of Yellow Cab’s certificates pending final decision by the P.U.C. Through its counsel, the P.U.C. refused to <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>state when the application would be considered or acted upon. On July 19, 1980, Yellow Cab filed a complaint in equity in the Commonwealth Court requesting a mandatory preliminary junction ordering the P.U.C. to: (1) immediately issue temporary operating authority to Duke, and (2) process the application for transfer of operating rights in an expedited fashion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> The Commonwealth Court issued an injunction requiring only that the P.U.C. make a decision on the application to transfer operating rights by September 1, 1980.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

It was thus conceded by the P.U.C. that Yellow Cab had no adequate remedy at law.

The majority blithely assumes that “similar harm would attend delays in processing for <em>all </em>applicants ...” (Majority opin. p. 666). It is irresponsible, however, to ignore Yellow Cab’s critical financial condition. A solvent business, or one about to begin operation, can and ordinarily does allow for bureaucratic delay in licensing and other matters as a cost of doing business. The orderly function of the business enterprise can, in fact, be staggered to accommodate delays of this nature so that they cost little or nothing. Yellow Cab, however, is in no position to make allowances for the unhurried pace of the P.U.C.’s administrative proceedings. As <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>Yellow Cab is currently operating under Chapter XI of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, the continuous decline in the value of one of its principal assets may threaten its status as an ongoing business entity, to the extreme detriment not only of the company but of the public as well. Yellow Cab has no means of suspending the decline in value of the certificate in order to preserve its own financial condition while awaiting the deliberations of the P.U.C. The P.U.C. refused to make any assurance whatsoever of <em>any </em>specific limit on the time required to process the applications. It is possible, if not probable, that Yellow Cab’s ability to reorganize under the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court would collapse long before the P.U.C. finds the opportunity to render a decision.</p>
    <p id="b579-4" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[207,992,1141,899]]]'>In consequence, and contrary to the simplistic assertion of the majority, it is far from “fiction” to suggest that a mandatory preliminary injunction would restore or maintain the “status quo,” the third requirement for the issuance of injunctive relief. The order was designed to forestall any further wasting of Yellow Cab’s assets attributable to administrative delay. It was the only way to ensure that Yellow Cab’s viability would not be adversely affected thereby. The “status quo” is altered with each day that passes while Yellow Cab’s resources dwindle unchecked. If Yellow Cab is no longer in existence when the P.U.C.’s decision is rendered, the “status quo” will have been effectively destroyed. The narrow view of the majority simply ignores the fiscal background against which this transfer application occurred. To evaluate the “status quo” by focusing solely on routine administrative transactions is hopelessly short-sighted.</p>

      <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>An injunction, however, is always prospective in effect. It is always a prophylactic measure, whether or not the harm in question includes past activity. The very purpose of its availability is the avoidance of harm which has not yet occurred but which, as here, is determined by a Court in Equity to be inevitable in the absence of prospective relief.</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.6",580,[280,621,1142,412]]]'>Moreover, under the reasoning of the majority’s opinion, it would not matter in the slightest whether Yellow Cab had waited 8 weeks or even 8 months. The opinion notes, in support of the supposed fairness of the P.U.C.’s approach to the matter at hand, that some applications date back to 1975. It is thus hard to imagine when, if ever, Yellow Cab would be able successfully to assert a claim of unreasonable delay under the rationale of the majority.</p>
    <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.7",580,[274,1052,1143,841]]]'>The P.U.C. made it abundantly clear that Yellow Cab’s application would not be considered before the end of 1980, and made no guarantee that it would be processed soon thereafter. In the face of its own financial deterioration, Yellow Cab had no choice but to initiate immediate remedial procedures necessary to prod the P.U.C. into acting without delay. The very promptness of Yellow Cab’s action lends credence to the urgency of the situation, and supports, rather than weakens, the complaint in equity. It evidences the fragile nature of the “status quo” from Yellow Cab’s viewpoint. Surely, the majority would not suggest that Yellow Cab should wait until it teeters on the brink of disintegration before praying for relief. In view of the fact that irreparable harm was stipulated by the parties, a mandatory injunctive remedy would be useless unless invoked by immediate, preventive action.</p>

But a “right” to relief in equity is frequently evanescent. It is, by definition, not an explicit legal right. It need not be <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>found in an external source such as statutory or common law. The “right” to injunctive relief can grow out of the circumstances by which the enumerated requirements are satisfied. The majority, however, comes to the unacceptable conclusion that the complainant in equity here must suffer irreparable harm, the existence of which has been stipulated, without a remedy.</p>
    <p id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[202,643,1142,943]]]'>I would concede that in the present case Yellow Cab has requested extraordinary treatment. The case for a “right” to such treatment can only be made out of the potential consequences flowing from the denial thereof. The P.U.C. is not, of course, responsible for the current insolvency of Yellow Cab. But as the agency legislatively designated responsible for the improvement of taxicab service in Philadelphia, the P.U.C. would clearly fail in its mandate if it were to expedite the demise of the largest cab company in the city. In truth, the remedy obtained below should have been unnecessary. The P.U.C.’s inexplicable intransigence in the face of Yellow Cab’s financial difficulties, however, effectively passed responsibility for the adequacy of Philadelphia’s taxi service into the hands of the Commonwealth Court. The Court’s only means of fulfilling that responsibility was to find a right to relief and fashion an equitable remedy, consisting of nothing more than an order ensuring review within a reasonable time.</p>
    <p id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[201,1614,1141,513]]]'>The majority pays lip service to the extremely narrow scope of our review of such an order, but has evaluated Yellow Cab’s claim as if <em>de novo. </em>The Commonwealth Court, in considering the full scope of this matter, decided that the case for relief was sufficient to make its order proper and necessary. Whether any member of this Court would have found otherwise in similar circumstances is not the question here.
