A non-jury trial was held before the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. At the close of the prosecution’s case-in-chief, the trial judge sustained appellee’s demurrer to the evidence and discharged the appelleedefendant. The Commonwealth then appealed to this Court.</p>

Applying that standard, the following facts appear of record.</p>
    <p id="b670-9" data-blocks='[["BL_670.9",670,[265,1409,1141,364]]]'>Barbara Ann Miklos and the infant son, Irwin, were visiting appellee, Ms. Miklos’ boyfriend, at his home in Pittsburgh. Early in the afternoon of June 10, 1979, the child began to misbehave by throwing some food. Appellee hit the child with his hand three or four times on the buttocks. When the child continued to misbehave, appellee escalated his discipline.</p>
    <p id="b670-10" data-blocks='[["BL_670.10",670,[264,1794,1142,525]],["BL_671.1",671,[189,274,1141,98]]]'>Later that afternoon, appellee beat the child about the legs and back with a belt which had a heavy buckle and a zipper pouch. Later still, after the boy spit some food on the floor, appellee again beat the child several times with the belt, finally stopping at Ms. Miklos’ insistence. After the child had placed his fingers near an electric fan, appellee beat him three or four times with his shoe, and apparently feeling this discipline insufficient to modify the young child’s behavior, appellee continued to beat him with a one-inch thick wooden stick against his buttocks, legs and <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>bare back. These multiple beatings raised numerous welts and bruises upon the child’s legs, buttocks, chest and back.</p>
    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[188,394,1143,467]]]'>Ms. Miklos decided to return to her own home that night, and together with her son and appellee, walked to the bus stop. However, as she had missed the last bus, she returned with appellee to spend the night at his apartment. Ms. Miklos placed the boy on the couch which was approximately 15 inches from the floor to the cushion, in appellee’s bedroom then went to bed at approximately 1:30 a. m. At that time, Ms. Miklos noticed no injuries or marks on Irwin’s head or face.</p>
    <p id="b671-6" data-blocks='[["BL_671.6",671,[189,892,1142,301]]]'>At about 3:45 a. m., Barbara Miklos was awakened by appellee’s shouts that Irwin was not breathing. The child was lying on his back beside the couch. Ms. Miklos then noticed bruises on his head. Neither paramedics nor hospital personnel could revive the child and he was pronounced dead at 4:12 a. m.</p>
    <p id="b671-7" data-blocks='[["BL_671.7",671,[186,1225,1145,473]]]'>Death was attributed to cerebral edema, or a swelling of the brain. This was caused by neurogenic shock which resulted from blunt force injuries sustained by the victim. The autopsy revealed numerous injuries to the chest, buttocks, back, and legs, and at least fifteen separate areas of contusions about the head of the child. Both the coroner, Dr. Steven Goldblatt and the chief forensic pathologist, Dr. Joshua Perper, testified that the child’s death was due to the combination of the trunk and head injuries.</p>
    <p id="b671-8" data-blocks='[["BL_671.8",671,[186,1723,1142,310]]]'>Pursuant to defense stipulation, evidence was received that blood stains found on the bedspread covering the couch cushions near where the child’s head lay as he slept, and a towel also found on the couch, were consistent with the blood of the victim. No blood stains were found elsewhere in the apartment.</p>

The reasoning was two-fold: first, the court noted no <em>direct </em>evidence had been introduced to show that appellee struck the victim in the head, and found the circumstantial evidence was as consistent with <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>self-inflicted, accidental injury as it was with homicide. Second, the court found that the below-head injuries were not shown to have been, of themselves, <em>the </em>cause of death and therefore, in the absence of <em>direct </em>proof of <em>above-head </em>beatings by appellee, ruled that the requisite causation element had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt.

Likewise, it is just as logical to argue that this child could have gotten down off that couch, wandered around in this darkened, cluttered room and fallen over something, injuring his head.” These possibilities are fantasy — did the child fall off the 15 inch-high couch 10 times? Did he stumble and fall 10 times? Of course not.

We find this distinction insignificant in view of the number and severity of the blows to Irwin’s head, as well as the fact that, according to Dr. Goldblatt, the injuries to the body alone would have initiated the shock, which shock would have decreased Irwin’s mobility.</p>

As we find the evidence sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that appellee caused the injuries to <em>both </em>the child’s head and his body, there is no need to address Judge Lewis’ causation analysis in detail. However, it appears this reasoning was also erroneous. Even though the lower court’s opinion points out that “both doctors testified that it was the combination of all the injuries that caused the child to go into shock and eventually die”, the proof of causation was insufficient because the doctors could not say “with medical certainty that the blows to the body alone ... were a substantial factor in bringing about the victim’s death.” We think this is an inaccurate reading of the doctors’ testimony. While purporting to view the medical testimony “as a whole”, the lower court appeared, instead, to focus on one instance where Dr. Goldblatt testified he <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>didn’t know how to qualify the word “substantial”.

However, the record <em>as a whole </em>reads loud and clear that <em>both </em>the above-neck and below-neck injuries— the combination of blows <em>as the lower court itself noted </em>— were the cause of death. Thus, even if there was no proof linking appellee to the head injuries, the medical testimony was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries struck by appellee to the child’s legs, back, chest and buttocks were a “direct and substantial cause of death.”</p>
