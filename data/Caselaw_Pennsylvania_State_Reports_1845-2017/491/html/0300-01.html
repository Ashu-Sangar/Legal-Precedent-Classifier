In its case-in-chief, the Commonwealth produced several lay witnesses who testified concerning Scarborough’s statements and actions both prior to and after the shooting. This testimony established the following:</p>
    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[296,1023,1147,1330]],["BL_355.1",355,[187,288,1148,2038]],["BL_356.1",356,[293,301,1142,309]]]'>During the day prior to the shooting and again immediately before he went to the victim’s home, Scarborough told Cindy Hampton, his common-law wife, that “Doug [the victim] has to die.” Upon returning from the victim’s home, he told her that “It’s done”; that he thought Doug was dead; that he had asked Doug to commit suicide; that she should not ask whether he did commit suicide; and, that he thought he had thrown the gun away. Shortly after this conversation, Scarborough called the police and told the dispatcher that he thought Doug Straley was dead; that there had been a shooting; that he was partially involved; and, that an ambulance should be sent. Scarborough also gave the dispatcher detailed directions to Straley’s home as well as his own address. After making the call, Scarborough told Cindy Hampton that “he would either have to stay and face the music or would have to go.” When the local police arrived at Scarborough’s home and read Scarborough his constitutional rights, he twice stated he did not know if he understood them. However, when the state police later arrived, read him his rights and asked if he understood, Scarborough nodded affirmatively. Shortly thereafter, Scarborough was handcuffed, and a frisk revealed spent and live .45 caliber cartridges in his pockets. Scarborough was then driven to the Straley home and gave directions throughout the drive. The state police questioned Scarbor<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>ough between the time they read him his rights at his home and their arrival at Straley’s apartment. Scarborough refused to respond to some questions and mumbled or went off on a tangent about politics in response to others. However, he did state that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol; that Doug Straley had his .45 caliber pistol; that he (Scarborough) had not fired the gun in a week; that he and Straley had shot the handgun in the past, but not recently; and, that he and Straley had a confrontation several hours earlier over political views. At the Straley home, Doug Straley was found dead in an upstairs bedroom. Cause of death was later determined to be a single wound to the head from a single projectile. After discovery of the body, Scarborough was again read his rights. He stated that he understood them and that he would not answer any more questions until he got an attorney. Questioning ceased, but Scarborough later blurted out that “[tjhere are things that you do that you know are wrong, but you still have to do them anyway,” and, that he had tried to get Straley to commit suicide, but he would not. Prior to making these statements, Scarborough had nodded affirmatively when the ambulance driver asked him, while they were alone, if he had killed Straley and then put his finger to his lips when a state police officer approached. On the way to the District Justice for arraignment, Scarborough told the state police officers the shortest route to take and, upon arriving, engaged in a normal conversation with the District Justice. While imprisoned on the day following the shooting, Scarborough phoned the victim’s home and asked for him. During the conversation with Straley’s landlady which followed, Scarborough admitted that he had tried to get Straley to commit suicide, but he had refused and that the gun had gone off in the ensuing struggle. During rebuttal, the Commonwealth called Dr. John M. Hume, a psychiatrist, who testified that, in his opinion, Scarborough did know the difference between right and wrong and knew the nature and quality of the act involved at the time of the shooting. This opinion was given in response to a lengthy hypothetical question and was based on the information contained in the <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>hypothetical question, Dr. Hume’s interviews with ten people connected with Scarborough, his review of the statements of 17 people given to the police in connection with the case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> his analysis of the results of tests given to Scarborough at Farview State Hospital, and the testimony given by the two defense experts.</p>

This issue was raised in Scarborough’s pre-trial suppression application, and suppression was denied after a hearing. However, Pa.R.Crim.P. 323 which governs pre-trial suppression of evidence only applies to evidence allegedly <em>obtained </em>in violation of a defendant’s rights. See Pa.R.C‘rim.P. 323(a), (h), (i), and the comment to the rule. Scarborough’s complaint does not speak to the method by which his statements were obtained, but to his own competency to make the admissions. See <em>Commonwealth v. Cunningham, </em><a href="/pa/457/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="457 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="478045" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0397-01">457 Pa. 397</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20644" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="322 A.2d 644">322 A.2d 644</a> (1974).

Questioning ceased but, a short time later, Scarborough stated, “There’s things you do you know are wrong, but you have to do them anyway.” Corporal Brown asked Scarborough what he meant, and Scarborough repeated the statement. Shortly thereafter and without further questioning, Scarborough also stated he had tried to get Doug (Straley) to commit suicide, but he would not do it. However, after this last statement was made, Corporal Brown asked Scarborough whether Doug Straley was a homosexual and whether he (Scarborough) had had relations with him.

The Commonwealth’s objection to that question was sustained by the magisterial court. Since direct examination of Dr. Hall did not directly or inferentially extend to the method of infliction of the victim’s wound or to who may have inflicted it, defense counsel’s question went beyond the scope of direct examination and constituted an attempt to develop the defense’s case.
