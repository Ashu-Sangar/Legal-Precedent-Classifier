Appellants are employees of appellee General Battery Corporation (“General Battery”), a manufacturer of lead lined batteries. For approximately eight years, Lash and Jablonski held positions which required their daily exposure to the hazards of lead handling. Well aware of the risks involved in such exposure, General Battery, much to its credit, periodically tested its employees in lead hazard positions to determine the lead content of their blood.</p>

      <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>In 1975, General Battery removed Lash and Jablonski to lower paying non-lead hazard positions “as a preventive matter” on the recommendation of the company physician, Dr. M. Wasserwig, because they had become “lead absorbers,” i. e., they had begun to absorb lead into their bloodstreams at an abnormally high rate, making further lead exposure hazardous. Because these positions were less remunerative than their former lead-hazard positions, appellants sought occupational disease benefits.</p>
    <p id="b344-4" data-blocks='[["BL_344.5",344,[254,789,1145,669]]]'>The Referee concluded as a matter of law that appellants had failed to prove by sufficient competent evidence (1) that they sustained a work related injury or occupational disease within the meaning of the Act and (2) that they were partially disabled due to a work related injury or occupational disease.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Although it expressly recognized that appellants had become absorbers of lead by reason of their immediate exposure thereto in their work and therefore were no longer permitted by their employer to work in lead exposed areas, thereby suffering a reduction in wages, the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Boárd affirmed the Referee. The Commonwealth Court agreed that benefits properly had been denied.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Such action was “preventive” since continued exposure undoubtedly would have caused appellants to become seriously ill. Fortunately, General Battery’s concern for the physical well-being of its employees, as evidenced by its practice of periodically testing them for elevated blood-lead levels, spared appellants from progressing to the advanced <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>stages of lead poisoning. The fact remains, however, that appellants no longer could work safely in jobs which brought them into contact with lead, and consequently they were forced to accept substantially less remunerative positions in low-lead areas. That appellants’ health had not yet deteriorated to the advanced stages of lead poisoning does not mean that they were not suffering from a compensable injury. They both had become absorbers of lead as a direct result of their job-related exposure to lead for a period of at least eight years; the amount of lead in their bodies had reached dangerous levels; and, as recognized by General Battery’s own physician, continued exposure would have been perilous. To require appellants to remain exposed until the advanced stages of lead poisoning had in fact been inflicted upon them in order to qualify for partial disability benefits would be unconscionable.</p>
