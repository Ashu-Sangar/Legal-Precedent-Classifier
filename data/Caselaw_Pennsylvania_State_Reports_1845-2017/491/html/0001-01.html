O’Dell purchased a tractor from Anderson Sales Service, Inc. under an installment sales contract and security agreement. The contract and agreement were then assigned to appellee Associates Financial Services Company, Inc. In February 1976, William O’Dell drove the tractor in the course of business to Texarkana, Texas where it became disabled. O’Dell requested appellant A. G. Turley, whose business in Zelienople, Pennsylvania included truck towing, repairs, and storage, to drive to Texas and haul the tractor back to Pennsylvania. Turley complied with this request, incurring expenses of $2,772.</p>

Associates, finding the tractor in Turley’s possession, brought this action in replevin against Turley and the O’Dells. Turley counterclaimed that he was entitled to a possessory lien on the tractor for expenses incurred in hauling and storing the tractor. The trial court awarded Associates possession of the tractor, but granted Turley a possessory lien on the tractor for the claimed expenses of $2,772. The Superior Court, <a href="/pa-super/262/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="262 Pa. Super. 584" data-case-ids="112305" data-case-paths="/pa-super/262/0584-01">262 Pa.

At its inception, the common law possessory lien was restricted to those circumstances where a lien creditor rendered his services upon the implied promise of the debtor to repay him. Since the action of assumpsit was not recognized at early common law, the possessory lien provided such creditors an extrajudicial remedy to collect their debt. Consistent with this limited purpose, the lien did not arise where the creditor had an action at law .upon an express contract. When the action of assumpsit on contracts implied in fact became available, however, the possessory lien was not abolished, but for reasons which are not clear was instead extended to creditors under express contracts.

Associates obtained a security interest on the tractor to protect its loan from other creditors of the O’Dells, as well as from default by the O’Dells. Surely such circumstances do not support a conclusion that Associates authorized the O’Dells to encumber Associates’ secured interest. Rather, they suggest that Associates intended that the O’Dells personally incur the expenses necessary to the maintenance of the tractor and thereby allow Associates to retain its security unencumbered. Additionally, at the time Turley entered the contract with the O’Dells, the disabled tractor did not pose a threat to the public welfare and Turley had ample opportunity to check the financial status of the tractor and <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>arrange an appropriate method of payment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellant Turley is therefore not entitled to a possessory lien on the tractor.</p>

The clear result of the opinion announced today is that whenever a person takes his vehicle to a service garage for maintenance or repair, the garageman, in order to insure his right to assert a common-law possessory lien in the event that the work is not paid for, will be required to determine whether there is a security interest against the vehicle, and if so, he will then have the task of seeking permission from the secured party to perform the work. This approach is unreasonable and impractical. To say, as the majority does, that the garageman has a contract action against the non-paying customer, ignores reality. Further, if the garageman keeps possession of the car after the work is completed, the customer who will not pay presumably has an action in conversion or replevin against the garageman. This result is unjust.</p>

If the owner, for whatever reason, then, does not have the title accessible, the garageman will not readily be able to determine the existence or non-existence of a security interest. Even if the title is accessible and the secured party has been identified, but has multiple offices, which office does the garageman call? And if he calls, what constitutes legal authority for him to proceed with the work? Is the telephone call adequate?

The majority, for reasons not explained, and contrary to the Vehicle Code, determines that O’Dell is not the “owner” of the truck.

This approach is simple and protects the interests of all parties: it is common for security agreements to provide that the debtor must keep the vehicle in good repair, a practice also in the interest of the owner. It is anomalous to make such a requirement, which obviously benefits both borrower and lender, and then make it difficult for the borrower-owner to secure services to maintain his vehicle.</p>

While it is true that <em>Meyers </em>sets out the rule that a workman must perform work at the request of the owner, it does not answer the question of who the owner is. In fact, in the <em>Meyers </em>case and in every other case cited in the majority opinion, some sort of bailment or installment lease is involved, not ownership, unlike the present case. In <em>Meyers, </em>for example, A owned cloth and contracted with B to make it into coats. B was a bailee of the cloth. B then contracted with C to make the coats at a price higher than A had agreed to pay B. C performed the work on the coats and sought payment from A after B absconded. The court observed:</p>

As the lower court pointed out, “If the secured party were to prevail, it would have the diminished value of its security restored at the expense of the repairman who would receive nothing for his labor, materials and storage charges.” 43 D. &amp; C.2d at 702.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
