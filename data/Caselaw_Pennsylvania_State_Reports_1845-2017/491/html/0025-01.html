See Act of December 9,1965, P.L. 1057, § 2 (Act 405 of 1965) and Act of June 12, 1968, P.L. 192, § 1 (Act 96 of 1968), amending the Public School Code of 1949, Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, § 1142.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> A <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>majority of appellants, twenty-eight of the forty-six, claim appellee failed properly to apply Code formulas in calculating higher local salaries during the 1965-66 school year.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> All appellants claim appellee violated the Code in 1967-68.

Through these years, and most recently in Act 405 of 1965 and Act 96 of 1968, the Legislature has repeatedly adjusted not only the minimum salaries but also the variables governing salary calculation.

Nothing contained in the Code, either as originally enacted or as amended, in any respect prescribes any particular means by which greater salaries must be determined. The sole limitation the Legislature has imposed is the requirement that a school district comply with the applicable statewide minimum salary schedule. As section 1152 of the Code provides,</p>
