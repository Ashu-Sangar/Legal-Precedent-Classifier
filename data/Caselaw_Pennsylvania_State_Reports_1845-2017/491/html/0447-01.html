      <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>Of course, recalling the sentiment with which we began our discussion of the No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, it is not surprising to learn that Allstate’s argument is cogent so long as one ignores contrary signs of guidance in the Act. For example, as we stated above, in its preamble the Act exclaims its purpose to be, <em>inter alia, </em>“the maximum feasible restoration of all individuals injured and compensation of the economic losses of the survivors of all individuals killed in motor vehicle accidents on Commonwealth highways. . . . ” Historically, the courts of this Commonwealth have routinely followed this spirit and found coverage for the insured in close or doubtful insurance cases. The tendency has been that if we should err in ascertaining the intent of the legislature or the intendment of an insurance policy, we should err in favor of coverage for the insured. Obviously, to adopt Allstate’s interpretation of the Act in the instant case is to give less than generous application to that principle. In addition, although Allstate directed our attention to the definitional dichotomy of “victim-deceased victim” which the Act creates, it has overlooked the impact of the Act’s definition of “injury.” Section 103 provides: “ ‘Injury’ means accidentally sustained bodily harm to an individual and that individual’s illness, disease, or <em>death </em>resulting therefrom.” [Emphasis added.] Because the Act specifically defines the term “injury,” for the purposes of construing the Act, “injury” is a term of art to which we should ascribe precisely the meaning the Act gives it. As one might expect when he analyzes the No-Fault Act, this interpretational truism creates another paradox, a nettlesome impediment for Allstate’s position. True, the Act has differentiated victims from deceased victims, but it has not differentiated injuries from fatal injuries. The result is that some sections of the Act which Allstate insists apply only to non-fatal injuries are not so limited by their terms. For example, Section 103 of the Act defines “Loss” as the “accrued economic detriment resulting from <em>injury .. . consisting of, </em>and limited to, allowable expense, <em>work loss, </em>replacement services loss, <em>and </em>
      <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>
      <em>survivor’s loss.” </em>[Emphasis added.] Since injury means death, as well as non-fatal injury, Section 103 can be read to mean that work loss is an accrued economic detriment resulting from death. This implication is fortified by Section 206 of the Act which, in attempting to define “net loss,” provides that life insurance proceeds are not to be subtracted from loss in calculating the net loss available to an individual because of injury.</blockquote>

In the case of work loss, as already discussed, the Act is simply providing a certain measure of Survival Act damage, on a no-fault basis. The amount will then neatly coordinate with recovery of any excess amount in a tort action under Section 301(a)(4). Similarly, with respect to so much of survivor’s loss recovery as represents contributions to survivors, this is simply no-fault wrongful death recovery. There is in fact no duplication of recovery in the same sense that third-party recovery in a wrongful death and survival claim involve different economic loss claims. They do not overlap.</blockquote>

As appellee Pontius points out in his brief, the legislature has allowed double recovery of other benefits under the Act. For example section 203 of the Act concerning Collateral Benefits permits victims to recover their medical expenses from Blue Cross and Blue Shield and then recover the same expenses a second time from the no-fault carrier. It is apparent that the “vice” of double recovery was not foremost in the minds of the legislators when the No-Fault Act was enacted.

As we view the Act, the decedent’s contribution of income under survivor’s loss recovery shall be excluded from the amount recovered under work loss. In this manner, both basic loss benefits will compliment, rather than duplicate each other. It must be kept in mind that the Act sets monetary limits of $15,000 for recovery of work loss benefits and $5,000 of survivor’s loss benefits. If actual losses do not reach or exceed these limits, the full amounts of these basic loss benefits need not be paid. The position taken by the Superior Court in Heffner<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> is the most cogent approach to the No-Fault Act.
