(Conaway) filed a complaint in assumpsit against 20th Century Corporation (Century). Conaway’s action sought to recover damages for failure to comply with an alleged oral contract between the parent corporation of First State Life and Century. According to the complaint, the contract concerned a promise by Century to purchase 500,000 shares of capital stock of First State Life for $250,000.</p>
    <p id="b241-8" data-blocks='[["BL_241.9",241,[229,1168,1144,1145]]]'>On November 6, 1974, Century filed preliminary objections to the complaint in the nature of a demurrer alleging, inter alia, that the cause of action was barred by the statute of frauds. On September 29, 1975, the trial court sustained Century’s preliminary objections and dismissed Conaway’s complaint. The court’s order dismissing the complaint stated: “AND NOW, this 29th day of September, 1975, [Century’s] demurrer is sustained in accordance with the above opinion, and the action dismissed.” The opinion indicated that the demurrer was being granted on the basis of the statute of frauds; that, given this ruling, the other issues raised by the preliminary objections did not have to be discussed; that an implication in Conaway’s brief on preliminary objections that other writings might exist to satisfy the statute of frauds could not cure the deficiencies of the complaint; that, if such writings existed, “the proper procedure would be to petition the court for reconsideration of the demurrer, attaching the writings”; and, that “[i]n this manner the court may consider whether such material overcomes the bar of the statute of frauds and whether [Conaway] should be granted leave to amend the complaint.” No appeal was timely taken from that order.</p>

      <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>On October 20, 1975, the trial court entered an order allowing Conaway twenty days from that date to file a petition for reconsideration. On November 7, 1975, a petition for reconsideration was filed. Attached to the petition were several writings which Conaway alleged satisfied the statute of frauds. After Century responded to the petition and after Conaway responded to new matter raised by Century, the matter was argued before the trial court en banc. On March 19, 1976, the trial court issued a per curiam ‘Memorandum on Petition for Reconsideration” and order. The memorandum stated, inter alia, that the court had “reviewed the items attached to [Conaway’s] petition and find . . . they do not overcome the bar of the statute.” The memorandum clearly addressed the merits of whether the writings attached to the petition for reconsideration satisfied the statute of frauds. The order merely denied the petition for reconsideration.</p>

On July 12, 1978, a divided Superior Court reversed both the March 19, 1976 order which denied reconsideration and the September 29, 1975 order which sustained Century’s preliminary objections, and remanded for further proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In an opinion by Judge Price, the majority ruled that the writings attached to Conaway’s petition for reconsideration “afforded] a <em>basis </em>for believing that the offered oral evidence rest[ed] on a contract actually made,” and that the court erred in granting the demurrer.

As to the failure to appeal the order of September 19, 1975, the Superior Court indicated that, in its view, the trial court had, in effect, granted reconsideration and thereby caused the time to appeal to run anew from the entry of the decision on reconsideration pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1701(b)(3) thereby excusing the failure to timely appeal the order of September 19, 1975.</p>

We concur with the judgment of the Superior Court that an injustice would have resulted if the appeal were held untimely because, in effect, the order of September 29, 1975 was not final, and hence, not appealable. Accordingly, no appeal from that order was required.</p>

A petition for reconsideration of an order asks the court to reconsider its order <em>in light of the record it previously considered. </em>Neither the writings nor a petition to amend the complaint were of record and the court’s order, in effect, allowed Conaway to add the writings to the record. <em>By allowing him to add to the record </em>and stating it would thereby be permitted to determine “whether such material overcomes the bar of the statute of frauds and whether [Conaway] should be granted leave to amend the complaint,” neither of which issues the court had yet to consider, the court specifically indicated that the litigation was not at an end; that its order was not intended to dispose of the entire case; and, that Conaway was not out of court. Hence, whatever finality the court expressed on the one hand, it destroyed on the other, and the practical ramification of the order of September 29, 1975 was not to put Conaway out of court.
