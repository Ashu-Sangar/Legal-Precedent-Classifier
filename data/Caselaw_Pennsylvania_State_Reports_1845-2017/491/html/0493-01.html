Edith Bressi, claimant/appellee, injured her back during the course of her employment with employer/appellant, Dale Manufacturing Company, on January 23, 1970. As a result of her injury claimant suffered a ruptured disc, and on February 18, 1970, she underwent an operation for the removal of the disc. The parties entered into an open compensation agreement under which claimant was to receive weekly compensation plus medical and hospital expenses.</p>
    <p id="b543-6" data-blocks='[["BL_543.7",543,[216,1042,1142,472]]]'>Claimant did not recover as her physician had predicted, and an infection developed which prevented the proper and speedy healing of the surgical wound. In March, 1971, claimant underwent a second operation during which her physician discovered that he had failed to remove a cottonoid pad from the wound during the initial operation. Six months later claimant filed a complaint in trespass alleging her physician’s negligence. This action resulted in a $30,000 pre-trial settlement.</p>
    <p id="b543-7" data-blocks='[["BL_543.8",543,[212,1538,1143,794]],["BL_544.1",544,[287,292,1140,96]]]'>Pursuant to the compensation agreement, employer made medical payments for the two surgical operations and also made weekly compensation payments to claimant during the period between the two operations. On June 25, 1973, employer filed a Petition to Suspend Payments and to Determine Subrogation Rights. Employer alleged that the negligence of claimant’s physician aggravated the initial injury. He therefore claimed that he was entitled to subrogation with respect to the settlement in order to recover previously paid compensation and medical expenses and to receive a credit for future payments to the extent of the remaining balance of the settlement. In claimant’s responsive pleading she asserted that the disability resulting from her doctor’s negligence lasted for a one-year period and terminated when the cottonoid pad was removed and the <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>wound finally healed. She further alleged that her continuing disability was the result of the original injury.</p>
    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.5",544,[286,404,1142,455]]]'>A hearing before a referee was held on February 20,1975. The only evidence proffered by employer was a copy of the complaint claimant had filed against her physician in the malpractice action. Based only upon this complaint the referee found in favor of employer and directed subrogation. The Board reversed the referee, and Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board’s decision. <em>Dale Manufacturing Company v.

    <p id="b544-6" data-blocks='[["BL_544.6",544,[284,877,1141,198]]]'>Employer’s claim to subrogation is based upon Section 319 of The Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act, hereinafter “Act”, Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, <em>as amended, </em>77 P.S. § 671, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b544-7" data-blocks='[["BL_544.7",544,[324,1087,1101,302]]]'>“Where the compensable injury is caused in whole or in part by the act or omission of a third party, the employer shall be subrogated to the right of the employe . . . against such third party to the extent of the compensation payable under this article [footnote omitted] by the employer. ...”</blockquote>
    <p id="b544-8" data-blocks='[["BL_544.8",544,[279,1405,1144,916]]]'>Employer correctly asserts that the rationale for this right of subrogation is threefold: to prevent double recovery for the same injury by the claimant, to ensure that the employer is not compelled to make compensation payments made necessary by the negligence of a third party, and to prevent a third party from escaping liability for his negligence. <em>Stark v. Posh Construction Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/192/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="192 Pa.

As Judge Spaeth has noted, “[t]his result is just, because the party who caused the injury bears the full burden; the employee is ‘made whole,’ but does not recover more than what he requires to be made whole; and the employer, innocent of negligence, in the end pays nothing.” <em>Arnold v. Brobonus, </em><a href="/pa-super/257/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="257 Pa. Super. 110" data-case-ids="102932" data-case-paths="/pa-super/257/0110-01">257 Pa.Super. 110</a>, 116, <a href="/pa-super/257/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="257 Pa.

Thus, where a third party’s negligent conduct causes injury to an employee actually engaged in the business of his employer, there is a clear, justifiable right to subrogation under Section 319 of the Act.</p>

      <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>In the case at issue, however, the third party’s negligent conduct occurred subsequent to the original, compensable injury. In order for employer to establish a right of subrogation in this case, the Commonwealth Court has said, “the employer must show he is compelled to make payments by reason of the negligence of a third party and the fund to which he seeks subrogation was for the same compensable injury for which he is liable under the Act.” <em>Dale Manufacturing Company v.

    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.5",545,[208,844,1143,630]]]'>The above assertion is based upon the rationale behind Section 319 of the Act as was noted in <em>Stark </em>v. <em>Posh Construction Company, <a href="/citations/?q=382%20A.2d%201256" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="382 A.2d 1256">supra,</a> </em>and the distinction drawn in <em>Savage v.

The court in <em>Savage </em>drew a distinction between new and independent injuries caused by a third party and those that aggravate or extend the initial compensable injury, holding that only the latter entitled an employer to subrogation rights. Appellant argues that this distinction is an artificial, improper one and should be abandoned. Given the dearth of evidence presented in the instant case, we are unable to evaluate such a claim.</p>
