Based on these numbers of days of instruction provided, the Commonwealth’s Department of Education determined appellee district is entitled to a state basic instructional subsidy of $6,169,399.84. Appellee district disputed the Department’s subsidy calculation. Appellee district claimed the Department should have calculated the subsidy as though 180 days of instruction had been provided. Appellee district sought a subsidy of $6,704,532.76, or $535,132.52 more than the Department determined to be proper. After a hearing, the Secretary of Education sustained the Department’s determination. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court agreed with appellee district that the Department erred in taking into account that less than the statutorily-mandated number of days of instruction had been provided, but held only that <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>“[a]ll future final subsidy payments shall be calculated” without regard to reduced instructional days.

As in those opinions, we hold that the Legislature here requires the Department, in calculating state subsidies, to take into account that a district has not provided the full, statutorily-mandated number of days of instruction. Accordingly we vacate the order of the Commonwealth Court at No. 494 C.D.1979 and reinstate the order of the Secretary of Education.</p>
