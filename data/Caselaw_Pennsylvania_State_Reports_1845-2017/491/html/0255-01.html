Judicial Branch of the State”; that whether a court was intended to be such an “establishment” was unclear because no similar nomenclature so referring to a court could be found; that, given this uncertainty, the legislative intent had to be determined by considering, <em>inter alia, see </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(c), the purpose of the statute and the presumption that the legislature did not intend to violate the constitution, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(3); that the primary purpose of the statute was to expose and prevent real and potential conflicts of interests; that, given the fact that the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Code of Professional Responsibility address themselves to “the same mischief”, the statute was not intended to proscribe the activities of judges and former judges of the Courts of Common Pleas; and, that a contrary construction of the statute would render it unconstitutional because it would result in the statute being a “direct restriction upon the practice of law” and, hence, an improper <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>usurpation of the exclusive power of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to regulate the practice of law.</p>

Otherwise, every time the legislature utilized a new term, it would have to be considered unclear and ambiguous. The words of the English language are not unclear and ambiguous simply because the legislature has not previously used them; rather, in such circumstances, the word or term must first be examined according to its common and approved usage. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1903(a); <em>Commonwealth v.
