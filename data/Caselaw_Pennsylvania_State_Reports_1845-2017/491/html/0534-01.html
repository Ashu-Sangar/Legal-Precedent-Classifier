X-rays revealed that a soft tissue mass had invaded the bone at the point of fracture. An excisional biopsy was performed, revealing a fibrosarcoma (cancer of the bone) of low-grade malignancy. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Corn surgically removed part of the bone and replaced it with a bone graft. Tests showed no cancer cells at either end of the incision and it was thought that all cancer cells had been removed. Unfortunately, however, a year later the cancer recurred at the same site, and on December 16, 1966, Dr. Corn amputated Edwin’s left arm above the elbow.</p>

Although he could not testify precisely when the bone invasion occurred, Dr. Corn did conclude that it was long before November 20,1965, when he was first consulted. Dr. Corn further testified that a biopsy should have been performed upon observation of the continuing growth, even before bone invasion would appear in the x-rays, because if the fibrosarcoma had been discovered before it invaded the bone, it would not have been necessary to do <em>any </em>bone operation. Thus Dr. Inouye’s failure to diagnose the fibrosarcoma, testified Dr. Corn, was a substantial factor in the boy losing his arm.</p>

There was abundant expert testimony, however, that his negligence <em>increased the risk </em>of fibrosarcoma. If the soft tissue tumor had been biopsied and removed in a timely manner, the fibrosarcoma, i. e., the bone invasion, was less likely to have occurred. Since, fibrosarcomas can metastasize-as both Dr. Corn and Dr. Inouye agreed-the possibility of metastasis would have been less if the tumor had been removed before it spread to the bone. Dr. Corn testified that Edwin’s prognosis remained guarded because of the possibility of metastasis, and for this reason, annual chest x-rays had been taken since the amputation. Although the likelihood of metastasis may have lessened with time, Dr. Corn opined that Edwin should be checked for metastasis of the cancer “for many, many, many more years.” (R. 190a).

Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em><a href="/pa/403/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="403 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1299455" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0614-01">403 Pa. 614</a>, 618, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.2d%20865" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="170 A.2d 865">170 A.2d 865</a>, 867 (1961), a doctor properly may be allowed to explain the possible future effects of an injury, and with less definiteness than is required of opinion testimony on causation.
