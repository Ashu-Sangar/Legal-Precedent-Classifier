Berry died as a result of his wounds, and appellant Otis Walker was arrested for his participation in the incidents. After trial by jury, appellant was convicted of murder of the third degree, aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy, and possessing instruments of a crime. Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to consecutive prison terms of ten to twenty years on the murder conviction and one to two years on the aggravated assault conviction. Sentence on the other two convictions was suspended.</p>

In the instant case, the offense of involuntary manslaughter was not at issue and the evidence would not reasonably have supported a verdict of guilty of that offense. The Commonwealth’s evidence unquestionably established an intentional killing, and appellant’s defense was that he went to the scene of the crimes anticipating only a “fair” fistfight, and fled as soon as his fellow gang members drew their knives. Thus, if appellant’s version of the incidents was accepted by the jury, he should have been acquitted of murder, not found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and the trial court properly refused his request for a jury instruction on that offense.</p>

This case was assigned to this writer after oral argument on May 23, 1980, but could not be proceeded with at that time because appellant’s counsel was given until June 23,1980 to file a supplemental brief.

This extension expired on July 4, 1980, at which, time the supplemental brief had not yet been filed. On July 16, 1980, appellant’s counsel filed a motion for permission to file the supplemental brief nunc pro tunc.
