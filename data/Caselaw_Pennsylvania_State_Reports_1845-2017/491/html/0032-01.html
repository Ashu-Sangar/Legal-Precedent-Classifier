    <p id="b83-8" data-blocks='[["BL_83.9",83,[225,823,1139,581]]]'>In March 1975, appellant, Robert Timko, was tried by the Court of Common Pleas sitting without a jury in Lycoming County on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, possession of marijuana, possession of an unlicensed firearm, and disorderly conduct. Timko was found guilty of possession of marijuana and possession of an unlicensed firearm. After post-verdict motions were filed, judgment was arrested on the weapon charge, and a sentence of one year’s probation was imposed on the possession conviction. The Superior Court affirmed the order,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and we granted Timko’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

While making a turn, Timko’s van almost struck one vehicle, then drifted across the center line nearly striking Officer Williams’ vehicle. As he passed Officer Williams’ car, Timko looked out of an open window in his vehicle and directed an obscene gesture at him. The policeman turned and pursued Timko intending to arrest <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>him for reckless driving. Moments later, Timko parked his van but struck vehicles to the front and rear of his own in the process. When Officer Williams approached Timko on foot, Timko rolled up his window and locked himself inside the van. When requested to show his license and registration, he responded with an obscene refusal. Officer Williams observed several boxes marked “shotgun shells” in the van and returned to his police vehicle to call for assistance.</p>
    <p id="b84-5" data-blocks='[["BL_84.5",84,[271,718,1146,1119]]]'>Soon, other police officers arrived at the scene. Timko continued his refusal to tender identification except for momentarily flashing a card in the window in such a manner that the officers were unable to read it. After addressing further obscenity to the policemen, Timko started the motor of his van. While he was attempting to pull out of the parking space, police officer Jett was trying to pry open the van door using a tire iron. As Officer Jett pried, Timko looked at him and then reached for a zippered brown valise sitting atop another article in the back seat of the van. Having seen boxes marked “shotgun shells” in the vehicle and suspecting Timko was reaching for a weapon in the valise, Officer Jett smashed the van window open with the tire iron. Within a short period of time, he unlocked the door, helped pull Timko from the van, and retrieved the brown bag. Before being led away to the police car, Timko was frisked and handcuffed while standing next to the driver’s seat door of the van. While this was happening, the police opened and searched the seized brown valise. It contained two packages of marijuana with a total weight of five hundred and forty-five (545) grams and a loaded revolver.</p>

Regrettably, the record is unclear about the exact sequence of events surrounding the search, but it does strongly suggest that Timko was under the control of the police officers, possibly handcuffed, at the time of the search and that the bag was under the exclusive control of the police officers at the time of the search. On this record, the Commonwealth has not established the search was incident to an arrest. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em><a href="/pa/489/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="489 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="1762430" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0369-01">489 Pa. 369</a>, <a href="/pa/489/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="489 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="1762430" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0369-01">414 A.2d 113</a> (1980).</p>

While the events leading up to the search were such as would lead a reasonable policeman to believe the zippered bag might contain a weapon, nothing further occurred to justify an immediate warrant-less search. For example, there is no suggestion the bag contained explosives or some other item which might in some way endanger the police officers or others, nor is there a suggestion the bag or its contents were in danger of concealment or destruction.</p>

Maroney, </em>supra. That exception is based on the inherent mobility of automobiles with consequent practical problems in obtaining a warrant and on the diminished expectation of privacy which is accorded automobiles because of their open construction, their function, and their subjection to a myriad of state regulations. <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em><a href="/us/433/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="433 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6176124" data-case-paths="/us/433/0001-01">supra.</a> In the case of luggage, no such considerations operate to diminish the citizen’s expectation of privacy. A piece of luggage is not mobile once it is taken into police custody, and it is ordinarily a place in which <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>personal belongings are stored or transported. <em>Arkansas v.
