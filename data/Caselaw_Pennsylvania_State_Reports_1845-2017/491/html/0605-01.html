    <p id="b654-13" data-blocks='[["BL_654.14",654,[283,1643,1141,425]]]'>Appellant raises five assignments of error, arguing: his confession was involuntary and coerced; admission of his co-defendant’s redacted extrajudicial statement violated his right to confront and cross-examine his accuser; his confession was admitted without establishment of the corpus delicti of robbery; his right to a fair trial was denied due to the district attorney’s allegedly improper closing comments; and the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict.</p>
