Stout and his wife and two children, were severely injured when an automobile owned by Hamilton Buick and Pontiac, Inc. (“Hamilton”) and driven by one of its repair customers collided with their automobile. At issue below was whether Hamilton’s motor vehicle liability insurance policy written by appellee, Universal Underwriters <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>Insurance Company (“Universal”), extended coverage to the customer-driver who had borrowed the car while his mother’s vehicle was in Hamilton’s shop for repairs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Court of Common Pleas found in favor of Universal, holding that the customer-driver was not an insured under Hamilton’s policy.</p>

Appellants failed, however, to docket their appeal with the Superior Court pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 907 as it then existed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> On July 6, 1978, without prior notice to appellants, Universal filed a motion to quash <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>the appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1971 for failure to comply with Rule 907.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> On the next day, July 7, 1978, appellants cured their oversight by filing a copy of the notice of appeal and proof of service with the prothonotary of the Superior Court. Despite appellants’ prompt action, Universal’s motion to quash was granted on August 1, 1978 for failure to comply with Pa.R.A.P. 907. This appeal followed.</p>

We agree. Pa.R.A.P. 902 expressly provides that failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does <em>not </em>affect the validity of an appeal. The extreme action of dismissal should be imposed by an appellate court sparingly, and clearly would be inappropriate when there has been substantial compliance with the rules and when the moving party has suffered no prejudice.</p>
