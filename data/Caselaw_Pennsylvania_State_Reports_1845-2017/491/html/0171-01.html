Appellant asserts a plea bargain had been entered into under which the Commonwealth would recommend no greater than a ten year maximum sentence on all charges in return for appellant’s guilty plea and withdrawal of post-verdict motions. Appellant thus assigns as ineffectiveness counsel’s failure to place the terms of the plea bargain on the record. The Commonwealth responds that the August 11, 1975, colloquy demonstrates there was no plea bargain of any sort. This is nonsense.</p>

When the proceedings reconvened the trial court conducted the colloquy expressly as if a plea agreement had in fact been reached. But that is not to say appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is meritorious. For while the colloquy does reflect that a plea bargain had been reached, there is no indication anywhere in the record that the agreement concerned sentencing. On the contrary the colloquy clearly demonstrates appellant was entering his plea in return for a decision by the Commonwealth to nolle prosse several charges then pending against appellant.
