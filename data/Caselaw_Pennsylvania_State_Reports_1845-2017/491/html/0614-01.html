The asserted defects in the charge are an incomplete definition of voluntary manslaughter and an improper expression of opinion by the judge with respect to the inappropriateness of a voluntary manslaughter verdict. The challenged portion of the charge is the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b663-9" data-blocks='[["BL_663.10",663,[249,1626,1101,578]]]'>Let me, therefore, turn to the third offense that has been brought against this individual, and that is Voluntary Manslaughter. I just stated to you that Voluntary Manslaughter is a lesser grade than murder. And Voluntary Manslaughter may be defined for you as the intentional and unlawful killing of a human being without malice-without malice-either expressed or implied, but under the immediate influence of sudden passion resulting from serious provocation. Now, the absence of malice is the controlling element which reduces the unlawful killing to manslaughter.</blockquote>

I don’t believe that this factor is involved in the present case.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b664-5" data-blocks='[["BL_664.5",664,[318,445,1105,810]]]'>As Voluntary Manslaughter is frequently a wilful [sic] act, to reduce a felonious killing to manslaughter it is necessary that the circumstances indicate the absence of malice, either direct or implied. Therefore, Voluntary Manslaughter exists where there was an intentional act which caused death, but it was administered with a <em>sufficient provocation </em>and while the defendant was either in <em>a state of rage or passion, without time to cool, so that he was placed beyond the control of his reason and suddenly impelled to do the deed. </em>Now, if any of these three factors be lacking, if there is provocation but no passion, or if there is passion without sufficient cause or provocation, or if there has been time to cool off and reason has resumed, then, of course, the killing is not Voluntary Manslaughter by Murder.</blockquote>
