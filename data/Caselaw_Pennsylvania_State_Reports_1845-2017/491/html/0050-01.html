(These items are job title, vacation and funeral leave and union visitation). Section 1620 provides, in relevant part: “The salaries and compensation of county officers shall be as now or hereafter fixed by law. The salaries and compensation of all appointed officers and employes who are paid from the county treasury shall be fixed by the salary board created by this act for such purposes . . ” The Salary Board has no control over non-financial items — instead, management of the prison guards with respect to these items is vested <em>exclusively </em>with the county prison boards. <em>See </em>Act of May 16, 1921, P.L. 579, <em>as amended, </em>61 P.S. §§ 408 and 409 (supp. 1979-80) delineating the respective spheres of authority of the prison board and the salary board with respect to guards at county jails or prisons. Thus, the argument that the “vote of a county salary board is a legislative action” within the meaning of section 805 of Act 195 is of no moment as to those items over which the salary board has no control, and it was erroneous for the Prison Board and the Commonwealth Court to ignore the distinction between these items and those involving salaries and compensation.</p>

Their syllogism fails, however, when the Prison Board equates the <em>fixing </em>of salaries and compensation <em>by </em>the Salary Board with appropriation of funds and levying of taxes by a lawmaking body. The authority to appropriate funds and levy taxes has been vested in the county commissioners, the County Code 16 P.S. §§ 202(6) and 203, <em>not </em>in the Salary Board. Moreover, a member of the executive branch of local government — either the county controller or the county treasurer where there is no controller — sits on the salary boards, 16 P.S. § 1622, further discrediting the notion that the salary boards are legislative bodies.

Indeed, the Salary Board must fix the salaries and compensation in accordance with the terms of the award. Accordingly, the unilateral rejection of the arbitration award by the Prison Board was, as the PLRB found, a section 1201(a)(1) unfair labor practice, and their <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>directions to the Prison Board to implement the award was proper under section 1301.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

If, at that point, legislative enactment is required — that is, if taxes must be levied or funds appropriated — then our holding herein cannot be read to override the Constitutional prohibition against improper delegation of legislative powers. Where it is <em>demonstrated </em>by the public employer that the lawmaking body has met, considered and rejected an arbitration award concerning financial items, then Art.

I agree that since neither of these two Boards are empowered with the legislative authority to appropriate funds or levy taxes, they are not within the proviso of section 805 of the Public Employe Relations <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>Act, Act of June 23, 1970, No. 195, P.L. 563, 43 P.S. § 1101.805. However, since the County Commissioners are granted such authority, the Commissioners are within the meaning of the proviso. Accordingly, as to the County Commissioners, the arbitration award was merely advisory. I, therefore, agree that this proviso did not release the Prison Board from its statutory duty to implement the arbitration award. The Prison Board’s attempt to raise section 805 is premature. It would only come to play if and when the County Commissioners refuse to make the required appropriation.</p>
