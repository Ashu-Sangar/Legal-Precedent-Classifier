While on parole from the original sentence, appellant was sentenced in September 1977 on new charges, arising in Delaware County, to a term of imprisonment of two to four years. After a proceeding before the Board, during which it is disputed whether appellant was represented by counsel, his parole was revoked and he was recommitted to serve the balance of his original sentence. Appellant filed with the Commonwealth Court contesting the recommitment order. <em>Bronson v. Brd. of Probation and Parole, </em>38 Pa.Cmwlth. 294, <a href="/citations/?q=392%20A.2d%20916" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="392 A.2d 916">392 A.2d 916</a> (1978).

Appellant was not represented in this proceeding. On December 29, 1978, appellant again applied to the Commonwealth Court for relief and this request was also denied. In this action, appellant also proceeded without the benefit of counsel. An appeal from the second denial of relief by the Commonwealth Court has been made to this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Because of the confusing state of the record and appellant’s request for the appointment of counsel to assist him, we remanded the question of appellant’s entitlement to court appointed counsel to the Commonwealth Court for their consideration.

    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[284,409,1143,370]]]'>The Commonwealth Court'treated Bronson’s “Petition for Review” as a civil action in the nature of a complaint in mandamus brought within the court’s original jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. 761. Thus to determine the soundness of the Commonwealth Court’s result, it is appropriate to begin with examining the initial premise that appellant’s complaint was an action in the nature of mandamus.</p>

      <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>In <em>Williams v. Board of Probation &amp; Parole, </em>2 Pa. Cmwlth. 312 (1971), a recommitted parole violator brought a mandamus action against the Pa. Bd. of Probation and Parole. The plaintiff alleged that the Board erred as a matter of law in denying him “street time” served on parole. Before overruling the Board’s preliminary objection to the complaint, the then recently formed Commonwealth Court found it necessary to explain its jurisdiction over the matter. The Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, § 401, 17 P.S. § 211.401,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> gave the Commonwealth Court original jurisdiction over all civil actions or proceeding against the Commonwealth. Since the plaintiff alleged an error in applying the law and requested a mandamus against a state agency, the court reasoned that the complaint was within its original jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b603-4" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[203,1094,1143,1065]]]'>Here, without analyzing the substance of appellant’s petitions for review, the Commonwealth Court summarily assumed that they were complaints in the nature of mandamus within the court’s original jurisdiction. In his uncounseled petitions, appellant prays for relief from the illegal and unlawful detention “in violation of his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.” The substance of appellant’s complaints concern the negligence of his parole agent and the unconstitutionality of the procedure by which he was recommitted. In neither of the petitions for review does the appellant request a mandamus. Moreover, the thrust of appellant’s complaints do not involve the essential allegation for mandamus-that there was a mistake in applying the law or there was a failure of the Board to act. Rather, appellant’s complaints appear to be a direct attack on the constitutionality of the entire parole revocation process. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra. </em>Therefore, the Commonwealth Court erred in treating appellant’s petitions for review as mandamus actions. Instead, we believe that Bronson was seeking a review of the revocation of his parole.</p>

Because Bronson was entitled to the assistance of counsel during his parole revocation hearing, he is also entitled to the assistance of counsel during his direct appeal as of right to the Commonwealth Court. “We are helped not at all in determining appellant’s constitutional rights by attaching artificial labels to describe the proceeding before us.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Whether a parole violation proceeding is properly classified as criminal, quasi-criminal or civil, we have recognized it to be a proceeding of the nature where the right to counsel is required to comport with our fundamental concepts of fairness.

The failure of a defendant to take an appeal “within the time allowed by law will preclude the assertion of such right <em>unless </em>the failure to do so resulted from an unconstitutional deprivation of the assistance of counsel.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
