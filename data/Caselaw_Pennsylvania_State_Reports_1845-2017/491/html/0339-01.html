That such a use is consistent with an intent to benefit only some or even none of the Smith grandchildren is obvious. Moreover, the Smiths have presented no convincing evidence that testatrix’s use of the phrase was inadvertent; rather, as will appear, there is every reason to believe that testatrix meant exactly what she said.

Here, testatrix’s intent cannot be determined with reasonable certainty from the language of the will alone. On the one hand, as the Browns and Fraziers contend, Paragraph 27 could be read in conjunction with the preceding paragraph, in which testatrix vests the entire income interest in the trust in the Brown and Frazier families and nowhere mentions her daughter by her second marriage. From such a reading it might be concluded that <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>when testatrix used the words “my youngest grandchild” and “such of my grandchildren” in Paragraph 27, she had in mind only the grandchildren of whom she had previously been speaking. The Smith grandchildren, on the other hand, argue with equal force that the contrast between the specificity of Paragraph 26 and the generality of Paragraph 27 demonstrates that in the latter paragraph testatrix was no longer thinking of only the grandchildren of her first marriage but of all of her grandchildren by both marriages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Whether or not testatrix was aware of the full extent of her husband Samuel Houston’s wealth, she was clearly aware that it was very substantial, that it greatly exceeded her own, and that her younger daughter, Eleanor Houston Smith, would be very well provided for. Also, ten months after she executed her will, testatrix and her husband created a life insurance trust in favor of only the Brown and Frazier grandchildren. Both her indisputable awareness of the Houston fortune and her creation of the insurance trust support the conclusion that testatrix felt a greater financial concern for the grandchildren of her first marriage than for the grandchildren of her marriage to Samuel F. Houston and thus intended to include only the Browns and Fraziers among the distributees of her residuary trust principal.</p>

Brown. At the time she executed her will, testatrix was sixty-six years old. Her daughter Eleanor Houston Smith was twenty-four years old and had had her first child only three months earlier. On the other hand, testatrix’s elder daughter Charlotte was then thirty-eight years old. Her youngest child was nearly six, and her two older children were twelve and ten. Testatrix’s son Charles was forty-one years old, and his sons were eight and six. From the language of the will it is clear that testatrix contemplated future grandchildren in the Houston-Smith line. In Paragraph 12 she directs her daughter Charlotte to try to find some piece of jewelry for “each girl among my and my husband’s granddaughters, more especial<a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>ly my namesakes.” Because testatrix had at the time only one such namesake, Charlotte Josephine Frazier, she must have believed that Eleanor Houston Smith would bear additional children.</p>

Yet all parties agree that the <em>deliberate </em>exclusion by testatrix of grandchildren born after her death into any line would be strikingly contrary to her manifest generosity. If testatrix foresaw the possibility of any of her children having children after her death, the clear meaning of the above direction requires the inference that she intended to exclude the afterborns in that line. Such an inference is inescapable in the case of Eleanor Houston Smith and her infant son, for testatrix could not have reasonably discounted the possibility that her twenty-four year old daughter might continue to bear children for many years. On the other hand, testatrix could well have reasonably believed that her thirty-eight year old daughter and the wife of her forty-one year old son were past their childbearing years. Intending to benefit only their lines, testatrix would then have had no occasion to consider the exclusion of afterborn grandchildren. Her only concern would have been to provide for distribution in the event of a <em>decrease </em>in the number of Brown and Frazier grandchildren before her death, a possibility to which the above direction is directly addressed.</p>

They note that in both the will and the insurance trust testatrix refers to the two sons of Charles Brown by name, whereas she refers to the three children of Charlotte Frazier as children. Thus, they contend, testatrix must have believed that the class of Frazier grandchildren might increase. This argument, however, depends upon the assumption that testatrix did not expect further grandchildren in the Brown line, yet the Smiths concede that it was <em>“theoretically” </em>possible for the Browns to have more children.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> When one recalls that Charles Brown, Sr., was forty-one years old and his sons eight and six when the will was executed (the record does not disclose the age of Mrs. Brown), the “theory” becomes no less likely than the theory that testatrix expected Charlotte Frazier to continue to bear children. It is more reasonable to assume that, in light of their ages, testatrix expected neither Charles nor Charlotte to produce children after her death (an expectation which proved to be correct) and that she referred to the Fraziers as “children” rather than by name because of their greater number and difference in sexes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

See, e. g., <em>Kelsey Estate, </em><a href="/pa/393/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="393 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="1279600" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0513-01">393 Pa. 513</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20A.2d%2042" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="143 A.2d 42">143 A.2d 42</a> (1958). The only grammatically and logically reasonable interpretations of this ambiguity are that testatrix meant either the youngest of <em>all </em>of her grandchildren or the youngest of the Brown and Frazier grandchildren. She could not have meant the former, however, for then the satisfaction of the condition by an afterborn grandchild-who could not take-might well have triggered the distribution. On the other hand, if, as we have seen, testatrix meant to benefit only the Browns and Fraziers, she would logically make the distribution dependent upon the attainment of age twenty-one by the youngest grandchild who could take.</p>

We also note that in Paragraph 26 testatrix made specific provision for the education and support of Charles, Jr., and Joseph Williams Brown from the income portion of her residuary trust; she made no such specific provision for the Frazier children, preferring to bequeath or devise property to each of them elsewhere in the will. Thus, she may have felt less need to refer to the Frazier children by name in that paragraph.</p>
