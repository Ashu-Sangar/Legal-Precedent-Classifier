Certainly the erratic behavior of the economy over the past half dozen years, plagued by war and other unusual circumstances, is not a sufficient demonstration that inflation at any predictable rate will continue for another twenty years. Furthermore, even if inflation is a part of the pattern of the future, one certain consequence is that interest rates on money will reflect that fact. Consequently, a sum representing the present worth of future earnings will earn more in dollars in an inflationary period than would otherwise be the case. This may not wholly compensate for the effect of inflation over the next twenty years. We view the “productivity factor” as simply a substitute for inflation and equally speculative and inadmissible in a calculation of future earnings.</blockquote>

The current earning amount is multiplied by the number of years remaining in the victim’s worklife span. The total figure is then reduced to its alleged present value.

Research reveals that the discounting theory is grounded in economic history of the latter part of the nineteenth century. “Between 1867 and 1896, for example, it is estimated that the price level dropped by about forty percent. At the turn of the century, one needed only approximately sixty percent of the dollars required at the end of the Civil War to purchase the same basket of goods.” 20 S.D.L.Rev. at 309. When future prices are expected to decline or remain constant, there is no economic disagreement with the discounting theory.

Instead, the judge simply assumed a stable rate of inflation, a condition historically associated with a real yield of two percent, and arbitrarily lowered the real rate of interest to one -and a half percent to allow for unforeseeable fluctuations.

For example, special findings of fact may be helpful in making certain that neither the tortfeasor not the injured is unduly prejudiced or benefited by future economic conditions. Also, at least thirteen states, including California, Delaware, Florida, and Maryland, have enacted laws allowing for some form of periodic payments in medical malpractice actions. See T. Elligett, “The Periodic Payment of Judgments,” 46 Ins. Counsel J. 130, 134 n.49 (1979). Very recently the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted an approved draft of a “Uniform Periodic Payment of Judgments Act” which authorizes installment payment of awards in personal injury cases. See generally Roger C. Henderson, “Periodic Payments of Bodily Injury Awards,” <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.B.A.%20J.%20734" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="66 A.B.A. J. 734">66 A.B.A.J. 734</a> (1980).

True, such an approach is a simple one, but it does not achieve justice, and, has only been adopted in one jurisdiction, i.e., Alaska. We should simply permit expert testimony on the issues of inflation <em>and </em>productivity. Such testimony, on both sides of the issue, is, of course, subject to cross-examination and argument as to its validity and weight. Thus, the jury is free to weigh the evidence before it and render its verdict. This is also simple, and provides justice in accordance with our time honored principles.</p>
