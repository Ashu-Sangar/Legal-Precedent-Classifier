As we have already noted, on direct examination, Bowen testified to this scenario and to having already been convicted of the murders. In this context, it would be a legitimate trial strategy for defense counsel to allow the Commonwealth to emphasize Bowen’s capacity for violence and depict him as a killer. The transcript of defense counsel’s closing argument indicates that such a strategy was, indeed, relied on. Obviously, the Commonwealth’s showing that Bowen had previously been convicted of assault with intent to kill and the murder of a police officer and had also been arrested for shooting an elderly couple would further that strategy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Although the questions Burton complains of were objectionable, in light of defense counsel’s having brought out Bowen’s conviction, for the instant murders and his attempt to depict Bowen as a “killer”, about which acts Burton does not complain, we cannot conclude timely objection to those questions offered a substantially greater potential for success than the course actually followed.</p>

In support of this assertion, Burton points to an exchange between the presiding judge and his trial counsel during which the judge stated that he detected a strong odor of alcohol on Burton’s counsel’s breath and asked him if he had been drinking; counsel replied he had consumed intoxicants every morning for the last forty years; the judge then requested that counsel sufficiently limit his drinking during the trial so that the court would not be offended by his breath.</p>

After the exchange concerning counsel’s drinking, counsel was ordered to proceed; the question was placed on the record; and, trial resumed. The trial judge’s remarks do not indicate he believed Burton’s counsel was inebriated and/or incapable of effectively representing Burton. In fact, his allowing the trial to resume points to an opposite conclusion. Further, no similar incident occurred either prior or subsequent to the exchange, and the record does not show any noticeable difference between counsel’s conduct at the time of the exchange and his conduct throughout the rest of the trial. Lastly, other than implying that his counsel’s drinking resulted in counsel’s failure to object to the questioning of defense witness Bowen about his prior arrests and convictions, an allegation of ineffectiveness we have already disposed of, Burton does not assert any instance in which counsel’s drinking resulted in ineffective assistance.</p>
