Indeed, appellant so argued before trial when he raised the statute of limitations defense and objected to the Commonwealth’s efforts to amend the first complaint naming the wrong party. Now, however, appellant argues that the first complaint, although not sufficient to toll the statute of limitations, was sufficient to commence the running of Rule 1100. This analysis comports with neither logic nor public policy and flies in the face of the plain language of Rule 1100.

The inability of courts to provide a prompt trial has contributed to a large backlog of cases in urban courts which, among other things, enables defendants to negotiate more effectively for pleas of guilty to lesser offenses and otherwise manipulate the system. In addition, persons released on bond for lengthy periods awaiting trial have an opportunity to commit other crimes. It must be of little comfort to the residents of Christian County, Kentucky, to know that Barker was at large on bail for over four years while accused of a vicious and brutal murder of which he was ultimately convicted. Moreover, the longer an accused is free awaiting trial, the more tempting becomes his opportunity to jump bail and escape.

But that position should be reserved to circumstances where the complaint is so defective that it is totally void and is not applied to the accused who later advances a speedy trial claim. Otherwise, absurd results will occur as in this case. Because the majority fails to recognize that the first complaint was applied to Gary Douglas Brocklehurst and fails to give weight to that fact, it concludes a person arrested on July 30 pursuant to a complaint filed on June 22 is not entitled to have the mandatory period in which to commence trial computed from either of those dates, but must have it computed from August 9, when an amended complaint is' filed.

Society seeks speedy justice because, when delayed, justice can be lost through the loss of witnesses from death and faded memories and it can be rendered ineffective because of delayed punishment and rehabilitation. These considerations, as well as others, have from the very beginning of the common law been collectively summarized as the efficient administration of justice.</p>
      <p id="b207-7" data-blocks='[["BL_207.7",207,[244,1537,1110,269]]]'>When Rule 1100 was proposed before this Court, I, for one, voiced grave doubts about its ability to serve society’s interests by advancing the efficient administration of justice. Nevertheless, because there existed a need to involve our courts more actively in calendar control and, thus, in advancing the efficient administration of justice and because prosecution was often too long delayed, I joined in adopting the rule.</p>
      <p id="b207-8" data-blocks='[["BL_207.8",207,[242,1811,1111,302]]]'>Whatever the problems of construction which may have arisen in interpreting the rule since its adoption, my doubts and those of many others, particularly trial judges, have been resolved favorably. Rule 1100 has served society, the courts, and accused persons well. The efficient administration of justice has been advanced; courts are serving society better; and, guilt and innocence is being more quickly determined. While discharges have occurred, the harm is far less than the benefits which have accrued.</p>

The majority’s position that, absent an attempt by the Commonwealth to circumvent the rule, the period should be computed from the second complaint because of the literal language the rule fails to recognize that the rule does not specifically address itself to resolution of this type of problem and, hence, is literally of no assistance in resolving it.</p>

As I previously suggested supra, very limited circumstances may arise where the first period should not be included as where the first complaint is so defective in terms of its application to the accused that it actually names a different person <em>and </em>is applied to no one or some one other than the accused. My suggested ruling that the periods should be tacked does not extend to such circumstances because, in effect, the first complaint would not under such circumstances have ever brought to bear on the accused the considerations a speedy trial rule should limit.</p>
