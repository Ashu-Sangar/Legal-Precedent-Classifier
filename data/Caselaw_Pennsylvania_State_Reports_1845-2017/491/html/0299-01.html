The Secretary of the Commonwealth, through the Bureau of Elections, refused to accept Mr. Haqq’s proffered withdrawal, ruling that it was untimely filed. See Act of June, 1937, P.L. 1333, Article IX, as amended, 25 P.S. § 2938. Mr. Haqq appealed this Administrative Ruling to the Commonwealth Court arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the “late filing” was as a result of misinformation <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>supplied to his representatives by employees of the Bureau of Elections, and that he relied on these misrepresentations to his detriment.</p>

In the <em>Welsh Appeal </em>nomination' papers by a candidate for the office of State Senator had been refused by the Office of the Board of Elections because of late filing. A unanimous court held that where it appeared that the candidate had been informed by personnel of that office that the date for filing had been extended, it would be unfair to set aside the nomination papers as untimely filed.</p>
