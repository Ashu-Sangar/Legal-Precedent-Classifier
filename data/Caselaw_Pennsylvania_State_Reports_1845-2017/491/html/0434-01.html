The record shows that on October 7, 1975, at approximately 5:00 p. m., a black male, wearing a dark jacket and a knit cap, his face partially covered with a pink and white towel, ran into Smith’s Grocery Store in Fayetteville, Pennsylvania. He first requested toothache medicine from the owner, Mrs. Edna Smith, and then forced her to place the sixty-five dollars in her cash register, in denominations of one and five dollar bills, on the store counter. Mr. Marion Cubeta then entered the store and the robber drew a gun and ordered him to “freeze.” After ripping out a candy case in an unsuccessful attempt to find more money, the robber patted Cubeta down, turned out his pockets, and ordered him to put all his money-some fifty cents-on the counter.

While the affidavit states the victims’ description of the perpetrator’s physical characteristics and clothing, there is no similarly detailed description given by the bystanders. Indeed, the only detailed description which the bystanders give is of an orange car with Florida license plates which they saw occupied by a “colored male” in the area of the crime at about the time the crime was committed. The description of the car and its presence in the neighborhood, however, are irrelevant to a finding of probable cause because nothing in the affidavit shows the car to be connected with the crime.</p>

As to the first bystander, however, the affiant merely states that this witness saw a “colored male approximate description as above,” referring to the description given by the victims. The phrase “approximate description as above” is fatal to the warrant. It tells the magistrate only the police officer’s conclusion that the witness’ description was similar to that of the victims. It does not tell the magistrate the witness’ <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>actual description, facts which would allow a “neutral and detached” magistrate to form his own independent judgment. <em>Johnson v.

Of course, as indicated above, this might be a different case if the victims had mentioned the car in their report of the robbery, as they did not here, thereby providing a connection between the car, its occupants, and the crime.</p>
