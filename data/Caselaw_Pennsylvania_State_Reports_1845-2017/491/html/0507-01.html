The day before the shooting, appellant was told by his cousin, Estelle Wilson, a barmaid at the Jubilee Bar, that her former boyfriend, the victim, had been beating and threatening to kill her. On December 24, at approximately 7:50 a. m., appellant went to the Jubilee Bar to await the victim’s arrival. Johnson arrived between 9:00-9:30 a. m., went behind the bar and started by beat up Estelle Wilson. Appellant, noticing that Johnson had his hand in his pocket, pulled him away from Wilson. Johnson spun around and produced a gun. Appellant and Johnson struggled over the gun and it fell to the floor. Appellant seized the gun and shot the victim in a further struggle for possession of the weapon. Appellant was arrested later that day and charged with murder, possessing instruments of crime and prohibited offensive weapons.</p>
