Three days into the trial, the court, upon motion by appellant, declared a mistrial. On September 11, 1979, appellant filed an Application to Dismiss Indictments on the grounds that a new trial would violate his right not to be twice placed in jeopardy. The trial court denied the application and this direct appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

However, I do not accept the suggestion of the majority that the complaint is “without merit.” The news article in question placed before the jury evidence of prior criminal activity attributed to appellant, which could not have been properly introduced at the trial of this case and should not have influenced the verdict to be reached in this case. Mr. Donaldson, a respected member of the media, testified under oath that he had spoken to the trial assistant who tried this case and that the trial assistant verified the facts set forth in the article. The trial assistant categorically denied this and offered the possibility that Mr. Donaldson may have overheard a conversation between himself (the trial assistant) and someone involved in the case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> If Mr. Donaldson’s version of the events is correct, there has been a serious violation of our rules. <em>See generally Commonwealth v.

The record reveals prosecutorial overreaching which, although not shown to have been motivated by desire to prejudice appellant or to provoke a mistrial, at the very least deserves strong condemnation by this Court.</p>
    <p id="b660-6" data-blocks='[["BL_660.7",660,[274,855,1141,469]]]'>On the second day of appellant’s trial an article appeared in the Pittsburgh Press concerning the events of the trial and detailing appellant’s prior criminal activity. The article attributed its source to the assistant district attorney who was prosecuting the case. After the defense brought the article to the court’s attention, the court questioned the jury and discovered that each of the jurors had read the article. Consequently, appellant filed a motion for a mistrial, which was granted.</p>
    <p id="b660-7" data-blocks='[["BL_660.8",660,[271,1350,1142,409]]]'>At a subsequent hearing on appellant’s motion to dismiss indictments, both the assistant district attorney and the newspaper reporter testified. The assistant district attorney denied ever having had a discussion with the reporter and also denied knowing him by name or sight. He conceded, however, that “I might well have been discussing the case in a position where it could have been heard. I can’t deny that for a minute.”</p>
    <p id="b660-8" data-blocks='[["BL_660.9",660,[270,1793,1140,203]]]'>The reporter testified otherwise. He said that he had approached the prosecutor to verify information concerning appellant’s criminal activities. The hearing transcript reads in pertinent part:</p>

    <p id="b661-15" data-blocks='[["BL_661.15",661,[213,1727,1146,585]]]'>Public disclosure by a prosecutor of information prejudicial to a defendant in the midst of trial is conduct which must be closely circumscribed by the courts. <em>See generally Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/451/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="451 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1948588" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0190-01">451 Pa. 190</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=303%20A.2d%20209" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="303 A.2d 209">303 A.2d 209</a> (1973). While the prosecutor in this case did not evidence an intent to prejudice the defendant or to provoke a mistrial, his actions did in fact result in a mistrial, which deprived the defendant of a trial by the jury originally sworn to decide his case. This Court should not summarily dismiss as merit-less a claim based on such misconduct. Rather, it should express its strong disapproval of the prosecutor’s actions.</p>
