To argue that appellant was simply seeking enforcement and that the Borough raised the interpretation question as a defense for its non-compliance, assumes the very question that is at issue, i.e. what is the proper interpretation of the award. Before the common pleas court could order enforcement as requested by the complainants, the court was called upon to first determine the rights and duties created by the award. A prerequisite to this mandamus action is a resolution of whether or not the terms of paragraph one of the 1976 award had been incorporated into “the basic wages” to be paid during 1977. Although the 1976 collective bargaining agreement expressly states that the cost of living increase “shall become part of the basic wages as of January 1, 1977,” the 1977 interest arbitration award omits reference to the inclusion of this increment in the permanent wage base for computation of 1977 wages. Thus, the proper analysis of the issue which <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>confronted the common pleas court was an interpretation of the interest arbitration award, and not the enforceability of the award.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
