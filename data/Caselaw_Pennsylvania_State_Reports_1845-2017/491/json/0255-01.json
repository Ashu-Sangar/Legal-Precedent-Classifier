        "text": "OPINION\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nOn March 12, 1979, the Honorable John M. Wajert, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, acting pursuant to Sections 7(9)(i) and (ii) of the State Ethics Act, requested an opinion from the State Ethics Commission. The issue presented to the Commission was:\n\u201cMay a Judge of a Court of Common Pleas, upon retirement or resignation, represent a client before that Court within the first year after such resignation.\u201d\nOn May 11, 1979, the Commission responded to the request as follows:\n\u201cIt is the Commission\u2019s Opinion that a Common Pleas Judge is barred by Section 3(e) of the Act from representing any person before the Court with which he was associated for a period of one year following resignation or retirement.\u201d Wajert, Opinion 1978-5.\nOn May 29, 1979, Judge Wajert filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment in Commonwealth Court seeking, inter alia, a declaration the Act, 65 P.S. \u00a7 401 et seq., in its application to judges and justices of the courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was unconstitutional and of no force and effect. On October 30, 1979, the Commonwealth Court, 407 A.2d 125, dismissed preliminary objections to the petition filed by the Ethics Commission. On November 27, 1979, the Commission consented to the entry of a final judgment in favor of the petitioner but specifically reserved its right to appeal from the judgment. On November 28, the Commonwealth Court entered a final judgment ruling Section 3(e) of the State Ethics Act, 65 P.S. \u00a7 403 (e), to be of no force and effect to judges of the Courts of Common Pleas in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Commission then filed this appeal.\nSection 3(e) of the Ethics Act, 65 P.S. \u00a7 403(e), provides: \u201cNo former official or public employee shall represent a person, with or without compensation, on any matter before the governmental body with which he has been associated for one year after he leaves that body.\u201d\nSection 2 of the Act, 65 P.S. \u00a7 402, defines the term \u201cpublic official\u201d to include any elected or appointed official in the judicial branch of the State or any political subdivision thereof and the term \u201cgovernmental body\u201d as:\n\u201cAny department, authority, commission, committee, council, board, bureau, division, service, office, officer, administration, legislative body, or other establishment in the Executive, Legislative or Judicial Branch of the State or a political subdivision thereof.\u201d\nIn its opinion filed in support of the judgment, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that a judge who retired or resigned from his judicial office was clearly a \u201cpublic official\u201d; that the proscription of 65 P.S. \u00a7 403(e) would apply to such an individual if a court of law was a \u201cgovernmental body\u201d; but, that a court of law was not within the definitional purview of \u201cgovernmental body.\u201d The court explained that a court of law was not explicitly included within the definition of \u201cgovernmental body\u201d; that, since such a court was not explicitly included, the legislature could have intended it to be within the definitional purview of the term only if it was an \u201cestablishment in the . . . Judicial Branch of the State\u201d; that whether a court was intended to be such an \u201cestablishment\u201d was unclear because no similar nomenclature so referring to a court could be found; that, given this uncertainty, the legislative intent had to be determined by considering, inter alia, see 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(c), the purpose of the statute and the presumption that the legislature did not intend to violate the constitution, see 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1922(3); that the primary purpose of the statute was to expose and prevent real and potential conflicts of interests; that, given the fact that the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Code of Professional Responsibility address themselves to \u201cthe same mischief\u201d, the statute was not intended to proscribe the activities of judges and former judges of the Courts of Common Pleas; and, that a contrary construction of the statute would render it unconstitutional because it would result in the statute being a \u201cdirect restriction upon the practice of law\u201d and, hence, an improper usurpation of the exclusive power of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to regulate the practice of law.\nWhile we consider the Commonwealth Court\u2019s effort to interpret this statute in such a way as to avoid declaring it unconstitutional when applied to a former judge laudable in light of the presumption that the legislature does not intend to violate the constitution, we are constrained to disagree with that court\u2019s interpretation of the statute. We are persuaded the statute was intended to apply to former judges, but, when so interpreted, it is unconstitutional.\nThe mere fact that a court of law has not previously been referred to as an \u201cestablishment in the .. . Judicial Branch of the State\u201d does not render the term \u201cestablishment\u201d unclear or ambiguous so that resort to the factors of 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(c) is required. Otherwise, every time the legislature utilized a new term, it would have to be considered unclear and ambiguous. The words of the English language are not unclear and ambiguous simply because the legislature has not previously used them; rather, in such circumstances, the word or term must first be examined according to its common and approved usage. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1903(a); Commonwealth v. Hill, 481 Pa. 37, 391 A.2d 1303 (1978).\nThe term \u201cestablishment\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d 1959) as a place of business or as that which is established, i.e. secured in permanent existence. Undoubtedly, the courts are secured in permanent existence and are places of business, /. e. public business. Moreover, if a court of law is not an \u201cestablishment ... in the Judicial Branch,\u201d one would be hard pressed to determine what the legislature was attempting to include.\nFinally, that the Legislature intended to include a court of law as a \u201cgovernmental body\u201d is made abundantly clear when 65 P.S. \u00a7 406 is examined. That section establishes the State Ethics Commission and its membership. Then in (d) it provides:\n\u201cNo individual, while a member or employee of the commission, shall:\n(4) directly or indirectly attempt to influence any decision by a governmental body, other than a court of law [Emphasis added.]\nObviously, specifically exempting a court of law from the term \u201cgovernmental body\u201d in this section would be absurd if it is not otherwise included within the term. Of course, we cannot interpret legislative pronouncements in an absurd manner. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1922(1).\nThus, we must conclude a court of law is a \u201cgovernmental body\u201d. Moreover, since we agree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s interpretation that the term former \u201cpublic official\u201d includes a judge who has retired or resigned, in our view, 65 P.S. \u00a7 403(e) clearly applies to judges of the Courts of Common Pleas who have resigned or retired.\nHaving determined the statute is applicable, we are constrained to hold it unconstitutional insofar as it is applicable to a former judge. In essence, we agree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s reasoning that application of this statute to a former judge constitutes an infringement on the Supreme Court\u2019s inherent and exclusive power to govern the conduct of those privileged to practice law in this Commonwealth. Long before the Ethics Act was enacted, this Court adopted the Code of Professional Responsibility enunciating the standards governing the professional conduct of those engaged in the practice of law in this Commonwealth. In the rules enforcing that Code, this Court had made it abundantly clear that supervising the conduct of an attorney, including that of a former judge, before the courts of this Commonwealth was a matter exclusively for this Court. Pa.R.D.E. 103 states:\n\u201cThe Supreme Court declares that it has inherent and exclusive power to supervise the conduct of attorneys who are its officers (which power is reasserted in Section 10(c) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania) and in furtherance thereof promulgates these rules which shall supersede all other court rules and statutes pertaining to disciplinary enforcement heretofore promulgated.\u201d [Emphasis added.]\nThere can be no doubt that the statute has infringed on this Court\u2019s exclusive power to govern the conduct of an attorney, and is, hence, unconstitutional. Moreover, that power has been specifically exercised to deal with the mischief the statute attempts to address. DR 9-101(A) of the Code of Professional Responsibility prohibits a lawyer from accepting private employment in a matter upon the merits of which he acted in a judicial capacity. See also DR 9-101(B) and (C).\nOrder affirmed.\n. Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 883, No. 170, \u00a7 1 et seq., 65 P.S. \u00a7 401 et seq. (Supp. 1980-81) [hereinafter: 65 P.S. \u00a7-].\n. Acting pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1503, the Commonwealth Court directed that the Petition for Declaratory Judgment be regarded and acted upon as a petition for review addressed to that court\u2019s original jurisdiction. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 761(a).\n. Even were we to conclude a court of law is not an \u201cestablishment,\u201d we would be hard pressed to explain why it is not an \u201coffice\u201d within the definition of \u201cgovernmental body.\u201d\n. Indeed, petitioner-appellee concedes this point and the Commission so argues.\n. We are not unmindful that the reasons set forth infra for our ruling strongly suggest the statute is also unconstitutional in application to attorneys who seek to practice in Pennsylvania\u2019s courts. We need not now so rule and explicitly refrain from doing so, but feel compelled to point out our conscious consideration of the possible breadth of our ruling. Such consideration is essential, since, given our interpretation of the statute and its application to courts of law and its possible application to law clerks, see 65 P.S. \u00a7 402, the courts of this Commonwealth might be effectively precluded from employing law school graduates as law clerks because persons would fear such employment would prohibit them from practicing before the court by which they were employed for one year after the termination of their employment.\n. Our determination is made in accordance with the well-established rule that a statute must be shown to clearly, palpably, and plainly violate the constitution.. Commonwealth v.
