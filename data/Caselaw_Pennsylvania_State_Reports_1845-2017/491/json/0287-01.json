As the Commonwealth Court correctly held, there is no basis in our case law or the Election Code for judicial inquiry into the relative independence of a candidate. This case is precisely the same as In re Morris, 491 Pa. 284, 420 A.2d 1044 (1980). Both are governed by Salera v. Tucker, 399 F.Supp. 1258 (E.D.Pa.1975), aff\u2019d, 424 U.S. 959, 96 S.Ct. 1451, 47 L.Ed.2d 727 (1976), and by our decision in Packrall v. Quail, 411 Pa. 555,192 A.2d 704 (1963). See also Ross Nomination Petition, 411 Pa. 45, 48, 190 A.2d 719, 720 (1963) (\u201cThe Election Code must be liberally construed so as not to deprive an individual of his right to run for office, or the voters of their right to elect a candidate of their choice\u201d).",
