        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI adhere to the view, joined by former Chief Justice Eagen, which I expressed in Mattos v. Thompson, 491 Pa. 385, 421 A.2d 190 (1980) (dissenting opinion), that our Legislature\u2019s Health Care Services Malpractice Act should not be declared unconstitutional. It is indeed curious that in Mattos, after judicially interring the Legislature\u2019s carefully amended arbitration plan and ignoring the Legislature\u2019s judgment that the recent amendments to the Act will more promptly resolve malpractice disputes, the majority then proceeds to extol the virtues of arbitration.\nIt is the stated legislative purpose of this Act to establish a system where one injured by providers of health care services \u201ccan obtain a prompt determination and adjudication of his claim. . . . \u201d Act of October 15, 1975, P.L. 390, \u00a7 102, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1301.102 (Supp.1980). Consistent with this purpose, the recent December 1979 legislative amendments and the more recent February 1980 administrative regulations mandate that malpractice plaintiffs will have their cases heard within fifteen months. The Legislature\u2019s goal of a prompt determination of malpractice disputes thus would have been accomplished if not for the majority\u2019s hasty and ill-considered declaration of unconstitutionality.\nThe cases remanded today are only the beginning of an avalanche of cases which will be descending upon our trial courts and adding to their already heavy caseloads. Surely it must be clear that these disputes would be more promptly resolved through the amended arbitration procedures.\nNot only malpractice litigants but all other litigants in our trial courts will be required unnecessarily to wait still longer for the resolution of their disputes. Regrettably, with the untimely demise of the Legislature\u2019s amended arbitration plan, there will be not less, but more delay.",
