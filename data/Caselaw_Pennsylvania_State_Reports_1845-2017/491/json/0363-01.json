        "text": "OPINION\nKAUFFMAN, Justice.\nKevin Davis, also known as Kevin Cargo, appeals from the judgments of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County following his conviction for murder of the first degree and possession of an instrument of crime. The relevant facts are as follows:\nOn June 7, 1975, the victim, Frank Johnson (\u201cJohnson\u201d), attended a party given by friends at 2412 Hulseman Terrace in Philadelphia. During the evening, an argument broke out between members of rival gangs, and two unidentified individuals forcibly removed Johnson from the premises. While he was standing in front of the house surrounded by a crowd of people, appellant approached Johnson and fatally wounded him with two shots from a .22 caliber derringer pistol.\nFollowing his arrest on September 9, 1977, for murder and other crimes unrelated to this appeal, appellant confessed in writing to shooting Johnson. On December 16, 1977, appellant\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress the signed confession on the ground that it was involuntary was denied, and on February 28, 1978, he was convicted of first degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime by the court sitting without a jury. On May 4, 1978, the trial court granted appellant\u2019s petition to file post-verdict motions nunc pro tunc, and on June 13, 1978, Appellant\u2019s motions were denied and he was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment on the conviction for first-degree murder and to a consecutive term of two and one-half to five years imprisonment for possession of an instrument of crime. Appeal was taken directly to this Court from the judgment of sentence imposed for the murder conviction and to the Superior Court from the judgment of sentence imposed for the weapons violation. The latter appeal has been certified to this Court. We affirm.\nI\nAppellant first argues that his arrest warrant was invalid because the information upon which it was issued was insufficient, unreliable and unworthy of trust. We disagree. The arrest warrant was issued on the basis of information received from three eyewitnesses. Two specifically identified appellant as the individual who shot Johnson and the third identified him as one of the four individuals she observed fleeing from the scene immediately after the shooting. We repeatedly have confirmed the reliability and trustworthiness of eyewitnesses testimony. See Commonwealth v. Musi, 486 Pa. 102, 113, 404 A.2d 378, 383 (1979), (eyewitness to shooting reliable); Commonwealth v. Irving, 485 Pa. 596, 601, 403 A.2d 549, 551 (1979), (\u201cthere is a basis for crediting the information of an eyewitness\u201d); Commonwealth v. Stokes, 480 Pa. 38, 44, 389 A.2d 74, 77 (1978) (\u201cinformation provided by an eyewitness whose identity is known has . . . been deemed sufficient\u201d). See also Commonwealth v. Carter, 444 Pa. 405, 409-10, 282 A.2d 375, 377 (1971) (testimony of two eyewitnesses sufficient to establish probable cause for arrest). Accordingly, there was sufficient information to support the issuance of the arrest warrant.\nII\nAppellant next argues that the confession introduced at trial was not his, but was that of the interrogator, and that his signature was obtained by physical and psychological coercion. In effect, appellant requests this Court to substitute its own factual findings for those of the suppression court, which we time and again have refused to do. See Commonwealth v. Martin, 481 Pa. 515, 520, 393 A.2d 23, 25 (1978).\nWhen ruling on suppression motions, the suppression court is required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether evidence was obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, Pa.R.Crim.P. 323(i), and must determine whether the Commonwealth has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the challenged evidence is admissible. Pa:R.Crim.P. 323(h). On review, this Court must \u201cdetermine whether the record supports the factual findings of the court below and the legitimacy of the inferences and legal conclusions drawn from those findings.\u201d Commonwealth v. Brown, 473 Pa. 562, 566, 375 A.2d 1260, 1262 (1977); Commonwealth v. Goodwin, 460 Pa. 516, 521, 333 A.2d 892, 895 (1975). In doing so, we will consider \u201conly the evidence of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and so much of the evidence for the defense as, fairly read in the context of the record as a whole, remains uncontradicted.\u201d Commonwealth v. Brown, supra, 473 Pa. at 566, 375 A.2d at 1262; Commonwealth v. Kichline, 468 Pa. 265, 280-81, 361 A.2d 282, 290 (1976). See Commonwealth v. Silo, 480 Pa. 15, 18, 389 A.2d 62, 63 (1978); Commonwealth v. Harris, 479 Pa. 131, 138, 387 A.2d 869, 873 (1978); Commonwealth v. Crosby, 464 Pa. 337, 342, 346 A.2d 768, 771 (1975). See also Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 604, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 1880, 61 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1961).\nThe conclusion of the suppression court that appellant\u2019s confession was his own and was made voluntarily is clearly supported by the record. The Commonwealth established that the confession was not the product of either physical or psychological coercion or promises of leniency made in exchange for appellant\u2019s cooperation. Although appellant testified as to the events surrounding the interrogation, the suppression court explicitly stated that it disbelieved appellant\u2019s testimony as to physical and psychological coercion. Thus, the lower court\u2019s conclusion was amply supported by the evidence.\nIll\nAppellant also argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the crimes with which he is charged. The test for the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case is whether the evidence admitted at trial is sufficient to prove every element of the crime or crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Harper, 485 Pa. 572, 403 A.2d 536 (1979); Commonwealth v. Tate, 485 Pa. 180, 401 A.2d 353 (1979); Commonwealth v. Liddick, 485 Pa. 121, 401 A.2d 323 (1979). In making this determination, the reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner, and accept as true all evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom upon which, if believed, the fact finder could properly have based its verdict. Commonwealth v. Helm, 485 Pa. 313, 402 A.2d 500 (1979); Commonwealth v. Tate, supra; Commonwealth v. Holmes, 482 Pa. 97, 393 A.2d 397 (1978).\nViewed in that light, the testimony at trial disclosed the following: On June 7, 1975, Johnson, while attending a party at 2412 Hulseman Terrace in Philadelphia, was forcibly removed from the house by unknown individuals. An eyewitness testified that a young man dressed in a gray-hooded sweatshirt stepped through the crowd surrounding Johnson, who apparently was unarmed, and, without saying a word, pulled out a small handgun and shot him twice in the chest and abdomen. The assailant was subsequently identified as appellant by a second eyewitness who observed appellant standing over Johnson\u2019s unconscious body. Appellant ran from the scene, but was apprehended as a fugitive almost two and one half years later. Following his arrest, appellant confessed to the murder. In his statement, appellant detailed the circumstances surrounding the shooting, which were in accordance with the accounts given by the eyewitnesses. Appellant\u2019s statement also established that he shot Johnson because of his belief, which later was proved to be mistaken, that Johnson previously had killed a friend of his.\nThis evidence clearly was sufficient. The testimony of two eyewitnesses established that appellant, without provocation, shot Johnson. Moreover, appellant\u2019s admission regarding his motive of revenge, as well as the manner in which Johnson was shot, established that appellant acted with the specific intent required to support a conviction for first degree murder. See Commonwealth v. Alston, 458 Pa. 412, 317 A.2d 229 (1974) (evidence that appellant fired a gun at the victim from a distance of approximately four feet and that the bullet struck the victim in the chest established specific intent to kill); Commonwealth v. Brieker, 458 Pa. 367, 326 A.2d 279 (1974) (specific intent to kill may be inferred from the fact that appellant fired two shots into the chest of the victim at a distance of two feet. See generally Commonwealth v. Ilgenfritz, 466 Pa. 345, 353 A.2d 387 (1976) (proof of specific intent to kill may be inferred from underlying circumstantial evidence). Similarly, appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of an instrument of crime was also supported by sufficient evidence, including positive eyewitness testimony and appellant\u2019s statement regarding his use of a handgun to shoot Johnson. See Commonwealth v. McNear, 238 Pa.Super. 177, 353 A.2d 39, aff\u2019d, 478 Pa. 19, 385 A.2d 975 (1975).\nIV\nFinally, appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his prior conviction. Although appellant concedes that this evidence was admitted into the record \u201cfor the sole purpose of impeaching credibility\u201d (Brief for Appellant at 15), he nevertheless argues that since a defendant\u2019s credibility is critical to the determination of guilt or innocence, it is error to admit this evidence prior to that determination, even for the limited purpose of impeaching credibility. Appellant thus advocates a per se rule that evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions is never admissible at trial, but may only be considered in determining the appropriate sentence following conviction.\nIt is well established that the Commonwealth may in rebuttal introduce evidence of prior convictions of crimes of dishonesty or false statement to impeach the credibility of a defendant who has elected to testify on his own behalf. Commonwealth v. Spruill, 480 Pa. 601, 391 A.2d 1048 (1978); Commonwealth v. Bighum, 452 Pa. 554, 307 A.2d 255 (1973).\nIn any event, appellant\u2019s allegation of prejudice is totally unsupported by the record. Appellant was tried and convicted by a judge sitting alone as factfinder, who expressly stated that he disregard appellant\u2019s prior criminal record. The evidence now objected to thus was not a factor in determining appellant\u2019s guilt. (Opinion of the trial court at 23-24) Accordingly, any error in its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 383 A.2d 155 (1978).\nThe judgment of sentence is affirmed.\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, 42 Pa.S.C.A. \u00a7 722(1) (Pamph.1979).\n. It is well established that credibility determinations are the sole province of the fact finder, Commonwealth v. Tate, 485 Pa. 180, 182, 401 A.2d 353, 354 (1979), and the fact finder is free to believe all, part of, or none of a defendant\u2019s testimony. Commonwealth v. Hinchcliffe, 479 Pa. 551, 388 A.2d 1068 (1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 989, 99 S.Ct. 588, 58 L.Ed.2d 663 (1978).\n. Appellant, in his pro se \u201cAmended Supplemental Brief,\u201d further argues that he was not fully advised of his constitutional rights at the time of the interrogation in violation of the requirements of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Credible record testimony clearly establishes that appellant received the appropriate Miranda warnings and that he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his rights to remain silent.\n. Appellant\u2019s consciousness of guilt, evidenced by his flight from the scene and his concealment of his whereabouts for over two years, supports the finding of guilt. See Commonwealth v. Whack, 482 Pa. 137, 141-42, 393 A.2d 417, 419-20 (1978); Commonwealth v. Tinsley, 465 Pa. 329, 333, 350 A.2d 791, 792-93 (1976); Commonwealth v. Osborne, 433 Pa. 297, 302-03, 249 A.2d 330, 333 (1969); Commonwealth v. Coyle, 415 Pa. 379, 393, 203 A.2d 782, 789 (1964).\n. Appellant does not argue that the Commonwealth failed to establish the admissibility of this evidence under the standards established by this Court in Commonwealth v. Roots, 482 Pa. 33, 393 A.2d 364 (1978) and Commonwealth v. Bighum, supra. Nor does appellant argue that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting this evidence under the standards set out therein.\n. A judge, as factfinder, is presumed to disregard inadmissible evidence and consider only competent evidence. Commonwealth v. Glover, 266 Pa.Super. 531, 534, 405 A.2d 945, 947 (1979) (Special Transfer Docket); McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 60 (2d ed. 1972). Cf. Commonwealth v. Batty, 482 Pa. 173, 178, 393 A.2d 435, 438 (1978) cert. denied 440 U.S. 974, 99 S.Ct. 1543, 59 L.Ed.2d 793 (1979) (court did not abuse its discretion by admitting inflammatory photographs \u201cbecause, although inadmissible in a jury setting, a judge, as the trier of fact, possesses the training, skill and experience to enable him to view such photographs [in the proper manner]\u201d). Commonwealth v. Green, 464 Pa. 557, 561, 347 A.2d 682, 683 (1975) (no prejudice when a confession, initially ruled admissible, is later found to be involuntary during a non-jury trial; the Court specifically rejected appellant\u2019s claim that \u201cthe mere exposure to prejudicial evidence is enough to nullify a judge\u2019s verdict in a case.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Glover, supra, 266 Pa.Super. at 534, 405 A.2d at 947, no prejudice where judge, as factfinder, hears inflammatory tape recording).\n. In his pro se \u201cAmended Supplemental Brief,\u201d appellant argues that he was denied his right to a preliminary hearing. The record, including the transcript of appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing, totally refutes this frivolous allegation.",
