        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nIn this labor dispute between Darby' Borough and its police employees, the Commonwealth Court held that a court of common pleas has no jurisdiction, in an action in mandamus, to order the municipality to perform its contractual duty arising out of a collective bargaining agreement. The Commonwealth Court concluded that the task of enforcing an arbitration award interpreting a collective bargaining agreement between parties covered under Act 111 is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (PLRB). We agree with the common pleas court, appellants Darby police and intervenor PLRB that such a reading of relevant labor statutes and case law authority is erroneous. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court, 38 Pa.Cmwlth. 337, 394 A.2d 1298 and remand to the court of common pleas for determination of appropriate relief on the merits of appellants\u2019 complaint.\nOn September 10, 1975 appellee, the Borough of Darby, and appellants, Darby police, entered into an agreement \u201cconcerning terms and conditions of employment of the police officers of the Borough of Darby for the calendar year commencing January 1,1976.\u201d Disagreeing as to the proper computation of wages for the year 1977, the parties entered into binding arbitration pursuant to \u201cAct 111,\u201d Act of June 24, 1968, P.L. 237, as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7 217 et seq. On December 20, 1976, the Board of Arbitration entered an arbitration award providing that:\n\u201cCommencing January 1, 1977, the annual wage for each police officer shall be increased by Three Hundred ($300.00) Dollars plus a cost of living adjustment for all police equal to the increased cost of living as measured by the C.P.I. for the Philadelphia Region for the twelve month period ending October, 1976, to be added to the base wage.\u201d\nOn February 11, 1977, appellant Geriot,. on behalf of a class of Darby police officers, filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County. The complaint alleged that appellee was not computing the base wage in accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, and requested the court to order appellee to pay appellants\u2019 wages in conformity with the agreement. Appellants\u2019 position was that although they received the cost of living increase for 1976, this increment was not included in the permanent base wage for computation of 1977 wages.\nAppellee filed a preliminary objection, contending that the complaint should be dismissed because \u201cthe Plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law other than an action in mandamus.\u201d Appellees claimed that appellants were seeking judicial, review of the arbitration award, and that such review is exclusively available pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 247. It was appellee\u2019s contention that since the 30-day period for filing an \u201capplication for review\u201d had lapsed, appellants were barred from relief.\nThe court of common pleas dismissed appellee\u2019s preliminary objection, holding that (1) appellants were not seeking judicial review of the arbitration award, and (2) that a contractual obligation imposed by law may be enforced against a municipality by an action in mandamus. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court dismissed the mandamus action on the ground that the court of common pleas was without jurisdiction. The Commonwealth Court held that appellants\u2019 exclusive remedy for breach of the collective bargaining agreement was the filing of an unfair labor practice grievance with the PLRB pursuant to the Public Employees Relations Act (PERA or \u201cAct 195\u201d), Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, \u00a7 1201(8), 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1201(8) (Supp. 1979). In so holding the court stated:\n\u201cPERA and Act 111 are to be read in pari materia. The exclusive jurisdiction to resolve charges of unfair labor practices is placed in the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board by Section 1301 of PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1301. The reasoning behind this is set forth by Justice Pomeroy, speaking for a unanimous court, in Philadelphia Fire Officers Association v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, 470 Pa. 550, 369 A.2d 259 (1977), reversing, 18 Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. 487, 336 A.2d 477 (1975). ...\u201d\n38 Pa.Cmwlth.Ct 337, 338, 394 A.2d 1298, 1299 (1978).\nIn our view, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s reliance on Philadelphia Fire Officers is misplaced. In that case, this Court held that the PLRA conferred jurisdiction on the PLRB to conduct a representation election in a bargaining unit consisting of fire and police officers. In so holding we sought to avoid the \u201cabsurd\u201d result of requiring \u201cemployees of the courts of common pleas to conduct elections in firehouses and police barracks and stations.\u201d 470 Pa. at 557, 369 A.2d at 262. Accordingly, in Philadelphia Fire Officers, Act 111, which does not cover the subject of representation elections, was read in pari materia with the PLRA. Thus read, labor boards would \u201cconduct secret elections through their staffs whose task it is to journey from workplace to workplace for such purpose.\u201d Id., 470 Pa. at 557, 369 A.2d at 262.\nHence, in Philadelphia Fire Officers practical considerations dictated that the PLRA, not the PERA, be read in pari materia with Act 111. Significantly, however, we did not hold that PERA governed the employees covered under Act 111. Rather, we stated:\n\u201cWe recognize, of course, that employees covered by Act No. Ill are not in any respect covered by P.E.R.A. (Act 195) and that Act 111 provides its own unique, specific procedure, namely, binding arbitration, as the final resort in the event of a bargaining impasse. 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 21713\u2014 217.8 (Supp.1976-77).\u201d\nId., 470 Pa. at 558, 369 A.2d at 262.\nBy its own terms, PERA excludes police and fire officers from coverage by the Act:\n\u201c \u2018Public employe\u2019 or \u2018employe\u2019 means any individual employed by a public employer but shall not include . those employes covered under the act of June 24, 1968 (Act 111), entitled \u2018An act specifically authorizing collective bargaining between policemen and firemen and their public employers; providing for arbitration in order to settle disputes, and requiring compliance with collective bargaining agreements and findings of arbitrators.\u2019 \u201d\nAct of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, \u00a7 301, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(2). Section 1201(a)(8) of the PERA, which was viewed as controlling by the Commonwealth Court, has no application to proceedings initiated under Act 111. PERA, through \u00a7 1201(a)(8), governs enforcement of \u201cgrievance\u201d arbitration awards. It does not encompass so-called \u201cinterest\u201d arbitration which is the subject of the present action. Thus the conclusion of the Commonwealth Court, that enforcement of a collective bargaining agreement incorporating a final and binding arbitration award may only be enforced through the filing of an unfair labor practice pursuant to \u00a7 1201 of PERA, is manifestly incorrect. The Commonwealth Court\u2019s result ignores the \u201cunique and specific procedures\u201d provided in Act 111 which were tailored by the Legislature to the specific requirements of the employment relations of municipalities and police and fire labor forces.\nThe remedy of mandamus is available against a municipality where there is a clear contractual right, arising out of a collective bargaining agreement, to be enforced. See Christian v. Johnstown Police Pension Fund, 421 Pa. 240, 218 A.2d 746 (1966) (contractual obligation imposed by law may be enforced by either mandamus or assumpsit); see also, Dombrowski v. Philadelphia, 431 Pa. 199, 245 A.2d 238 (1968) (because of contractual relationship between former employee and municipality, mandamus action by former employee is available to ensure financial soundness of municipality\u2019s retirement system). Here, the collective bargaining agreement, incorporating the cost of living increase provided for in the arbitration award, gave rise to a binding contractual duty on the part of appellee. Thus a judicial determination of a breach of that contractual obligation is properly remediable by mandamus. The order of the Commonwealth Court to the contrary is reversed and the case is remanded to the court of common pleas for proceedings to determine the merits of appellants\u2019 claim that the collective bargaining agreement was breached.\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court reversed and the case remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County-\nNIX, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. Paragraph one of the collective bargaining agreement provides:\n\u201c1. Wages and Cost of Living: Beginning January 1, 1976, the annual wage for each officer shall be increased by $350.00 plus the percentage of increased cost of living as measured by the C.P.I. for Philadelphia during the 12 months ending October, 1975. Said cost of living is incorporated in and shall become part of the basic wage as of January 1, 1977. By way of illustration the basic wage of a patrolman on January 1, 1976, will be computed as follows:\n1975 Basic Wage $13,160.15\n1976 Standard of Living Increase 350.00 Cost of Living Increase\n(assuming hypothetically that during the 12 months ending 10/75 the cost of living increase is 5%) 675.00\nTOTAL $14,185.50\u2019\n. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of appellants\u2019 complaint in mandamus allege:\n\u201c6. The defendant has not, as of January 1, 1977, been computing the plaintiffs\u2019 base wage in a manner or fashion contemplated by the 1976 Collective Bargaining Agreement, in that they have not incorporated the cost of living, as measured by the C.P.I. for Philadelphia during a 12 month period ending October, 1975, into the basic wage as of January 1, 1977, in computing the basic wage for each of the police officers for the Borough of Darby for the year commencing January 1, 1977.\n7. Despite requests made on behalf of the pl\u00e1intiffs for the inclusion of the cost of living aforesaid as part of the base wage for 1977, and as agreed to by the Council for the Borough of Darby in the agreement Exhibit \u201cA\u201d aforesaid, the defendant has failed, \u25a0refused to perform the duties imposed upon them in connection with the payment thereof.\u201d\n. Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 247 provides:\n\u201cReview of Arbitration Awards in Local Public Employment Disputes:\n(a) Review of an award of arbitrators appointed in conformity with an Act of Assembly to arbitrate a dispute between a public employer and employe not within the scope of Rule 703 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure shall be sought exclusively in the courts of common pleas. The application for review shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of the award of the arbitrators.\n(b) The order of a court of common pleas under subdivision (a) of this rule shall be subject to appeal to the Commonwealth Court in the manner prescribed by Chapter 9 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure.\nAdopted June 23, 1976, effective July 1, 1976.\u201d\nSee also Washington Arbitration Case, 436 Pa. 168, 259 A.2d 437 (1969).\n. \u201cStatutes in pari materia\n(a) Statute\u00e1 or parts of statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things.\n(b) Statutes in pari materia shall be construed together, if possible, as one statute.\u201d\nAct of November 25, 1970, P.L. 707, added December 6, 1972, P.L. 1339, \u00a7 3, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1932 (Supp. 1964-1978).\n. Section 1201(a)(8) provides:\n\u201cPublic employers, their agents or representatives are prohibited from refusing to comply with provisions of an arbitration award deemed binding under \u00a7 903 of Article IX.\u201d\nSection 903 provides:\n\u201cArbitration of disputes or grievances arising out of the interpretation of the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement is mandatory. The procedure to be adopted is a proper subject of bargaining with the proviso that the final step shall provide for a binding decision by an arbitrator or a tri-partite board of arbitrators as the parties may agree. Any decisions of the arbitrator or arbitrators requiring legislation will only be effective if such legislation is enacted.\u201d\n43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.903.\n. \u201cGrievance\u201d or \u201ccontract interpretation\u201d arbitration contemplates the disputed interpretation of an existing contract. \u201cInterest\u201d arbitration contemplates an inability of the parties to agree on the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.

        "text": "NIX, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThe majority opinion misconstrues the true nature of appellant\u2019s complaint. The majority finds that the complaint involves enforcement of an interest arbitration award and holds that the common pleas court has jurisdiction to enforce interest arbitration awards. (Maj. opinion at 1147-1148.) To the contrary, the instant dispute focuses upon the proper interpretation of the 1977 interest arbitration award. This basic disagreement causes my dissent. Moreover, Act III grants policemen and firemen the right to settlement of their grievances, but Act III is devoid of any provision whereby officers may pursue this right. I am of the view that this vacuity should be bridged by reading Act III in pari materia with PERA to provide for mandatory arbitration of grievances for policemen and firemen.\nOn September 10, 1975, the Borough of Darby entered into an agreement \u201cconcerning the terms and conditions of employment of the Police officers of the Borough of Darby for the calendar year commencing January 1, 1976.\u201d Paragraph 1 of the agreement provided:\n\u201c1.

Said cost of living is incorporated in and shall become part of the basic wage as of January 1, 1977. By way of illustration, the basic wage of a patrolman on January 1, 1976, will be computed as follows:\n1975 Basic Wage $13,160.15\n1976 Standard of Living Increase 350.00\nCost of Living Increase\n(assuming hypothetically that during the 12 months ending 10/75 the cost of living increase is 5%) 675.00\nTOTAL $14,185.50\u201d\nThe Borough and the police force could not agree on salary and conditions of employment for the 1977 calendar year. Thus, an arbitration panel was formed, hearings were held, and on December 20, 1976, the arbitrators entered an interest arbitration award applicable January 1, 1977. The interest arbitration award provision concerning wages provided:\n\u201cCommencing January 1, 1977, the annual wage for each police officer shall be increased by Three Hundred ($300.00) Dollars plus a cost of living adjustment for all police equal to the increased cost of living as measured by the C.P.I. for the Philadelphia Region for the twelve month period ending October, 1976, to be added to the base wage.\u201d\nDuring the first week of January 1977, the Borough paid the policemen\u2019s salaries in accordance with the Borough\u2019s interpretation of the interest arbitration award. The policemen did not petition for review, nor did they institute suit within thirty (30) days from the date of the Arbitrator\u2019s award. On February 11, 1977, the appellant filed a mandamus action on behalf of himself and on behalf of a class of Darby police officers in the common pleas court of Delaware County. The Borough filed preliminary objections asserting inter alia that the appellant had an adequate remedy at law and consequently the mandamus complaint should be dismissed.\nIn paragraphs 6 and 7 of appellant\u2019s complaint, he framed the issue as follows:\n\u201c6. The defendant has not, as of January 1, 1977, been computing the plaintiffs\u2019 base wage in a manner or fashion contemplated by the 1976 Collective Bargaining Agreement, in that they have not incorporated the cost of living, as measured by the C.P.I. for Philadelphia during a 12 month period ending October, 1975, into the basic wage as of January 1, 1977, in computing the basic wage for each of the police officers for the Borough of Darby for the year commencing January 1, 1977.\n7. Despite requests made on behalf of the plaintiffs for the inclusion of the cost of living aforesaid as part of the base wage for 1977, and as agreed to by the Council for the Borough of Darby in the agreement Exhibit \u201cA\u201d aforesaid, the defendant has failed, refused to perform the duties imposed upon them in connection with the payment thereof.\u201d\nIn my judgment, it is apparent that neither party disputed the binding effect of the award, but rather that the controversy focused upon how the basic wage was to be computed under the terms of the award. To argue that appellant was simply seeking enforcement and that the Borough raised the interpretation question as a defense for its non-compliance, assumes the very question that is at issue, i.e. what is the proper interpretation of the award. Before the common pleas court could order enforcement as requested by the complainants, the court was called upon to first determine the rights and duties created by the award. A prerequisite to this mandamus action is a resolution of whether or not the terms of paragraph one of the 1976 award had been incorporated into \u201cthe basic wages\u201d to be paid during 1977. Although the 1976 collective bargaining agreement expressly states that the cost of living increase \u201cshall become part of the basic wages as of January 1, 1977,\u201d the 1977 interest arbitration award omits reference to the inclusion of this increment in the permanent wage base for computation of 1977 wages. Thus, the proper analysis of the issue which confronted the common pleas court was an interpretation of the interest arbitration award, and not the enforceability of the award.\nUnder my analysis, the question that should have been addressed by the majority in this appeal is the proper forum to hear this interpretation dispute. I will therefore express my views on that subject.\nIn response to the threat of strikes by fire and police personnel, in great haste, the legislature in 1968 passed the Act of June 24, 1968, P.L. 237, No. 111, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 217.1-217.-10 (1979-80 Supp.) (Act III). Act III conferred upon policemen and firemen the right to organize, but in the interest of the public\u2019s health, safety and welfare, these public employees were not given the right to strike. Section 217.1 specifically grants policemen and firemen the right to collectively bargain for the terms and conditions of their employment, as well as \u201c. . . the right to an adjustment or settlement of their grievances or disputes in accordance with the terms of this act.\u201d Consistent with the legislature\u2019s intent to prevent strikes of police and fire personnel, Act III contains detailed provisions involving the time to begin collective bargaining, 43 P.S. \u00a7 217.3, the number of days to engage in collective bargaining, a description of when an impasse occurs during collective bargaining, 43 P.S. \u00a7 217.4, the procedure to request an interest arbitrator if an agreement is not reached, and restricts the right to appeal to courts from an interest arbitration award, \u00a7 43 \u00a7 217.7. Although the legislature also granted the police and fire personnel the right to remedy their grievances under 217.1, unlike the right to collectively bargain, Act III is devoid of any procedure under which the parties may pursue this right.\nIn order to avoid an unreasonable or absurd result, Act III should be read in pari materia with PERA Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, No. 195, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.101 et seq. The legislature has declared that statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same class of persons or things. 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1932(a). See also, In re William L, 477 Pa. 322, 383 A.2d 1228 (1978). When statutes are in pari materia, they shall be construed together whenever possible as if one statute. 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1932(b). See Commonwealth v. PEC, 472 Pa. 530, 372 A.2d 815 (1977). In Philadelphia Fire Officers v. PLRB, 470 Pa. 550, 369 A.2d 259 (1977), we recognized that Act III, PERA, and PLRA, Act of June 1, 1937, P.L. 1168, No. 294, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 211.1 et seq., all concern the subject of labor relations. 470 Pa. at 555, 369 A.2d at 261. We noted that Act III granted the police and firemen the right to collectively bargain, but lacked the procedures to designate the collective bargaining agent. In order to avoid an absurd result prohibited by 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1922(1), we read Act III in pari materia with PLRA and empowered the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board to conduct representation elections.\nThe facts of the instant case are analogous to the facts of Philadelphia Fire Officers. Here the legislature granted the policemen and firemen the right to resolve their grievances in accordance with the act, but Act III neglected to establish procedures whereby the grievances could be remedied. Recognizing that the legislature did not intend the absurd result of granting a right without providing for its enforcement, we should read Act III in pari materia with PERA.\nAct III should be read in pari materia with PERA in order to provide policemen and firemen with a method to resolve their grievances. PERA contains extensive provisions for grievance resolution, reflecting the legislature\u2019s recognition of the importance of harmonious labor relations in the public sector. Section 903, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.903 states:\n\u201c\u00a7 1101.903 Disputes under collective bargaining agreement; mandatory arbitration\nArbitration of disputes or grievances arising out of the interpretation of the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement is mandatory. The procedure to be adopted is a proper subject of bargaining with the proviso that the final step shall provide for a binding decision by an arbitrator or a tri-partite board of arbitrators as the parties may agree.\u201d\nTo protect the employee\u2019s right to mandatory arbitration of grievances, the legislature has declared that it is an unfair labor practice to refuse to discuss grievances with an employee representative. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1201(a)(5). Moreover, if either the employee or the employer fails to comply with an arbitration award deemed binding under Section 903, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.903, the party commits an unfair labor practice. 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101.1201(a)(8) and 1201(b)(8). The Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board is given the exclusive power to prevent unfair labor practices which accrue under PERA. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1301.\nIt is appropriate to read Act III in pari materia with PERA. First, Act III is a skeletal statute and PERA adds meaningful substance to Act Ill\u2019s provisions. PERA is a comprehensive statute, the product of intense study,, debate and compromise in the Pennsylvania legislature. Governor\u2019s Commission to Revise the Public Employee Laws of Pennsylvania, Report and Recommendations (June 1968). PERA, one of the first public employee labor relation statutes, served as a model for other public employee statutes throughout the nation, and should also serve as an adjunct to Act III.\nSecond, it is logical to construe Act III with PERA, a public employee statute, rather than with PLRA, a private employee statute. Pennsylvania courts have consistently recognized that \u201c[t]he distinction between the public and private sectors cannot be minimized. Employers in the private sector are motivated by profit to be returned from the enterprise where as public employers are custodians of public funds and are mandated to perform government functions as economically and effectively as possible.\u201d PLRB v. State College A.S.D., 461 Pa. 494, 499-500, 337 A.2d 262, 264 (1975). See also, PLRB v. Mars Area School District, 21 Pa.Cmwlth. 230, 344 A.2d 284 (1975); B. Aaron, J. Grodin, J. Stern, Public Sector Bargaining, 191 (1979).\nThird, the goals of the public employee labor relations statutes are similar and reading Act III in pari materia with PERA is consistent with the legislature\u2019s objective of promoting harmonious labor relations among public employees and their employers. The central theme of PERA is accommodating public employee demands, while recognizing that the public\u2019s interest is paramount. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.101. Act III imposes a duty of \u201cgood faith\u201d on public employees and their employers to exert every reasonable effort to settle disputes. 43 P.S. \u00a7 217.2. In contrast, PLRA only attempts to balance the rights of the private employer and their employees, and the statute is devoid of any mandate to bargain in \u201cgood faith.\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 211.5.\nFourth, the fact that PERA excludes policemen and firemen from its definition of \u201cemployees\u201d is not an obstacle to prevent reading PERA in pari materia with Act III to provide for mandatory arbitration of grievances. In Phila delphia Fire Officers Association, we read PLRA in pari materia with Act III in order to authorize the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board to conduct representation elections, despite the fact that 43 P.S. \u00a7 211.3(c) of PLRA expressly excluded \u201cpublic employers\u201d from its definition of employers. Act III employees are excluded from PERA because policemen and firemen do not have the right to strike. However, Act Ill\u2019s strike prohibition will not be effected by reading Act III in pari materia with PERA to provide for mandatory arbitration of grievances.\nFinally, although the common pleas courts currently resolves grievances which arise under Act III interest arbitration awards, the better procedure is arbitration of these grievances. Unlike the common pleas courts, labor arbitrators have an expertise in labor law, as well as experience in resolving labor disputes. Also, the arbitrator may have participated in drafting the Act III interest arbitration award, and he is in the best position to resolve interpretation disputes which may arise under the award.\nThus, the pleadings reveal that the issue in dispute concerns the proper interpretation of the interest arbitration award. Although Act III grants policemen the right to settlement of their grievances, the statute fails to provide for a grievance arbitration procedure. To avoid an absurd result, it is sensible to read Act III in pari materia with PERA and have the grievance proceed to arbitration pursuant to 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.903. If the Borough refused to arbitrate the grievance, an unfair labor practice would result. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1201(a)(5). If the policemen and the Borough submitted to mandatory arbitration of their grievances, but the Borough still refused to pay wages in accordance with the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the interest arbitration award, an unfair labor practice would occur. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1201(b)(8). It is not until the PLRB determines that an unfair labor practice has occurred, does the common pleas court have jurisdiction to enforce the PLRB\u2019s order preventing an unfair labor practice.\nTherefore, I would dismiss the action and allow the employees to proceed with seeking grievance arbitration pursuant to 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.903.\n. The Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County acknowledged that the action involved an interpretation of the award when it said:\n\u201cA reading of the Complaint makes it clear that plaintiff is seeking a judicial determination of whether or not the terms of paragraph I of the 1975 contract have been incorporated into the \u2018basic wages\u2019 to be paid Plaintiff in 1977. The award of the arbitrators provides for an increase to be made to the basic wages to be paid in 1977, but, said award does not fix \u2018basic wages.\u2019 Whether or not \u2018basic wages\u2019 was part of the subject matter before the arbitrators is not known to the Court at this time.\u201d\n. The PLRA does not have any provisions requiring mandatory arbitration grievances. If Act III was read in pari materia with PLRA, any grievance procedure would be provided for solely by the terms of the collective bargaining contract.\n. Unlike other PERA employees, guards and court personnel are prohibited from striking and if an impasse occurs during collective bargaining they must submit to binding arbitration. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.-1001. Also, public employees may agree to enter into binding contract arbitration. 43 P.S. \u00a7 804. Even though the literal terms of 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.S03 refer to mandatory arbitration of grievances which arise under a \u201ccollective bargaining agreement,\u201d this section applies to binding interest arbitration awards which arise under 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.804 and 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.805.\n. The courts have also recognized the desirability of arbitrating grievances and have held that \u201cany dispute which even arguably involves the interpretation of the agreement must be submitted to arbitration.\u201d Stroudsburg Bd. of Educ. v. PLRB, 39 Pa. Cmwlth. 200, 208, 395 A.2d 622, 623 (1978). Moreover, on the national level, binding arbitration of grievances which arise during the term of a labor agreement was once the exception in the public sector, but is rapidly becoming the norm. U. S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Grievance and Arbitration Procedures in State and Local Agreements, Bull. No. 1833 (Washington: 1975).\n. See e.g.; Flood v. Boro. of Canonsburg, 28 Pa.Cmwlth. 248, 368 A.2d 348 (1977); Darney v. Boro. of W. Mifflin, 23 Pa.Cmwlth. 267, 351 A.2d 317 (1976).",
