        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nIn 1972 appellant Karen Brungard commenced this action in trespass against Mansfield State College and Professor John A. Hartman, a chemistry professor at the College. The complaint alleged that appellant was injured in a chemistry lab explosion as a result of defendants\u2019 negligence. The Commonwealth Court dismissed the complaint against the College on the basis of sovereign immunity, and dismissed the complaint against the professor on the basis of official immunity. See Brungard v. Hartman, 12 Pa.Cmwlth. 477, 315 A.2d 913 (1974). On appeal this Court (1) vacated the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order with respect to the College on the basis of our decision in Mayle v. Pennsylvania Dept. of Highways, 479 Pa. 384, 388 A.2d 709 (1978), application for reargument denied, 479 Pa. 411, 390 A.2d 181 (1978), and (2) vacated the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order with respect to the professor and remanded for consideration in light of the principles of official immunity enunciated in Dubree v. Commonwealth, 481 Pa. 540, 393 A.2d 293 (1978). See Brungard v. Hartman, 483 Pa. 200, 394 A.2d 1265 (1978).\nOn remand, the Commonwealth Court dismissed the complaint with respect to the College on the ground that Act 152, Act of September 28, 1978, P.L. 788, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., which created for the first time in Pennsylvania statutory sovereign immunity in certain categories, barred the action. See Brungard v. Hartman, 46 Pa.Cmwlth. 10, 405 A.2d 1089 (1979) .\nThis Court recently held in Gibson v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 490 Pa. 156, 415 A.2d 80 (1980), that Act 152 cannot be constitutionally applied to actions like the instant one which accrued and were in existence prior to passage of the Act. Here, as in Gibson, it was error for the Commonwealth Court to dismiss the complaint against the College.\nAccordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court dismissing the complaint with respect to the College is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nNIX, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nEAGEN, C. J., and O\u2019BRIEN, J., dissent.\n. The Commonwealth\u2019s application for reargument requested that this Court give Mayle prospective effect only.\n. The Commonwealth Court also transferred appellant\u2019s complaint against the professor to the court of common pleas for appropriate proceedings. That order is not challenged here.",
