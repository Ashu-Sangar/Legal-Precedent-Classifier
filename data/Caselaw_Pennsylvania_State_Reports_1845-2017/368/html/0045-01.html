Appeal No. 157 is filed by Sol Davidow et al, the accounting trustees; appeal No. 158 by Frank J. McDonnell, Trustee Ad Litem for the unascertained beneficiaries; No. 159 by the Jewish Federation of Scranton, Pa., entitled in remainder under Myer Davidow’s will. ,These appeals all raise the same questions and will be disposed of together.</p>

The fund accounted for and distributed arose from a previous award made in the adjudication of a <em>second </em>account confirmed March 31, 1941. In that adjudication it appeared the accountants represented to the court that certain named legatees then entitled to legacies aggregating $170,000 resided <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>in foreign countries and by reason of the world conditions it was impractical to send the funds to them and requested impounding the legacies in the hands of the trustees for the respective legatees’ benefit. Whereupon Judge Leach, then specially presiding, stated in his adjudication, “By reason of the world conditions at the present time, it being impractical to send funds to foreign countries in which these legatees live, and to carry out the intent of the testator, the accountants request that the legacies to the said persons living in foreign countries be impounded with the trustees pending the further order of this Court as to a disposition of these legacies to them, and to be distributed, together with the increment that shall accrue thereon from the date of the final confirmation of the audit, to the said legatees when and as directed by the order of court.”</p>
    <p id="b69-4" data-blocks='[["BL_69.4",69,[211,1254,1152,647]]]'>Thereafter followed the award in the following language: “And the bequests amounting to $170,000.00 shown in the 13th finding of fact herein (adjudication of March 18, 1941) are to be impounded in the hands of the Trustees for the benefit of the foreign legatees, to be distributed, together with the increment that shall accrue thereon from the date of the final confirmation of the audit, to the said legatees when and as directed by order of court, as follows, viz.: . . .” after which is recited the names of each distributee with the legacy to which he or she was entitled set opposite the legatees’ name.</p>

The rest had been paid out to parties entitled. Of this balance on hand Judge Leach had awarded $15,000 for the benefit of Benjamin Davidow (decedent’s brother), and $10,000 each for Benjamin’s three children, Bebeka, Leiba and Chaje. This total of <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>$45,000 was claimed at the audit before Judge Beady by Israel Davidow of Tel-Aviv through his attorneys in fact. Israel, a son of Benjamin, is the sole next of kin of his father, sisters and brother. Judge Beady found that Benjamin had been killed March 22, 1944, by the Nazi army in Lithuania and all his family save only Israel (the claimant) had been massacred by the Nazi army, and that Israel was the sole next of kin. Similar findings were made with respect to Jacob and Israel Vorabay, two other legatees, who were killed by the Nazi army on August 18, 1941, and their nearest kin was their mother, Liba Vorabay, who claimed their legacies. Also it was found that Ida Zack, another legatee, died March 5, 1945, a civilian prisoner in a concentration camp in Germany, leaving to survive her as her only next of kin her daughters, Gita Rosen and Lea Block, who claimed their mother’s legacy. Upon these findings the auditing judge lifted the impounding order and awarded the respective next of kin the legacies claimed by them. To which action exceptions were filed, dismissed, and adjudication confirmed absolutely.</p>

However, we agree with the learned court below in holding this question sought to be raised is no longer open for consideration in the circumstances of this case for the reason well stated by Judge Beady in his adjudication which we quote with approval: “On the facts and circumstances as found relative to the claims presented by the next of kin and heirs of the deceased legatees, the rights of the claimants rest primarily on whether the rule of res ad judicata should apply.

They are cases where funds were either reserved or awarded back to the accountants for future disposition or accounting. Here the awards were not so made. There was an actual distribution to the legatees then living and entitled. Only because the world conditions made transmission of funds then impossible or impracticable were they awarded back to the accountants, not, however, for future accounting as part of the original trust funds but “impounded for the benefit of the foreign legatees, to be distributed together with the increment that shall accrue thereon ... to the said legatees when and as directed by the order of Court.” Obviously, the accountants then no longer held these awards as trustees of the testator but in reality as trustees of the legatees for whose benefit they were to hold them. The mere fact that the trustees were the same person is a matter of no importance. This does not prevent such an award from being a distribution.

Judge Leach might, as was sometimes done during those critical years when legacies could not be safely or legally transmitted to legatees in war torn lands, have awarded them to a different trustee or directed their payment into court as was frequently done to permit the accounting fiduciary to be discharged.
