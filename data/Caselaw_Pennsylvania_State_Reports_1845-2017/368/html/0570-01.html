On the same date letters of administration c.t.a. on the estate were granted to Mr. Lare, the exceptant in the present proceeding. As administrator c.t.a. Mr. Lare came into possession of the assets of the estate consisting of personal effects, furniture, an automobile, jewelry, cash, and securities. In December of 1942 the brothers and sister of the decedent appealed from the probate of the will, charging it to be a forgery. After a long hearing a decree nisi was entered in November, 1943, sustaining the appeal and revoking the letters of administration granted to Mr. Lare. On December 30, 1943, the decree nisi was made absolute by a decree of the Orphans’ Court in banc.</p>

It seems this surcharge was not actually paid to the accountant because it was agreed to be charged against Fare’s ultimate share as an advance in distribution. It is also contended <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>the total amount of commission claimed on <em>principal </em>is excessive. We see no need to pass on these questions now because the whole credit item of commission on principal is prematurely taken. We have here only a <em>first and partial </em>account.

E. Horwitz’s Estate, </em>7 Pa. Dist. (1898) ( Penrose, J.). The only objection made to the credit item of commissions on income is to that calculated on that part of the income received as dividends on the stock of the United Pocahontas Coal Co., which appellant states represents depletion of that corporation’s assets. The record is barren of any proof that that corporation’s assets were depleted in producing the earnings from which the dividends were paid. At the audit the appellant’s counsel asked administrator’s trust officer how much of the Pocahontas Stock income ($80,712.00) constituted depletion of the $46,020.00 included in the principal account as the value of the stock. The witness was unable to answer. We understand the appellant’s point to be, if part of the income of $80,712.00 received as dividends was in fact a return of part of the value of the capital stock included in the principal account then there would be duplication of commissions if 5% were charged on both items. This, however, must be =hown and we cannot pass on that question now because <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>of absence of proof. In any event there is no need to pass on the question now in view of the fact that we have stricken out all commissions on principal. Appellant will have ample opportunity to prove such duplication if he can when commissions on principal come again before the court for approval on final accounting.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[271,666,1160,1698]],["BL_597.1",597,[198,333,1149,1577]]]'>Concerning appellant’s contention that the sum of $12,500 paid to the administrator’s counsel for services rendered to date was excessive, the learned auditing judge found: .“The services rendered by counsel to the administrator d.b.n. were extensive and varied. There is in evidence Exhibit No. 4, setting forth on twenty-nine pages of legal-size paper a detailed statement of the services rendered by counsel to the administrator d.b.n. of this estate. This statement, as well as the testimony in the record, has been considered in measuring the value of the services rendered. Counsel successfully resisted the effort of Mr. Lare to prevent the grant of letters of administration d.b.n. to the Fidelity Trust Company and, thereafter, his effort to have the letters revoked. It became necessary to proceed against Mr. Lare for possession of the personal property of the estate. This matter was conducted by counsel with satisfactory results. Exceptions on behalf of the administrator d.b.n. to the inventory and appraisement and the account filed by Mr. Lare as administrator c.t.a. of the estate were prepared and filed by counsel. The exceptions were numerous and most of them were sustained by the court after a hearing that extended over a period of three days. As a result of the exceptions, a surcharge of $9,179.13 was entered against the administrator c.t.a. The Kilpatrick estate matter referred to in the discussion' above, pertaining to the compensation of the administrator d.b.n., was difficult and exacting litigation. It was unusual and it placed a heavy burden upon counsel for the administrator d.b.n. It involved innumerable conferences, a searching and constant investigation ex<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>tending over long periods. Much of the detail of the services rendered in this matter is set forth in Exhibit 4 and in the testimony. Counsel also intervened in the liquidation of the Bunker Coal Company in which the estate had an interest. They appeared at a number of hearings held by a Special Master and successfully advanced a position which Mr. Lare had requested the administrator d.b.n. to assert. Counsel successfully conducted negotiations for the reduction of the valuation by the Bureau of Internal Bevenue of the shares of the Pocahontas Coal Company owned by the estate. This involved investigation and examination into the records of the Coal Company and the filing of a brief. The reduction in valuation resulted in a saving to the estate of Federal estate taxes in the sum of $4,144.77. Counsel also enforced the collection, to the extent of $1,-965.15, of a judgment which had been entered in Beaver County and had been thought to be worthless. In addition to the extraordinary services indicated above, counsel also performed all the usual and ordinary legal services which lawyers render to fiduciaries in the course of settlement of a decedent’s estate. Giving consideration to all the items of services rendered by counsel and applying the rule for the measurement of the value of legal services laid down in Huffman’s Estate No. 3, <a href="/pa/349/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="349 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="459338" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0059-01">349 Pa. 59</a>, at pages 64 and 65, the auditing judge finds the fee paid to counsel for services rendered to the administrator d.b.n. to be fair and reasonable and not excessive.”</p>

It has been a general practice in the orphans’ courts for counsel whose fees are contested to prepare and present such a statement in the interest of saving the time of the court, the parties and the public. A copy given <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>to opposing counsel enables him to make a better cross-examination as to items he wishes to investigate further. This practice has been found salutary and such statements are usually received in evidence without objections for they are prepared by an attorney who is an officer of the court who has taken an oath upon admission to serve as such with fidelity to the court as well as to the client. Indeed, this well established practice has had such approbation of the bar that objections heretofore have been rarely, if ever made. In the instant case the record shows that Mr. Lare’s counsel, who tried the case at the audit, himself suggested the preparation of the itemized statement of services rendered, saying, “. . . just as a suggestion to shorten this procedure, I think that if Mr. Bane will submit to us an itemized statement of what services they have rendered, and we have an opportunity to examine that. . . we can save a lot of time ...” To this appellee’s counsel assented. It was prepared and formally offered in evidence and no objections made by Lare’s counsel, who proceeded immediately to cross-examine counsel on the same. Later the next day he sought to object to the statement (Exhibit No. 4) which objection the auditing judge correctly refused to entertain since it had been received in evidence without objection the day before. The fee paid was also supported as reasonable by the testimony of three experienced members of the Allegheny bar. Moreover, as the fee claimed was for services rendered in settlement of an estate, the court itself is amply able to appraise the reasonableness of the fee upon a mere recital of the nature of the services rendered: see <em>Wood’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/272/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="272 Pa. 8" data-case-ids="1068351" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0008-01">272 Pa. 8</a>, 13, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20A.%20865" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="115 A. 865">115 A. 865</a> (1922).</p>
