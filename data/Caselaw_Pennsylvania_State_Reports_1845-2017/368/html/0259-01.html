The difference, so far as this case is concerned, is obvious from a mere reading of the two sections. <em>Section 904 </em>authorizes the Attorney General to <em>investigate </em>any alleged violations 'of the'laws of the Commonwealth and to take such steps, and adopt such means, as may be reasonably necessary to enforce the laws. But it does not specifically or impliedly give the Attorney General the very important and powerful (and to citizens onerous) right to issue a subpoena, which right, as noted above, he does not possess except when (and to the extent) granted by statute. <em>Section 520 </em>of The Administrative Code does, however, specifically give every administrative department — which certainly includes the Department of Justice — “the power to issue subpoenas, requiring the attendance' of witnesses . . . <em>pertinent to any hearing </em>before such department” and the authority to examine such witnesses. It is clear, we believe, that the right of subpoena was. limited to a right to subpoena a witness to appear (and produce books and papers) <em>at a hearing.</em>
