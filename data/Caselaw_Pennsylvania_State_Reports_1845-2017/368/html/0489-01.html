The court below sustained preliminary objections to the complaint and entered judgment for the defendants from which the plaintiffs brought this appeal.</p>

The lease, which was for a specified term of one year, was automatically renewed annually thereafter under the provisions of its hold-over clause. On May 28, 1948, the defendants gave the plaintiffs written notice of their avowed desire to possess themselves of the property “for their own use and occupancy” and, therewith, demanded that the plaintiffs quit and surrender up possession of the premises within sixty days of receipt of the notice. The plaintiffs refused to vacate on the ground that, under the law of Pennsylvania, a cognate notice three months prior to the expiration of the current year’s term was required to terminate the tenancy. The defendants thereupon instituted eviction proceedings against the plaintiffs before an alderman who gave judgment for the tenants. This effort to evict was not pursued further. Several months later, to wit, on January 11, 1949, the defendants again notified the plaintiffs in writing that they desired the apartment “for their own use and occupancy” and demanded that the tenants quit and surrender up possession of the premises on May 1,1949, i.e., on the termination date of the yearly term. The plaintiffs, assuming the good faith of the defendants’ statement of intention to occupy the apartment themselves and in reliance thereon, vacated as the notice called upon them to do. However, the defendants did not move into the apartment but forthwith rented it to a third person at a higher rental.</p>

    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[231,611,1160,984]]]'>It is not open to dispute that the landlords’ deception of the tenants with respect to the intended use and occupancy of the premises was a fraud within the purview of the Federal Housing and Rent Act (see portion quoted in footnote 1 supra). But, only penal sanctions were prescribed by that Act for a landlord’s breach of it. Specifically, the statute did not confer upon an aggrieved tenant a right of action for damages for such a violation. Accordingly, it has been held that a Federal court lacks jurisdiction of an action for damages brought under the statute by a tenant against his landlord: <em>Leidy v. Connor, </em><a href="/f-supp/70/1022-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="70 F. Supp. 1022" data-case-ids="608408" data-case-paths="/f-supp/70/1022-01">70 F. Supp. 1022</a> (D.C.E.D. Pa.) A like conclusion was reached in a suit in Federal court on the same cause as is here involved: see <em>Crawford v. Pituch, </em><a href="/f-supp/91/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="91 F. Supp. 626" data-case-ids="294081" data-case-paths="/f-supp/91/0626-01">91 F. Supp. 626</a> (D.C.W.D. Pa.). It is interesting to note that in the latter case the court implicitly recognized, by the quotation from another case which it approved, that, although “The frauds</p>

Also pertinent in this connection is the fact that Federal jurisdiction was not invoked in either of the cases above cited on the ground of diversity of citizenship for the enforcement of a right of action existing under local law. Both cases were instituted on the mistaken assumption that the statute conferred upon a tenant a right of action for damages for a landlord’s violation of the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Furthermore, it is the rule both federally and in this State that where a statute creates a new offense and prescribes the penalty therefor or where it declares a new right and sets forth a remedy, the prescribed penalty or remedy is exclusive: see <em>Farmers’ and Mechantes’ National Bank v. Dearing, </em><a href="/us/91/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="91 U.S. 29" data-case-ids="5649075" data-case-paths="/us/91/0029-01">91 U.S. 29</a>, 35; <em>Gerber’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/337/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="337 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1197251" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0108-01">337 Pa. 108</a>, 116, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20438" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="9 A.2d 438">9 A. 2d 438</a>. What the effect of the right of action for damages now conferred upon tenants by the 1951 amendment of the Housing and Rent Act, cited in footnote 2, may be is not before us. As already indicated, the Housing and Rent Act in force when the cause of action, here relied upon, is said to have arisen was the Act of 1947 as amended by the Act of 1948, cit. supra.</p>
    <p id="b515-4" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[215,1762,1149,263]]]'>This suit was not brought under the Housing and Rent Act.

The present complaint avers such a cause of action. True enough, the false statement of the defendants as to their intention with respect to the use and occupancy of the premises derived its materiality from the right attaching to the plaintiffs, as tenants, by virtue of the Housing and Rent Act. But, that is purely incidental. The false statement was actionable as deceit, nonetheless, in the circumstances of its utterance, its purpose and its effect. The courts of a number of sister States have ruled similarly in like factual situations: see, e.g., <em>Gabriel v. </em>Borowy,-Mass.-, <a href="/citations/?q=96%20N.E.2d%20243" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="96 N.E.2d 243">96 N.E. 2d 243</a> (1950); <em>Kilroy v.
