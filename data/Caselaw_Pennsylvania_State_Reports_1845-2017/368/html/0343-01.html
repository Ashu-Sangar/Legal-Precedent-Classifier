Her will, dated January 5, 1925, probated by the Register in Philadelphia County, provided (tenth item) that after payment of various legacies a trust of $40,000 be erected with appellant as trustee, whereunder Margaretta C. Anthony was to receive the income for life and upon her decease the principal of the fund was to fall in and become part of the residuary estate. Under the twelfth item of the will the residue was directed to be held in trust by the appellant-trustee to pay the income to named great nieces and great nephews for their lives and upon the death of each to pay the principal to his or her descendants absolutely. The appellant and testatrix’s nephew, Edward C. Dale, were named, and thereafter qualified, as executors of the will. The original record discloses that the first account of the executors was filed on October 30, 1930 and audited by President Judge Lamorelle who filed his adjudication December 13, 1930. In the account a credit was taken by the <em>executors </em>of $5961.44 “com- t missions 3% on $198,714.69 principal” and $215.75 “commissions 5% on $4314.92 Income”. By the schedule of distribution, approved June 13, 1932, $40,000 (in scheduled securities) was assigned to <em>appellant as trustee </em>for Margaretta O.

Yet it must not be overlooked that in fixing compensation of fiduciaries we are required to consider the situation not only of great corporations doing an enormous trust business in large cities, but also the smaller corporations in less populous areas. The same rates of compensation equally apply to individuals and corporations. It should only be if absolutely necessary and in justness and fairness, that compensation of fiduciaries in trust estates should be presently increased, especially since during the past quarter of a century, which included a tremendous financial depression and two major wars, the net return of income to trust beneficiaries has been progressively diminishing and the value of corpus is so frequently found to have greatly shrunken, and in many cases disappeared. In extreme cases, in trusts of unusual duration, the entire principal <em>could be </em>greatly diminished or even consumed by the annual allowance of a trustee’s commission upon principal. For example, the record in <em>Curran’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/310/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="310 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="1144293" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0434-01">310 Pa. 434</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%20842" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="165 A. 842">165 A. 842</a>, discloses that, in a charitable trust, testator directed the accumulation of income until the corpus (p. 436) . . shall yield annually thirty thousand dollars. . . .” A calculation will demonstrate that testator obviously contemplated a period of approximately 100 years before such result could be attained. Solely because of the wise action of the fiduciary in entering into an extremely profitable improvement lease, only 35 years elapsed before the desired result was accomplished. Had such beneficial lease not been taken, and had the fiduciary annually received one-half of one per cent <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>of the principal, it may readily <em>be </em>observed that at least fifty per cent of the principal would have been consumed by the payment of trustee’s commissions and the termination of the trust greatly retarded.</p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[260,555,1156,807]]]'>The principles relating to fixing the amount of compensation to fiduciaries as determined by this Court and the Legislature over the past 150 years, have become firmly established. It may well be that present conditions demand that the system requires general revision. If this be true, such radical change should be made by the <em>Legislature </em>and not by the Court. We decline to overrule the host of our decisions over such a long period. We agree with Judge Ladner that even before a change of such magnitude should be enacted by the Legislature, there should be a wide and searching investigation by a legislative committee concerning the entire subject matter, including not only the situation of all corporate fiduciaries but of individual fiduciaries as well.</p>

On the other hand, the proposed principle or practice advocated by the corporate fiduciary of taking <em>annual </em>compensation by way of commissions, based on the annual market value (or even the inventory value) of the principal of the estate, is so fundamentally contrary and antagonistic to all our authorities, and to our philosophy of trusts and their preservation, and to our long established policy of awarding compensation only for services which were rendered during the entire trust; and the likelihood of the proposed practice producing diminution of or disaster to the trust is so great — that for all these reasons I believe such new prac<em>J </em>tice or principle would, be approved only if authorized or required ■ by an act of the legislature.</p>
