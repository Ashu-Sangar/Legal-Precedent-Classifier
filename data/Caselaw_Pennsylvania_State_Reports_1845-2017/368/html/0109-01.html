London conveyed 122 acres of land situate and bounded as described in the deed, excepting and reserving thereout the coal to Meredith. <em>In 1840 London owned not only the surface, hut also a reversionary interest in whatever coal remained after the expiration of the 100 year lease to Meredith. </em>Since the plaintiffs contend that it was never the intention of London in and by the deed to Meredith to consider or convey the possibility of reverter in the coal land, it may not be amiss to ask <em>what mines and minerals London was referring to on the surface land </em>which plaintiffs allege he was solely conveying; and what were the reversions and remainders which plaintiffs allege London was reserving <em>on the surface land only; </em>and what is the meaning of the broad language of the deed “and also all the estate, right, title, interest, . . . claim and demand whatsoever of the said party of the first part in law or equity or otherwise howsoever . . . pertaining to London”? So far as the record shows there were no mines, minerals or reversions on or in or appertaining to the surface, and unless the mines and minerals and the reversions and remainders ap<a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>plied to London’s reversionary interest in the coal lands leased to Meredith, the language would be meaningless; and it is difficult to conceive of any broader language than that used in the deed <em>to convey all </em>of London’s estate, <em>right, title, interest, claim, and demand in law or equity </em>which he and his wife had in the land <em>and in every part and parcel thereof.</em>

In that case a bill in equity was brought by heirs of Susan London Dolph (sister of Isaac London) against this defendant for an accounting of coal mined in Lackawanna County <em>from this specific coal land </em>which had been leased by Isaac London to Thomas Meredith in 1828. The facts and the ruling of the Court are so clearly and aptly set forth by Mr. Justice, now Chief Justice, Drew, that we shall quote therefrom: “These writings were construed, in Kingsley v. Hillside Coal &amp; Iron Co., <a href="/pa/144/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="144 Pa. 613" data-case-ids="823742" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0613-01">144 Pa. 613</a>, to amount to ‘a sale of the coal to be mined within the term stated therein.’ Meredith took possession, and by himself and his assignees mined the coal in large quantities until 1928, when the hundred-year term expired. The defendants then took possession and began mining and removing coal, claiming under a deed of the land <em>executed in 1840 by Isaac London to Burr Kenyon, </em>under which Kenyon and defendants, his successors in interest, have held possession of the surface ever since its execution. <em>This deed covered not only the surface but the ‘mines, minerals, reversions and remainders ’ with the exception of the interest of Meredith in the coal ”</em>

The Court granted the relief prayed for and affirmed on the learned opinion of Judge Endlich. The basis for his decision is found on pages 244-245 where he said: “But, where an estate is conveyed in fee for a specified purpose ‘and no other,’ the fee is a base fee determinable upon cessation of the use of the property for that purpose: Kirk v.

Second, if it was an absolute interest, was that interest in the coal, realty or personalty?” The Court held that Miss Smith had an absolute interest under the will and that «the interest in the lease requiring <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>payments of royalties was personal property and salable by her as administratrix.
