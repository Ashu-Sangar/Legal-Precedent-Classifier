Snyder died on April 15, 1948, leaving a will in which he gave all his estate to his wife, whom he had. married 14 months prior to his death. The decedent’s estate totaled $17,000. Decedent’s father at the audit ■ of the account presented a claim on 8 judgment notes which were <em>under seal, </em>the first dated January Í3, 1930 and the last July. 1, 1935. These notes totalled $3700. plus interest, making a total claim of $6547.19. Six of the notes were made payable by the decedent to his father and two to his mother, who in turn assigned them to the father on April 8, 1949. The claim was first made 11. months, and 21 days after the son’s death.</p>
