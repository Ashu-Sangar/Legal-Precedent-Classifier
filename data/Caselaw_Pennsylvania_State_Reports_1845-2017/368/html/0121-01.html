He had for many years an antenna in and on top of his house; he operates his station solely for pleasure and wants to increase its efficiency so that he can communicate with more distant points and use less power. He proposes to erect in his back yard, which is 50 feet wide and 60 feet deep from the hoqse to the rear boundary line, a mast <em>32 feet high, </em>with a 39 inch triangular base and a triangular top 12 inches on a side. The mast and beam antenna which it supports will be made of aluminum, set in a concrete base which will be placed 30 feet from his house, 23 feet from one lateral lot line and 27 feet from the other. The mast is self-supporting and will withstand a wind velocity in excess of 70 miles per hour. The court found that the proposed antenna will not appreciably interfere with radio reception by others; and that no question was raised as to the adequacy of the base or support, or as to the strength and durability of the mast.</p>

It was considered a part of his fundamental liberty, a very important part of the fundamental law which was the supreme law of the land and which was called the Common Law because it was given to all in common.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> A large part of the law in the Middle Ages was necessarily concerned with property.

It was probably because of this historical origin and development of our Country and the rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed by our Constitution, some of which are apparently little known or ofttimes forgotten, that this Court in the leading case of <em>White’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/287/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="287 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1099652" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0259-01">287 Pa. 259</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20A.%20409" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="134 A. 409">134 A. 409</a>, reviewed the power of a state to take or regulate the use of private property, as well as the difference between the police power and the power of eminent domain. The Court, in a clear and comprehensive opinion, reiterated certain fundamental principles and laid down certain guideposts to aid legislative bodies and zoning commissions in their consideration of prospective laws, ordinances or regulations which might affect the health, safety or welfare of a community on the one hand, and on the other hand, interfere with certain unalienable rights of every citizen. The legislative power is so well known and the constitutional rights of an individual are today so little known, that we shall quote only those parts of the Court’s opinion which deal with the limitations of <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>legislative bodies and tbe corollary rights of citizens (pages 265, 266, 267) :</p>

There is one matter that is quite certain, <em>the power to thus regulate does not extend to an arbitrary, unnecessary or unreasonable intermeddling with the private ownership of property, even though such acts be labeled for the preservation of health, safety and general welfare. ... </em>While such regulations may not physically take the property, they do so regulate its use as to deprive the owner of a substantial right, therein <em>without compensation. </em>'We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition it not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change’: Pennsylvania Coal Co. v.

'To secure their property was one of the great ends for which men entered society. <em>The right to acquire and own property, and to deal with it and use it as the owner chooses so long as the use harms nobody, is a natural right. </em>It does not owe its origin to constitutions. It existed before them. <em>It is a part of the citizen’s natural liberty, </em>— an expression of his freedom, — guaranteed as inviolate by every American bill of rights’: Spann v.

Each case must of course be decided on its own facts. . . . Where a statute or ordinance interferes with the use and control of property without rational relation to public safety, health, morals or general welfare, <em>or is a palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law, the enactment cannot be sustained </em>as a legitimate exercise of police power. ... To bring this, and other like regulations, under the police power, would be to sweep <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>away constitutional guarantees on the ownership of property.
