Tomayko, the claimant, was decedent’s faithful and efficient employe, in whom decedent reposed great confidence. On February 23, 1944, decedent made his will wherein he bequeathed claimant all his stock in the Coca Cola Bottling Company <em>of Charleroi. </em>(italics supplied) On May 17, 1945, decedent made a first codicil which has no effect upon this litigation. On August 10, 1946, decedent executed a second codicil wherein he revoked the bequest of the stock to claimant and provided: “I direct that my executors give to the Coca-Cola Company <em>of Pennsylvania </em>(italics supplied) the first opportunity to buy my stock in the Coca-Cola Bottling Company <em>of Charleroi </em>(italics supplied), Pennsylvania, at the fair and reasonable value of my said stock.” A third codicil was executed on February 16,1947, republishing the will but which did not change the testamentary provisions concerning the disposition of the stock. Decedent died June 24, 1948, and his will and codicils were duly probated July 13, 1948. Judge Carson, a common pleas judge of Washington County, co-executor and sole trustee in the will, a close personal friend of decedent, testified concerning decedent’s reason for the change in his will. It was that the Coca-Cola Bottling Company <em>of Charleroi </em>was the licensee of the Coca-Cola Company of <em>Pennsylvania. </em>Officials of the latter company learned in some undisclosed manner of decedent’s bequest. They objected. As licensor they feared that the stock might “pass into hands that would not manage the business correctly and properly.” They insisted that the licensor company be permitted to purchase the stock upon decedent’s death at its fair value. Decedent did not oppose these wishes because of his fear that the license might be withdrawn, whereupon the stock would be <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>worthless. Decedent thereupon reluctantly agreed to change his will. The Chicago lawyer of the licensor company drafted a clause which was accepted by decedent and which was incorporated in the codicil prepared by decedent’s friend Judge Carson. When the Judge inquired of decedent whether there should be incorporated a clause bequeathing the <em>proceeds of sale </em>of the stock to claimant, decedent stated that he <em>“had already made arrangements that Alex would be talcen care of.”</em>

Naccarato was considering taking a steady job with the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Charleroi and wanted some assurance as to the prospective permanency of the employment. He had worked for the Pittsburgh Steel Company for fourteen years and, before changing positions, he wanted, as his testimony discloses and the circumstances authenticate, some indication of security; he didn’t want merely to lose his seniority rights with the steel company. It was in such relation that Swearingen told him that he had given his stock in the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Charleroi to Alex (Tomayko) and that as long as Naccarato got along with Alex he would be secure in his position. The first time Swearingen told Naccarato that he had given Alex the stock was in the spring of 1947 and the last time was in March 1948, shortly before Naccarato accepted employment with the Charleroi company. Swearingen died three months later, on June 24, 1948. The decedent’s like declarations, as testified to by the other two witnesses, were not earlier than 1947.

Especially, in the <em>Malone </em>case, it is implicit in Judge Penrose’s opinion that, without the independent evidence of delivery, there mentioned, the donor’s verbal acknowledgment of his executed gift was sufficient to take the case to the jury on the question of gift.

No one disputes that “A joint lease of a safe deposit box is not of itself sufficient to establish joint ownership of securities found therein which originally belonged to one of the lessees.” But, on the other hand, the fact that both Swearingen and Alex had rightful access to the deposit box, wherein the stock was located, does not operate to divest Alex of his right to the securities by virtue of the proven gift: see <em>Pyewell’s Estate, </em>supra.</p>

The evidence clearly shows that this testamentary change was made not because of any desire on Swearingen’s part, but actually contrary to his wishes, at the urgent insistence (veritably a demand) of the Coca-Cola Company of Pennsylvania to which the Charleroi company was beholden for its distributing franchise. In fact, the attorney for the Pennsylvania company (or the parent Coca-Cola Company of Delaware) prepared a draft of the change in Swearingen’s will with respect to his stock in the Charleroi company, which the Pennsylvania company required, and intended to come to Charleroi to have the codicil “re-written and the will re-executed so that they would have the right to buy the stock.” Swearingen, fearful of losing his distributing franchise if he continued to refuse to make the change in his will required by the licensing company, gave in to its demand and executed the codicil. But, he contemporaneously confided to a friend that “Alex would be taken care of.” And, it is undisputed that his kindly feeling and attitude toward Tomayko never underwent any change but endured undiminished to the day of the decedent’s death. A significant thing is that the declarations of the decedent, as testified to, that he had given Alex the stock (which he was at liberty to do despite the codicil) were all made subsequent to the execution of the codicil of 1946 and its republication of February 16, 1947.
