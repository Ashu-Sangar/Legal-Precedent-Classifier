In summary: defendant, a former convict, on Saturday, June 25, 1949, burglarized the Blizzard home in Rydal, Abington Township, and on Monday, June 27, 1949, burglarized the Hauptfuhrer residence, both being in the same neighborhood ; the houses were closed for the summer; he carried away from both homes all the loot which he could pack in two stolen suit cases, and in his pockets; apparently his pockets were filled to overflowing because he lost a watch and cigarette lighter along, his <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>way home, and which were later identified as part of the stolen goods; because defendant was unable to carry away on his person all the property in the burglarized houses he desired to acquire, he segregated and piled in each residence merchandise which he proposed subsequently to pick up with the aid of an automobile. On Tuesday night, June 28th, he stole a truck in Philadelphia for use in removing the loot which he had piled up in the two dwellings which he had previously broken into and burglarized. On the early morning of June 29th, at about 1 a. m., after driving the truck to Rydal, defendant re-entered the Blizzard residence through the door he had left unlocked (after breaking in on June 25th) and picked up in the hall six bottles of liquor which he placed in the back of the truck; he then proceeded in the truck toward the Hauptfuhrer home where the additional articles were left by him to be picked up.</p>

Matthews (the victim) were patrolling the vicinity in a police car; at the adjacent Koenig residence the flood lights were turned on and dogs barking and they proceeded to investigate. While so engaged the police officers heard and saw a truck drive past; they followed in the police car; the truck was observed to enter and then back out of, the O’Neill driveway, opposite the Hauptfuhrer residence; the police officers stopped the truck and questioned the driver, the sole occupant, whom officer Cutting identified as the defendant. The liquor was seen in the rear of the truck; while the defendant was being questioned, defendant slid out of the opposite front door of the truck and ran across the Hauptfuhrer lawn and into the woods in the rear;. he was closely pursued by . both police officers; officer Mátthews (the victim) ran after defendant shouting for him to halt and shooting his revolver; at Matthews’ request, Cutting returned to the police car <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>and radioed for help; while Matthews continued the pursuit, still firing his gun, Cutting heard some one fall in the woods; the policemen who responded in answer to the radio call, with the aid of flood lights, discovered the dead body of officer Matthews, on his back, with arms extended, handcuffs near his right hand, and the cartridges in his revolver all discharged. His death was found to have been caused by bullets from a .38 calibre Smith &amp; Wesson revolver (similar to that stolen from the Hauptfuhrer residence); nearby was also found a rubber heel from defendant’s sandals. Defendant had escaped. On July 8, 1949, he was arrested in Amherst, Virginia. In a letter to friends in Virginia defendant wrote “You see I killed a policeman.” In the Amherst jail he told his cellmate “I’m here for murder, I killed a cop in Pennsylvania.” There are many other corroborating circumstances, all of which are narrated in detail by the court below in its charge and opinion, which are cumulative to the overwhelming circumstantial evidence that defendant killed the officer with a deadly weapon while fleeing from a burglary and which also clearly established a wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing.</p>

Defendant on his reentry of the Blizzard home removed six bottles of liquor which he placed in the truck. This constituted a statutory burglary under section 901 of The Penal Code of June 24, 1939 P. L. 872, 18 PS, 4901. Under the code the offense is burglary to “. . . wilfully and maliciously, <em>[enter] </em>any building, with intent to commit any felony therein. . .

Having attempted to reduce the loot to his complete dominion preliminarily by placing it in the truck, defendant commenced to carry it away. He was intercepted by the police officers, and while being questioned fled and was pursued by the officers, resulting in the death of one of them.

He assigns as error the court’s refusal of the fifth point of charge that the quality of circumstantial evidence must be “such as to exclude every other reasonable possibility, except that of guilt.” The trial judge properly refused to so charge. The true test of the quality of circumstantial evidence necessary to convict has been repeatedly stated by this court. In <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Bausewine, <a href="/pa/354/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="354 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="467477" data-case-paths="/pa/354/0035-01">354 Pa. 35</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.2d%20491" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="46 A.2d 491">46 A. 2d 491</a>, the present Chief Justice said, p. 40: “While the mere fact that the evidence adduced is wholly circumstantial is not fatal to the Commonwealth’s case (Commonwealth v. DePetro, <a href="/pa/350/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="350 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="461127" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0567-01">350 Pa. 567</a>, 577, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20838" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="39 A.2d 838">39 A. 2d 838</a>), yet it must be remembered that guilt must be proved and not conjectured. The reasonable inference of guilt must be based on facts and conditions proved; it cannot rest solely on suspicion or surmise. These do not take the place of testimony. The facts and circumstances proved must, in order to warrant a conviction, be such as to establish the guilt of the defendant, not necessarily beyond a moral .certainty, nor as being absolutely incompatible with his innocence, but at least beyond a reasonable doubt. The circumstantial evidence in this case is not such ‘as reasonably and naturally to justify an inference of the guilt of the accused,. . . and of such volume and quality as to overcome the presumption of innocence and satisfy the jury of the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt’: <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>Commonwealth v.

The defendant was seen being pursued by officer Matthews and running into the woods where the body was found. Defendant admits he was attempting to elude arrest. Shots were heard. Defendant’s rubber heel was found near the body. The death dealing wounds were inflicted by the type of revolver which defendant had stolen from the- Hauptfuhrer home; not only did defendant then flee the jurisdiction but attempted suicide to escape capital punishment. Twice he admitted the killing of a policeman, once in his letter to his friend and in a conversation with his Virginia cellmate. Such killing obviously related to the murder here involved.

He may, however, apply to the Pardon Board for a commutation of his sentence. We have, in Pennsylvania, a State Parole Board, which has jurisdiction in all cases except where the penalty is death or life imprisonment, and we also have a Pardon Board, and the Pardon Board is comprised of the Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the Attorney-General and the Secretary of Internal Affairs. Any prisoner, regardless of what the sentence is, may make application to the Board of Pardons for a commutation of his sentence, and the Board may then make its recommendation to the Governor for a reduction of sentence or, if the circumstances, in the opinion of the Pardon Board, warrant, they may recommend a full and complete pardon.’ ”</p>

We said (p. 487), speaking through Chief Justice Maxey : “Both the inquiry and the answer were irregular and neither should have been made. The only issue before the jury was that of the guilt of the defendant. Whether if found guilty and sentenced he was then eligible for parole was of no concern to the jury and the trial judge should have said so. The answer of the trial judge was well calculated to lead the jury to believe that if it resolved a reasonable doubt of defendant’s guilt against him the Board of Pardons would make a timely correction of its error.
