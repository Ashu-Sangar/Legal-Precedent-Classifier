As the opinion in the <em>Boyer </em>case reveals, — “Petitioner was [at the time of his conviction] accepted for military service and <em>was released by the court without formal order deferring or suspending sentence” </em>(Emphasis the author’s). It was not until a year later when Boyer (while still in the Army) was returned to the court to plead guilty to another indictment, whereon he was at once sentenced, that the court assumed to pass sentence on the two convictions of the year before. It was the latter belated sentences that were voided in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Boyer v. Ashe, </em>and rightly so, but not because the term of the conviction had passed. The true <em>ratio decidendi </em>of the <em>Boyer </em>case is that the trial court deliberately permitted its power to sentence the relator to go unexercised because of the special circumstances attending his pleas of guilty to the indictments then presented against him. The case was disposed of on the relator’s petition without argument before this court and it is not discernible from the record how many members of the court actually participated in the <em>unreported </em>memorandum opinion in that case.</p>

True, there are <em>dicta </em>to such effect in some of our cases, but it will be found in every one of them that the trial court had assumed to exercise its sentencing power, which then became <em>functus, </em>and that, after the term, the court undertook to resentence or to sentence afresh on other convictions which had been before the court when it originally exercised its power to sentence with respect to the particular defendant.</p>

It is true that we reversed the Superior Court’s order in the <em>Michelotti </em>case (see <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Michelotti v.

That that is so is confirmed by what we said at p. 543 as follows, — -“The court below sentenced relator on each of the six bills of indictment and, in the same session, revoked and vacated each sentence. Nothing appears of record to show that the court did anything to preserve its power to <em>resentence. </em>

Smith, </em>which we cited in support of our action in the <em>Michelotti </em>case, supra, the relator had been found guilty, on his plea, to several bills of indictment but was sentenced on only one. The court took no action to suspend or temporarily defer sentence on the other convictions but, after the term had passed, sought to impose sentence on one of the other bills. The Superior Court reversed, saying, in that connection, that “the court might have imposed at the time separate sentences on each bill of indictment or separate sentences on each count of a bill of indictment. Sentence, however, was limited to one bill of indictment, and the court’s power to sentence on such remaining indictments therefore expired with that term of court, no power to sentence thereon having been preserved by any action of the court.” The underlying reason why the court could no longer sentence on the remaining indictments was because it had. exercised its power within the term with respect to convictions of the defendant had during the term. Thereby its power in such connection was exhausted and it could not thereafter sentence the defendant on a prior conviction. The rationale of the <em>Nagle </em>case is indicated by its quotation from our opinion in <em>Moskowitz’s Registration </em>Case, <a href="/pa/329/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="329 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1181419" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0183-01">329 Pa. 183</a>, 190, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.%20498" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="196 A. 498">196 A. 498</a>, that “A court may not legally resentenee a criminal after the term has ended .... If it were permissible to amend, modify or revise sentences without this limitation the entire administration of criminal justice would be disrupted and manifest abuses would result.” In the matter of sentencing a convicted defendent, a court may not toy <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>with him by purporting to exercise its power to sentence and then later attempting to change the sentence or add a new one. It is for just such restraint that the end of the term makes for the complete finality of the original sentence or judgment. But, a court is authorized to sentence a convict once regardless of the expiration of the term at which the conviction was had.</p>

No action was taken on the others, nor was sentence thereon deferred or suspended. The court attempted at a later term to impose sentence on one of these other bills. The Superior Court unanimously held, in a per curiam opinion, that such sentence was void, saying (p. 395, A. p. 176) : “Belator was sentenced on one bill of indictment, and on the others to which he at the same time pleaded guilty the court took no action whatsoever. He was not remanded and held for sentence on the other bills, nor was sentence thereon suspended or temporarily deferred. The court might have imposed at the time sep<a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>arate sentences on each bill of indictment or separate sentences on each count Of a bill of indictment. Sentence, however, was limited to one bill of indictment, <em>and the court’s power to sentence on such remaining indictments therefore expired with that term of court, no power to sentence thereon having been preserved by any action of the court.” </em>(citing cases). The majority opinion asserts that the only reason for this decision was that the court, having sentenced on one bill of indictment, had so exhausted its power that it could not sentence after the term even on an entirely different bill. But can it really be seriously argued that if a defendant pleads guilty to two bills of indictment, one charging, let us say, rape, and the other robbery, and the court imposes sentence on one of those bills, it thereby exhausts its sentencing power so as to prevent it, <em>for that reason, </em>from thereafter imposing sentence on the other? The Superior Court did not decide the <em>Nagle </em>case on the basis of any such obvious absurdity. Its decision rested solely upon the fact, <em>as it expressly and clearly stated, </em>that “the court’s power to sentence on [the] remaining indictments . . . expired with that term of court, <em>no power to sentence thereon having been preserved by any action of the court.” </em>If the ratio decidendi had been (as the majority opinion would have it) that the sentence on the one bill had exhausted the power, <em>no action of the court could have preserved the power </em>by suspending or deferring the sentence, and the Superior Court certainly would not have suggested that that could have been done.</p>

There the trial court had sentenced the relator on six bills of indictment, but, during the same term, it revoked and vacated the sentences. It did not suspend or defer sentence or remand relator to be held for sentence, but nevertheless it attempted at a later term to impose sentences on those bills. We held that such sentences were illegal, saying (p. 543, A. p. 892) : “We are unanimously of opinion that the learned Superior Court was in error in their conclusion that the sentences here involved were legal. The court below sentenced relator on each of the six bills of indictment and, in the same session, revoked and vacated each sentence. <em>Nothing appears of record to show that the court did anything to preserve its power to resentence. It could have availed itself of this right by suspending or deferring sentence or remanding relator to be held for sentence. Falling so to do, its power of resentence expired with the session of court.” </em>(citing cases).</p>

This contention, however, entirely disregards the fact that the sentences had been revoked and vacated during the same term in which they had been imposed and therefore there were no sentences in existence at all at the expiration of the term; hence the case was not one of an attempt to “resentence” in the sense of amending or adding to an-.existing previous sentence but only in the sense of <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>imposing a sentence where a previous one had been validly cancelled and voided during the original term. If our decision were, as the majority opinion argues, explainable on the theory that the later sentences were resentences of sentences originally imposed we would not have said, as we did, that the trial court could have preserved its power by suspending or deferring sentence or remanding relator to be held for sentence, because, as I have pointed out above in regard to the <em>Nagle </em>case, the law is clear that if the later sentences were resentences, they could not have been imposed even if the court had tried to preserve its right to impose them by suspending or deferring senteuce. The <em>Michelotti </em>case is, in my opinion, as clear, as explicit, and as conclusive an authority, therefore, as any decision could possibly be, that, where no sentence on a bill of indictment is in existence at the time of the expiration of the term, and sentence has not been suspended or deferred, a sentence thereafter cannot lawfully be imposed.</p>

Docket, Western District, where, in a unanimous per curiam opinion, we said: <em>"Where a court does not sentence a defendant and does nothing to preserve its power to later sentence, it does not have the power to sentence the defendant at a subsequent term of court.” </em>In that case there was no sentence imposed during the original term and there was no order deferring or suspending sentence; we held, therefore, that a sentence imposed at a subsequent term was illegal and had to be vacated. Here there was no possible question of any "resentence” or alteration of a sentence after the term, since <em>no </em>sentence had ever been imposed. The majority opinion seeks to. distinguish this" case by stating that the reason why the court had imposed no sentence during the original term was because of special circumstances at<a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>tending the defendant’s plea of guilty to the indictments, the “special circumstances” being that the relator had been accepted for military service. I fail to perceive how the wholly irrelevant circumstance of the court’s motive — whatever it may have been — for not imposing sentence during the original term can furnish an explanation of our reason for denying it the power to impose sentence at a subsequent term. The only reason for our decision was — and we stated it in the clear and unambiguous language already quoted — that <em>“Where a court does not sentence a defendant and does nothing to preserve its power to later sentence, it does not have the power to sentence the defendant at a subsequent term of court ”</em>

The Superior Court properly decided the present case in conformity with those decisions, and it may be pointed out that even Judge IIirt, in his dissenting opinion, said (<a href="/pa-super/166/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="166 Pa.

But the trial court did not impose sentence even in the term in which the relator’s rule for a new trial was finally discharged.</p>

The majority opinion suggests that “For any unnecessary delay in thé sentencing, of an incarcerated defendant, a petition for habeas corpus is the efficient means for correcting the abuse.” But what would be the standard by which a court could determine whether there was any “unnecessary delay” in imposing sentence? Such a- phrase would furnish no definite guide whatever for application to any given case for determining the maximum time within which sentence must be imposed, whereas the fixed terms of court provide exact time-compartments in which even civil, a fortiori criminal, business of the courts must, subject to well recognized exceptions, be transacted.</p>
