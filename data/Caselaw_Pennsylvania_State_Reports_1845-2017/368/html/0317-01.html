Defendant entered into á <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>contract with plaintiff’s employer, an independent contractor, dated June 15, 1946, under which plaintiff’s employer agreed to “thoroughly scrape free of all loose and scaling particles ... all metal work ... including the fire escape” and to paint it with two coats of paint. Plaintiff was a foreman painter who was given charge by his employer of doing this job with three assistants. He testified that he was an expert in rigging and in scraping and in painting iron work, structural iron work, fire escapes and things of that sort; that he was familiar with the whole building trade, including fire escapes, from a boiler room to the finest home ever built in Philadelphia; that the manner of doing the work was left entirely up to him and that neither the defendant nor anyone except plaintiff’s boss had any control over him.</p>

On October 15th he commenced work around 8 o’clock in the morning and exactly what happened thereafter is not as clear from the evidence as it should be. The following is a virtually verbatim summary of the pertinent testimony. Plaintiff testified that in order to find out what the conditions or situation was so that he could properly paint it, it was necessary to scrape the fire escape; that he might find that the wood or some of the iron was rotten after scraping it and that you could not paint over rust — you had to scrape rust before you painted it. <em>The drop, </em>erroneously called counter-balance, which is that part of the fire escape which is dropped and extends to the ground, <em>was down. Plaintiff had walked up the fire escape that morning. </em>With the help of one of his. assistants he placed a plank from the extension ladder to the counter-balance along the alleyway which was under the fire escape. The plank was between 15 and 18 inches wide and 20 or 22 feet long and weighed about 25 pounds. The counter-balance was 28 or 30 <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>inches wide. Plaintiff was working on the fire escape, cleaning, brushing and scraping it and had progressed to approximately 4 to 6 feet from the corner. He decided he needed some paint, turned around, <em>put Ms left hand on the outside rail, the rail gave way, </em>he grabbed with his right hand to hold on, fell head first, turned almost a complete somersault and landed on the sidewalk at a 30 degree angle.</p>
    <p id="b342-4" data-blocks='[["BL_342.4",342,[277,780,1156,364]]]'>The part of the fire escape from which he fell is approximately 4 or 5 feet long and ran parallel with the alley. It does not appear how high it was from the ground. The fire escape was made of steel pipe, pretty heavy, and about 2 inches wide. The counter-balance was made of steel and the handrail was a metal pipe about an inch wide.</p>
    <p id="b342-5" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[277,1172,1158,868]]]'>After plaintiff fell he did not lose consciousness. He saw some evidence of debris and found the uprights on the far corner leading down to the counter-balance. <em>The pipe was corroded and deteriorated at the bottom of the upright </em>and he observed some narrow holes in the pipe. Among the debris there were several screws which had no threads on. <em>Me did not see anything wrong with the upright before he touched the rail. </em>The only thing he did was to put his hand on the rail; he wouldn’t say he pushed it; it fell out; he lost his balance and went down. He had not been warned by anyone that the fire escape or any part of the building was in bad condition except that it needed paint; <em>neither defendant nor anyone knew, prior to the accident, that the fire escape or any part of the building was in bad or dangerous or defective condition.</em>

    <p id="b343-5" data-blocks='[["BL_343.4",343,[212,532,1150,1200]]]'>Plaintiff produced three witnesses who were working with him on this job, James E. Moran, Edmund Meyers, and Cecil Rutter. None of them saw the accident but each looked up when they heard plaintiff scream. After plaintiff was taken to the hospital Moran saw debris and pipes and a whole section of the fire escape which was missing; he saw the end upright and both rails on the ground, after they had hit the ground, and the force of the impact had knocked all the loose scales and things off; <em>the pipe was corroded, almost rusted through; in bad condition. </em>Then Moran examined the fire escape. “It was very corroded, and one part- — I went up, the inside rail right by the counterbalance, above the counter-balance, which would be on the inside wall, I gave a yank at it with my hand, and I pulled it away from the wall.” It was not part of the same line that went overboard when Miller fell but it was part of the same structure on the inside. The part or fastening Moran pulled away from the wall was very rusted; “Also, the wood it was fastened to was very poor. It was weatherbeaten, and these little screws had no hold at all in there, they just came right out.”</p>
    <p id="b343-6" data-blocks='[["BL_343.5",343,[212,1743,1151,596]]]'>Defendant’s theory of the accident is that which was set forth in Moran’s written statement made several weeks after the accident (viz. November 5, 1946), in which he blamed the plaintiff’s fall on the fact that when he and the plaintiff placed the plank over the railing of the fire escape, plaintiff put his weight against the rail and the railing gave way. However, the jury obviously believed Moran’s (very different) testimony at the trial and therefore his prior written statement cannot be considered by any Court on a motion for judgment n.o.v.</p>

On his return approximately three-quarters of an hour later he examined the part of the rail which had been attached to the fire escape ladder and which <em>was lying on the ground. </em>That part had sheared right off down where the joints are; then you could see the corrosion of the metal. The upright pipe was on the handrail probably in the middle of the section that was snapped off at the edge. Meyers did not see any other part of the fire escape on the ground except that piece of outside railing and it was the metal upright that broke off at the bottom.</p>

Blake, who was employed by Albert M. Greenfield &amp; Co., defendant’s real estate agent, to inspect fire escapes of properties in Philadelphia of which Greenfield &amp; Co. were the agents, and to report anything which needed correction. Both plaintiff and defendant, strange to say, relied on the inspector’s testimony. Blake was a maintenance inspector of buildings, external, internal, fire escapes and towers. He inspected the defendant’s fire escape sometime in <em>June 1946 </em>and again <em>in the middle of September 1946, </em>4 months and 1 month prior to the accident. He found nothing wrong with the building or the fire escape except that the exterior should be painted and he recommended that the exterior of the building be painted and the fire escape be scraped and <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>painted. Both in his inspection in June and in September he went up to the top of the building, came out through the fire tower, <em>walked down the fire escape, “looking for any loose l)Glts or broken rails or anything of that kind, put my hands on the rail at different places, </em>and if I find nothing loose, I do not recommend anything other than possibly to paint or a scrape job.” He especially tried the counter-balance to see if it would go down and come up. He inspected <em>the fire escape for safety and found it was in good condition and, </em>except for scraping and painting, <em>toas satisfactory and he was satisfied that if there had been a fire in that place the occupants could have escaped by way of the fire escape. </em>He looked for loose bolts or missing bolts or broken rails or anything of that kind; he saw some rust but no evidence of pitting. If he sees something that he thinks is pitted he takes out a double opener penknife and scrapes away the metal. He did not use his knife on either of these inspections because he didn’t see any reason to do that since he could tell or thinks he could tell with his eyes. There was no rust on the piece of the fire escape that was broken off and lying on the ground when he examined it the afternoon of the accident and no evidence of pitting at that particular point, but it looked like it had been a shearing <em>off of some </em>kind.</p>

So considered, the jury was clearly justified in finding from plaintiff’s proofs that the western end of the fire escape (a most important part at the turn leading to the drop) was in a weakened and dangerous state and that its condition, resulting from rust and gradual deterioration, ought to have been discovered and remedied by the owner-defendant. The house and fire escape thereon were old. It was described as an “antique” building. When one of the plaintiff’s witnesses immediately after the accident gave a yank at a handgrip on the inside wall of the building beside the ladder drop, it “pulled away”; it was “very rusted”; the wood to which it was fastened was “very poor”, “weatherbeaten” and the “screws had no hold at all in there, they just came right out.” The plaintiff testified that the railing that gave way was corroded and deteriorated at the base — “You could see small narrow holes. . .” in it. Screws that had apparently fallen with the railing “had no threads”. Moran, a fellow workman, testified that a whole section of the railing at the west end fell to the ground and that the upright referred to by plaintiff, and other parts of the railing were found to be “corroded, almost rusted through.” The other two fellow workmen testified to the same effect.</p>

Blake who said he had twice inspected the fire escape; that he looked for missing bolts, nuts or broken parts and apparently made a limited spot check of the railing. He stated that the fire escape was rusted and there was the possibility of pitting underneath. However, he did not scrape it at any point, stating that “I can tell, or at least I think I can tell with my eyes.” The trial judge in his charge left to the jury whether there had been a proper inspection.

The jury could well have found that under the circumstances this was entirely too casual an examination, and patently insufficient for a structure or instrumentality designed to carry safely persons in numbers, hurriedly escaping from fire. This inspector produced no reports of his inspections (although he stated he had made one in his first inspection in June) and apparently he was daily engaged in the inspection of numerous buildings. Indeed the jury could have found that no inspection had been made by him. They had the right to reject any and all oral evidence adduced by the defendant.

While descending the fire escape, one of its platforms gave way, causing the injuries sustained. The Court in upholding liability said at page 520: “To be sure the use which the defendant company directed should be made of it by the plaintiff, was not the ordinary office of a fire escape, but it was apparently not an improper use, and at any rate it was placed at the disposal of the plaintiff and his fellow workmen, by the express direction of the officer of the defendant company.

Photographs introduced into evidence demonstrate this and there was no contention by defendant that the plaintiff should have used other means. The only distinction between the <em>Newingham, </em>and the instant case is that in <em>Newingham </em>the defendant’s negligence was the failure to make an inspection, and here (if consideration is given to the witness Blake’s testimony) the failure to make a <em>proper </em>inspection — a distinction without difference.

The plaintiff inspected and tested the rungs or iron bars of a crude ladder in the inside of a chimney as he ascended and the Court held it to be apparent from his own testimony that he was testing the safety of the ladder for himself, and was relying upon his own judgment. When one of the bars pulled out and he fell to the bottom of the stack, he was held to have assumed the risk. In <em>Myers v. Edison Electric Illuminating Company, </em><a href="/pa/225/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="225 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="965330" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0387-01">225 Pa. 387</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=74%20A.%20223" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="74 A. 223">74 A. 223</a>, the danger arising from an uninsulated wire carrying electricity was held to be obvious and the risk of injury assumed by the plaintiff.

He assumed a risk that was incidental to the specific task undertaken. In <em>Nettis v. General Tire Company of Philadelphia, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/317/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="317 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="8845558" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0204-01">317 Pa. 204</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20A.%2039" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="177 A. 39">177 A. 39</a>, recovery was denied because although several ways of cleaning the windows of defendant’s building were available, plaintiff selected the most dangerous method.</p>

With this we cannot agree. The work called for was the painting only of the fire escape after the customary and necessary scraping and scaling. The contract covered the building and provided that “All the wood and metal work of the entire exterior front, sides and rear, including fire escape will be thoroughly scraped free of all loose and scaling particles, loose putty removed, and reputtied and receive two (2) coats of . . . paint . . It was an ordinary painting job of the entire premises. Plaintiff was to paint, not repair the fire escape, and he had a right to assume that it was in a sufficiently sound condition to permit its necessary use in the performance of his task. A fire escape from its very nature and the purpose which it serves must presumably be in safe condition for use at all times. The railing is a necessary component part, and, according to plaintiff’s testimony, he did not exert undue pressure upon it. He said that he did not push against it and apparently was using it in a customary manner. It is to be noted that he had scraped the major portion of the fire escape without encountering any serious or dangerous corrosion, and was not engaged in scraping or painting when the accident happened, but on his way to obtain some paint for a fellow workman who was standing on the fire escape cleaning window frames. The situation was no different than if the railing had collapsed when he first went on the fire escape to commence his work.</p>

Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company, </em><a href="/pa/339/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="339 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1201249" data-case-paths="/pa/339/0033-01">339 Pa. 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.2d%2019" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="13 A.2d 19">13 A. 2d 19</a>, in support of a contention that plaintiff failed in his proof of negligence in that no evidence was adduced establishing that his employer, an independent contractor, was not informed by defendant of the defective condition of the <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>fire escape. This Court held in that case that where an employe of an independant contractor sued the owner of a building in an action in trespass for injuries resulting from the maintenance of a <em>known </em>dangerous condition that the burden of proving that the owner failed to warn the independent contractor of the dangerous condition was upon the plaintiff. Where the owner has actual knowledge of the existence of a dangerous condition, he is not required to warn every subcontractor or laborer who comes upon the premises, but in such circumstances the extent of the duty is to warn the contractor of the existence of the dangerous conditions. See <em>Engle v. Reider, </em><a href="/pa/366/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="366 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="8845631" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0411-01">366 Pa. 411</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20621" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="77 A.2d 621">77 A. 2d 621</a>. Where the owner is aware of the dangerous condition, the law with regard to the burden of proof is clear. The instant case, however, is clearly distinguishable from <em>Valles v. Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company, </em>supra, and <em>Engle v. Reider, </em>supra, in that there was no proof of actual knowledge by the owner of the alleged dangerous condition. There was no proof of actual knowledge and defendant’s liability exists by reason of the finding of the jury that he would have known if a reasonable and proper inspection had been made.</p>

Reider, </em>supra, has never been held by this Court to apply to cases other than those in which the owner had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition. A recovery by plaintiff in the instant case was not dependent upon proof of a failure by defendant to notify plaintiff’s employer, Kooperman, of the defective condition of the fire escape.</p>
