After preliminary objections were dismissed to the complaint which asked for an injunction against defendants restraining them from interfering with the seniority rights of the plaintiffs and their employment and asking for damages for previous interference, a hearing was held, findings of fact were made by the Chancellor, President Judge Valentine, and an order was made dismissing the bill of complaint.</p>

All are machinists, and were members of the defendant Union. In February, 1945, plaintiff Martin F. Haefele, was upgraded to the position of foreman in this plant. In September, 1947, the other two plaintiffs were also upgraded to foremen. Because of a recession in business conditions all three plaintiffs were dismissed as foremen on June 15, 1949. They did not remain members of the Union when they became foremen. Due to the ob<a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>jections of the defendant Union none of the plaintiffs have been reemployed by the company as machinists and the Union by official action has denied them membership.</p>
    <p id="b47-4" data-blocks='[["BL_47.5",47,[197,543,1150,429]]]'>Plaintiffs’ position is that by reason of seniority rights they were entitled to be employed as machinists when they were downgraded. In support of this position they contend that when they were upgraded to the position of foremen they did not <em>lose </em>their previously acquired seniority rights. They do not take the position that the time spent as foremen counted toward their seniority.</p>
    <p id="b47-5" data-blocks='[["BL_47.6",47,[193,993,1152,472]]]'>The collective bargaining agreement executed between the Company and the Union provides as to seniority rights as follows: “Seniority shall cease upon (a) justifiable discharge; (b) voluntary quitting; (c) if the employee does not return to work within five days after written notice at address appearing on the Company’s records. The Company shall notify the Union at the same time the employee is notified to return to work.”</p>
    <p id="b47-6" data-blocks='[["BL_47.7",47,[196,1496,1150,814]]]'>The case turns on the proper construction of the ambiguous phrase “voluntary quitting.” In construing this phrase, a majority of the court regard as significant the finding of fact, which the court en banc added to those found by the chancellor, as follows: “20. During the negotiations for the collective bargaining agreements, the representatives of the Union proposed that a provision be inserted in the contract which would give a production worker, who was elevated to assistant or foreman, the right, in the event of a decrease m the personnel of the company, to resume his former employment as production worker and retain his seniority status. This was not assented to by the management of the company and no such provision was inserted in any of the contracts.”</p>

      <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>However, when the testimony on which this additional finding was based was introduced by defendants’ witness, the plaintiffs-appellants moved to strike it out as violating the parol evidence rule. Whereupon the learned Chancellor in his ruling said, “It is very clear, I think, that anything that occurred prior to the execution of that agreement doesn’t amount to anything as far as substantive evidence is concerned. Everything is in writing and all the negotiations are merged in the contract and I will allow Mr. Cann’s testimony to stand as purely historical to show what happened leading up to the contract.”</p>
    <p id="b48-5" data-blocks='[["BL_48.4",48,[235,990,1156,483]]]'>At the argument counsel for appellants stated, that misled by this ruling, he did not offer evidence to contradict or deny the testimony of defendants’ witness on this point. That the court en banc’s finding which treated the testimony as a substantive fact notwithstanding the Chancellor’s ruling, left him without opportunity to produce contradictory testimony. In the circumstances we cannot pass on the question raised because of the present state of the record.</p>

The paragraph in question of the contract of January 1, 1943 and of the collective bargaining agreement of October 17, 1945 is short and clear: “Seniority shall cease upon (a) justifiable discharge; (b) <em>voluntary quitting; </em>(c) <em>if the employee does not return to work</em>

Yet that would be the effect if an employee’s promotion was interpreted to be a “voluntary quitting of his employment.” There is, in my judgment, no ambiguity in the language of the contract or of the collective bargaining agreement and <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>therefore no evidence of the prior negotiations between the union and the employer is admissible: <em>Grubb v.
