Mr. Justice, later Chief Justice Schaffer, in Ms opinion, after calling attention to the provisions of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, said (page 490) : “The governing principle is accurately stated in 20 Corpus Juris, 566, ‘There need not be an actual, physical taking, <em>but any destruction, restriction or interruption of the common and necessary use and enjoyment of property in a lawful manner may constitute a talcing </em>for which compensation must be made to the owner of the property.’ ”</p>

A principle of questionable constitutionality should not be extended beyond its present application or limitation especially if such extension would violate either the letter or the spirit of the Constitution. “The law as to what constitutes a taking has been undergoing a radical change during the last few years. Formerly it was limited to the actual physical appropriation of the property or a divesting of title, but now the rule adopted in many jurisdictions and supported by the better reasoning is that when a person is deprived of any of certain rights in and appurtenant to tangible things, he is to that extent deprived of his property, and his property may be taken, in the constitutional sense, though his title and possession remain undisturbed; ‘and it may be laid down as a general proposition, based upon the nature of property itself, that, <em>whenever the lawful rights of an individual to the possession, use or enjoyment of his land are in any degree abridged </em>

Whenever a law deprives the owner of the beneficial use and free enjoyment of his property, or imposes restraints upon such use and enjoyment that materially affect its value, without legal process or compensation, it deprives him of his property, within the meaning of the constitution! All that is beneficial in property arises from its use and the fruits of that use, and whatever deprives a person of them deprives him of all that is desirable or valuable in the title and possession. It is not necessary, in order to render a statute obnoxious to the restraints of the constitution, that it must, in terms or in effect, authorize an actual physical taking of the property or the thing itself, so long as it affects its free use and enjoyment, or the power of disposition at the will of the owner.”,</p>

If it desires plaintiffs’ land for a park or playground which it considers desirable or necessary for its future progress, it can readily and lawfully obtain this land in accordance with the Constitution which, we repeat, is the Supreme Law of the land. The Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of Pennsylvania empower the city to take and appropriate private land for public purposes. <em>All that is required is that just compensation be paid therefor. </em>.We do not propose that our Federal or State Constitution shall be disregarded or nullified either directly or by subterfuge, even though the purposes and objectives of a legislative act are worthy and sincerely believed to be in the best public interest.</p>
