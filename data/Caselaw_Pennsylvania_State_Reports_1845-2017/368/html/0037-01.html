The other defendants are the president and shop chairman of the union, the American Arbitration Society which is the designated means of supplying arbitrators as provided in the arbitration clause of the aforementioned agreement, and the arbitrator to whom the dispute hereinafter mentioned was referred.</p>

On August 10, 1948, and for some days later (21 to 22 days), because of lack of orders, the company was compelled to lay off between 800 and 1088 employees. On August 24, 1948, defendant shop chairman filed a grievance, No. A-575, reading as follows: “Due to the fact that the Company has laid off employees out of line of seniority the Union demands that the Company compensate all these employees for all wages lost until such time as these employees are reinstated on their jobs in line with their seniority. This is a violation of the agreement between the Company and the Union.” <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>This grievance was denied on August 31, 1948, because no list of employees claiming to be aggrieved was submitted with the “Grievance.”</p>

However, the company officials insisted on such a list being furnished and the Union officials just as insistently refused to supply it, although it may be said the large number of lay-offs, 800 to 1088 employees, probably made it impractical for the Union to do more than request the company to permit it to compile such a list from the company’s own records. However that may be, the Union on February 23, 1949, served the plaintiff with a demand for arbitration pursuant to Sec. 11 of Article 7, which reads: “Section 11. In the event any dispute shall not have been settled by the foregoing grievance procedure and the Union desires to submit the grievance to arbitration, it shall, within sixty (60) days from the date of the final decision under the grievance procedure, give written notice to the Factory Manager of its intention to refer the grievance for decision by an arbitrator. Upon the giving of such notice, either party may call upon the other party to meet for the purpose of selecting an arbitrator by mutual agreement. If at such meeting the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, then the grievance shall be referred for decision to an arbitrator selected in the following manner: . . ,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Thereafter, in accordance with the provisions' of Sec. 12 of the Agreement, L. G. Lichliter was selected as arbitrator and fixed a time and place for a hearing.

It means in effect that the American Arbitration Association does not arbitrate, but that it is the medium through which arbitration is secured. This is made clear in a later paragraph of the same letter in which it is stated that the arbitrator himself will decide the arbitrability of the particular grievance.</p>

The court below also stated that plaintiff contended that under Article 7, Section 10, upon failure to furnish a list of the names the grievance is considered settled and therefore no grievance existed for submission to arbitration. It is argued that this statement of the court below was a misconception of the purpose of the bill and proofs and that plaintiff does not contend there was any technical default but a deliberate refusal of the Union officials to supply the list of names demanded. What plaintiff seeks is a decision on the question whether the supplying of this list is a prerequisite to the consideration of the grievance and to make it arbitrable. But we see no real distinction between the statement of what the learned court below viewed as the question to be determined and what counsel contends is the question, for we agree with the court’s interpretation of .the agreement which is that whether the grievance has been presented in the proper form, whether the plaintiff has the right to refuse to consider it until it obtains the list demanded, and whether the points' raised are arbitrable at this time, are all questions for the arbitrator.</p>
