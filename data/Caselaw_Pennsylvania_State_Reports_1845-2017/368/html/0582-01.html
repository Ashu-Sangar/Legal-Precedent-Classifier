The complaint charged negligence on the part of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company from whom the radiator was purchased. Sears brought in as additional defendants, Martha K. Harrison and George D. Shields, trading as Harrison-Shields, the carriers who delivered the radiator.</p>

The learned court below refused Sears’ motion for judgment n.o.v. but granted the motion of the plaintiffs for a new trial as against both original and additional defendants. From this action of the court below both Sears, original defendant, and Harrison-Shields, additional defendants, took the appeals now before us. .</p>

The contract provided that a separate licensed contractor would install said materials and that Sears would not install the heating system but that by acceptance of the proposal the purchaser agreed to employ the named contractor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The contract did, however, contain but one price which included the materials, delivery of the materials and their installation.</p>

Each radiator was placed by the driver with his helpers in the rooms that were designated on tags attached by Sears to the radiators. The radiator which caused the injury was placed in an upright position in front of the window of plaintiffs’ dining room on the second floor of their house by Harrison-Shields employees where it stood for two days.</p>

Danner was the driver of the truck owned by Harrison-Shields that made the delivery. He stated he had picked up the load of eight radiators at Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company on August 14 on a Bill of Lading issued August 12, and that he delivered them by placing them underneath windows in the rooms indicated on the tag attached to each radiator; that after delivery, Mrs. Potanko signed the Bill of Lading; that he had three helpers on his truck, all employees of Harrison-Shields and that no one was there to direct him where to place the radiators but he put them under the windows because, ‘They always wanted it under the windows’ where he had placed them for the last nine or ten years.</p>

The most that can be said is the Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company requested inside delivery and designated the rooms in which they were to be placed; and if we interpret Mr. Danner to mean Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company when he said, ‘They wanted them under the windows’ that would mean that Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company requested that they be placed under windows in the respective rooms. There is no evidence that Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company requested that the radiators be set up in any way or manner. Under all the evidence it therefore, must be concluded that Harrison-Shields, through its agent Danner, was wholly responsible for the manner the radiator was set up, whether upright or on its side, whether secure or insecure.</p>

In fact, the jury was instructed that since the Bills of Lading provided for ‘inside’ delivery: ‘Their (Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company) supervision and control over the equipment, of course, had been transferred to this carrier as an independent agency from the time at least when it was delivered to the carrier until, in turn, it was delivered to the premises <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>of Potanko.’ It is recognized that the meaning to be applied to the instructions ‘Inside delivery’ was left to the jury but under the evidence as we have just discussed it, we now are of the opinion that under any interpretation Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company is not responsible for the manner in which the radiator was left, regardless of location.</p>

Despite the fact that such slope was not noticed either by the employees of the additional defendants or the father plaintiff, it was for the jury to say whether the slope should have been discerned and whether it was negligence to place a heavy unsecured radiator in an upright position on such a slope.
