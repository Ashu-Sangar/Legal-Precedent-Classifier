The chancellor, after hearing, dismissed the bill. The case turns on two narrow questions: Had the plaintiff’s trade name or trade-mark acquired a special or secondary meaning; and if so, was defendant’s name or practices so similar to plaintiff’s as reasonably likely to confuse or deceive the public?</p>

It has advertised its products extensively nationally, as well as locally in Allegheny County. Defendant was engaged in the business of selling and installing building materials and equipment, bathroom fixtures, and, since March 1949, has sold aluminum awnings. The name “Cool-Ray” was adopted by the manufacturer and both it and the defendant knew of KoolVent. awnings prior to the adoption of the name “Cool-Ray”. Defend<a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>ant advertises Cool-Ray awnings locally in newspapers, periodicals and brochures. Other metal awnings of similar design and construction are advertised for sale in Allegheny County under various names, such as “Breeze”, “Breezeway”, etc. The prefix “cool” or “kool” is widely used. It appears from Thomas’ Register of American Manufacturers, that the word <em>“Koolhomé” </em>was registered as a trade name in connection with <em>awnings in IDJjO, </em>although never sold in Allegheny County; the word “Coolvent” has been used by manufacturers of attic fans; “Cool Vent” by manufacturers of piston rings; and “Cool-A-Vent” was registered as a trademark for window ventilators in 1939. There are more than fifty other products patented with the name “Cool” or “Kool” as a prefix or part of a name, which are in use in other parts of the country.</p>

The names do not look or sound alike and create no confusion. The first letter is of course different; the form of the letter is different, one being block and the other script; the word “KoolVent” has a mark over the top of each word; the word “Cool-Ray” is hyphenated; and they neither appear nor are pronounced nor sound alike. “The word ‘Cool’ is appropriate for and commonly used in the sale of awnings, regardless of type or substance.” The word “cool” is a generic word of common and widespread usage; “both [names or trade-marks] suggest a quality generally applied to awnings, i.e., coolness. However, this feature is distinguishable by the last part of each name; vent indicating that the coolness is by ventilation and ray indicating that the awning itself cools the sun’s rays without indicating in what particular way this is accomplished.” There is a high degree of care exercised by purchasers of each product, since the articles are <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>expensive and are bought only after negotiation, measurements, and considerable attention.</p>

      <em>Quaker State Oil v. Steinberg </em>is on its facts the closest authority to the present case and rules it in favor of the defendant.

For that is the generic term of the article, which describes it with a fair degree of accuracy; and is the term by which the biscuit in pillow-shaped form is generally known by the public. Since the term is generic, the original maker of the product acquired no exclusive right to use it. . . . But to establish a trade name in the term ‘shredded wheat’ [and hence a special or secondary meaning] the plaintiff must show more than a subordinate meaning which applies to it. <em>It must shoto that the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer. </em>This it has not done.”</p>
