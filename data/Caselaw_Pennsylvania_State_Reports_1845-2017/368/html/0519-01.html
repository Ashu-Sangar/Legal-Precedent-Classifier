The appellant is also the administrator and surviving tenant by entireties of a property at 348 N. Third Street, in Erie.</p>
    <p id="b543-4" data-blocks='[["BL_543.4",543,[220,493,1149,543]]]'>At the audit the appellant sought contribution from decedent’s estate of one-half of five obligations paid by him. Four of these arose out of the ownership of the entireties property and the other out of a bailment lease for a Frigidaire. The learned court below disallowed all five claims. As we have concluded there was error in so doing as to some of these claims, it becomes necessary to review each one separately. The facts being without dispute, the liability of the estate depends upon the proper application of the relevant principles of law.</p>

The first claim is for one-half of the balance due on a purchase money mortgage of $4,000 executed by the appellant and the decedent at the time the mortgagors acquired title as tenants by entireties to the real estate on which it was secured, viz., 348 N. 3rd St., Erie. The mortgage and accompanying bond, jointly executed, are payable in instalments of $40.00 per month, and the balance due at the time of decedent’s death, December 16, 1947, was $3,667.57. This sum was paid by the appellant and he sought to recover one-half thereof from the estate of his joint obligor. The learned court, holding that such claim could only be made against the estate if the equity in the mortgaged property was insufficient to discharge the obligation secured thereon (a situation absent in the instant case), dismissed the claim. This disallowance we conclude is error.</p>

In so ruling, Mr. Justice Horace Stern cogently said, (p. 206) “It is wholly immaterial that the mortgaged property, passing to the wife as surviving tenant by the entireties, did not constitute one of the assets of decedent’s estate. The controlling fact is that he, together with his wife, was personally liable on the bond; that liability continued after his death and therefore constituted a debt of his estate .... Prima facie the payment of an indebtedness by one of two or more joint obligors is for the benefit of all, and the one making the payment is therefore entitled to contribution from the others.” (p. 207)</p>

The next claim was based on a judgment note in favor of White Star Roofing Company for $467.97, dated August 1, 1947, signed by both the appellant and decedent. The balance due = at the time of death was $428.97, which was paid by the husband appellant after wife’s death and one-half, viz., $214.48, is now claimed from the wife’s estate. In absence of any proof or agreement that the surviving spouse agreed to be <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>solely responsible this claim falls in the same category as the bond and mortgage and must be allowed.</p>
    <p id="b545-4" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[204,432,1149,591]]]'>3. Similar in character is another claim presented upon the assignment of Associate Discount Company of the promissory note signed November 11, 1947, in the amount of $154.20, also signed by both appellant and decedent. The note is payable to the order of the Storm Seal Company and by it assigned to the Associate Discount Company and by the latter assigned to the appellant. This claim must also be allowed to the extent of one-half thereof, viz., $77.10, for the same reason that the mortgage bond obligation and the White Star Roofing claim were allowed.</p>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.5",545,[208,1034,1148,979]]]'>4. The appellant next presented a claim in the amount of $1,621.22, on a note originally held by the Security Peoples Trust Company. In neither the adjudication nor the opinion dismissing exceptions is there a clear statement of the facts relating to this claim. From the undisputed testimony it appears that during the lifetime of the decedent, Neth and Company wrote to the appellant (individually) under date of September 15, 1949, a proposal to install a gas furnace and ducts in the entireties property. It was to be financed by an F. IT. A. loan through the Security Peoples Trust Company to which a credit application was made in the name of the appellant, again individually, but signed by <em>both </em>appellant and decedent. Neth’s salesman, through whom the application was made, testified in explanation that where property is owned by husband and wife, F. H. A. requires both signatures to the application.</p>

When the work was completed, the appellant (again individually) signed a judgment note dated January 5, 1948, and the money was then paid by the trust company to the contractor, Neth and Company. Neth <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>and Company made no claim against the estate. They were paid by the trust company out of money which it loaned to appellant on the judgment note signed by him <em>alone. </em>Two years later appellant paid off the loan together with the financing expenses, took an assignment from the trust company of the note and presented a claim for one-half thereof at the audit.</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[230,712,1158,875]]]'>The burden of proof ©f this claim is of course upon appellant. In the face of the proposal made to and accepted by the appellant individually, we cannot infer that the deceased wife had contracted jointly "with her husband to pay for this furnace when installed merely because she signed the credit application along with her husband. The most that can be inferred from the wife’s signing the application is an expressed willingness to pledge her credit along with that of her husband if and when the loan was granted. But before the loan was granted, she had, in the meantime, died, and the loan was then actually granted to the appellant alone upon an obligation signed by him alone. The situation is therefore clearly different from other claims just reviewed and we hold the court below was correct in refusing to allow this claim.</p>

Finally a claim was made by appellant for one-half of a balance of $200.59, due for unpaid rent instalments of a bailment lease for a Frigidaire signed by both the appellant and the decedent. This claim we conclude was properly disallowed because under the terms of the bailment lease title to the Frigidaire did not pass until all of the rent was paid: <em>Leitch v. Sanford Motor Truck Co., </em><a href="/pa/279/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="279 Pa. 160" data-case-ids="1083418" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0160-01">279 Pa. 160</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20658" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="123 A. 658">123 A. 658</a> (1924); <em>Decker v.

The payments thus made by the ap<a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>pellant were solely for his own benefit and in order to secure title to the property leased.
