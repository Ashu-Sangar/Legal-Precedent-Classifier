    <p id="b440-9" data-blocks='[["BL_440.14",440,[236,1288,1158,865]]]'>The three appeals are by a father and his two sons (plaintiffs) from a. judgment by the court below sustaining preliminary objections to the complaint and amendment in trespass for false arrest, in a criminal proceeding instituted by a husband and wife (defendants). The grand jury returned a true bill. Upon trial the defendants (plaintiffs herein) were acquitted and the costs were imposed on the prosecutors (defendants herein). The court below, <em>as matter of law, </em>decided that there existed probable cause for thé criminal prosecution. It reached this conclusion solely upon the ground that the grand jury had returned a true bill. In entering the judgment sustaining the preliminary objections of defendants to plaintiffs’ complaint, the court stated that its decision was based “. . . alone on the return of the Grand Jury.” The appeals followed.</p>

Ward and Catherine S., his wife, in 1949 were owners of land adjoining land owned by plaintiff, Earl Byers. It was claimed by the Wards <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>that coal under their land had been illegally removed by Earl Byers and his two sons (plaintiffs herein). Defendants caused warrants to be issued for the arrest of the plaintiffs, charging them with stealing the coal.</p>
    <p id="b441-5" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[198,554,1150,760]]]'>The plaintiffs’ complaint in trespass charged that the arrests were made without just or probable cause. In addition to the above facts, it is stated in the complaint: “The plaintiff further avers that all of said prosecution was brought without any just or probable cause and wholly without any basis or reason, and defendants used the processes of the criminal law for the purpose of forcing the plaintiff to give the defendants a Lease upon the coal on plaintiff’s land for mining and stripping purposes at a price of ten cents (10(5) a ton when he was receiving for himself on the farm immediately adjoining plaintiff, the sum of twenty-five cents (25(5) a ton for his coal which was being stripped.”</p>
