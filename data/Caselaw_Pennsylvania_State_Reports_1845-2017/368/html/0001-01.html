On July 29, 1945 a number of freight cars whose contents were consigned to the Ordnance Depot were hauled from the railway yard to the Ordnance Depot on tracks <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>running into the latter by a diesel engine owned by the Federal Government and operated by its employes. On July 30, 1945, the decedent with several other men in the employ of the Ordnance Depot went to unload one of the cars belonging to the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, and which had moved under load from Stapleton, Staten Island, New York over four railroads, the Staten Island Rapid Transit, Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Reading Company and the defendant. One of the doors of this car was opened in order to take out the shipping papers, but they could not be reached from that door and, therefore, the door on the other side of the car was opened. Both doors were sealed and the seals intact. After breaking the seals on the second door, it was opened approximately 18 inches or 2 feet. It was necessary to open the door farther to obtain the papers, and the decedent took hold of the handle on the car door and started to push it farther open. As he was doing this the door, which weighed approximately 500 or 600 pounds, fell out and onto the decedent who was so seriously injured that he died the same day. On the day before, July 29, 1945, the car was inspected by a car inspector in the employ of the defendant.</p>

The door was a corrugated iron door which had rollers at the bottom. The rollers operated on an iron track or a bar attached to the car and the door was held in place by curved irons which hooked under and up around the lower track. At the upper part of the door was a Z-bar attached to the car which formed a groove or channel about one and a half inches deep and one and a half inches wide in which the door was supposed to slide. <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>The Z-bar was to keep the door from falling outwards, and the door had several small guides of iron which rode on the outside of the Z-bar, preventing the door from falling in and rubbing against the main structure of the car. At the side where the door closed there was about a two inch vertical flange or angle on the door post, the full height of the door opening, which came out at right angles to the car and then turned at right angles and ran parallel to the car an inch to an inch and a half out from it. This formed an offset or groove the full height of the door, known as a cinder guard or spark arrestor, because it prevented any sparks or cinders from entering the car, when the door was closed. The door fitted into this offset when closed and was held in place by a door lock which was sealed with the ordinary railroad seal. The door guides and tracks along the side of the car, beginning at the door post at which the door closed, extended and ran, respectively, along above and below the door opening and past it to the door stop on the car, which prevented the door from sliding beyond the tracks when opened, a distance of 12 feet, 5% inches. The width of the door was 6 feet 2% inches. The distance from the top of the bottom rail, on which the door rollers rested, to the bottom of the upper guide or Z-bar behind which the door was supposed to slide, was slightly different at different places as the upper rail, for some distance, was bent up from % of an inch to a maximum of % of an inch and the lower rail at the rear door post was bent down or dented approximately % of an inch. We refer to the front door post as the door post on which the spark arrestor or cinder guard was placed, against which the door closed and the rear door post as the door post at the opposite side of the door opening. The plaintiff’s witnesses measured the size of the door and also the distance between the lower rail on which the door rollers ran and the lower part of the upper guide, that is, the open<a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>ing which existed between the lower edge of the guide or Z-bar at the top of the door and the track on which the door rollers ran. These measurements seem to have been very accurately made by the witnesses for the plaintiff, one of whom was a civil engineer. They are as follows: at the front door post, 8 feet, 7 inches, then at intervals of one foot measured from the front door post toward the door stops; at one foot the opening was 8 feet, 7% inches; at two feet — 8 feet, 7-3/16 inches; at three feet — 8 feet, 7-3/16 inches; at four feet — 8 feet, 7% inches; at five feet- — -8 feet, 7-3/16 inches; at six feet — 8 feet, 7% inches; at seven feet— 8 feet, 7 inches; at eight feet — 8 feet, 6% inches; at nine feet — 8 feet, 6% inches. It will be noticed that these measurements covered the space occupied by the door when closed up to a point where it was opened approximately three feet. The uncontradicted evidence in the case was that the door was opened approximately eighteen inches to two feet when the decedent started to push it farther back and it fell, therefore, these dimensions cover the location of the door at the time it fell. The door was also measured by the same persons called by the plaintiff, and they stated that on the side which fitted into the spark arrestor or cinder guard, it measured from the bottom of rollers to the top of the door 8 feet, 7 inches and at the opposite side 8 feet, 7% inches, a difference of % of an inch. The witnesses for the defense who measured the opening between the track on which the door rollers ran and the bottom of the Z-bar made two measurements, one at the front door post and one at the rear door post, and stated that both of these measurements were 103 inches or 8 feet, 7 inches. They measured the door and stated that it measured on both sides 103 inches or 8 feet, 7 inches. One of them testified that the lower rail or bar was bent down about a quarter of an inch at the rear door <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>post<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and that the top door rail was bent up from the back door post for a distance of three feet to the center of the door, <em>% </em>of an inch. ... It was also testified that the top <em>edge of </em>the door was slightly rubbed and not the upper part of the front side, which indicated that the top of the door was rubbing against the bottom of the upper rail or Z-bar. It is clear that when the door was in place, closed and locked, the front side of the door was held in place along its entire height by the cinder guard or spark arrestor on the front door post. It will be noticed that the height of the door was less than the opening between the track on which the rollers ran and the lower part of the upper guide or Z-bar from % to % of an inch, this discrepancy varying across its width of 6 feet, <em>2% </em>inches, except that at the front door post the door height and the opening were the same. There was testimony that standing on the ground, <em>with the door of, </em>and looking up at the upper guide, one could notice that the upper guide was bent upward. There was also testimony that <em>with the door in place on the car, </em>any slight opening between the top of the door and the lower edge of the upper guide or Z-bar could not be seen by a person standing on the ground, close to the car, as the top corrugation on the door was very close to the lower edge of the Z-bar and that ‘this door rail would not have been detected bent under ordinary inspection by any inspector.’" <em>There was no testimony in the ease that, when the door was closed, a person standing on the ground could see and recognize- the fact that the upper part of the door was not behind' the outside portion of the upper guide or Z-bar. </em>The door was not replaced on "the car immediately or shortly after the accident with the upper and lower door rails or guides.as they <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>were when the door fell off. There was testimony that the door was replaced some days later, August 11th, in the repair shop of the D.L. &amp; W. R.R., without anything being done to either the upper or lower guides and that it operated satisfactorily.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

The answer lies in the degree of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff as an employe of the consignee Ordnance Depot. It was the duty of the defendant to make a reasonable inspection of the car before delivery to the consignee. Was there a reasonable inspection? Under our cases and those of a majority of other, jurisdictions., it is settled that a railroad .company before delivering a loaded car received <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>from a connecting carrier to a consignee must make an inspection thereof sufficiently thorough to ascertain whether there is any <em>fairly obvious defect </em>in its construction or state of repair which constitutes a likely source of danger: <em>Dominices v.

There was ample uncontradicted evidence to show conclusively that the customary method used by railroads in inspecting cars was by an inspection from the ground, the inspector walking around the car and looking at the running gear, brake rigging and visual inspection of the body of the car and its doors. The inspection made by defendant’s inspector was in conformity with this standard. In the instant case, uncontroverted measurements demonstrated that when the door was shut and in place practically against the side of the car, the closing edge being in the cinder guard or spark arrestor, it was practically impossible for a person standing on the ground beside the car, looking at the door for defects, to see and recognize that the door for a distance was from % to % of an inch shorter than the space which it occupied. Especially was this true as the uppermost corrugation was close to the upper guide or flange which was approximately 6 feet above the head of a person 6 feet in height. As stated by the learned trial judge, only by an examination made from the top of the car or from a ladder placed on the ground which would enable án inspector’s eyes:to be on a level with such condition, or by opening the door, would such condition be apparent. There was no testimony that the door sagged or bulged in any way and, in fact, the uncontradicted testimony showed that, when unlocked, and the Seals removed, the door slid back 18 inches or 2 feet , in' a' normal manner.'</p>

While appellants insist that the evidence does not show that such inspectors inspected this particular car en route, since appellants charged only the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe with negligence, its liability must depend upon whether it discharged its duty in the premises. When trains were inspected, record was made by the inspector only of cars which were found to be defective, and the records of inspection of trains in which this car moved from the time it was loaded at Fort Worth to the time it was spotted for unloading at Temple, failed to show any defects discovered in the car. It is not controverted that inspections were made at Fort Worth, at Cleburne, and at Temple of the train which included the car in question; that same were made by competent and experienced inspectors under proper rules, regulations, and supervision of the railway company; and that same were made in the usual and customary manner. And we think it was clearly established that such inspections were made as carefully as the exigencies of the traffic would permit. The record also discloses, without substantial controversy, that the defect in question was a hidden defect. It consisted of an old break or crack on the inside of the hanger arm of the car door. This was not visible from an outside inspection except for a <em>small fractional part of an inch on one edge of the hanger bar where the break extended through to the outer edge. </em>As to doors, the inspection was made from the ground, and the hanger was just beneath the roof <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>of the car, some five or six feet above the inspector’s head. All those qualified to testify on the subject, after an inspection of the broken hanger arm which fell upon Pass, and the old break therein, testified that the defect could not have been discovered <em>except by a minute and very close inspection; </em>and some witnesses testified that it could have been detected <em>only by opening the door of the car </em>and examining the hangers from the inside.

We are of the opinion that any defects in the car door mechanism which caused it to fall upon the plaintiff’s decedent were not fairly obvious upon a reasonable inspection performed by a competent inspector, but were defects which could only be discovered and recognized as a likely source of danger by an inspection so minute and made in such a manner as to place an unreasonable burden on a connecting carrier receiving the car loaded and sealed.
