There were two tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Wolf’s Crossing, where the accident happened. The train was approaching on the far track. At that time and place there was <em>a thick fog. Red flasher lights were flashing on each side of the tracks. </em>The flasher signals were started by a railway device when the first wheels of a train passed over the relay which actuates the flasher lights approximately 3500 feet from the crossing. On the side from which the truck was approaching, the red <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>flashing signal was <em>68 feet </em>back from the center of the track on which the accident occurred.</p>

The bus was approximately 35 feet in length and the above mentioned 75 foot distance could have meant the distance between the front of the bus and the back of the truck, although there was also testimony by plaintiff’s witnesses that <em>the truck stopped short of the flashing lights </em>on the near side of the tracks.

Two of the plaintiff’s witnesses said they did not hear any train whistle, but the testimony of one of plaintiff’s witnesses, Thaddeus J. Tomalewski, was sufficient on this point. He testified he was listening for the train whistle because he used Wolf’s Crossing as a place for him to determine whether or not he could “lock out” his mail sacks or whether he would require assistance to get them ready in time for Dennison which was 4 or 5 miles from Wolf’s Crossing; and that for an interval of approximately 5 minutes before the accident a train whistle <em>did not blow. </em>The jury could have believed, therefore, that no whistle was blown.</p>
