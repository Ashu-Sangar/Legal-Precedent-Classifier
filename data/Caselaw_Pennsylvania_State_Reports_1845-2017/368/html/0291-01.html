At trial, he abandoned the cruel and barbarous treatment charge and rested his case on indignities in connection wherewith he proved, inter alia, an act of adultery on the part of the respondent. The learned trial judge entered a decree of divorce which, on appeal, the Superior Court unanimously affirmed (one judge being absent) : see <em>Phipps v.

Allen </em>the Superior Court had held that testimony of the respondent’s adultery “was not admissible on the charge of indignities and should have been disregarded even though in evidence without objection.” With such evidence thus excluded, the court was of the opinion that the libellant had not made out a case of indignities and reversed the decree in divorce which the trial court had granted. However, two members of the court, while concurring in the result reached by the majority, disagreed that the testimony <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>of the respondent’s adulterous act was inadmissible and pointed out (p. 383) that the Superior Court had consistently held “that a wife’s affair with another man, in itself, may constitute an indignity, and that conduct by a husband with respect to other women, although not sufficient to support a charge of adultery may be considered as a form of personal indignity to the wife rendering her condition intolerable and life burdensome”, citing, inter alia, <em>Blansett v.

The only reason contra advanced in the <em>Allen </em>case is that, by statute, adultery is made a separate and distinct ground for divorce and is of such gravity that, when established, prohibition of the marriage of the offending spouse to the paramour follows as a matter of legislative direction. Note was also made of the fact that a statute requires that the paramour be named in the libel and, as corespondent, be given notice of the charge and an opportunity to defend. But, neither the fact that adultery alone, when pleaded and proven, will justify a divorce nor the statutory provisions peculiar to such an action operate to deprive the adulterous conduct of its evidentiary value as relevant and material proof of an indignity. Cruel and barbarous treatment is also a separate ground for divorce, but evidence of the respondent’s physical violence toward and threats against the life of the libellant (viz., cruel and barbarous treatment) is relevant and material to, and may be used to sustain, a charge of indignities: see <em>Zonies v. </em>Zonies, <a href="/pa-super/151/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="151 Pa.

    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[186,496,1149,1364]]]'>We hold, therefore, that evidence of a respondent’s adultery is admissible on a charge of indignities. How far such evidence goes in helping to establish a <em>course of conduct, </em>requisite to sustaining a charge of indignities, is for the fact-finder to appraise subject, of course, to appellate review for legal sufficiency of the evidence. But, the evidence is admissible, nonetheless, even though it falls short of supporting a charge of indignities. What was said in <em>Allen v. Allen, </em><a href="/pa-super/165/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="165 Pa. Super. 379" data-case-ids="467331" data-case-paths="/pa-super/165/0379-01">supra,</a> in presently pertinent connection, was considerably retracted, if not entirely overruled, six months later by the Superior Court’s opinion in the instant case where, as we have already mentioned, evidence of an act of adultery by the respondent was held to be admissible on a charge of indignities. The Superior Court there correctly said (p. 625) — “Counsel for respondent . . . argue that you cannot establish indignities by proving adultery. If staying together in the same room at the hotel at Stroudsburg had been the only evidence of misconduct on the part of respondent, we would readily agree; but it was not.” The unanimity of the Superior Court in the instant case is peculiarly significant in view of the separate concurrence in the <em>Allen </em>case on the admissibility of evidence of the respondent’s adultery.</p>

Other misconduct of the respondent, as testified to, tending to prove indignities but which might have been extenuated as mere indiscretions or discounted as the imaginings of an overly suspicious or jealous spouse assumes its true import when pondered against the background of the respondent’s deliberate and flagrant unfaithfulness to the libellant. Thus, the evidence as a whole becomes capable of constituting, as a matter of law, indignities to the person of the libellant rendering his condition intolerable and his life burdensome which is to be determined objectively.</p>
    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[268,996,1159,1252]]]'>Nor was the respondent’s adulterous act any the less admissible because the libellant did not learn of it until after he had commenced his action in divorce, if such indeed be the actual fact. The importance of the evidence of adultery lies in its capacity as an aid to the fact-finder in appraising the respondent’s conduct in general with respect to her husband and her treatment of him. Its admissibility, in the circumstances here present, does not depend upon whether the libellant knew of it before the separation. Of course, if he did not then know of it, it was not a <em>direct </em>indignity such as where the innocent party comes upon his offending spouse <em>flagrante delicto. </em>In <em>Holbrook v.

His knowledge of the particular subject matter did not in any sense qualify as after-discovered evidence. What he knew and his whereabouts in Auburn, New York, where he was living with his natural father with his mother’s permission, were, of course, well known to her at the time of the divorce hearings. If she desired his testimony, it could have been taken by deposition when he refused to come to Scranton to testify. The hearings extended intermittently over a period of three months during which time Bradford spent the Christmas holidays in Scranton (although unknown to his mother) visiting at the home of friends. But, even if the proffered testimony, as forecast by Sweet’s affidavit and respondent’s petition to remit, were received in evidence, it would be merely cumulative of testimony of the respondent and her witness Martin in attempted refutation of Jean Kehrli, a witness for the libellant, whom the trial judge and the Superior Court justifiably accredited. Moreover, the unfilial reasons to which Sweet’s affidavit confesses as being the cause of his not having attended the divorce hearings tends to impeach his credibility which, no doubt, the Superior Court also took into consideration in rejecting the petition' to remit.</p>

    <p id="b328-5" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[236,486,1160,923]]]'>The decision of the trial judge was based almost entirely upon the alleged adultery of the defendant in Stroudsburg oh June 6, 1948. The Superior Court likewise placed tremendous importance upon this episode. Jean testified that at Mrs. Phipps’s direction she (aged 16) and Brad Sweet (son of Mrs. Phipps) occupied the room at the hotel with the twin beds, while Mrs. Phipps and the chauffeur slept in the room with the double bed. Of course this testimony was vigorously objected to by the defendant as inadmissible and hearsay. Jean’s testimony was contradicted by defendant and the chauffeur, both of whom testified that the defendant and the girl occupied one room while Brad and the chauffeur occupied the other. Brad did not testify. The trial judge believed Jean, although her subsequent conduct certainly cast considerable doubt on her credibility.</p>
    <p id="b328-6" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[235,1422,1157,648]]]'>Defendant presented a petition to the Superior Court requesting it to remand the record to the trial court for the purpose of taking the testimony of Brad Sweet who, according to the petition' and Brad’s attached affidavit, would testify to his mother’s innocence and that Jean and his mother occupied one room that night and he and the chauffeur the other room. Brad’s affidavit alleged in effect that libellant had bribed him not to testify and had also poisoned his mind against his mother by false stories and had induced him to keep out of the State'of Pennsylvania so that .he could not be. subpoenaed.</p>

If Brad’s accusations of bribery are true, plaintiff would not be entitled to a divorce and the decree in his favor would have to be set aside, even under the majority opinion which admits the testimony of Jean. The majority opinion does not discuss plaintiff’s alleged bribery; it merely describes Brad’s affidavit as cumulative evidence in favor of his mother and assumes that the Superior Court took this cumulative effect into consideration “in rejecting petition to remit”. Unfortunately for the majority’s assumption, the Superior Court did not dismiss defendant’s petition or even mention the petition or the affidavit at all. Even more unjustifiable, to put it mildly, is the majority’s assumption that the trial judge would disbelieve Brad and continue to believe Jean, although the trial judge had not seen Brad or heard his story.</p>
