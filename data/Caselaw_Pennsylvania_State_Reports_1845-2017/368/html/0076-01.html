      <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>The State Workmen’s Insurance Fund was created by the Act of June <em>2, </em>1915, P.L. 762. By section 3 of that Act it was provided that certain sums to be paid by employers should constitute a Fund for the purpose of insuring such employers against liability under article three of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915, and of assuring the payment of the compensation therein provided. Section 20 provided that any subscriber to the Fund, upon giving notice of an accident sustained by an employe in the course of his employment, should be discharged from all liability for the payment of compensation for the personal injury or death of such employe by such accident; and all such compensation due therefor, under article three of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915, should be paid out of the Fund. Section 21 provided that the Fund might be sued, in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, to enforce any right given to any subscriber under the Act.</p>

They engaged, in New Jersey, one Esther Gotkin as “camp mother”, who, on July 12, 1944, in the course of her employment at the camp, slipped on the steps of the mess hall and was injured. On June 20, 1945 she filed a claim petition for compensation with the Bureau of Workmen’s Compensation of the Department of Labor and Industry at Harrisburg, but allowed the claim to be dismissed on December 27, 1945 for want of prosecution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> On March 4, <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>1946 she filed a claim for compensation with the Workmen’s Compensation Bureau of the New Jersey Department of Labor at Trenton; on that claim she received an award upon which she recovered judgment in the former Supreme Court of New Jersey, and on appeal to the present Supreme Court of that State the judgment was affirmed (<a href="/nj/2/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 N.J. 305" data-case-ids="106643" data-case-paths="/nj/2/0305-01">2 N.J. 305</a>).

Conflict of Laws, §398.

The Fund agrees to pay, in the manner provided by the <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>said Workmen’s Compensation Act, all benefits due or to become due from this Insured Employer because of injuries by accident, sustained during the term of this Policy, . . . <em>for which the Employer may be or become liable under said Act.”</em>

The Fund expressly agreed to assume <em>that liability. </em>Of course, the Fund was obligated only, as the policy provides, to save plaintiffs harmless to the extent of such liability, and not to the extent of any judgment that might be recovered against them; plaintiffs admit that they are not entitled to recover from defendant the amount of the New Jersey judgment but only the compensation for which they were liable to the injured employe under the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Law. The fact that proceedings were instituted by Mrs. Gotkin in New Jersey is wholly irrelevant to the question of plaintiffs’ liability to her under the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Law. Of course, if there were any substantive difference between the terms of the New Jersey and the Pennsylvania Acts such that the recovery obtained by Mrs. Gotkin in the former State could not have been obtained in our own Commonwealth, — in other words, if plaintiffs were not liable to her for compensation under the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Law, certainly the Fund would not be obligated to them under the terms of the policy. But it is not questioned that such liability did exist and accordingly plaintiffs were under the duty of paying her compensation — whether or not she had brought proceedings in New Jersey — to at least the extent to which she was entitled under the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Law, and they did <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>in fact make such payment. We do not think it can be fairly inferred from the terms of the policy, or that the parties thereto could have contemplated, that the Fund assumed the obligation to save plaintiffs harmless only in case the injured employe instituted proceedings to recover compensation in Pennsylvania and not if, for some purpose of her own, she chose to proceed against plaintiffs in some other jurisdiction. Had such limitation of the Fund’s obligation under the policy been intended by the parties it could and should have been expressly inserted therein. The general rule is that where there is any question as to the proper construction of the terms of an insurance policy and the extent of the coverage intended thereby the doubt must be resolved in favor of the insured, and that rule applies as well to a policy issued by an instrumentality of the Commonwealth as to one issued by an ordinary insurance company. There is no such limitation in the Act constituting the Fund, and the broad provision of the Act that the insured “shall be discharged from all liability for the payment of compensation for the personal injury or death of such employe by such accident; and all such compensation due therefor, under article three of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915, shall be paid out of the Fund,” controls the policy issued under the Act and must be read into it and made the basis of its interpretation.</p>

That promise constituted a separate, distinct and independent obligation on the part of the Fund, and its liability or non-liability to pay a judgment that might be recovered in any such suit would not affect or limit its duty to <em>defend </em>the ;action. Failing to defend, as here it did, it became liable to plaintiffs for the - costs and fees which they were obliged to.spend in.making.their Own defense: <em>Zeitz v. </em>
