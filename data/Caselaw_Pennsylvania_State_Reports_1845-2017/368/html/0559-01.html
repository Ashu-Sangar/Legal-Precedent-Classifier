It should be noted that the Act of May 26, 1897, P. L. 95, codified the procedure under the earlier acts and provided expressly in Section 10 that in the issue framed thereunder the <em>claimant </em>shall be plaintiff and all other parties defendants. The Act of 1897, was later repealed and supplied by the Act of June 22, 1931, P. L. 883, 12 P. S. 2358-2377. Section 10 of that act (12 P.S. 2367) includes the same provision as that of the Act of 1897 as to who shall be plaintiff and who shall be defendant.</p>

Though even before this act and the acts above cited that expressly conferred interpleader jurisdiction at law, there were earlier cases which permitted interpleaders under the practice of administering equitable principles under <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>common law forms: see cases collected and referred to by President Judge Keller in <em>Fisher v.

In sheriffs interpleader, the acts required the claimant to be made the plaintiff and all other parties defendants in that issue. In other interpleaders the responsibility of determining who should be plaintiff and who should be defendant rested upon the court that <em>framed the issue </em>and not the trial judge. So far as equity interpleaders are concerned no issue was strictly necessary. The bill for interpleader was considered as putting the defendants to contest their respective claims and if the question between them was ripe for decision at the hearing the chancellor might proceed to decide it; if not he might direct an action or an issue as might best be suited to the nature of the case: <em>Bispham’s Principles of Equity </em>(eleventh ed.) p. 342; and see Equity Rule 61.</p>

      <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>Who in a given case should be plaintiff and who the defendant depended generally upon either the agreement of the parties or upon whom the burden of proof lay. Aside from sheriff interpleaders, contests most usually arose over proceeds of insurance, or concerning the ownership of property or money. In the first class where the contest arose between the beneficiary named in the policy and someone claiming adversely, the one claiming against the beneficiary would normally have the burden of proof and be made plaintiff and the beneficiary, defendant. This because the latter was entitled to rest in the first instance on the prima facie right established by his designation in the policy. However, where the contest was between parties claiming a fund deposited in court or property in possession of a third person, as a general rule each had the burden of proving his own claim thereto. The importance of determining the respective positions of the contestants was often lost sight of by counsel when the issue was being framed, and at times confused with the sheriff’s inter-pleader practice or failure to distinguish between the different classes of cases.</p>
    <p id="b587-4" data-blocks='[["BL_587.4",587,[209,1543,1149,815]],["BL_588.1",588,[270,337,1153,267]]]'>From this situation the confusion probably arose that worried the text writers concerning the burden of proof after the grant of the interpleader. In <em>Anderson’s Pa,. Civil Practice, </em>vol. IV, p. 477, it is said that the former practice was deemed unsatisfactory in that it gave the original plaintiff an unfair advantage by freeing him from the necessity of carrying the burden of proof. And in <em>Goodrich-Amram, Civil Practice, </em>section 2315-1, p. 94, it is said, “In some instances the original plaintiff became the plaintiff on the interpleader issue and the claimant became the defendant; in other instances the claimant became the plaintiff on the issue. This party alignment was of great importance under the prior practice for the party plaintiff on the issue had the burden of proof and his rival could recover <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>without proving his case if the plaintiff on the issue could not prove his. This gave the defendant on the interpleader issue an unfair advantage and was an incentive to litigants to seek to out-maneuver each other to gain this tactical advantage.”</p>
    <p id="b588-4" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[266,613,1157,972]]]'>This then was the situation which the Pa. Rules of Civil Procedure sought to eliminate. Each claimant is made an alternative plaintiff who must prove his claim regardless of the default of his rival. It is therefore of no importance whether one or the other of the claimants is first to present the proof of his claim. The comment in Goodrich-Amram to Section 2304 is to the effect that the order on the claimant to join as a party plaintiff does not mean that the original plaintiff and the claimant become joint plaintiffs. Their status is really <em>plaintiffs in the alternative </em>and as such governed by the procedure in Rule 2231. In other words, it would seem clear that the intention of the new rules is that the trial of an interpleader should be so conducted as if independent actions by each claimant had been consolidated in one trial much as the separate rights of action of a minor and parent are redressed in one trial.</p>

J. S. section 41, page 92, where it is said, “Each claimant has the burden of proving his own claim by a preponderance of the evidence, and cannot recover on the weakness of an adverse claim. Both claimants are in the position of a plaintiff in possessory actions, and must recover on the strength of their own title rather than on the weakness of that of the adversary; and each claimant has the burden of establishing his own claim by a preponderance of the evidence, but one interposing an affirmative defense to a claim has the burden <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>of proving such, matter.” And see 30 Am.

In that class of cases a beneficiary named in the policy stands in the position of being prima facie entitled so that in the absence of all other evidence he is entitled to recover on the designation as beneficiary alone. Consequently, the burden would be on all other claimants to overcome such evidence. Therefore in the Superior Court cases the impanelling of the beneficiary as defendant did no harm. However, that situation does not as we have shown always prevail in all interpleader cases and lest harm be done by an apparent acquiescence in the interpretation of the Rules by the cases cited, we now hold that the practice there followed is no longer proper under the present Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure so far as they relate to interpleader. We recognize of course the difficulty with which the Superior Court labored and sought to solve in cases where the original defendant had disclaimed any interest in the fund paid into court and had then been discharged of all liability, for as said in the <em>Waples </em>case, supra, p. 593. “The claim is then against the fund.” In such case to continue the interpleader action with both claimants as party plaintiffs against a defendant who had been discharged seems anomalous. We are frank to say that the existing <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>interpleader rules of practice fail to provide for the trial difficulties that may arise in a case where there are two plaintiffs and no defendant. We feel impelled therefore to indicate the proper practice to be that at the trial of such cases the jury should be sworn with the party plaintiffs designated as plaintiffs on the one side, against the fund or the property which stands in the place of the original defendant. In this ease, therefore, the jury should properly be sworn as to Andrew P. Slavin and Edward X. Slavin party plaintiffs against $12,992.93.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Unfortunately, however, the learned trial judge did not do this but instead, instructed the jury as follows: “There are certain matters of law that govern such a situation and condition as this, and that is, the plaintiff must convince you by the fair weight or preponderance of the evidence that he and his evidence as proven to you by that fair weight or preponderance of the evidence if he is to succeed, and for him to succeed he must prove by the fair weight of the evidence that his contention is the true contention.

The error we indicate was apparently emphasized by the learned trial judge in the latter portion of his charge, saying, “If you find that this money belonged to Mrs. Slavin and Mr. Slavin, then your verdict should be for Andrew P. Slavin. The contention here is between Edward and Andrew. Edward says it is his. Andrew says it was money that belonged to Andrew and to his former wife Agnes.” This also tended to indicate to the jury that Andrew need not rely upon his own claim of title which according to his complaint was one of sole ownership.
