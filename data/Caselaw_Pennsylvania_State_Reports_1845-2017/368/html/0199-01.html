An applicant to quash a writ may not aver simply a defense on the merits, or a good legal answer to the alleged debt itself, he must point to some defect in the record which renders the proceeding fundamentally irregular and void (Crawford v.

The bank discounted the draft and deposited the proceeds to the credit of Morse, the drawer, in his open checking account. The bank forwarded the draft to a bank in Pittsburgh for presentation and -payment. The drawee paid the draft and simultaneously began a proceeding in foreign attachment against Morse, the drawer, and served the Pittsburgh bank as garnishee. The Superior Court held that a bank which discounts a sight draft and places the proceeds to the credit of a drawer is a holder in due course for value and was the owner of the draft and its proceeds and the proceeds could not be attached as the property of the defendant. Moreover, this decision was rendered in spite of the fact that after the attachment the bank in Canada charged back to the depositor’s account in Canada the amount of the draft, although it doubted whether the bank could support such a charge against the will of its depositor after the instrument it had discounted had been paid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a>

In that case of foreign attachment <em>the defendant appeared de bene esse and filed a petition to quash the writ. </em>A rule to show cause was granted, an answer was filed by plaintiff, depositions were taken in New York City, and, as here, filed as part of the record; and the rule was made absolute <em>and the writ was quashed, because the property, </em>viz.: proceeds of life insurance, <em>was exempt from attachment. </em>This Court in its opinion said: “It is urged that the matters alleged in the petitions of garnishee and defendant being dehors the record, this case should not have been disposed of in the court below upon a motion to quash the writ. While it is a well-established rule that the court will not quash a writ of attachment execution or foreign attachment unless some fundamental irregularity appears on the face of the record, <em>yet it is a recognized exception to that rule that evidence dehors the record may be a ground for quashing a writ where defects therein are of such a character as to put plaintiff completely out of court. </em>In Pasquinelli v.
