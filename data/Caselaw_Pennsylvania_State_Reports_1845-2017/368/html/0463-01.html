Settlement was made by the Department in November, 1940. The tax was paid in January, 1943 by the application by the Department <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>of a tax credit. In July, 1943 another bank — the First National Bank &amp; Trust Company of Easton — filed an appeal in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County from the settlement of its shares tax for the year 1939 on the ground that the Department had employed the book value of its assets instead of their actual value, and had failed to exclude from the tax the shares held by religious,. charitable and eleemosynary organizations. Because of certain intermediate proceedings the court did not decide that appeal until May, 1949, at which time it rendered a decision in favor of the bank’s contentions. <em>(Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. First National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of </em>Easton, 60 Dauph. 388). Meanwhile, in January, 1946, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which had taken over the assets of Emaus National Bank pursuant to the Federal Reservé Act, filed a petition with the Board of Finance and Revenue for the refund of a part of the 1939 tax imposed upon the shares of that bank which, it asserted, had been erroneously assessed because the fiscal officers of the Commonwealth, in computing the tax, had employed the book value of the bank’s assets instead of their actual value and had included shares held by religious, charitable and educational institutions. In September, 1949, the Board refused the petition on the ground that the requirements of section 503(a) of the Fiscal Code of 1929, as amended, had not been met. Thereupon Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation brought the present action' in the' Céurt of Common Pleas of Dauphin County praying for the issuance of a mandamus to the Board to grant'the refund. The Board filed preliminary objections in the nature of a "demurrer to., .the plaintiff’s complaint; the court sustained the objections and dismissed the action. From its decree so holding plaintiff has taken the present appeal.</p>

In the computation of the taxes on the shares also of that bank for the years 1939, 1940 and 1941 the fiscal officers allegedly employed the book value of the assets instead of their actual value. The taxes for those years were paid respectively in April, 1941, September, 1941 and September, 1942. Petitions for refunds for the portions improperly assessed were filed in January, 1946. The Board of Finance and Revenue refused the refunds in September, 1949. The bank brought actions of mandamus to compel payments of the refunds. The Board filed the same preliminary objections and the court sustained them for the same reasons as in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation case. The present appeals from the court’s decrees in those cases raise substantially the same questions, therefore, as those involved in that appeal.</p>

Ordinarily a refund of taxes to which the Commonwealth is not rightfully or equitably entitled must be applied for within two years of the settlement or the payment of the tax, but within one year if the claimant be a bank or trust company and the alleged error be in regard to the valuation of its shares of stock. However, a special case is provided for, namely, where the tax is apparently properly paid under a statutory provision, but subsequently a court of competent jurisdiction decides that the statute had been erroneously interpreted and the Commonwealth was not entitled to the tax; the taxpayer under those circumstances may obtain a refund, and <em>“in such case” </em>is allowed five years from the payment or settlement of the tax in which to file a petition to the Board claiming the refund. It would seem obvious, therefore, that in the petition to obtain a refund in <em>such </em>a case it is necessary for the taxpayer to aver, and to establish the fact, that, by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, it had been held that the tax payment was made under an erroneous interpretation of the statute which imposed it, it being solely on the ground of such a decision having been renderéd that the five year extension privilege is granted; only by reason of such decision is á claim for refund warranted under section 503(a) (4) of thé Code. In the presént instances the petitions for refunds filed in 1946 by Federal Deposit <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>Insurance Corporation and The First National Bank of Susquehanna did not assert that a court of competent jurisdiction had held that there had been an erroneous interpretation of the provisions of the statute under which the payments were made; indeed they could not have made such an allegation because it was not until 1949 that the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County rendered its decision in the <em>First National Bank &amp; Trust Company of Easton </em>case to that effect. The petitions for the refunds merely set forth, not a court decision, but the petitioners’ own contentions that the statute should have been interpreted as claimed by them, — contentions that would have been proper in a petition for resettlement of the tax under section 1102 of the Fiscal Code (with the right of petition to the Board of Finance and Revenue under section 1103 and appeal to the Dauphin County Court under section 1104) or in a petition for refund under section 503(a) (1) of the Code provided the petition were filed within the period of a year as there prescribed. But the right to obtain a refund under section 503(a) (4), where the period of five years is allowed in which to file the petition, is restricted to cases where the petitioner is able to present, not merely an argument, but an actual decision by a court of competent jurisdiction that, by reason of an erroneous interpretation of the statute, the Commonwealth was paid a tax to which it was not rightfully or equitably entitled. Appellants contend that it might happen, as here indeed it did happen, that a decision on the basis of which a refund could be claimed would not be rendered by a court within the five year limitation, but the legislature evidently did not intend to allow taxpayers to file claims for refunds, and then, if ten or twenty or any other number of years thereafter a judicial decision was rendered that the statute had been erroneously interpreted, they could thereupon obtain refunds; no <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>doubt the legislature considered that to allow refunds under such circumstances would create great uncertainty in the budgetary planning and fiscal affairs of the Commonwealth. In <em>Art Metal Construction Co. v. United States, <a href="/f2d/47/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="47 F.2d 558" data-case-ids="1835044" data-case-paths="/f2d/47/0558-01">47 </a></em><a href="/f2d/47/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="47 F.2d 558" data-case-ids="1835044" data-case-paths="/f2d/47/0558-01">F.2d 558</a>, 559, 560 (2 C.C.), Judge Learned Hand characterized a petition for refund of the kind filed by plaintiffs in these proceedings as “a mere caveat, an attempt to reserve the taxpayer’s right at some later time to file a claim, should something turn up, either because of a change in the rulings of the courts, or of the Department, or for any other reason which might lead him to suppose that he could get back what he had already paid. . . . Patently, the claim was nothing but an effort to extend the time which the statute had given; . . .”</p>

It was this second condition that was not met, and could not have been met, by appellants.

It is argued, therefore, that that same interpretation should now be given to section 503 (a) (4) of the Fiscal Code, — in other words, that it should be held that the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction upon which the claim for refund is based need not be rendered before the filing of the petition for refund but at any time thereafter. It is true, of course, that the contemporaneous construction of a statute by those charged with its execution and application, especially when it has long prevailed, is entitled to great weight and should not be disregarded or overturned except for cogent reasons, and unless it is clear that such construction is erroneous: 25 R.C.L. 1043, §274; 42 Am.

Provident Trust Co. of Philadelphia, </em>55 Dauph. 235, — decisions in which were rendered on November 3, 1941 and February 21, 1944 respectively, and in which it was held that the actual value of a bank’s assets must be employed rather than the book value in determining the tax on its shares. Appellants refer also to the case of <em>Commonwealth v. First National Bank of Scranton, </em>53 Dauph. 245, decided under date of September 21, 1942, in which it was held that the shares of bank stock owned by religious, charitable and educational institutions were not taxable under the Act of 1897. However, the <em>City National Bank </em>case and the <em>First National Bank of Scranton </em>case were decided before the taxes here involved were paid,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> and, since the payments were therefore made with knowledge of those decisions, the taxpayers’ remedy was <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>to seek resettlements in accordance with the provisions of sections 1102, 1103 and 1104 of the Code or refunds, within the year, under section 503(a) (1). The right to obtain a refund under section 503(a) (4) was obviously intended to apply only to cases where the tax was paid under the law as then interpreted and understood but where subsequent judicial decision held the previous interpretation to have been erroneous. As to the <em>Provident Trust Company </em>case, which was decided after the payment of these taxes had been made, the decision did not involve the Act of 1897 under which they were paid but the Act of June 13, 1907, P.L. 640, and therefore was not a holding, as required by section 503 (a)(4) of the Code, that the statute under which the tax had been paid had been erroneously interpreted.</p>

Here, too, the facts raise the same questions as those in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and First National Bank of Susquehanna appeals. The Nazareth National Bank &amp; Trust Company filed a shares tax report for the year 1937, and in October, 1938 paid the tax as imposed by the settlement. In computing the assessment book values were allegedly used instead of actual values and the fiscal officers included as taxable the shares of the bank owned by religious and charitable institutions. On June 1, 1943 the bank filed with the Board of Finance and Revenue a petition for the refund of the portions of the tax thus improperly assessed. In 1949 the Board refused the petition and the bank then brought action in mandamus against the Board in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. The Board filed preliminary objections to the complaint. The court sustained the objections and dismissed the action, from which decree the bank now appeals.</p>

      <em>wealth v. First National Bank, of Scranton </em>case, handed down in September, 1942, was subsequent to the bank’s payment of the tax in October, 1938, and since that decision held that the imposition of the tax on shares owned by religious, charitable and educational institutions was improper, it would have served the bank, under section 503 of The Fiscal Code <em>as now amended, </em>as the necessary requirement of a judicial decision rendered subsequently to the payment of the tax. However, when the bank’s petition for refund was filed there was not yet in effect the amendment to section 503 effected by the Act of May 7, 1943, P.L. 229, and prior to that act the section provided that the decision must be <em>“by the court of final </em>jurisdiction.” The amendment made by the 1943 Act, effective July 1, 1943, substituted for the words “by the court of final judisdiction” the words <em>“by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction”. </em>The decision of the Dauphin County Court in the <em>First National Bank of Scranton </em>case was not “by the court of final jurisdiction” since, in any such proceeding, an appeal would lie from that court to this court. It was obviously for the very purpose of broadening the right of the taxpayer to obtain a refund by virtue of a ruling of the Dauphin County Court instead of only by this court that the amendment of 1943 was enacted, but, unfortunately for the appellant bank, with an effective date too late to enable it to take advantage of the Dauphin County Court’s decision in the <em>First National Bank of Scranton </em>case.
