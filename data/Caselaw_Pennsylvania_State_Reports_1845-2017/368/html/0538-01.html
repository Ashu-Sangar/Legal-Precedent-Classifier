On <em>November 12,1945, </em>Taylor and Kaufhold had a meeting with Craig and desired Craig to consent to an assignment of the lease by Taylor to Kaufhold, explaining that the arrangement was merely temporary until Taylor regained his health. <em>Taylor at that time also requested Craig, in the presence of Kaufhold, to make a new lease to him, Taylor, for three years commencing April 1, 1946; </em>and to these requests Craig agreed. That same day, viz.: November 12,1945, Taylor sold the restaurant business to Kaufhold and assigned to him his (two year) lease, which had <em>4y¿ </em>months to run, and shortly thereafter Craig approved in writing this assignment.</p>

Kaufhold then filed a motion to open the judgment; upon the dismissal of his motion, he appealed to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.

This verdict was predicated not on the rental value of the leasehold, but on the profits which plaintiff would have made if Kaufhold had not illegally retained possession of the premises. Both defendants contend <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>(1) that plaintiff has joined an action in tort with claims in assumpsit for breach of contract, and (2) that the reasonable rental value of the premises is the correct measure of damages, and not the estimated loss' of profits, and (3) that with respect to the surety, there could be no recovery by this plaintiff on a surety bond which was not given for his benefit, and the obligations of which have been fully performed.</p>

Taylor, who was defendant in the ejectment proceedings, not only lost that case, but took no part in Kaufhold’s appeal. While the supersedeas bond was given for the use of <em>all proper parties in interest, </em>the proper party in interest and the only proper party in interest in that appeal was Craig, who was plaintiff and landlord and owner of the judgment which was being appealed from and temporarily superseded. Moreover Craig is not a party to this suit, having been paid his rent and costs in full, and is not asking any relief in this case. Under all these facts we are unable to see how Taylor, the unsuccessful defendant in the ejectment proceedings, can successfully contend that the supersedeas bond was given for his benefit or that he was a <em>proper party in interest </em>within the meaning of the bond.</p>

Prior to the assignment of the existing lease by Taylor to Kaufhold, and prior to the new lease by Craig to Taylor, <em>Kaufhold knew that Taylor, </em>if he recovered his health, <em>intended on April 1,19J/6 to conduct or to continue a restaurant and liquor lousiness on the demised premises. </em>Taylor’s covenant in the lease of April 1, 1944, to deliver up the premises to Craig in good order and repair at the end of the term was equally binding upon Taylor’s assignee, Kaufhold, since a covenant to deliver up possession of, the premises runs with the land and binds the assignee: <em>Pollard v.
