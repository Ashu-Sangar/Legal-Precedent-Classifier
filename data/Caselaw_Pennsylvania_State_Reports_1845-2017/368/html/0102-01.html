    <p id="b126-6" data-blocks='[["BL_126.8",126,[261,760,1158,695]]]'>Six partners trading as Bowie Coal Company are and had been for many years engaged in the mining of bituminous coal by the open pit mining method. On August 29, 1945, they registered with the Department of Mines. Their registration was duly accepted and approved by the Secretary of Mines, and since then they have continued open pit mining, and have complied with all the requirements of the Bituminous Coal Open Pit Mining Conservation Act of May 31,1945, P.L. 1198 as amended, 52 P.S. §1396, with respect to renewal of their registration. They operate twenty-two separate mining operations in three counties: Mercer, Yenango and Butler.</p>

The order was repeated on July 15, 1948. On <em>August 20,1948, </em>the Secretary issued a new order or directive requiring them to file a separate bond and pay a separate fee <em>for each operation in each county. </em>They filed a petition on <em>November 1, 1949, </em>in the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Mercer </em>County praying for relief from the orders and directives of the Secretary of Mines. The court thereupon granted a rule to show cause, returnable December 19, 1949. On January 18, 1950, the Secretary of Mines filed a petition raising a preliminary question of jurisdiction as to the operators’ petition of November 7, 1949. The court granted a rule to show cause and after an answer and <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>argument, the court discharged the rule (which was granted to the Secretary of Mines) to show cause why the operators’ petition should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. From this order, the Secretary of Mines took this appeal.</p>

The operators contend that the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Mercer </em>County has jurisdiction of their petition under the provisions of <em>Section V¡ </em>of the Act of May <em>31,194-5, </em>P.L. 1198, as amended by the Act of <em>May 23,1949, </em>P.L. 1730, 52 P.S. §1396.14. The pertinent provisions of <em>Section 14 </em>of said Act are as follows: “Any operator or landowner, <em>who shall he aggrieved </em>by any administrative regulation, directive or order of the Secretary of Mines or of the Secretary of Forests and Waters or any other administrative agency making application of the provisions of this act, <em>may file a petition in the court of common pleas of the county where the land is located,</em>

The appellant contends that this particular provision in Section 14 of the amendment of May 23,1949, supra, is <em>prospective </em>only and therefore cannot apply to the orders or directives of the Secretary of Mines which were dated June 28, July 15 and <em>August 20, 1948. </em>For purposes <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>of this case we shall assume, without deciding, that the Commonwealth’s further contention is correct, viz.: prior to the Secretary’s directives of 1948, the only provision for appeal in the Bituminous Coal Open Pit Mining Conservation Act <em>of </em>1945, supra, was (1) from the failure of the Secretary of Forests and Waters to approve planting (Section 14), and (2) from the action of the Secretary of Mines in forfeiting a bond or converting collateral (Section 15).</p>

The original Bituminous Coal Open Pit Mining Conservation Act, supra, was signed by the Governor on <em>May 31, 1945, </em>and by its terms became effective immediately. Section 41 of the Administrative Agency Law of June 4, 1945, supra, gives any person aggrieved by <em>an adjudication </em>(of any one of a dozen or more departments, administrative boards or agencies) the right of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. If these acts are clearly inconsistent and irreconcilable the Administrative Agency Law, being latest in date of final emactment, must prevail: Statutory Construction Act, May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, Section 65, 46 P.S. §565. It is clear that the appellee operators could present their petition or appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County (1) if the amendment of Section 14 was retroactive, or (2) <em>if the order </em>or regulation or directive of the Secretary of Mines <em>was effective after May 23, 1949.</em>

The Secretary’s orders or directives were dated June 28, <em>1948, </em>July 15, <em>1948, </em>and August 20, <em>1948, </em>but it does not follow that the directives were not still in force and effect after May 23, 1949. In our opinion those orders, under the record in this case, continued to be and remain in full force and effect <em>on November 1, 1949, </em>the date of the filing of appellees’ petition, and the petitioners were therefore “operators who <em>shall be aggrieved </em>by any directive or order of the Secretary of Mines.” It follows therefore <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>that the operators came squarely within the amendment off May 23, 1949 and were authorized by the terms of the amendment to file a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of the county where the land is located, viz., <em>Mercer </em>County.</p>
    <p id="b130-4" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[240,618,1166,1528]]]'>The Commonwealth also contends that the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County did not have jurisdiction because -the operators’ petition ■ or appeal was filed one year and two months after the order or directive of the Secretary of Mines. This issue or defense was not raised in the Commonwealth’s petition to the lower court raising the question of jurisdiction, and although orally argued before the lower court, was not considered by said court to be properly before it. There are three conclusive answers to the Commonwealth’s contention. First, there is no provision in the Act or in the amendment limiting the time for taking an appeal from an order of the Secretary of Mines; second, the orders or directives of the Secretary were continuing ones, and the operators were aggrieved by them up to and including the time they filed their petition; and finally, this defense raises a question not of jurisdiction but of laches. While laches can be taken advantage of by demurrer or by preliminary objections without requiring a plea or answer to bring it to the notice of the court, the laches must be clearly apparent from the bill or petition itself: <em>West, Admrx., v.
