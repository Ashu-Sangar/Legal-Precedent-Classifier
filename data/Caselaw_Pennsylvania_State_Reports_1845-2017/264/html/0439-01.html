In the present instance they did the former, for they entered security and dissolved the attachment: Sec. 62, Act June 13,1836, P. L. 583. It was only after they had obtained this benefit as defendants, they took the appeal from the order making them so. They were then estopped by the record from complaining thereof. So also, — even if we assume appellants had a standing to move to quash an attachment not issued against them personally, — having affirmed the action of the court below in making them defendants, they no longer had a basis for their only objection to the attachment, namely, that there was no such corporation as was therein named as defendant. The objection fell also when they dissolved the attachment, for that which had ceased to exist could not be quashed; and for the further reason that by Section 62 of the Act of 1836, above referred to, when an attachment is thus dissolved “the action shall proceed in due course, in like manner as if the same had been commenced by a writ of capias ad respondendum,” the bail standing in the place of the property attached, whereas the purpose of the motion to quash is to end the proceedings forever.</p>
