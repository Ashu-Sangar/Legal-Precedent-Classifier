    <p class="summary" id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.6",303,[100,615,1163,1400]]]'>There remains defendant’s objection founded upon the size of the verdict. It must be conceded that it is beyond what is usual and beyond what appears needful for the purposes of compensation for the plaintiff’s suffering and pecuniary loss, past, present and future. Á careful examination of the case, however, has led to the conclusion that this objection cannot properly, and therefore ought not to be attempted to, be remedied by the court reducing the verdict. In order to justify that there ought to be an adequate basis in the evidence for it affording a safe measure of reduction: see Stauffer v. Reading, <a href="/pa/208/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="208 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="998097" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0436-01">208 Pa. 436</a>, 437. The evidence here does not furnish that basis and measure for a reduction, and the latter would appear as, and could hardly be other than, an arbitrary act on the part of the court. Moreover, it must not be overlooked that in an action like this a plaintiff on the question of his damages has the constitutional right to have them assessed by a jury: Bradwell v. Pittsburgh Pass. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/139/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="139 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="11251814" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0404-01">139 Pa. 404</a>, subject to the power of the court to set aside the verdict if clearly too great or too small. We are of opinion that in this instance the ends of justice will be best served by the submission of this case to a second jury. Further discussion of it at this time with reference to the quantum of the damages is therefore inadvisable: see McKnight v. Bell, <a href="/pa/135/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="135 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="817392" data-case-paths="/pa/135/0358-01">135 Pa. 358</a>, 373.</p>
