    <p class="summary" id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.13",611,[125,1011,1157,265]]]'>The essential facts in the case, as set forth in the pleadings, about which there is no dispute, are as follows: In 1910 Ella Benscoter, of Muhlenburg, Luzerne County, loaned $1,500 to F. J. Niemeyer and wife, on a bond and mortgage executed by the Niemeyers and delivered to her.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b611-6" data-blocks='[["BL_611.14",611,[124,1285,1158,1086]]]'>In 1913 Mrs. Niemeyer, her husband having died, desired to borrow $2,000 and arranged with F. W. Larned &amp; Son to procure a loan, which the Larneds did procure on a mortgage, and appropriated $1,500 of the amount to pay off the mortgage which the Niemeyers had formerly given to Ella Benscoter. The money was received by the Larneds on September 5,1913, but the fact that the mortgage had been paid was not communicated to Ella Benscoter until November 19,1913, when Lewis Larned called on Miss Benscoter with a power of attorney to satisfy the Niemeyer mortgage. He then informed Miss Benscoter for the first time that the Niemeyer mortgage had been paid, but assured her that they could place her money on another mortgage which would be equally good, and upon which the interest would be promptly paid. On this assurance Miss Benscoter signed the power of attorney to satisfy the Niemeyer mortgage, and delivered the mortgage itself, with the bond and insurance policies, to Lewis Larned. The power of attorney was not recorded and the Niemeyer mortgage satisfied until February 7,1914.</p>

      <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>The plaintiff, E. G. Watkins, had given a mortgage to Caroline Kraft, of Philadelphia, in 1910, on his property on Laurel street in Parsons, Luzerne County, for $2,000, to secure a loan of like amount, which he had secured through the Larneds. Watkins had paid $500 on this loan, so that in December, 1913, the balance due on his mortgage was $1,500.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b612-4" data-blocks='[["BL_612.4",612,[271,740,1154,1081]]]'>About the middle of December, 1913, Frank Larned told Watkins, the plaintiff, that the Kraft estate, Caroline Kraft having died and the mortgage being in the hands of her executor, wanted the mortgage paid; that he, Larned, had $1,500 in hand belonging to Miss Benscoter, which he would apply in payment of the Kraft mortgage, and had Watkins execute a new bond and mortgage for $1,500 to Miss Benscoter to secure the new loan from her, with which to pay off the Kraft mortgage. This mortgage from Watkins to Benscoter, the one in question in this case, was dated and acknowledged December 18 and recorded December 19, 1913. About a month later Watkins called at the Larned’s office and was told by Frank Larned that the Kraft estate had refused to take the money in satisfaction of Watkins’s mortgage, but had assigned the mortgage, which was not yet due, to a Dr. Petery, whereupon Watkins said that he had no use for Miss Benscoter’s money, and Frank Larned replied that he had destroyed the bond and mortgage given by Watkins to Miss Benscoter, and returned the money.</p>

She then placed the matter in the hands of her attorney, who made demand on the plaintiff, Mr. Watkins, for an installment of interest then overdue, whereupon the plaintiff brought this bill in equity to restrain the defendant from collecting on the mortgage, and to have the mortgage satisfied, and the accompanying bond canceled.</p>
