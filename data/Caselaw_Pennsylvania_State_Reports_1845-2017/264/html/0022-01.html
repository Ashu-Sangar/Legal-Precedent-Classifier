He acquiesced in both decrees until 1910, when on his petition it was finally determined by the Supreme Court that Ms income accruing <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>after May 9th, of that year, should be paid to him without further deduction. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, his counsel strenuously argued that the decrees of this court were invalid by reason of the above-quoted spendthrift trust provision of the will. The Supreme Court in view of the changed condition of the property held in terms “that while the $6,355.24 retained by the trustee need not now be refunded out of the principal of the estate, justice and equity require that the life tenant be granted relief to the extent indicated,” evidently meaning that the $6,355.24 should be in principal until there should be such a material change in the circumstances of the case that would render it just and equitable to grant further relief to the life tenant. The Supreme Court added, “We are not called upon and it would serve no useful purpose to consider the other points urged before us by the appellant not raised in the court below.”</p>
