An examiner was appointed, who reported that contestant had been chosen by a majority of one vote; exceptions filed by Padden were sustained, and the court entered a decree adjudging him entitled to the office; the petitioners for the contest have appealed.</p>

Such relief was not prayed in the court below; but, when the case was called for argument before us, a petition was presented requesting that an amendment to the original petition for contest, adding certain averments and a prayer that the “entire return may be thrown out,” should be allowed at bar. No authority justifying this most unusual application has been cited, and it will not be granted; nor shall <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>we discuss the several reasons urged by appellant in support thereof, for none of them is appropriate to any specification of error.</p>
