The court below declined to receive the evidence because there was no proof of insanity in the direct ancestral line, and while it was in error in so holding, under the offer and the record as it now stands its action in declining to receive this evidence must be approved. The question, as it bears on the last proposition of law, may be stated thus: in the absence of any proof whatever of insane conduct on the part of the accused’s direct ancestry, may such existence be inferred from evidence to the effect that the accused and his collateral ancestors of near degree were suffering from hereditary or transmissible insanity, or had so suffered? Illustrations have been given in the textbooks and digests of instances, where evidence of insanity in blood relations of the accused, such as nieces, nephews, brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts, has been received. In many of these cases it does not clearly appear that insanity in the direct ancestral line had been previously shown. The reasons why such evidence should not be required are well stated in a discussion of this subject in Wharton &amp; Stille’s Medical Jurisprudence, Chap. 30, and summed up by Wigmore, supra, in the statement that hereditary insanity may pass over a generation or individual before reappearing later on. The difficulty in obtaining proof in the direct ancestry is apparent. In People v. Garbutt, supra, where it was not claimed that <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>either parent or any direct ancestor had been insane, but the defense offered to show insanity in the brother and sister arising from a cause similar to that which it was alleged had induced the destructive act of the defendant, Chief Justice Cooley says: “If a family of several children should be found, without known cause, to be idiotic, or subject to mental delusions, the inference of hereditary transmission would in many cases be entirely conclusive, notwithstanding the inability to point out anything of a similar character in any ancestor. Insanity in a part of the children only would be less conclusive; but the admissibility of the evidence in these cases cannot depend upon its quantity and it could never be required that it should amount to a demonstration. In some cases its force must be small; in others it will prove hereditary taint with great directness. We think evidence of mental unsoundness on the part of a brother or sister of the person whose competency is in question, is admissible, and that the jury should be allowed to consider it in connection with all the other evidence bearing upon that subject.”</p>

People, supra, a leading case, one of the defenses interposed was that the accused was afflicted with insanity superinduced by epilepsy. An effort was made to show that the brother was suffering from the same malady. The trial court ruled that it was not shown that epilepsy induced, or tended to induce, insanity, or that the disease was transmissible. The court said: “The insanity of parents, or relatives, is also admissible upon the issue of insanity. It tends to show an hereditary taint, and supplements evidence of insanity of the accused. When the question as to the conduct of the plaintiff’s brother was asked, it had neither been shown that the father was insane, or that the prisoner was afflicted with epilepsy, or other disease. The conduct of the brother as an isolated, independent fact, was wholly immaterial, and the question asked did not necessarily point to evidence of insanity in him. We think the <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>fair construction of the ruling of the court was, that the defense should first show that epilepsy is, or tends to produce, insanity, and that the disease is transmissible before entering into the general subject of the conduct of the brother.”</p>

This would dispose of the objection by the court below and it is further emphasized by the fact that the witnesses who testify to insanity in the ancestors, either direct or collateral, should do so from personal knowledge and observation and not from reputation: Walker v. The State, <a href="/ind/102/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="102 Ind. 502" data-case-ids="1358735" data-case-paths="/ind/102/0502-01">102 Ind. 502</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=1%20N.E.%20856" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="1 N.E. 856">1 N.

But it must still be shown that the disease was hereditary or transmissible, as indicated. There is not a scintilla of evidence to show the form or symptom of the disease with which the collateral <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>kinsmen suffered. The accused was afflicted with melancholia. Was it acquired by him under such circumstances that the jury might find that it had been transmitted to him by some ancestor and that the brothers, sister, aunt and cousins were in turn suffering from an insanity likewise transmissible? Not that they suffered from the same symptom, but a transmissible symptom. The various forms of this disease are so numerous and complex, the subject so difficult, that in due protection of the orderly administration of the criminal law it becomes necessary to insist that, before evidence to establish hereditary taint be introduced, proof should be present that the insanity in the collateral kinsmen was transmissible, and not nonhereditary, for it is just as probable in this case that the insanity of the collaterals was produced from some exciting cause, such as grief, terror, disappointed affection, anxiety, great joy or intense worry; 'or from some physical cause such as drunkenness, use of opium or other narcotics, a blow on the head, exposure to severe heat or cold, or other physical causes. As the offer was merely to show that they were in an insane asylum, or were of unsound mind, it was clearly insufficient, and as there are many and varied forms of insanity, the court, of course, could not take judicial notice of a physiological fact on which the medical profession is not in unanimous accord. Nor should the evidence have been received, and the Commonwealth by cross-examination be required to show nonhereditary cause. As we said in opening, the burden is on the accused to lay his foundation for the admission of such evidence. The benefit (if such it was) of this evidence was not entirely lost, for reference to one of the children being in an asylum was made in the testimony.</p>
