The owner, Richard L. Wallace, on June 21,1917, entered into a written agreement with the claimant, William E. S. Dyer, a mill engineer and architect, by which the latter was to prepare plans and supervise the construction of a wool scouring plant on a tract of land at Eighty-first street and Bartram avenue, Philadelphia. The plant was to embrace two warehouses, a power house, a steam piping system and other structures and equipment. The contract states that, “As compensation in full for services to be rendered by him the said Dyer shall be paid a commission of ten per cent of the total cost of the building construction and equipment.” On May 13, 1918, Mr. Dyer filed the lien here in question setting forth a copy of the contract and claiming $18,134.88, made up of items in the attached schedule. The lien sets forth, inter alia, “The said claimant......supervised the construction of the buildings erected and the installation of the machinery placed therein. The said claimant entered upon the performance of the said services on June 21, 1917, and was continuously engaged in the performance thereof from said date until the filing of this lien when the said Richard L. Wallace refused to permit the said claimant to continue the supervision of the unfinished portion of said work, in violation of the terms of the aforesaid contract. The lot of ground On which the several buildings hereinafter inore particularly described are erected, in course of <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>erection, or at the time the services rendered were intended to be erected, to be used as hereinbefore stated together as one plant, is described as follows.” This is followed by a description of the buildings erected thereon, which states, inter alia: “The steam piping system extends from the boiler house to the several buildings which said system is now being in process of construction,” and, referring to warehouse No. 2, states: “The building to be erected in accordance with the plans and specifications prepared by the claimant.......was to be constructed of brick and timber similar to warehouse No. 1.”</p>
    <p id="b205-7" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[154,1013,1156,862]]]'>The schedule or bill of particulars is indefinite; while it purports to be, “In account with Richard L. Wallace &amp; Company,” the claimant’s name does not appear therein. It mentions ten per cent commission and computes it on forty-four items, in two groups; above them appears the only date, “September 7, 1917.” The four largest items are stated thus, “No. 1 Warehouse...... Henry E. Baton, $44,000; Power House, $15,363.87; No. 2 Warehouse Bid, $74,137; Piping System, $13,371.” The other items are equally and in some instances more indefinite. The claim includes some small items, amounting to $58.76, for alleged services and expenses, aside from the contract, for which there seems to be no. justification and which we will not discuss. The amount of the claim as above stated is the balance after deducting credits of $4,717.50.</p>

In each of those cases as here the claimant sought to embrace in his lien a claim for damages for breach of contract. In the present case appellant was discharged during the building operation, when work on some of the structures had not begun, while others were in process of construction and some possibly finished. According to the contract his commission was to be on the total cost of the building construction and equipment; but he fails to aver the total cost or in fact the cost of any part of it. Certain items are stated, but no averment that they represent the total cost or the actual cost of the respective structures. As the lien was filed when the plant was but partially constructed, its total cost could not then be known. This clearly appears in the largest item, “No. 2 Warehouse Bid, $74,137.” That does not show the cost of the building, and nothing had been done towards its construction, yet $7,413.70 of this claim is based upon it. This lien could be sustained only for work actually performed and the amount of that is not stated; admittedly but part of the entire work was done and we do not know what part as it blends the claim for work done with that for work not done, and, hence, cannot be sustained. Appellant might have filed a lien against the plant for the value of the work actually done (Linden Steel Co. v. Rough Run Mfg.

Such conclusion must be reached if at all by inference and not from averment. Neither do we agree with the suggestion that the averments as to the machinery placed in the power house are sufficient; for example, take the largest of those items, stated in the bill of particulars as, “Permutit Company......$6,570.00”; there is no averment that this sum was the cost of or connected with the Permutit Water Softener equipment mentioned in the body of the claim; and placing it in the bill of particulars in a separate group of items from the power house adds to the uncertainty.

S. Dyer, the owner is Richard L. Wallace, and the contractor is the said Richard L. Wallace, trading as R. L. Wallace &amp; Company. The second requirement is that the claim shall specify “the amount or sum claimed to be due and the nature or kind of the work done, or the kind and amount of materials furnished, or both, and the time <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>when the materials were furnished or the work done or both, as the case may be.” The claim says that the amount due is $18,134.88, for services rendered in the erection and construction of the buildings under a contract with the owner, a copy of which is attached to the lien, and proceeds: “the said services consisted of the preparation of general and preliminary plans, — the location of the several buildings and structures, so as to permit them to be operated as a single plant; the preparation of detailed plans, working drawings, and specifications for each separate building and structure; the designing, selecting and supervising the installation and erection of the heating, ventilating, mechanical, electrical and sanitary equipment, including fire protecting apparatus, and whatever else was necessary to a complete construction of said plant, including the selection and purchase of engines and machinery of all kinds required in the operation of said plant for carrying on the wool scouring and wool storage business by the said owner and contractor. All of the above-mentioned services were rendered and performed by the said claimant in full compliance with the terms of the aforesaid contract.” It also says that claimant “entered upon the performance of said services on June 21, 1917, and was continuously engaged in the performance thereof until the date of the filing of this lien.”......The third and last requirement is that the claim shall specify “the locality of the structure or other improvement with such description thereof as may be necessary for the purpose of identification, and a description of the real estate upon which the same is situate.” The claim in this case describes particularly the property and the several buildings upon which the work was done, giving their location and size, as well as the purposes for which they were to be used. It is clear, therefore, that every requirement of the Act of 1905, is fully met by this lien, and the court below erred in striking it off, unless some other reason be shown for its action.</p>

Moreover, this contention wholly overlooks the fact that the claim is not filed by a subcontractor, but by one who contracts directly with the owner. Under the Act of 1836, it was held in a series of cases, of which Haley v. Prosser, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 133" data-case-ids="483319" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0133-01">8 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 133</a>, is probably the last, that a mechanic’s lien would not be sustained “where there is a special contract with the owner,” for in that event “the party who deals with him must provide for his own security; but where there is no agreement in which the terms of the bargain are particularly stated, he is supposed to contract on the basis of the law.” Under that act, for the protection of the owner, a subcontractor was, and under the Act of 1901 still is, required to specify in detail the work which he did, the materials which he furnished, and the prices which he claims to be paid for them; but even in that class of cases (Willson v. Canevin, <a href="/pa/226/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="226 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="967952" data-case-paths="/pa/226/0362-01">226 Pa. 362</a>) if a lien specifies the total contract price, and details the work and materials actually furnished, it is not necessary to state the prices charged for the various items.</p>

The reason for the distinction between the two classes of liens is, in the latter class the owner already knows whether or not the lien is a proper one, and does not need to be advised in regard thereto; whereas in the former he does need the informa<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>tion, because “the agreement between bim [tbe subcontractor] and tbe contractor is not tbe measure of tbe owner’s responsibility”: Chapman v.

It necessarily follows, — and perhaps it is nowhere better stated than in Judge Rice’s opinion in tbe last-cited case, — if tbe claim gives tbe owner sufficient information to enable bim to know whether or not it ought to be paid, and to defend against it if be thinks it should not, it answers every purpose required by law.</p>

Tbe contract provides “as compensation in full for services to be rendered by bim, tbe said Dyer shall be paid a commission of ten per cent of tbe total cost of the building construction and equipment,” and “all bids are to be submitted to Richard L. Wallace &amp; Company; tbe several contracts are to be selected by Dyer, subject to the approval of Richard L. Wallace &amp; Company, and placed by Richard L. Wallace &amp; Company with tbe individual contractors.” This tbe claim avers was done, and hence <em>it </em>is clear defendant knew exactly what tbe bids were, who were tbe successful bidders, and what was plaintiff’s ten per cent thereof. Tbe lien says that one of tbe buildings actually “constructed” is a “power bouse” in which has been placed as part of tbe equipment, “two Coatesville boilers, Skinner engine, Western Electric Generator, Permutit Water Softener equipment, Harrison Safety Boiler Works feed water beater, Griscom-Russell hot water beater, and Walker Electric switchboard,” and “tbe particular items upon which said commission was based are particularly mentioned in tbe schedule hereto attached, marked ‘Exhibit B’”; from which we find the cost of those specific items is detailed as $8,170, $3,202, $1,815, $6,570, $670, $691, and $673, respectively.

Bear, <a href="/pa/240/0448-02" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="240 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="993091,993236" data-case-paths="/pa/240/0448-02,/pa/240/0448-01">240 Pa. 448</a>, especially as in the former mechanic’s lien case it was held to be erroneous to say that one employed to superintend the construction of a building may recover, after a wrongful discharge, the entire commissions he would have received had he continued so to do until completion, and equally erroneous to hold he would be entitled to be paid for his superintendence only up to the time of his discharge. In the present case the plans were prepared, a portion of the services of superintendence was unquestionably rendered, plaintiff was entitled to a lien for at least as much as they were worth, and the motion to strike off the whole lien should fail.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[251,1453,1152,972]],["BL_215.1",215,[155,362,1169,754]]]'>The exact point of divergence between the majority of the court and myself is found in the inquiry: Can a contractor who has been wrongfully refused permission to finish his contract, recover for work actually done, without setting forth in his lien an apportionment as between the work done and that not done? If an apportionment was requisite, still the judgment below should be reversed, for that question is not raised by the motion to strike off, defendant’s contention, as above quoted, being that the character of services performed was not such as to entitle plaintiff to a lien. That omission, if it be one, was amendable, and the lien doubtless would have been so amended had objection been made on that ground. But in this case it was not required. If the contract had been for a gross sum, perhaps it would have been (though even there, in my judgment, it would have been a matter for the jury, in view of plaintiff’s strict compliance with the act of assembly); but where, as here, the contract is <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>made directly with the owner, and the extent of the recovery is measured by a percentage of a number of items, and the cost of any one thereof is averred, a rule to strike off the whole lien should not prevail: McCristal v. Coch- - ran, supra. Of course “the lien must be self-sustaining”; but that only means every requisite of the claim, as prescribed by law, must appear therein, or be fairly deducibletherefrom: Willson v. Canevin, <a href="/pa/226/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="226 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="967952" data-case-paths="/pa/226/0362-01">supra;</a> Chapman v. Faith, <a href="/pa-super/18/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="18 Pa. Super. 578" data-case-ids="837273" data-case-paths="/pa-super/18/0578-01">supra.</a> In the present case, as shown above, every requisite of the act of assembly has been complied with, and no principal applicable to mechanics’ liens has been violated. In my opinion, therefore, the order striking off the lien should be reversed, the lien reinstated, and a procedendo awarded.</p>
