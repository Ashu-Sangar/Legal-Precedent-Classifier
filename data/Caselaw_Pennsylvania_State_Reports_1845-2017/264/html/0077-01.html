      <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>Appellant admits, in the statement of questions involved and throughout its printed argument, that the benevolence of the Albion Society extends beyond its needy membership to all natives of England, or of the British islands, colonies, territories and dependencies, who may be in distress, in the City of Philadelphia, and also to their wives, widows and children. It will be noticed that this large class of charitable objects would embrace practically all members of the society, when in distress, even were they not specially mentioned as entitled to assistance; in other words, the members are placed on a par with all other needy persons of British nativity or descent, in the City of Philadelphia, so far as the society’s benevolence is concerned.</p>
    <p id="b116-7" data-blocks='[["BL_116.4",116,[270,1101,1151,366]]]'>When the general principles which we have enumerated are applied to the facts justifiably found by the auditor, and stated in this opinion, it is clear that the legatee named by testator is a charity, within the meaning of the law, to such an extent as to make his gift to it void under the Act of 1855, supra; and the court below did not err in so ruling.</p>
    <p id="b116-8" data-blocks='[["BL_116.5",116,[271,1480,1150,633]]]'>After testator’s death, appellant society made certain changes in its laws, enlarging the social features at the expense of its charitable purposes; but the auditor and the court below properly refused to allow this fact in any way to control the determination of the present case. A society ór association, incorporated or otherwise, cannot change its organic law or prime purpose so as to divert charitable funds to other uses (see cases, supra), and this, apparently, is what was attempted by the changes here sought to be shown; hence there was no error in refusing to consider the evidence relating thereto.</p>
    <p id="b116-9" data-blocks='[["BL_116.6",116,[273,2132,1149,146]]]'>The assignments of error are overruled and the decree of the court below is affirmed; costs to be paid out of the fund.</p>
