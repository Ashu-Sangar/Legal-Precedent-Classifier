At tbe audit of the account of an executor of an insolvent decedent a claim was presented for $25,000 based on a writing signed by decedent. It appeared that decedent had been the president of a street railway company, and that the claimant was a plumber. Two years before decedent’s death it was discovered that the railway company had been illicitly tapping fire lines and unlawfully using city water. Claimant found this out, and suggested to decedent that, if he were given the contract to meter the fire lines, he could arrange it so that the city would make no claim for water previously illicitly used. An oral contract was then made by which a certain amount was fixed for construction work, and a further sum of fifteen per cent on the savings due to such metering. Claimant was paid by the company for the construction work and receipted in full “for all services rendered.” Subsequently claimant pressed the decedent to pay him the percentage for the saving, and as a result decedent prepared a paper which was signed by both. In this paper it was recited that claimant had agreed to accept $25,-000 in full payment for metering and that decedent had agreed to pay fifteen per cent on the savings from the metering. The decedent bound himself, his heirs, executors and assigns, and the company, to protect claimant for the full amount of $25,000, further stating, “I will see the above sum is paid you in amounts as may be required from time to time for your personal use.” The consideration was stated in the following language: “In consideration of the faithful and efficient service rendered by you to the company, and to me in the matter of metering the fire lines for the company.”</p>

The only allegation of fraud was that claimant had deceived decedent into the original agreement, not that the contract in question grew out of fraud against the city. The court found as a fact from the evidence in the case that the promise of the payment of percentage on the savings was the express promise of the decedent, and that there was no fraud. Held, (1) that the receipt to the company did not' bar claimant from demanding payment of the percentage from the decedent’s estate; (2) that the writing and the other evidence were sufficient to establish a contract of the decedent based on a valuable consideration to pay claimant the Sum of $25,-<a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>000; (3) the evidence was not sufficient to establish fraud; and (4) there was a valuable consideration.</p>

Kruger accepted this suggestion, and entered into an oral arrangement with Purdy, whereby it was agreed that, after making required investigations in the water department of the city, Purdy should meter the fire lines wherever necessary, he to be paid the cost of construction, plus ten per cent, and also the further sum of fifteen per cent on the savings due to such metering.</p>

After carefully considering these contentions, and all they involve, we are not convinced the orphans’ court erred in refusing to sustain them.</p>

Be this as it may, however, the written agreement, signed by both Kruger and Purdy, demonstrates that, as between them, it was not intended Kruger should be discharged from his personal liability; and Judge Solly’s second opinion proceeds upon the basis that the testimony shows Kruger, from the first, throughout his dealings with Purdy, assumed a personal liability.</p>
    <p id="b89-5" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[115,857,1158,416]]]'>The court below says, inter alia, “The work of metering the fire lines was done for the company, under the order of its president, and paid for by the company, but the agreement as to the percentage on the savings of water charges which Purdy was to receive was the express promise of Kruger.” This finding is not formally complained of; but, if it were, we could not say there was error therein.</p>

In other words, the recital of this receipt contains no declaration which is inconsistent with Purdy’s present claim against Kruger; for, by the written contract in suit, Kruger expressly agrees to pay Purdy, “In consideration of the faithful and efficient service rendered by” him, “to me [Kruger],” not for metering the lines of the transit company, but “in the matter of metering” those lines.</p>

If this was Kruger’s attitude (and the paper in suit strongly indicates it was) then his assumption of liability would be quite lawful; and, when the unpaid amount due Purdy was finally settled between them, it, like any other lawful debt, might be put into the form of a written obligation. Thus viewed, the contract in suit is supported by a valuable consideration; therefore, we cannot say the court below erred in sustaining its validity.</p>
