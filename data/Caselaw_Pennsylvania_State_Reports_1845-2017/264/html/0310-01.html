The orphans’ court commits no error in refusing to appoint an examiner to take testimony in a proceeding for the removal of an executor for mismanagement of the estate, where the executor’s answer ’ admits the material averments in the petition for his removal. In such a ease there is no necessity for taking testimony.</p>

On the 4th day of December, 1918, the executor asked and obtained an extension of time to the 15th of December for filing of the answer. On the 14th of December an answer was filed.

On this mortgage a sci. fa. has been issued since the death of testatrix and judgment taken against the executor and legatees for $12,576.63, and costs. The decedent was also indebted on a mortgage in the sum of $1,000; also on another mortgage in the sum of $2,-000, on which foreclosure proceedings are threatened.

No authority whatever is shown for these payments. His statement is • that the most of it is for board. The father, Joseph W. Miller, was the husband of Annie E. Miller. He gets nothing under the will. It does not appear that he elected to take against the will. Why the executor should pay out this money, for which there is no warrant, and allow the direct inheritance tax to remain unpaid while bearing interest at the rate of 1 per cent per month, and allow penalties to accumulate on the taxes, is nowhere explained. Certainly, this is not to the best interests of the estate. He paid out large sums of money for items which he designates, as “trips and supper.” There is no explanation as to what these items mean. If in the fourteen months’ time a property which has rented as this property has the manager cannot save from repairs and upkeep enough to pay the funeral expenses, etc., especially <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>where part of these taxes bears interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum, it seems to the court time to get a new manager. He makes no explanation as to the nonpayment of these things, except to say that he did not have the funds. He makes no promise, nor does.he hold out any hope that matters will be better in the future. While he rents the buildings heated, he admits that coal, which he purchased for that purpose, has not been paid for. He admits that the hardware which he purchased, presumably for repairs, has not been paid for. There is no doubt whatever of his mismanagement of the estate. He seeks to hold the petitioners responsible for the unpaid bills, because they would not sign a note, by which he could borrow money. It was not their business to raise the money. Instead of acknowledging the rights of the petitioners to assert their position and complain of his management, he shows a defiant attitude. He shows that there is no harmony between the devisees and legatees and the executor. It will not take many years, with such management as his, to render a solvent estate insolvent.</p>

Instead of denying, the executor attempts to explain. His explanations are very unsatisfactory.
