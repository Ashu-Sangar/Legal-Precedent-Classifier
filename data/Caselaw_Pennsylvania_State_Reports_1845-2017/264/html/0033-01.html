In consequence of a riot call to the police station of the City of Philadelphia, a police patrol wagon driven rapidly, proceeded westward on the north side of Federal street; the horses and front wheel of the wagon passed over the street car track and when the rear wheels of the patrol wagon struck the east track the axle of the wagon broke, the right rear'wheel of the wagon was detached from the axle of the wagon and was projected forward for a distance of about 100 feet, when it struck the curb and rolled upon the sidewalk and hit John J. Henry in the back, throwing him to the ground, and causing the injuries for which this suit was instituted.</p>
