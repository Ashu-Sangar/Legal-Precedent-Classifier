The whole thing has been, at all times, operated as a single colliery; while that was apparently in contemplation of the parties to the lease, the exigencies of transportation between the different parcels, eventually led to the modification of their-contract by the supplement of 1891, before mentioned.</p>

This grant was made in consideration of an increased royalty and of one thousand dollars in cash, both of which were paid by defendant. Plaintiffs contend that this right-of-way must be deemed to have expired with the exhaustion of the coal in the Lillibridge, which is alleged to have occurred as early as 1914”; while defendant contends it is to last as long as any part of the colliery, which requires the free use of the passageways contracted for, is being <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>worked, and, further, that the coal in the Lillibridge has not yet been exhausted.</p>

Both the top split of the New County and the Dunmore are minable and are intended to be mined; the bottom split of the New County vein is thin, and the only work now in progress on the Lillibridge is prospecting work to determine whether this seam can be mined to any advantage, but there has been no cessation of the use of the mine openings for haulage-ways and transportation between the other parcels and the shaft, that user continuing to be exercised in like manner as it has been from the start.”</p>

Therefore, regardless of the stage of exhaustion of the coal in the Lillibridge, defendant is in lawful possession of all and singular the mine openings, etc., therein; it is entitled to the free use and enjoyment thereof so long as the occasion which gave rise to the grant shall continue to exist, and its right in that particular is exclusive.” To this the chancellor adds: “Just what rights plaintiffs may eventually have in any pillars which may in the end be left in place, upon cessation of the mining and the abandonment of the operation, is a question with which this issue is not presently concerned, and any attempt to decide it at this time would be premature; but, on the facts as they now appear, no present right...... of......possession is shown to be in plaintiffs.” In all of which we concur.</p>
