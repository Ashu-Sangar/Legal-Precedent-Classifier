    <p class="summary" id="b457-6" data-blocks='[["BL_457.7",457,[129,1228,1157,422]]]'>The covenants in this case which bind the defendant provide that it, as agent for the lessor (the plaintiff), shall pay to and distribute among the stockholders of the lessor entitled to receive the same a certain amount per share in each year, and also to pay “all taxes, charges and assessments now or hereafter lawfully imposed upon the lessor’s existing bonds, capital stock, real and personal property and future dividends.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b457-7" data-blocks='[["BL_457.8",457,[125,1662,1158,692]]]'>In our opinion this lease comes within the ruling of Catawissa R. R. Company v. Phila. &amp; Reading Ry. Company, <a href="/pa/255/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="255 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="1027681" data-case-paths="/pa/255/0269-01">255 Pa. 269</a>. In that case the covenant required the lessee to pay any taxes upon the capital stock of the lessor company or the dividends thereon. In the case at bar the only feature of the covenant on which an argument could be made which would bind the defendant would be that part requiring it to pay taxes assessed upon future dividends. As the Chief Justice pointed out in the Catawissa case the tax levied by the Federal Government was not a tax upon dividends but a tax upon income. For these reasons judgment must be entered for the defendant.</p>
