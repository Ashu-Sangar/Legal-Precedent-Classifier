Coffey, the last survivor of the testator’s children, died in 1902, leav- ■ ing a will whereby she undertakes to dispose of the shares of her deceased brothers and sisters under her father’s will and as having vested in her on their successive deaths; and the question in this case is whether they did so vest as contended by the Fidelity Trust Company, <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>which, intervened as a defendant to protect its interest under the will of Mrs. Coffey or devolved either by the will or by the intestate laws, upon the children of Mrs. Coffey who are parties to the bill.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b333-3" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[128,566,1157,970]]]'>The first question which arises on examining the part of the will above quoted is as to what is meant by the words, “after the death of my sons and daughters.” Standing alone these words may be taken collectively or distributively; that is, they may mean a single period after the death of all his sons and daughters, or, in other words, at the death of the survivor of his sons and daughters; or they may refer to the time after the death of each son and daughter. In order to determine which of these the testator meant, it is necessary to look to the nature of the dispositions which are made to take effect upon this event or these events. The testator proceeds to provide for three contingencies upon the death of his sons and daughters; first, if they should die leaving children and leaving a will disposing of the property among those children; second, if they should die leaving children, but without such a will; and third, if they should die without leaving children at all.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[125,1548,1157,864]],["BL_334.1",334,[263,350,1159,856]]]'>It is very evident that all of these provisions are made to refer to the same time and all together they dispose of every possible contingency. The provision in case any of his children should die without issue living at the time of his death was that the share of such child should be paid to the survivor or survivors of them. The words “after the death of my sons and daughters” can therefore not possibly be taken to mean after the death of all of them, or otherwise we should have the testator directing a share to be paid to the survivor of his children when according to the hypothesis there could be no survivor. It seems, therefore, very certain that the provisions as to the devolution of his estate after the death of his sons and daughters were intended to take effect immediately upon the death of each son and daughter as it occurred. On the other hand, it seems equally clear that the trust ere<a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>ated by the will for the support of his children was intended to last until the death of the last survivor of them, as each one of them was entitled to a share in the joint income of all the property involved. When, therefore, the testator directed that after the death of each of his children, “the same shall become vested in their respective children,” it is evident that he intended that they should each take their share subject to the trust while it lasted; that is, that during the continuance of the trust the children of his children should receive the income from his trustee, in other words, should hold the land subject to the trust. And this is what he means when he says that in case there are no children of his children the share of each shall be paid over to the survivor. So long as the trust subsisted it would be properly designated as a paying over.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b334-4" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[257,1218,1159,918]]]'>If, instead of using the words “paid over,” the testator had said that these shares should go or be given to the survivors, or had used any similar expression, there would seem to be no doubt whatever that this would give to the survivors the same share which he intended the children of each of his children to have if they existed. It is only the fact that the words “paid over” are not appropriate for the devolution of real estate, from which any doubt could arise as to this intention. If by using these words he meant only the income, then he died intestate as to the corpus of each of the five shares. There is nothing else in the will which can be construed as disposing of them. He is not to be deemed to have died intestate as to this property if by any fair interpretation of the will it can be avoided, especially where, as in this case, the provisions of the will seem to be intended to dispose of every case that may arise.</p>

We are unable to see how this throws any light upon the matter, as its only effect is to enable the executors to dispose of the coal at any time after his death that they should deem proper, and to add the proceeds of it to the income which they were to use or accumulate.</p>
