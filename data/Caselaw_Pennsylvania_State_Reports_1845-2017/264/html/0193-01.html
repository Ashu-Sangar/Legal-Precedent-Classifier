On an attachment execution, a judgment on a verdict in favor of the garnishee -will he sustained, where it appears that the defendant, a contractor, was building a railway for the garnishee; that, on a settlement of accounts between defendant and garnishee <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>one week after the attachment was issued, it was discovered that the defendant, who had been paid for his work in bonds, had received by mistake or inadvertence $1'T,500 of bonds in excess of what was due him; that the bonds had been delivered to defendant without strict regard to estimates, as the work progressed, in order to facilitate their sale; and that these particular bonds had been delivered to defendant before the attachment issued, but that the credits therefore, by defendant’s direction, had not been made until after that date.</p>

In such a case the plaintiff cannot contend that since the bonds were given defendant, they belonged to him, and not to the garnishee, and that after the attachment was served, neither the status of such securities nor the proceeds from the sale thereof, could in any manner be changed by a settlement of the accounts between the defendant and garnishee in which plaintiff took no part.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b226-5" data-blocks='[["BL_226.5",226,[255,1073,1153,357]]]'>3. The real question was whether the garnishee owed defendant anything when the attachment was served. If, at the time, defendant was overpaid, and a balance of the account was due the garnishee, an adjustment in good faith of that balance, even after the date of the attachment, by paying back the proceeds from the sale of the bonds inadvertently advanced, could not make the funds thus received by the garnishee subject to the attachment, for these bonds, in reality, never belonged to defendant.</p>

On an attachment execution, where a traction company for which the defendant, under a contract, is building a railway, is served as garnishee, a claim that an initial payment in cash to which defendant was entitled under the contract, had not in fact been paid to him by the garnishee, is not sustained by evidence to the effect, that the check for that amount, of a railway company, with whom defendant had also a construction contract, was given to the traction company, the garnishee, which on the same day, gave its check to defendant for a like amount, and this or the latter’s check for the same amount, was given to the railway company; that all these checks were drawn upon the same company; and that the total capital stock of the garnishee amounted exactly to the amount represented by the cheeks. Such evidence shows that the railway company had either actual cash in bank or sufficient credit to meet the check given to the garnishee, and that upon the deposit of such cheek the latter had an adequate balance to its credit, when it made the payment to defendant in absence of allegation or proof of fraud.</p>

When the matter came to trial, the jury found a verdict in garnishee’s favor, upon which judgment was entered, and plaintiff has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b229-4" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[153,970,1160,1297]]]'>Defendant was engaged as a contractor in the construction of a street railway for the garnishee when, in an effort to collect a ten-year-old judgment, which plaintiff held against defendant, the present attachment issued. As a result, defendant, being- unable to finance his contract, withdrew therefrom, and, at a settlement of accounts between him and the garnishee, which occurred March 11, 1915, it was discovered that he had been overpaid, in bonds of the latter, some $17,500. In other words, by the terms of the contract between defendant and garnishee, the former was entitled to receive from the lattei’, for work completed up to date of service of attachment, some $126,800, whereas, through inadvertence, he had been paid, in round figures, $144,300. So that the garnishee not only held no property or credits of defendant, but, on the contrary, he owed it the amount of the overpayment; which was refunded by the brokerage firm that had charge of marketing garnishee’s bonds, transferring from defendant’s to garnishee’s account credits from the sale of these securities, amounting to $15,312.50, the bonds having been sold at defendant’s orders prior to the attachment, although the transfer of credits (which likewise was made at the latter’s direction) did not take place till after that date.</p>

This witness suggested the bonds in question were paid defendant without strict regard to estimates, or work actually done, in order to get them on the market in such lots, “when the money would be paid out on construction work as it went along”; and that, in following this course, the overpayment inadvertently occurred.</p>
    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[288,730,1150,532]]]'>Plaintiff contends that, since the bonds were given defendant, they belonged to him and not to the garnishee, and, after the attachment was served, neither the status of such securities nor the proceeds from the sale thereof could in any manner be changed by a settlement of accounts between defendant and garnishee in which plaintiff took no part; therefore, when either the bonds or their proceeds\were paid back to the garnishee, they were defendant’s property and, as such, immediately became subject to the previously levied attachment.</p>
    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[287,1273,1150,687]]]'>The real question upon which this branch of the case turns, however, is: Did the garnishee owe defendant a balance on the contract when the attachment was served? If it did not, then nothing in its hands became bound by the attachment; and (if as a matter of fact defendant was at that time overpaid), the balance of the account being due to garnishee, an adjustment, in good faith, of that balance, even after the date of the attachment, by paying back the proceeds from the sale of bonds inadvertently advanced to defendant, could not make the funds thus received by the garnishee subject to the attachment, for those bonds, in reality, never belonged to defendant.</p>

The trial judge, summing up the issues in hand, said: “All this testimony has a bearing only upon whether the garnishee received these $17,500 in bonds, or the proceeds of these bonds, or a credit for the proceeds, at a time <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>when Vandegrift did not owe them anything. If Vandegrift had been overpaid he owed them that overpayment. Now, if this amount was simply paid back to square that overpayment, then your verdict should be in favor of the garnishee in this case. On the other hand, if it was not paid back to square that overpayment, and if either these bonds, or the proceeds, or any part of the proceeds legally belonged to Vandegrift at the time of the attachment, or subsequent thereto, and were in the hands of the garnishee at the time of the service of the attachment, or subsequent thereto, then your verdict should be in favor of the plaintiff.” This practically covers what was repeated in answers to points, also complained of; and we see no error therein.</p>

The contract between garnishee and defendant provides that the latter shall be paid a consideration of $169,625 “consisting of $34,000 in cash and $155,000 of the company’s first mortgage......bonds at a price of 87these payments to be made on “semi-monthly estimates of the proportionate amount of work performed, material and equipment delivered.” Before any substantial work had been done, this first payment of $34,000 was made by garnishee to defendant, in the following manner: August 3, 1914, a check of the railway company for $34,000 was given to garnishee, who, on the same day, gave its check to defendant for a like amount; and this, or the latter’s check for a similar amount, was, on August 5, 1914, given to the railway company. All these checks were drawn upon the same trust company; and, from such <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>fact, together with the further circumstance that the total capital stock of the garnishee amounted to exactly $34,000, plaintiff contends it could justifiably be found that this alleged first payment to defendant was “not in fact made”; and, hence, he insists that, in settling the accounts between garnishee and defendant, the sum of $34,000 ought to be deducted from the payments which the former claims to have been made to the latter. If this course were pursued, it would leave a considerable sum due and owing by garnishee to defendant, at the date of the attachment.</p>

Here it was shown that the railway company had either the actual cash in bank or sufficient credit to meet its draft of $34,000, when the check was given to garnishee, and that, upon the deposit of such check, the latter had an adequate balance to its credit when it made the payment to defendant.</p>

Vandegrift.” The court refused this offer; and subsequently, in vindication of its ruling, stated: “The offer of the opinion of the expert was rejected for the reason that there was nothing before the court which was the subject of opinion evidence; the books of the company, with one exception, were not called for or offered, and these books might well have explained the entries and transactions to which they related without the opinion or conclusion of any expert.” In this we see no error.</p>

      <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>Finally, appellant complains that the court erred in refusing to affirm this point: “If the jury believe that the accounts of the Ephrata &amp; Lebanon Traction Company, as between itself and Joseph A. Vandegrift, as contained in the journal of the said Ephrata &amp; Lebanon Traction Company, are not true and correct in every material particular, and that such material entries were made for the purpose of fabricating evidence in its behalf and against the plaintiff’s interest, the jury is justified in disregarding the defenses of the garnishee of either overpayment to Joseph A. Yandegrift, or of set-off against Joseph A. Yandegrift and the plaintiff.” Since neither the evidence produced nor that tendered would sustain the findings set forth in this request, it was properly refused.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[268,1168,1151,742]]]'>None of the authorities cited by appellant rules the facts at bar, nor is any novel point of law raised which requires discussion. We have disposed of all the important questions in the case; since they are treated by us as though every material fact offered in evidence had been actually established by competent proof, it is not necessary to pass specifically upon the many assignments which complain of the refusal of testimony; and, as to those which criticize the charge, keeping in mind what has already been said upon that subject, it is only necessary to state we see no material error .therein; in conclusion, the complaint that the court below erred in refusing plaintiff judgment n. o. v. is entirely without merit.</p>
    <p id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[316,1932,531,42]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
