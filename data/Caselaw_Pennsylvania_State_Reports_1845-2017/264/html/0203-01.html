An attachment execution was issued against a railway company to attach shares of stock standing in the name of the defendant in the execution. After judgment against the garnishee, an appeal was taken, and, in lieu of bail on appeal, a stipulation was entered into by the plaintiff and defendant in the attachment proceedings, and a corporation and others claiming ownership of the stock, by which it was agreed that the shares should be deposited with the prothonotary of the lower court, that the garnishee might prosecute its appeal, that the appeal should not be a supersedeas, that the plaintiff might proceed by interpleader proceedings, by serving the claimants with an appropriate writ; that the alleged owners should have the right to file a claim for the stock alleged to be owned by them, and that the question of the ownership' of the shares should be determined in the proceedings in the manner provided by the Sheriff’s Interpleader Act of 1897. The garnishee did not prosecute its appeal; but the defendant instituted the interpleader proceedings, as soon as an attempt was made physically to take the stock in execution. The corporation claimant of the stock was not a party in the attachment proceedings, was not served therein, did not intervene, and had no notice of them, other than the knowledge of certain of its officers acquired when they were not acting for the claimant. <em>Meld, </em>(1) that the claim of the corporation 'alleging ownership of the stock was not res adjudieata by the attachment proceedings; (2) that the corporation could under the stipulation establish its ownership of the stock in the interpleader proceedings; (3) that the fact that the appeal of the garnishee was not pressed, was immaterial.</p>

It may be further noted that the stipulation particularly provides that “Should the Supreme Court finally decide said appeal ......in favor of the garnishee, then the prothonotary is hereby authorized and directed to return forthwith said 2,327 shares of stock to the Duquesne Bond Corporation [and other claimants named], notwithstanding the pendency of the execution and the sheriff’s inter-pleader,” but the stipulation is significantly silent as to any duty to hand over such stock, or give other satisfac<a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>tion to the present defendant (plaintiff in that case), should the appeal be decided in its favor.</p>

Yandegrift, defendant, on the stock books of the said garnishee.’” So far as the case now before us is concerned, the sole effect of the attachment judgment against garnishee is to adjudicate, as between that corporation and the person in whose name the stock stood, the fact that the latter was the owner of such stock, free of any lien or obligation to the garnishee corporation; and this only for the purpose of clearing the way for a subsequent fi. fa. to take the stock in execution.</p>
    <p id="b243-4" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[147,1343,1156,525]]]'>When carefully read and considered in connection with their facts, it will be seen that Weaver v. Huntingdon, etc., R. R.

L. 126, 128, provides that “No attachment or levy upon shares of stock for which a certificate is outstanding shall be valid until such certificate be actually seized by the officer making the attachment or levy, or be surrendered to the corporation which issued it, or its transfer by the holder be enjoined.” Here, as soon as an attempt was made to enforce the attachment, by way of execution against the stock, plaintiff immediately acted to protect its alleged ownership, and it did this in the manner agreed upon in <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>the before mentioned stipulation. Had plaintiff done nothing, and allowed the stock claimed by it to be physically taken in execution and sold as the property of the defendant, Vandegrift, in whose name such stock stood when the attachment was served on garnishee, a different question might be presented; which, as the case stands, need not be considered.</p>
    <p id="b244-4" data-blocks='[["BL_244.4",244,[249,728,1149,208]]]'>We have already decided that plaintiff proved its ownership of the stock in controversy; but, in that connection, several contentions are made by appellant, which, perhaps, may be discussed profitably.</p>
    <p id="b244-5" data-blocks='[["BL_244.5",244,[248,945,1153,751]]]'>Appellant attacks the validity of the voting trust under which, just prior to the attachment, the stock was held for plaintiff; but this attack is sufficiently disposed of by the following short excerpt from the paper-book of counsel for appellee: “Even if the voting trust was illegal and nudum pactum [which counsel well argue it was not], the ownership of the stock must rest somewhere. Vandegrift had sold his title, for value, to appellee, which had deposited the stock with the trust company [that acted for the voting trust], and appellee held the certificates of the trust [to the effect] that the trustees held the stock for it; therefore, if for any reason the trust agreement failed, the stock reverted to appellee.”</p>

It appears that, simultaneously with the termination of the voting trust, on February 15, 1915, the trustees executed these assignments in a sufficient number to furnish one for each stock certificate, forthwith delivering them to appellee, with the intention and upon the understanding that it should attach the several assignments to the stock certificates, when the latter were received from the trust company which acted as the depositary of such stock. <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>Subsequently appellee exchanged the voting trust certificates for the stock due it, the stock certificates being received on or about March 8, 1915, when the transfers, previously signed and delivered by the trustees, were immediately attached thereto. Section 9 of the Act of May 5, 1911, supra, provides that the delivery of a certificate without the endorsement requisite to a valid transfer thereof, but with the intent to make such a transfer, imposes an obligation, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, upon the person so delivering, to complete the transfer, and that, when completed, it shall take effect as of the time when the endorsement was actually made; and we find nothing in the act which, as between the parties to the transfer or their privies, requires a separate instrument of assignment to be delivered simultaneously with the certificate sought to be transferred. The general rule is that “Any [prior] bona fide assignment of stock for value will effectually pass the transferrer’s interest therein, so far as to supersede the rights of an attachment or execution creditor to levy upon it for a debt due by the transferrer”: 2 Daniel’s Negotiable Instruments, sec. 1708e; also see U. S. v. Vaughan, 3 Binney *394; Com. v. Watmough, 6 Wh. *117, *137 et seq. The contention under consideration is not sustained.</p>

At the time in question, the stock was registered on the books of garnishee company in the name of Vandegrift and, under Section 3 of the Act of May 5,1911, supra, that corporation could recognize “the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares..... .to vote as such”; this being the law, and, when the Vande<a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>grift proxy was acted upon, there being a contest oyer the ownership of the stock, the effect of its use cannot be given controlling significance. The incident was called to the attention of the jury, however, and, in connection therewith, they were told to consider any act of plaintiff “which may be inconsistent with its claim of ownership.” As previously said by us in this opinion, the facts in the case were for the jury; and the ones now under discussion, as well as all others, were submitted by the trial judge without substantial error.</p>

There the party, who appellant claims occupied a legal position analogous to that of the present appellee (although the proceedings were different in character), had an opportunity in a prior suit to protect his property interest, but, instead of doing so, “in effect authorized and directed” one of the litigants in such prior suit to “protect his rights”; we ruled that, under such circumstances, he was bound by the former adjudication as to the ownership of the property in controversy, and this upon the ground that “one who has notice of a suit brought to determine ownership of property upon which he claims a lien, and authorizes a party to the suit, who is in possession of the property, to take such steps as will protect the former’s rights, is concluded by the result of the litigation, although he does not intervene as a party.” The marks of distinction between Exler v. Wickes Bros, and the present case are too plain to require discussion; the other cases cited by appellant are likewise readily distinguishable on their facts, and none of them governs here.</p>
