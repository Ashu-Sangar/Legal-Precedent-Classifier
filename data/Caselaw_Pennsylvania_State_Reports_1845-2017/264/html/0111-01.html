As stated in the city solicitor’s brief, “The question as to whether or not the streets of a city are clean at any particular time is a matter susceptible of such wide divergence of opinion, that a contract for this purpose must deal mostly with the means by which that end is produced. It is necessary, therefore, to have specifications <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>based upon the experience of the department, showing what number of men, teams and implements shall be employed, how the work shall be done, in what manner the men must clothe and conduct themselves, so they may be easily identified and the work performed without offense to the public. The damage resulting from nonperformance of any of these items, or others like them, cannot be accurately determined. While the absence of a man, or an implement, might not prevent the cleaning of a street, yet it might keep a whole gang of men idle. The failure of the contractor to uniform men, or mark equipment, might result in no loss; on the other hand, it might make it difficult for the inspector to know whether or not the contract was being complied with and thus cause a great loss of time and effort on his part. Hence, the only fair method is that used in these' specifications, to set forth a list of violations with the deduction for each, so the contractor, in making up his estimates, may know what loss will be incurred by his failure of performance”; and, we may add, so public interests may be adequately protected: Malone v. Phila., <a href="/pa/147/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="147 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="829846" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0416-01">147 Pa. 416</a>, 421.</p>

As hereinbefore indicated, the specifications contained two clauses, each designating a referee, or arbitrator, to determine questions under the contract; the first, section 16, names the engineer, and the next, section 76, designates the director. If the last mentioned clause did not appear, appellant’s present contention might well be sustained; but, when two arbitration provisions are inserted in an agreement, the first being so generally comprehensive in its scope as to apparently take in disputes of every nature, while the other is limited to certain defined questions, they may both stand; and, in construing such a contract, matters specified in the second clause, as particularly given to the referee there designated, will <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>be excepted from the wider jurisdiction previously conferred. When this rule is applied to the present case, it is clear the director, and not the engineer, was the person to pass upon and determine whether or not, as a matter of fact, the contractor had made the particular defaults alleged against him, and, if he had, then to deduct the stipulated damages; but he must do this in a legal and proper manner.</p>
