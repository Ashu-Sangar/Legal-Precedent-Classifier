Shimer pledged certain stock of the Crucible Steel Castings Company and the Pennsylvania Wire Glass Company to the Aldine Trust) Company, as.collateral for a loan; subsequently this collateral was bought in by the trust company, who sold part of it to W. K. Wetherill. Shimer filed a bill in equity against the trust company and Wetherill, praying that they be ordered to re-transfer to him so much of this stock as was then in their possession, and to account for such parts thereof as had been sold by them, together with dividends. After hearing, the bill was dismissed and plaintiff has appealed.</p>

    <p id="A_u" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[233,641,1157,1182]]]'>The chancellor found, inter alia, that the notes accompanying the collateral empowered the holders thereof, “for purposes of liquidation,” without demand or notice, to dispose of such collateral, either by public or private sale, “with a right on the part of such holders to become the purchaser and absolute owner thereof”; that, plaintiff being in default, all the stock pledged as collateral was, after demand and notice, offered at public vendue by well-known auctioneers in the City of Philadelphia, and, for want of other purchasers, the trust company bought in the Wire Glass Company stock for a sum sufficient to pay the balance of plaintiff’s debt, interest and costs; that, after selling all the stock which could be disposed of to others, for the figure which it had brought at the beforementioned public auction, defendant Wetherill, who is the president of the trust company, took 74 shares thereof in his own name, at the same price; finally, that every step in the matter of the sale of this stock was in strict accord with law and the contract between the parties, and “there was no conspiracy ......unlawfully to deprive Mr. Shimer of his 120 shares in the stock of the Pennsylvania Wire Glass Co.”</p>

At argument before us, plaintiff strenuously contended that this, as well as other findings of fact against him, were not “justified by the evidence” and <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>earnestly urged that the testimony be read in full, which we have done with the utmost care.</p>
