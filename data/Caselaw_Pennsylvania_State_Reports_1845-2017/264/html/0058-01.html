The answer denies such construction of it, but contends that it is testamentary in its character. Blackstone defines a will as “The legal declaration of a man’s intention which he wills to be performed after his death”; Kent’s Commentaries defines it as a writing disposing of real and personal property, or both, to take effect after the death of the maker, and such writing is generally denominated as “last will and testament.” The writing is not restricted to any particular form under statutory provision, or any particular language, if the obvious purpose of the writing is to effect a disposition of the maker’s property after death. The essence of the definitions relative to a will is that it is a disposition to take effect after death; whatever the form of the instrument, if it vests no present interest, but only directs what is to be done after the death of the maker, it is testamentary: Turner v. Scott, <a href="/pa/51/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="51 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="999790" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0126-01">51 Pa. 126</a>; <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>Wilson v.

    <p class="summary" id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[239,481,1156,1722]]]'>Turning to said writing and eliminating words not directly essential, so as to secure a proper perspective, we find it would read as follows: “I will give my home ......619 Linden St. to......Angelina Kern. For special favors and honest kind work and good service ......during the last three month and before. She shall have my home which I promised to her......for staying with me. to the end of my life. I......order my executor James Kressler......to sign said deed ...... and after my death to hand and deliver...... said deed to......Angelina Kern.” The maker of the writing was then quite old, and the writing was made within a few days of his death. The beneficiary named in it, had been with him as housekeeper for upwards of three years; the maker evidently intended to further provide for her for the care and attention she had given him in his later years; the paper indicates that such was the moving cause; the language used is as follows: “for special favors and honest kind work and good service she has done for me during the last three month and before. She shall have my home which I promised to her. Also for the last three years past for staying with me. to the end of my life.” That the writing was to take effect in futuro is shown by the following expressions used: “I will give,” “She shall have,” “I name and order my executor, James Kressler lawful to sign said deed over to in her name, and after my death to hand and deliver said deed to her, Angelina Kern.” She was to have no present interest; what was to be done to make the writing effective, was to be done by the executor, after the maker’s death. It was testamentary in its character.</p>
