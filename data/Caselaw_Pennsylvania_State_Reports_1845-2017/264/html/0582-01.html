Here, however, the alleged bargain is between a mother and her two sons for the maintenance of a home by the latter for the former, and, in the making of such a contract, it must be assumed the mother desired to provide for something more than mere shelter and food; that she desired, contemplated and bargained for the companionship, comfort, personal attention and affection of her own flesh and blood, and none of the contracting parties intended that the mother, in her old age, should be obliged to live with such strangers to her blood as might acquire the real estate in question. Thus it may be seen that the alleged contract, in this case, calls for something more, of a personal nature, than the mere payment of money for the support and maintenance of <em>plaintiff; </em>and, in addition, it expressly requires the sons to live upon and manage the farms during the whole of their mother’s life. Such an undertaking is a distinctly personal one, which terminated with the death of the two boys (Eastman v.

The two sons being alive at the time the pleadings were made up, the points in question could not have been so raised; but, when the death of the sons was suggested of record, and subsequently proved by defendants, plaintiff’s request for binding instructions necessarily called for consideration not only of the legal adequacy of the evidence depended upon to prove the contract alleged by defendants, but (in view of the record as it then stood) it also involved the potency of that contract, if proved, to overcome plaintiff’s title. We conclude that, in either aspect of the case, defendants were not entitled to go to the jury; hence no good purpose would be served by a new venire, and none of the alleged trial errors needs to be considered.</p>
