T., 1919, by John H. Heiss, from decree of O. C. Philadelphia Co., April T., 1904, No. 463, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in Estate of Thomas Kessler, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Frazer, Walling, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication by Gest, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that Thomas H. Kessler died on May 2,1904, leaving a will and codicils, by which he devised and bequeathed his residuary estate to his executors in trust to pay the income to his wife, Clara E. Kessler, for the term of her life, and upon her decease to pay the income to his brother, George F. Kessler, if living, for the term of his life, and upon the decease of both his said wife and brother.\nThe fifth clause was as follows: \u201cFor the better management and final distribution of my estate I authorize and empower (and after the decease of my wife and brother which ever shall last happen order and direct) my said executors and the survivor of them to sell and dispose of the whole or any part of my real estate, &c.\u201d\nClara E. Kessler, the widow, died May 23,1916, having been predeceased by George F. Kessler, the brother, who died February 3,1915, so that the trust has terminated.\nThe fund before the court includes only the sum awarded by the board of viewers for damages for taking ground of the decedent in the opening of Broad street through real estate of which he died seized.\nThe court distributed the fund as personal property.\nExceptions to the adjudication were dismissed. (See 28 Dist. Rep. 171.) John H. Heiss, a residuary claimant, appealed.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing exceptions to the adjudication.\nIsaac Gordon Forster, with him Abraham Wernich and Rowland C. Evans, for, appellant.\nCharles I. Cronin and Owen J. Roberts, for appellee,\nwere not heard.\nApril 21, 1919:"
