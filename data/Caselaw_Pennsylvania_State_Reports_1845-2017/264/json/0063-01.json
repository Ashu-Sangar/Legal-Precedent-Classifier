    "head_matter": "Commonwealth v. Moon, Appellant.\nCriminal law \u2014 Murder\u2014Evidence\u2014Threats\u2014Malice.\nOn the trial of an indictment for murder, it is not error to admit evidence that defendant employed as a miner by the deceased, and on a strike, threatened shortly before th^ killing to \u201cfix the clock\u201d of the deceased, and made threats against the deceased and other men who were working in the mine. Such evidence is proper to show malice, hatred and ill will on the part of the defendant towards his victim.\nArgued Feb. 3, 1919.\nAppeal, No. 4, Oct. T., 1919, by defendant, from judgment of O. & T. Somerset Co., Sept. T., 1918, No. 6, on verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree in case of Commonwealth v. Bertie Franklin Moon.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Stewart, Moscitzisker, Walling and. Simpson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nIndictment for murder. Before Ruppel, P. J.\nAt the trial the evidence of the Commomvealth tended to show that on August 13, 1918, the prisoner who was employed by Ernest W. Saylor, as a miner, deliberately shot his employer with a shot gun. The prisoner was on a strike at the time.\nWhen Grant Lytle, a witness for the Commonwealth, was on the stand the following offer was made:\nThe Commonwealth proposes to prove by the witness on the stand that when the defendant was riding with him on the morning of the day of the shooting in the direction of his boarding house, he stated to the witness, after talking of the trouble, that he was going out to the mine to fix Saylor\u2019s clock; said threat having been made about eight o\u2019clock in the morning and the shooting later occurred about 9:30 o\u2019clock the same morning.\nObjected to. Objection overruled and exception (1).\nWhen Hazel Younkin, witness for the Commonwealth, was on the stand, the following offer was made:\nThe Commonwealth proposes to prove with the witness on the stand that the defendant on the morning of the shooting had come over to the house of George Hyatt, who had gone to work in the mine of Ernest W. Saylor, after the defendant and the other men had refused to work any longer; that he then and there called the said George Hyatt scab aAd other names; this to be followed by proof that the defendant then came to the home of the witness and there repeated said conversation, calling the men scabs and made threats against the deceased and other men who were in the mine that day; this is offered for the purpose of establishing the defendant\u2019s motive for committing the crime and also for showing of malice, hatred and ill will against the deceased.\nBy Mr. King: This is objected to because the offer does not propose to show that the remarks were made to or in the hearing of the deceased, or in any way related to him, but were in regard to other parties; and as to the threats, the offer does not propose to show what the threats are, and without stating what the threats are specifically, they could not be evidence to be used against bim and the evidence is therefore immaterial and inadmissible.\nObjection overruled; exception (2).\nVerdict of guilty of murder of the first degree on which judgment of sentence was passed. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1, 2) rulings on evidence as above and (3-8) various portions of charge and answers to points, quoting them.\nAlexander King, for appellant.\nVirgil R. Saylor, District Attorney, Charles F. Uhl and Norman T. Boose, for appellee,\nfiled a printed brief but made no oral argument.\nFebruary 24, 1919:"
