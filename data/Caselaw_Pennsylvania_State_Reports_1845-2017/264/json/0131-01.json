        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nDuring the last illness of Frank Bean, the present decedent, his housekeeper saw upon his bureau a pocketbook and some keys belonging to him. With his consent she locked them in her trunk for safekeeping, stating that she would return them to him when he was all right. But he did not recover. On the day after the funeral she Opened the pocketbook, found in it two promissory notes, one for $565, signed by Henry J. Frankenfield to the order of decedent, and endorsed by decedent, \u201cThis note is void after my death\u201d; the other for $3,000 signed by decedent to the order of Laura Frankenfield, wife of Henry J. Frankenfield; and handed them to said parties. The pocketbook, the rest of its contents, and the keys, she gave to the administrator.\nWhen the account of the administrator was filed, Laura Frankenfield presented a claim \u201con this note ......as a creditor,\u201d being the one for. $3,000, proved decedent\u2019s signature and rested. The heirs at law then gave in evidence the above stated facts as to possession of the note, and that claimant, who was a niece of decedent\u2019s wife, lived with them as a member of their family, and rested. Claimant then proved that she went to live with decedent when she was six years old, was treated as one of the family, and continued to reside with him until she was twenty-three years of age, during which time she helped in the house and store, and on the farm. The auditor finds that \u201cwhile she resided with the decedent, the claimant attended school, was treated as one of the members of the family, being clothed by decedent\u201d; and \u201chelped to wait on the store, did housework, waited on her aunt while she was ill, and even assisted in the farm work\u201d as any member of his family would. The above is all the admissible evidence in the case ; but even if we include that of Henry J. Frankenfield, husband of the claimant, despite his in competency as a witness (Sutherland v. Ross, 140 Pa. 379; Reap v. Dougher, 261 Pa. 23), and the objection made on.that ground; and the evidence of conversations with decedent\u2019s wife, not shown to have been made in his presence, and of course not admissible to charge his estate, the only addition to the foregoing will be that decedent said claimant had worked faithfully, was a good girl and \u201cwill be provided for.\u201d\nThe auditor further says: \u201cIf there was nothing more to sustain this claim than the declarations of the decedent that Laura would be well provided for, or other loose expressions of like character, the evidence would clearly not justify the allowance of the claim, but those expressions, taken in conjunction with decedent\u2019s own act in making the note, present a different question.\u201d The auditor then asks a series of questions: (1) Why should decedent have cancelled the husband\u2019s note and retained this one, \u201cunless he intended that this note to the claimant should represent his acknowledgment of his indebtedness to her for her services?\u201d (2) Why should he write it \u201cif he did not intend to give the payee of the note an obligation which she could collect?\u201d (3) If he did not intend this note as an acknowledgment \u201cwhy would he have permitted the pocketbook containing this note to pass into the possession of Mrs. Krial and be taken charge of by her during his illness?\u201d Deeming those questions unanswerable, and apparently not recognizing the vital distinction between an unexecuted intention and one that is executed, he allowed the claim because of the cases hereinafter considered. The court below stating the same facts, and reviewing the same cases, approved the auditor\u2019s conclusion, decreed accordingly, and this appeal by decedent\u2019s heirs and next of kin followed.\nAs the family relation existed between claimant and decedent, there is no presumption of a liability to pay for her services: Amey\u2019s App., 49 Pa. 126; whether they were rendered in household or business affairs: Barhite\u2019s App., 126 Pa. 404; and no recovery can be had therefor except upon clear and satisfactory evidence of an express promise to pay: Neel\u2019s Adm. v. Neel, 59 Pa. 347. In the present case there is no evidence of an express promise; and hence we start with the fact that her claim of an \u201cindebtedness to her for her years of faithful service,\u201d has no legal basis upon which to rest. True, decedent could recognize a moral claim, but his recognition thereof is of no moment unless accompanied by evidence of ah express promise to pay: Neel\u2019s Adm. v, Neel, supra. In the present case there is no evidence of such promise, except as attempted to be derived from the undelivered note, which would not become a promise until delivered. The auditor and court below correctly decide that the \u201cloose expressions\u201d in the evidence \u201cwould clearly not justify the claim,\u201d yet they conclude that \u201cloose expressions,\u201d which do not justify the claim, conjoined with an undelivered note, which also does not justify it, together make the claim good, though no con nection is shown between the services, the \u201cloose expressions\u201d and the note. Necessarily this is error. Had decedent referred to the note in connection with the services, or even had he said he intended to recompense claimant for her services, something might be said in support of the claim; but the evidence is barren of anything in regard thereto. For all that appears the note may have been delivered, paid and returned, or may have been an intended but unexecuted gift; and certain it is the \u201cloose expressions\u201d testified to were more compatible with an intention to recompense by will, than by a promissory note, and were wholly valueless for any purpose: Walls\u2019s App., 111 Pa. 460; Ulrich v. Arnold, 120 Pa. 170; Miller\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 239, 249.\nThe cases relied upon by the claimant, the auditor and the court below, do not support the right to recover. In Toner v. Taggart, 5 Binney 490, the note was found among Toner\u2019s papers after his death, but the money out of which it was paid was in Taggart\u2019s possession, delivered to him by Toner who refused to take any obligation therefor, though he was studiously careful so to do in all other transactions between them. The court found as a fact that Toner in his lifetime \u201calluded to that paper as an act done in favor of Taggart,\u201d and counsel for the heirs and next of kin admitted if that was so the claim would be valid. In Fanny Miller\u2019s Est., 16 Lane. Law Eev. 3, claim was made upon three sealed notes, which the auditor found were executed and delivered in escrow by decedent in her lifetime, to be delivered to the parties interested after her death, in payment of services rendered; that course being taken because she was advised she could not make a will in favor of claimants, who were not related to her, but could pay them after her death by giving the notes, and hence she pursued that course. Moreover, the only objections there made to the allowance of the claim on the notes, was because of an alleged want of consideration therefor, and because the consideration, if there was any, was so inadequate as to taint the transaction with fraud. In Henry Miller\u2019s Est., 53 Pitts. L. J. (o. s.) 321, by agreement between claimant and decedent the latter had taken title to a property in which the former was interested, and on which she had paid considerable money, he agreeing to compensate her for her interest, and when asked if he had made out the note for the amount due her, he said not, but he would do so that day. She lived with him and the note was found in his possession. The auditor found he was indebted to her on the purchase of the property in the amount of the note, and allowed the claim. In Gilmor\u2019s Est., 158 Pa. 186, claim was made upon a series of notes in claimant\u2019s favor, and found in decedent\u2019s possession, with endorsements in decedent\u2019s handwriting, on the envelopes containing them, that they belonged to claimant and were given for money he owed her. So far as she proved, aside from the notes themselves, that decedent was indebted to her, the claim was allowed, but there was no recovery beyond that'. It is clear, therefore, none of the above cases lends any aid to the claim in the present case.\nThe decree of the court below is reversed, appellee\u2019s claim is disallowed, and the record remitted that distribution may be made to those entitled thereto.
