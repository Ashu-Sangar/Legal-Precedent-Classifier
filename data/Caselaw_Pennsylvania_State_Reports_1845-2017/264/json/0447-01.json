To which he replied, \u201cCollar.\u201d Counsel for defendant then proceeded, against plaintiff\u2019s objection, to elicit by cross-examination a more full account of the accident, to the effect that, just as the horse, which was being driven by the witness on a \u201ctight line\u201d and \u201cunder full control,\u201d came near the motortruck, another automobile unexpectedly swung around a street corner, immediately ahead, and, in passing, the mudguard of this vehicle struck the horse on the shoulder, whereupon it \u201creared up and nearly touched the roof of the wagon......, and, as it came down, ran against Mr. Reibstein, striking ......and throwing him against the corner of the truck.\u201d\nThe cross-examination was entirely proper (Vautier v. Atlantic Refining Co., 231 Pa. 8, 14; Quigley v. Thompson, 211 Pa. 107; Glenn v. Phila. & West Chester Traction Co., 206 Pa. 135; Smith v. P. T. Co., 202 Pa. 54, 57, 58; Jackson v. Litch, 62 Pa. 451, 455-6), and, either with or without the testimony thus elicited, defendant\u2019s negligence was not shown; hence a nonsuit was justified, and the court below did not err in refusing to remove it.\nJudgment affirmed.",
