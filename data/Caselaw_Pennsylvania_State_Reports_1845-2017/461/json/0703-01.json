        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nJONES, Chief Justice.\nHugh S. Woolett died testate on June 4, 1972. On June 20, 1972, following the naming of appellant Jean S. Gardner, administratrix c. t. a. of the estate, decedent\u2019s will was probated in Allegheny County. Thereafter, appellant filed an account which came up for audit on April 17,1974.\nOn June 3, 1974, the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County entered a decree providing that the residuary estate bear the burden of estate inheritance tax, debts and administrative expenses. Thereafter, appellant filed exceptions to the decree requesting that the heirs of testator\u2019s deceased brother be required to pay a proportionate share of the above-mentioned costs. Exceptions were denied by the court en banc and this appeal followed.\nAppellant\u2019s contentions involve the interpretation of the second paragraph of the decedent\u2019s holographic will. The will provides:\n\u201cLAST WILL AND TESTAMENT HUGH S. WOOLETT.\nIn the name of God, Amen.\nI, Hugh S. Woolett, bequeath my real estate at 282 Magnolia Place, Mt. Lebanon, to my brother, Kieth M. Wollett [sic] and his heirs.\nAll my personal property, consisting of all household effects, automobile, insurances, and everything I possess save the real estate described above, I give and bequeath to Jean S. Gardner.\nSigned this 20th day of June, 1969.\n/s/ HUGH S. WOOLETT.\nWitness:\n/s/ Leo Vogel\u201d\nIt is appellant\u2019s belief that the testator intended the second paragraph of his will to constitute a specific bequest as to his household effects, automobile and insurance policy and an \u201cindefinite legacy\u201d as to all other personalty. For purposes of abatement, appellant maintains there is no residuary bequest, that an \u201cindefinite legacy\u201d abates equally with a specific gift and that consequently all the beneficiaries under the will must pay a pro rata share of the estate\u2019s administrative expenses and taxes. We disagree.\nUnder the provisions of the Fiduciaries Act of 1949, P.L. 512, \u00a7 751, 20 P.S. \u00a7 320.751, property devised or bequeathed in a residuary clause or property disposed of in the form of a general bequest must abate before a specific devise or bequest in the payment of the decedents debts, funeral expenses and the cost of administering the estate. See Sorschek Estate, 422 Pa. 79, 221 A.2d 131 (1966). Likewise, the inheritance and Estate Tax Act of June 1961, P.L. 373, \u00a7 718, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-718, provides that if there is a residuary estate, it must bear the burden of inheritance tax unless the will provides otherwise. See Krogman Estate, 40 Pa.D. & C.2d 462, 464-5 (O.C.Phila.1966). Since the testator\u2019s will is completely silent with respect to the manner in which taxes and expenses be paid, if appellant is a general residuary legatee, she must bear the contested costs.\nIn the past we have defined a specific bequest as \u201ca gift by will of a specific article or part of the testator\u2019s estate, which is identified and distinguished from all other things of the same kind, and which may be satisfied only by delivery of the particular thing.\u201d Soles Estate, 451 Pa. 568, 573, 304 A.2d 97, 100 (1973); Beatty v. Hottenstein, 380 Pa. 607, 610, 112 A.2d 397, 399 (1955). In contrast, we have defined the residue of a man\u2019s estate as \u201cwhatever is not specifically devised or bequeathed . . . .\u201d Bricker\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 300, 303-4, 6 A.2d 905 (1939); Willard\u2019s Estate, 68 Pa. 327, 332 (1871). In all cases, the test must be the testator\u2019s intent to dispose of a residue. Klein Estate, 9 Pa.D. & C. 20 (O.C.Phila.1926). See also McKinney Estate, 435 Pa. 608, 258 A.2d 632 (1969). Since no particular language is necessary to convey the residuary estate, \u201cwords in any clause sufficiently broad to pass a general residue are not usually held to be restricted by association with other words of narrower import or by added attempts at enumeration.\u201d Rood on Wills (Second Ed. Section 520 p. 508). See also Armstrong Estate, 347 Pa. 23, 31 A.2d 528 (1943).\nLooking, as we must, at this will in its entirety, we find that testator specifically devised to his brother and heirs a particular parcel of land identified as 282 Magnolia Place. Thereafter, testator bequeathed to one Jean Gardner all else remaining in his estate (\u201csave the real estate described above\u201d). The intent to generally bequeath the residue seems clear.\nShould there be any doubt as to testator\u2019s intent, the party arguing a gift is specific must carry the burden of proof. Soles Estate, 451 Pa. 571, 304 A.2d at 99; Wilson\u2019s Estate, 260 Pa. 407, 103 A. 880 (1918); Ferreck\u2019s Estate, 241 Pa. 340, 88 A. 505 (1913). As this Court said in Snyder\u2019s Estate, 217 Pa. 71 at 74, 66 A. 157 at 158, \u201cIt is certainly true that the presumption of intention is favorable to general legacies in the first instance and that it requires clear proof of a restrictive intention to repel it.\u201d (Emphasis added).\nAppellant\u2019s only argument in favor of specificity is that testator\u2019s choice to enumerate the several types of personal property comprising his bequest to appellant negates the intent to generally bequeath. We can not accept this argument. A gift of residue including certain property does not, in itself, make the gift of that property specific. Nor does the \u201cmere fact that the testator enumerates some specific things in the gift of the residue (as \u2018all my furniture, cattle and all my other personal estate\u2019) . . . make the gift of those things specific.\u201d 2 Jarman on Wills (Seventh Ed. by Sanger 1003). See 2 Page on Wills (Second Ed. 2054 Section 1232). See also Reel\u2019s Estate, 266 Pa. 221, 109 A. 845 (1929); Ritter Estate, 77 Pa.D. & C. 37 (O.C.Lycoming 1951).\nSince the general enumeration of certain items, in a residuary clause, does not indicate clear proof of the testator\u2019s restrictive intent, and since the appellant has offered no other evidence indicating such restrictive intent, we find the lower court properly dismissed the exceptions.\nDecree affirmed. Appellant to bear costs.\nROBERTS, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nAlthough appellant has argued the entire second paragraph acts as a specific bequest, in the alternative, she maintains that this paragraph is comprised of both a specific bequest, i. e., the household goods, automobile and the insurances, and a \u201cgeneral legacy,\u201d i. e., the \u201ceverything I possess.\u201d Under this analysis, the \u201ceverything I possess\u201d (consisting of cash from testator\u2019s savings and checking account and social security benefits) must abate first. Since this would not cover all expenses and taxes, the deficit would then be paid on a pro rata basis, i. e., based on what was actually received by the beneficiaries under the will by reason of their specific bequests.",
