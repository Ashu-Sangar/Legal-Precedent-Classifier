Post-trial motions, which were permitted to be filed nunc pro tunc, were denied. A sentence of from two to eight years imprisonment was imposed. This appeal followed.\nAppellant raises the following issues for consideration: whether the trial court erred in permitting the prosecution to introduce as rebuttal evidence appellant\u2019s prior conviction for aggravated robbery and, whether the trial court erred in preventing appellant from introducing his statement made to the police as a prior consistent statement.\nWhile objections were properly made at trial, the aforementioned issues were not raised in support of post-trial motions. Consequently, appellant is precluded from raising these issues on appeal. Commonwealth v. Bronaugh, 459 Pa. 634, 331 A.2d 171 (1975); Commonwealth v. Reid, 458 Pa. 357, 326 A.2d 267 (1974); Commonwealth v. Clair, - Pa. -, 326 A.2d 272 (1974); Commonwealth v. Goodman, 454 Pa. 358, 311 A.2d 652 (1973).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.",
