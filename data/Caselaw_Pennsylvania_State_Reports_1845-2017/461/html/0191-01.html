    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[200,725,1150,1254]]]'>Appellant additionally contends that his signing of his confession was brought about by “suspect” police tactics which should vitiate the entire confession. Appellant points particularly to the fact that after the completion of his formal statement but before it was actually signed by him, his paramour, Stephanie Hill, and the two month old child of Tucker and Miss Hill were brought into the interrogation room. The purpose in bringing Miss Hill to the room was to have her read appellant’s statement to him, since the police were aware of his reading difficulty. During the reading of the statement appellant was holding his infant baby in his arms; he testified that the baby was crying, jumping and in need of a diaper change. We fail to see how these facts, even if true, support appellant’s claim of involuntariness. As the lower court observed in its opinion, “[a] smelly diaper has not yet been found to be police coercion.” The presence of Tucker’s paramour and the child itself, if it had any effect, tended to make appellant’s confrontation with the police <em>less, </em>not more, coercive. <em>See, e. g.

He suggested that Tucker might have signed the statement just to release the tension built up during his questioning and the reading of the statement by Miss Hill. At a later point in his testimony, the doc<a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>tor appeared to take the position that <em>anyone </em>who gave and signed a confession had to be “very masochistic.” His testimony suggests that the very giving of an inculpatory statement is indicative of some sort of emotional incapacity which should vitiate the voluntariness of the confession. The law has never recognized such a proposition. The suppression court was free to reject this theory, and also to consider it as weakening the doctor’s explanation of Tucker’s signing of the confession. The degree of credence to be given to opinion evidence of this sort is primarily within the discretion of the fact-finder, to whose judgment we will defer if there is support for it in the record. <em>Commonwealth v.

After being transported to the police administration building and being advised of his constitutional rights (which he waived), an intelligence summary was taken by the police, which included such things as Tucker’s full name, employer, address, etc. From 3:33 to 4:20 P.M., appellant gave a statement in which he admitted witnessing the stabbing, but denied being a participant. After being allowed to rest, appellant consented to a polygraph examination, which was administered to him from 4:45 to 8:20 P.M. He was then told that he had flunked the test.

Appendix. We need not, however, consider the merits of this argument because we find the issue to have been waived by the failure to raise it at trial. The exclusionary rule consequent upon violation of Rule 130 was announced in <em>Commonwealth v.

Although the suppression hearing in this case was held more than two years before the decision in <em>Futch, </em>appellant’s re-trial did not take place until December, 1973, some twenty months after <em>Futch. </em>The claim of error in not excluding the confession by reason of unnecessary delay was not made to the trial judge, but was raised for the first time on post-trial motions. This was untimely, and the issue will not now be considered by this Court. <em>Commonwealth v.

The appellant in his statement admitted that his reason for being in the men’s room of the theatre at 5:00 A.M. was to “lay for somebody to come through that we could steal some money off.” The obvious purpose of the prosecutor’s remarks was to explain why the defendant chose that particular place to rob someone.
