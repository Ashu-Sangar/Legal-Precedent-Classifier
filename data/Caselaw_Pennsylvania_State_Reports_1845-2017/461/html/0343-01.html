Norbert Cymbalista, Paulette’s husband, visited the hotel in August and, after discussions with the manager, became very concerned over the hotel’s financial condition. He discovered that there were unpaid bills in excess of $100,000, that all telephone and Telex communications had been cut off for nonpayment of bills, and that the filing of mechanics liens against the hotel was imminent. After a trans-Atlantic telephone call, the Cymbalistas travelled to the United States within several days of Norbert’s discoveries to attempt to resolve the hotel’s difficulties with Intraworld.

First, it contends that Cymbalista’s statement (as required by the credit) that “lessee . . . has not paid the installment of rent due under said lease on May 10, 1974,” is false and fraudulent because, after Cymbalista purported to terminate the lease in September, 1973, Intraworld was not obligated to pay rent and because the statement failed to disclose the termination of the lease.

From this premise Intraworld asserts the falsity of Cymbalista’s representations that she is the lessor and that the rent was due and unpaid. However, Intraworld did not attempt to prove to the trial court that, under Swiss law, Cymbalista’s attempted termination was effective. In fact, Intraworld’s Swiss counsel informed Cymbalista’s counsel on November 7, 1973, that Intraworld “cannot agree with your position according to which the lease contract can be considered as terminated . . . . ” Counsel added that Cymbalista was “at liberty to obtain payment by way of” the letters of credit.

When presenting the draft and documents to Girard in November, 1973, Cymbalista’s American counsel candidly admitted that “our client, as Lessor, takes the position that the lease has terminated . for various reasons . . . .’’In addition, Girard was a party to the first equity action and its counsel joined the agreement which terminated that action. .Cymbalista could reasonably have assumed in May, 1974, that Girard was fully aware of the positions of both Intraworld and Cymbalista.</p>

It argues that payment under the credit was permitted only for “rent,” and that Cymbalista (as she concedes) was in fact seeking the “stipulated penalty,” which is not “rent.” Intraworld concludes that Cymbalista was fraudulently attempting to draw under the credit for satisfaction of an obligation not secured by the credit.

The letter of credit (see note 7 supra) authorized Cymbalista to draw “the sum . . . due . . . under [the] lease,” without specifying that the “sum due” contemplated was only “rent.” The letter required that a draft must be accompanied by Cymbalista’s statement that “the lessee . . . has not paid the installment of rent due under said lease.” This is not equivalent to a limitation on availability of the credit only for nonpayment of rent; in fact, such nonpayment of rent is precisely the condition which triggers Cymbalista’s entitlement to the “stipulated penalty.” In short, Intraworld has failed to persuade us that the letter of credit was not <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>available to Cymbalista for satisfaction of the “stipulated penalty.”</p>

It provides that “[i]n the event the lessee should not fulfill its obligation to pay, so that the letter of credit must be used,” then the lessor was entitled to terminate the lease and “retain the <em>rent </em>paid or <em>guaranteed </em>[by the letters of credit] for the following year as a stipulated penalty for non-performance of the contract . . . .” (Emphasis supplied.) Because Intraworld did fail to pay the rent due on November 10, 1973, and May 10, 1974, Cymbalista could reasonably and in good faith have concluded that she had the right to draw on the credit for the “rent . . . guaranteed for the following year.”</p>

We hold only that Intraworld failed to establish that Cymbalista lacked a bona fide claim to the “rent . . . guaranteed . as a stipulated penalty” or that her demand under the credit lacked some basis in fact. Therefore, her documented demand was not shown to be fraudulent because she was seeking satisfaction of the “stipulated penalty.”</p>

It is clear that an issuer of a letter of credit must act in good faith, see 12A P.S. §§ 5-114(2) (b), 5-109(1). However, we are not persuaded that issuer bad faith is a circumstance justifying an injunction against honor; in most if not all instances of issuer bad faith, it would seem that a customer would have an adequate remedy at law in a claim against the issuer or a defense against the issuer’s claim for reimbursement. In any event, in this case Intraworld has failed to prove the existence of bad faith on the part of Girard. It was proved no more than that Girard failed to resolve the dispute over the rights and obligations of the parties to the lease in Intraworld’s favor. This Girard was not obligated to do. Its obligations included a careful scrutiny of the documents, but once it determined that the documents conformed to the requirements of the credit, it bore no responsibility for the performance of the lease obligations or the genuineness of the documents. 12A P.S. § 5-109(1) (a) &amp; (2). It would, we think, place an issuer in an intolerable position if the law compelled it to serve at its peril as an arbitrator of contract disputes between customer and beneficiary.</p>

Apparently, Cymbalista offered two translations of each letter as exhibits in the trial court; exhibits 1(T) and 3(T) are translations of the November 7 letter, 2(T) and 4(T) of the November <em>9 </em>letter. One set of translations was prepared by Girard, although it is unclear which one is Girard’s. The other set seems to have been prepared by an associate of Cymbalista’s American counsel. The confusion was compounded when an officer of Girard was cross-examined by Cymbalista’s counsel. The witness was requested to read exhibit 4(T) into the record. What he actually read, as stenographically recorded in the notes of testimony, corresponds to the document in the record labelled 2(T). At the close of the trial, Intraworld’s counsel objected to the admission of 2(T). However, Intraworld’s counsel failed to object when the officer of Girard read 2(T) into the notes of testimony.
