Two days later, May 9, 1971, at 12:45 p. m., appellant and his older brother were arrested at their home and taken to the police station. Appellant, who was 15 years old at the time, was placed alone in an interrogation room. During that day, he was interrogated on three different occasions by three different detectives. At all times he denied any involvement in the shooting. During the third interrogation session, which commenced at about 8:40 p. m., a detective told appellant that a witness had identified the appellant as the person who fired the fatal shot. Appellant then asked to speak to his brother, who was in a separate interrogation room. After talking to his brother, the appellant, in a fourth interrogation session, made an oral inculpatory statement at about 9:30 p. m. Almost 9 hours had elapsed since his arrest. The taking of a formal written statement commenced at 11:30 p. m., almost 11 hours after the arrest. The taking of this statement concluded at 12:57 a. m., when appellant signed it. Appellant was arraigned some time later. The precise time of his arraignment is not clear from the record. As a result of appellant’s statement, the police located and recovered the barrel and trigger housing of a .22 caliber rifle.</p>

Therefore, the prosecution argues, the confession was not “reasonably related” to any delay. To support this position, the prosecution cites <em>Commonwealth v.

The confession introduced into evidence at appellant’s trial constituted the bulk of the proof against him, and the prosecution does not contend that the delay was necessary. As to the third consideration, it is true that appellant denied involvement in the incident until informed of the witness’s accusation, however, the fact that the accusation may have <em>combined </em>with the unnecessary delay to induce <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>appellant’s confession does not mean that the confession is admissible.
