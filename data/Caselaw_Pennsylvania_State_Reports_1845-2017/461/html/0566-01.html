The Commonwealth, relying on the testimony of several eyewitnesses, police officers and the recorded statement of the victim, was able to show that during the course of a fist-fight between appellant, a member of the “Montgomery Street” gang, and Frank Thomas, a former member of the “Oxford Street” gang, the appellant pushed the deceased away, “backed off” a number of feet (anywhere <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>from five to ten) and reached into his waist for a gun. At that point, the Commonwealth alleges the appellant, with an outstretched hand, fired two or three times into a crowd of rival gang members. One of these shots mortally wounded Thomas. Although there was some question as to whether appellant had at some point earlier fallen to the ground and fired his weapon while attempting to get up, there was no evidence that appellant was knocked down by the deceased or that the deceased was in any way the aggressor. Further, there was a postmortem report and sufficient eyewitness testimony supporting the Commonwealth’s contention that appellant was standing facing the unarmed victim when he fired the fatal bullet.</p>

This is so for the reason that such an in-court declaration does not harm the calling party nor aid the opposing party.

Consequently, appellant would have us believe Foster’s testimony was as <em>neutral </em>as had he said “I do not remember.” We disagree. As was stated earlier, the trier of fact may choose to believe any part of any Commonwealth witness’s statement. Since Foster’s testimony reflects an unequivocal denial of seeing appellant and cast doubt on appellant having any role in the instant homicide, if the trial judge chose to believe Foster’s testimony, appellant would indeed have benefitted.

Appellant's convictions of voluntary manslaughter and carrying a concealed deadly weapon have been appealed directly to this Court, although only the appeal on the homicide judgment is properly so taken.

Although direct appeal was not timely, on July 13, 1972, London petitioned this Court for leave to file an appeal as if timely from the judgment of sentence. By order of July 29, 1972, this Court remanded the matter to the court below to determine whether appellant’s right to appeal had been violated and whether appellant was effectively represented by counsel. After an evidentiary hearing held on these issues, the court, on November 2, 1972, denied appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but granted appellant the right to file an appeal as if timely filed.</p>

Appellant also claims that, since the witness repudiated his prior inconsistent statement when cross-examined (claiming he was tired at the time of its making and consequently did not read it “too good”), the statement should not have been introduced into evidence. However, since Foster admitted his making, and identified his signature on, his statement to police, a proper foundation was laid and the prior inconsistent statement was admissible for credibility purposes.
