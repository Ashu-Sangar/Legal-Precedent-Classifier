Mrs. Edith Taylor, Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children (PARC), also called by defendants, testified that the current trend is to locate nursing home facilities for physically and mentally retarded children in areas where normal persons work and live and the daily activities of a community environment are present. Mrs. Taylor also testified that large isolated institutions are no longer desirable because parental access to urban nursing homes results in more frequent visits which are beneficial to these unfortunate young patients. Another witness for defendants, Mr. Manuel Kaufman, First Deputy Commissioner of Philadelphia Department of Welfare, concurred with Mrs. Taylor that urban location of facilities for the severely retarded best serves the welfare of the handicapped individual and their families, and further pointed out that in the Northeast area, where more than 10% of the city’s population resides, no such facilities are provided for that particular community.”</blockquote>
