Two young boys had observed a black Chevrolet in the same parking lot a few minutes before the shooting. They and another man heard shots, then saw the car speed from the parking lot driving the wrong way on a one-way street. Less than fifteen minutes later, Eddie Wilder and Richard Staples were arrested. The victim’s briefcase and the murder weapon were discovered in the Staples’ car. Appellant and Staples were both charged with armed robbery, assault with intent to kill and violation of the Uniform Firearms Act. Wilder did not post bail and was incarcerated. The victim died twenty-four days later on October 26, 1971. In separate jury trials, Wilder was convicted of murder in the first degree and Staples of murder in the second degree.

The only question is whether there was sufficient information at the time of the arrest to reasonably justify a belief by police that the Staples car was involved in the crime and that Wilder was involved as well. We find that there was. The arresting officers received a radio report of a full-size 1965 black Chevrolet, possi<a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>bly with a loud muffler, occupied by two black males. The car sped from the scene going the wrong way on the one-way street. Although Staples’ car was traveling at a normal speed and observing traffic signals when the officers stopped it, the car matched the full description broadcast over the radio. Furthermore, the arrest took place within fifteen blocks and less than fifteen minutes from the shooting. And, although the fact of appellant’s mere presence in the car at that time might not be sufficient to establish probable cause for his arrest, a combination of factors provided probable cause for appellant’s arrest. Probable cause for Wilder’s arrest depended upon an inference raised by his presence in the Staples car after the crime had occurred.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> All circumstances surrounding the apprehension can be taken into account in determining probable cause. <em>Commonwealth v.

Moments before the officers stopped the Staples car, they heard over the radio a report by another officer that the suspected car had sped past him at the Bloomfield Bridge near to where the arresting officers first observed the car. The physical description of the car with occupants and the circumstances surrounding the ultimate apprehension gave police sufficient reason to believe that this was the car which had been at the scene. Wilder’s presence in the car so shortly after the shooting led to the reasonable inference by police that he was the same person seen in the car fleeing the crime and a probable participant in the shooting. Both Wilder’s arrest and the seizure of the briefcase and murder weapon were based upon probable cause. <em>Cf. Chambers v.

The sum of the Commonwealth’s case was the evidence seized from the Staples car and appellant’s presence therein shortly after the shooting. It is uncontradicted that while appellant was held in custody and while the victim was in . the hospital, appellant made prompt and repeated requests for confrontation, all of which were denied. Identification requested by Wilder upon his arrest was crucial to his defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Shot twice in the abdomen, the victim had been attacked in a face-to-face confrontation. The victim, a black, twenty-three <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>year old college student, did identify his assailants as “two black kids,” as the preliminary hearing record reveals.

The victim, was twenty-three years old. His first words after being shot were to the effect that he had been attacked by “two black kids.” Staples, the driver, was twenty-three at the time; Wilder, the appellant, was thirty-nine, almost forty. Thus, identification evidence sought by appellant had at least the potential for exculpation. The police refusal to take appellant upon request to the victim effectively precluded confrontation. Suppression of the material evidence of identification was becoming irreversible and complete since the victim was dying. Identification had to be prompt or not at all.
