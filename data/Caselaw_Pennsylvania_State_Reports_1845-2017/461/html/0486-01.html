The statute, by its terms, punishes illicit sexual connection that results in the birth of a child. Although both male and female offenders may be charged under the Act, the sanction to be imposed against the female is limited to the payment of a $100.00 fine. On the other hand the male offender, in addition to being subject to pay a $100.00 fine, is also liable for lying-in expenses, maintenance of the said child during its minority, and funeral expenses if the child dies at birth or during the continuance of an order. The male offender may also be com<a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>pelled to give security to assure his compliance with the order of the court.</p>

See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1932 (Pamphlet, 1973). While section 732 does provide for punishment for both male and female who have willfully neglected or refused to reasonably support a child born out of wedlock, we do not believe that the fact that the woman under this statute could be punished and required to pay maintenance eradicates the inequality established under section 506. First, under the provisions of section 732, it appears that the right of the court to impose an order for maintenance is limited to future support. Thus lying-in expenses and cost of maintenance between birth and the entry of the order could not be recouped. Thus, the man would be liable for lying-in expenses and past support maintenance under section 506 whereas a woman could only be charged for future support after the date of the order.</p>
