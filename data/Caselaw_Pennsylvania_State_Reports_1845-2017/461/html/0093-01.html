First, the trial court must decide whether the photograph possesses inflammatory characteristics. If the Court finds that it does not, the picture is admissible as is any evidentiary item, subject, of course, to the qualification of relevance. If, but only if, the photograph is deemed to be inflammatory, the Court must then apply the balancing test set forth in the majority opinion, i. e., is the photograph of “such essential evidentiary value that [its] need clearly outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jurors.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

The opinion announcing the decision of the Court ignores what <em>Petrakovich </em>points to as a court’s preliminary inquiry, and instead proceeds to “balance” this picture’s “essential” evidentiary value against its potential for inflaming a jury. This is putting the cart before the horse, for in the absence of a finding that the photograph is indeed inflammatory, there is nothing which exists to be balanced. Beyond this, whatever the meaning of the word “essential” in the phrase “essential evidentiary value” it cer<a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>tainly must denote something more than mere relevance. The majority, however, would rob the word of any independent significance. That this is so is clearly demonstrated in the case at bar since, in light of the pathologist’s testimony, this photographic evidence was, at most, cumulative, and thus, only minimally relevant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
