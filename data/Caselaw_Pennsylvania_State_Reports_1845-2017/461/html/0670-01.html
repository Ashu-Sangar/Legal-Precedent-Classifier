    <p class="author" id="b904-4" data-blocks='[["BL_904.4",904,[343,420,320,34]]]'>PER CURIAM:</p>
    <p id="b904-5" data-blocks='[["BL_904.5",904,[289,482,1162,476]]]'>David Ash, the appellant, entered a plea of guilty in Luzerne County to murder generally. A three-judge court empaneled, pursuant to Rule 1115 [now 319A] of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, 19 P.S. Appendix, conducted an evidentiary hearing and entered an adjudication finding Ash guilty of murder in the first degree. A sentence of life imprisonment was imposed. This direct appeal from the judgment of sentence was then filed.</p>

    <p id="b904-7" data-blocks='[["BL_904.7",904,[278,1125,1166,809]]]'>An examination of the record discloses that no post trial motions were ever filed in the trial court. In order to preserve an issue for appellate review, it is necessary that the issue be presented initially to the trial court for decision via post trial motions. And this is so, whether the conviction results from a trial or a plea of guilty. <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/459/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="459 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="481057" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0589-01">459 Pa. 589</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="459 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="481057" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0589-01">330 A.2d 854</a> (1975). Issues not raised in post trial motions are deemed waived and may not be raised on appeal. However, in order to be effective as a waiver, the decision not to file such motions must be made knowingly and intelligently. In other words, the appellant must have “a full knowledge and understanding of its consequential effect on [his] right to appeal”. <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/459/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="459 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="481057" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0589-01">459 Pa. at 592</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="459 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="481057" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0589-01">330 A.2d at 855</a>.</p>
