Brodsky, </em><a href="/pa/397/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="397 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="1286224" data-case-paths="/pa/397/0463-01">397 Pa. 463</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.2d%20334" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="156 A.2d 334">156 A.2d 334</a> (1959), was not instituted by a group of private citizens seeking to establish appellant’s bar as a public nuisance. Rather, it was brought by the District Attorney of Lancaster County pursuant to a limited grant of authority contained in Section 6-611 of the Liquor Code, Act of April 12, 1951, P.L. 90, art. VI, 47 P.S. <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>§ 6-611 (1969). Section 6-611 (a) clearly defines a nuisance capable of being enjoined by providing that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b373-4" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[230,412,1105,422]]]'>“Any room, house, building, boat, vehicle, structure or place, except a private home, where liquor, alcohol or malt or brewed beverages are manufactured, possessed, sold, transported, offered for sale, bartered or furnished, or stored in bond, or stored for hire, in violation of this act, and all such liquids, beverages and property kept or used in maintaining the same, are hereby declared to be common nuisances.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b373-5" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[185,859,1148,307]]]'>Thus, in a suit instituted pursuant to section 6-611 the sole issue for determination is whether there have been violations of the Liquor Code. Testimony and evidence presented to show in what manner patrons conducted themselves other than on the subject premises is irrelevant and inadmissible.</p>
    <p id="b373-6" data-blocks='[["BL_373.6",373,[186,1197,1149,313]]]'>In the present case appellant admits that the testimony of a Liquor Control Board investigator established that violations of the Liquor Code had occurred on appellant’s premises several months before this action was filed. This admission, which is supported by the record, is alone sufficient to sustain the issuance of the injunction.</p>
    <p id="b373-7" data-blocks='[["BL_373.7",373,[182,1533,1153,802]],["BL_374.1",374,[255,307,1162,634]]]'>Furthermore, I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that the testimony of a police officer who testified from daily police logs concerning police calls to the vicinity of the bar was admissible. First, for the reasons stated above, if such testimony was offered to prove the conduct of patrons in the neighborhood, it was irrelevant to the sole issue presented. Second, if the testimony was offered to prove violations of the Liquor Code, its admission would violate appellant’s constitutional right to confront his accusers. As Justice Eagen noted in his dissenting opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Tick, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/427/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="427 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1910358" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0120-01">427 Pa. 120</a>, 125, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20866" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="233 A.2d 866">233 A.2d 866</a>, 868 (1967), suits instituted pursuant to section 6-611 are indistinguishable from criminal prosecutions because in each case a substantial sentence or punishment may be inflicted for a violation of <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>the law. We would not allow a conviction for any crime —murder, burglary, rape, possession of narcotic drugs —to stand if the only evidence against the defendant were uncorroborated statements contained in a police log. In the present case the contents of the police logs were read into the record by a police officer who was neither the entrant nor the custodian. While the identity of the entrants appeared beside each entry, appellant was denied the opportunity to have them brought into court and defend their accusations. The Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act was never intended to accomplish such an unconstitutional result.</p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[251,970,1159,306]]]'>Thirdly, even assuming the testimony was relevant and even assuming their admission did not deprive appellant of his constitutional rights, the record does not support the conclusion that such evidence satisfied the necessary qualifications set forth in the Act.
