The certificates were sold to appellant at a sheriff’s sale on March 13, 1972. Prior to the sale, according to appellant’s complaint, the sheriff was advised by an agent of the issuer that the seized shares were valid certificates subject to transfer.</p>

In early April, 1972, the certificates were forwarded to the transfer agent, who registered the transfer and returned shares of the issuer to the broker for the account of appellant. Several days thereafter, however, the registration of the transfer was voided as a result of the discovery of a stop order placed on these certificates. The issuer and the transfer agent refuse to register appellant as a shareholder of the issuer.</p>

In its answer, Central Penn pleaded that in June, 1968, its counsel had by letter informed appellant that the certificates seized by the sheriff had been cancelled and replaced upon the affidavit of Robert Gunning that they had been lost; it also pleaded that in August, 1968, a former transfer agent forwarded to appellant a copy of Gunning’s Lost Original Instrument Affidavit.

While the transfer of the certificates from Robert Gunning to appellant may <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>have been a “sale,” it surely was not a voluntary sale. The intervention of legal process for the benefit of a judgment creditor indicates that, as to Robert Gunning, this transaction was involuntary.

It is beyond cavil that the transfer of the certificates from Robert Gunning to appellant effected on her behalf by the sheriff was not a “voluntary transfer of possession.”</p>
    <p id="b826-7" data-blocks='[["BL_826.5",826,[259,1401,1163,590]]]'>This reading of the Code makes good commercial sense. The preferred status that the Legislature conferred on bona fide purchasers is designed to protect the free market in the instruments of finance. Greater social benefit accrues if investors make decisions on the basis of the investment merits unhindered by fears of possible adverse claims or illiquidity resulting from potential transferees’ fears of adverse claims. Investment yields greater social benefits when investors place their funds according to their assessment of <em>investment </em>risks and rewards and undeterred by unassessable <em>legal </em>risks.</p>

The effect of the majority’s holding is that stock certificates are no longer subject to Sheriff’s sale <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>upon the levy of a judgment creditor. Who would buy a stock certificate at a Sheriff’s sale if that certificate cannot be transferred to the purchaser ? The validity of the Sheriff’s sale has not been attacked in any way. Why then is the purchaser not entitled to a transfer of the stock? The only reason given by the <em>majority is that a </em>purchaser of stock at a Sheriff’s sale <em>is not a purchaser. </em>That conclusion is clearly erroneous, and I cannot agree with it.</p>
    <p id="b828-4" data-blocks='[["BL_828.4",828,[281,806,1158,419]]]'>The trial court granted summary judgment for the sole reason that appellant did not purchase the stock in good faith. In this appeal, the appellant contended that summary judgment was improper because there was an <em>issue of fact </em>as to whether appellant had notice of any adverse claim. The majority ignores this issue, and considers an issue which was not briefed or raised in the trial court or in this Court.</p>
    <p id="b828-5" data-blocks='[["BL_828.5",828,[278,1253,1158,425]]]'>If the appellant did not have notice of any adverse claim, as must be assumed under the majority opinion, why is she deprived of the benefit of her purchase at a Sheriff’s sale which was entirely legal? If the appellant, who paid $8,000 for the stock at a Sheriff’s sale, cannot transfer what she bought, anyone who purchases stock at a Sheriff’s sale, in effect, purchases nothing. I must dissent from such a novel proposal.</p>
    <p id="b828-6" data-blocks='[["BL_828.6",828,[276,1701,1156,309]]]'>If, as the majority states, 12A P.S. § 8-302 applies to the situation before us, why would it not apply to all purchases of stock at Sheriff sales ? If it does, no one would ever dare buy stock at a Sheriff’s sale in Pennsylvania because they would not be able to have the stock transferred into their name.</p>
    <p id="b828-7" data-blocks='[["BL_828.7",828,[273,2038,1157,207]]]'>The trial court’s order granting summary judgment should be reversed and the matter remanded for a determination of the factual issue of whether appellant was a bona fide purchaser.</p>
