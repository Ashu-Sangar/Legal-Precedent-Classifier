The brothers had been employed as groundmen, climbers, and bucket operators for periods ranging from one and one-half to three years. In October of 1970 all of the brothers were discharged, allegedly for excessive absenteeism and tardiness.

On January 12, 1971, the Bureau of Unemployment Security notified appellants that they were ineligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits because, according to the Bureau, they had been discharged by the employer for “willful misconduct,” and were therefore ineligible for compensation because of Section 402(e) of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law. Act of Dec. 5, 1936, Second Ex.Sess., P. L. (1937) 2897, art. IV, § 402, as amended, 43 P.S. § 802(e).</p>

Case law, however, has defined willful misconduct as conduct which violates standards of conduct an employer has a right to expect of its employees. <em>See Woodson v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>7 Pa.Cmwlth. 526, <a href="/citations/?q=300%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="300 A.2d 299">300 A.2d 299</a> (1973). A determination of whether an employee has engaged in willful misconduct can therefore only be made by considering what standard of conduct an employer reasonably requires. Standards expected by one employer may of course not be the standards of another employer. Willful misconduct cannot therefore be <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>considered in a vacuum. It must be considered in relation to the particular employees and to the reasonable standards expected by a particular employer.</p>

Such a finding would constitute “willful misconduct” if the record established that the appellants’ employer discharged all employees with an absenteeism and tardiness record similar to that of the appellants. Under such circumstances, it could be said that the employer had a reasonable expectation that a certain standard of conduct would be met by its employees. The facts in this case, however, are otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b675-5" data-blocks='[["BL_675.5",675,[178,1068,1153,1082]]]'>The record establishes that one of the appellants was absent fifteen days during his last six months of employment; another appellant was absent nineteen days; another, twenty-four days; another, twenty-seven days. Uncontradicted evidence on the record also established that during the same period of time five white employees had absenteeism records as delinquent as those of the appellants. None of these white employees were discharged however. The record also indicated that the appellants were good workers and that they were not discharged for any conduct other than their allegedly excessive absenteeism and tardiness. Only one conclusio n can be drawn from the facts in this record. The employer required one standard of conduct of black employees and another standard of conduct of white employees. The same “criterion [was not] applied alike to members of all races.” <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

S. § 830, the findings of the Board or referee as to the facts shall be conclusive “if supported by the evidence and in the absence of fraud.” Where such is the case, the jurisdiction of the courts on appeal “shall be confined to questions of law.” <a href="/us/407/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="407 U.S. 163" data-case-ids="9137166" data-case-paths="/us/407/0163-01">Ibid.</a> The Commonwealth Court considered the charge of racial discrimination “disturbing,” but “[ajfter a reading and re-reading of the entire record,” concluded that the findings of fact of the referee, adopted and confirmed by the Board, “are supported by the evidence.” Noting that the burden of proving a right to unemployment compensation rests upon the claimant, that court concluded that the record did not support racial discrimination as the basis for the discharge.</p>

Unless we <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>are to become a super Unemployment Compensation Board, I do not see how we can properly make such an independent determination.</p>

I venture to suggest that none of these dispositions is correct. Since there were charges of racial discrimination, I think the referee and Board should have taken cognizance of the evidence in that regard and made express findings and conclusions one way or another as to the charges.
