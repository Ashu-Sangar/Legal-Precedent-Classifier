These disputes culminated in the refusal of the Commission to pay S &amp; T’s final bill of $557,536.14, whereupon S &amp; T demanded arbitration in accordance with the contract. A board of arbitrators was selected, and hearings were conducted by the arbi<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>trators on March 22 and 23, 1973.

The Commission asserts that no doctrine of waiver or estoppel is applicable because the defect is one of jurisdiction. This conclusion is based on the proposition that the arbitration act of 1927 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> [hereinafter the “Act of 1927”] was repealed in part when, ten years after its enactment, the legislature adopted the arbitration of claims act of 1937 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> [hereinafter the “Act of 1937”]. The Commission argues further that since S &amp; T did not invoke arbitration by the only permissible method, viz., that provided by the Act of 1937, it is now without remedy of any sort by reason , of the Commonwealth’s immunity to suit, which the Commission, as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, shares.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Constitution of Pennsylvania, Art.

      <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>The backbone of the Act of 1927 is the flat and unequivocal stipulation of its first section: “A provision in any written contract, except a contract for personal service, to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract, or out of the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract” (§ 1, 5 P.S. § 161). The remaining provisions of the Act are in aid of that basic section, setting forth enforcement rights and the procedural framework of the arbitrational process. They need not be set out in detail in this opinion. Suffice it to say that the Act of 1927 provides for the ad hoc appointment of boards of arbitrators or an umpire in such manner as the parties shall agree, or, in the absence of an agreement, for appointment of such persons by the court of common pleas (§ 4, 5 P.S. § 164); the courts of common pleas may adopt rules of procedure and practice which shall govern the arbitration proceedings (§ 5, 5 P.S. § 165); the arbitration award may be confirmed, vacated, or modified by the court at any time within one year after the award is made, and judgment thereupon entered in conformity with an order confirming, modifying or correcting an award (§§ 9 -14, 5 P.S. §§ 169-174).

A permanent Board of Arbitration of Claims is established, the three members of which are appointed by the Governor. One member of the Board must be learned in the law and one is required to be a civil engineer. The third member is to be a citizen and resident of the Commonwealth who is neither a lawyer nor an engineer (Act of 1937, § 1, 72 P. S. § 4651-1). The Board has no power to decide claims presented more than six months after they have accrued (§ 5, 72 P.S. § 4651-6). The hearings before the Board are public and are governed in general by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure (§ 8, 72 P.S. § 4651-8).

See <em>Jenner Township Annexation Case, supra </em>note 9. Although the procedures established by the two statutes before us differ in a number of respects, they are not repugnant one to the other. In the absence of a clear indication, either express or implied, of legislative intent that the Act of 1937 shall apply to all those cases it covers to the exclusion of the Act <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>of 1927, we must assume that it was the intention of the legislature that the procedures embodied in the two acts are to stand together, providing alternate and discrete methods of dispute resolution for the Commonwealth and those who contract with it. Thus, we hold that Section 16 of the Act of 1927 has not been repealed by implication by Section 4 of the Act of 1937.</p>
