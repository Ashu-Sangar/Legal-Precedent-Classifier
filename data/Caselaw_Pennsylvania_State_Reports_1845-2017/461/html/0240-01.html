Appellant contends (1) the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict; (2) an alleged eye-witness did not testify because of threats received; (3) the trial court’s charge was prejudicial; (4) the jury was preoccupied during part of the trial because a hurricane had struck the area; and (5) the appellant did not intelligently understand and waive the <em>Miranda </em>warnings which he received. We have examined each of these issues and conclude that each is without merit. The appellant has raised other issues which were not raised in the trial court. These are not properly before us. <em>Commonwealth v.
