According to appellant’s statement, appellant came home from work and went to a neighborhood playground in West Philadelphia to drink wine with some friends. After drinking for a short time, he accompanied a companion to the companion’s home where they procured a sawed-off shotgun, the weapon that fired the fatal shot. Thereafter, they returned to the playground. In the meantime, the Market Street Gang had come to the playground to negotiate a peace treaty with the Lex Street Gang of which appellant was a former member. Apparently, the negotiations broke down, a commotion began, and a cry went out that the Market Street Gang was “warring.” Appellant continued his statement:</p>

In this case, virtually the only available corroborating evidence was testimony that gang wars in appellant’s neighborhood were vicious and deadly. The testimony that appellant endeavored to elicit — that gang shootings had been frequent during the weeks preceding the deceased’s death, that members of street gangs often carried deadly weapons into their battles, and that appellant himself had been once hospitalized by gang fighting— was relevant to establish the ferocity with which gangs clashed and therefore to raise an inference that panic and fear could be evoked by an incipient gang war.
