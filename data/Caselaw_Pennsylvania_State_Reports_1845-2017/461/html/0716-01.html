However, the Committee viewed the imposition of real property taxes directly by the local authorities as undesirable. In its view, local taxation would permit those governmental units in which public utilities were located to reap windfall benefits while other communities would obtain little or no benefit from local taxation. The increased taxation, however, would become part of the utilities’ rate bases and accordingly would be reflected in every consumer’s rates regardless of whether he lived in a community benefiting from the tax.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> It therefore included in its proposal to eliminate the exemption a plan whereby all local taxing authorities could share in the revenue derived from the utilities.

Article VIII, section 4 provides that “[pjayment to the Commonwealth of gross receipts taxes or other special taxes <em>in replacement </em>of gross receipts taxes by a public utility” (emphasis added) is in lieu of payment of local property taxes. Section 8 of PURTA <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">20</a> provides that “It is the legislative intent that the tax imposed by this act . . . shall not be construed in any manner as to constitute a <em>replacement </em>for or a repealer of the [gross receipts tax].” (Emphasis added.)
