The failure to give Maio and Good, prior to their testimony before the grand jury, the warnings later prescribed in <em>McCloskey </em>did not require that their indictments for perjuring themselves before the grand jury be quashed. If they did not wish to <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>tell the truth, appellants could have grasped the first horn of the trilemma by refusing, on the grounds of self-incrimination, to answer the questions posed to them concerning their illegal wiretapping activities, and could likewise have defended against any subsequent contempt citation for such refusal to answer. Since this avenue was available to appellants, it was incumbent upon them to pursue it. Instead, they opted for perjury.

The majority describes three options as being open to the appellants when called to testify before the grand jury: (1) to act in a contemptuous manner, (2) to make harmful disclosures, and (3) to commit perjury. There is, however, a fourth option: exercise of the constitutional right against self-incrimination. But nobody told these appellants about their constitutional rights. The majority says that the appellants could have invoked their constitutional rights, and since “this avenue was available” the appellants should have pursued it. How could they? The very point of the appellants’ appeal is that one compelled to talk by government coercion is entitled to be informed of his constitutional rights. The majority fails to answer the only issue raised — why are citizens not entitled to be informed of their constitutional rights when compelled to testify? It would be simple, painless, and relatively costless to tell people of their constitutional rights. Why not do it? I must dissent.</p>
