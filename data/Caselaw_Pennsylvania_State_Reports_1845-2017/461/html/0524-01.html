By statutes of long standing, a party may appeal either the granting or denial of a preliminary injunction even though interlocutory. See Act of February 14, 1866, P.L. 28, § 1, 12 P.S. § 1101 (1953); Act of June 12, 1879, P.L. 177, § 1, 12 P.S. § 1102 (1953). And, of course, a party may appeal the granting or denial of a permanent injunction. But there is no statute which permits appeals from orders denying motions to dissolve preliminary injunctions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> no doubt <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>for the very good reason that we would otherwise be faced with multiple interim appeals from the granting of a single injunction.

    <p id="b760-4" data-blocks='[["BL_760.4",760,[263,509,1156,1519]]]'>The dissenting opinion makes two arguments which to me are quite irrelevant as to the appealability of an order refusing to dissolve a preliminary injunction. It is first stated that it would be unreasonable to compel an enjoined party to proceed to a final hearing when that party “desires to accept the adverse judicial determination made at the preliminary hearing”. (Dissenting Opinion, <em>infra, </em>at 280). The point is then made that “appellants cannot be indefinitely bound by an injunction which infringes on their constitutional rights to peaceful picketing.” These arguments appear to me to be antithetical one to the other. But, however, that may be, our procedural rules are not unmindful of the need for speedy resolution of preliminary injunctions involving freedom of expression. When such an injunction is issued, it is mandatory for a trial court to hold a final hearing within three days after demand by the defendant, and to file a final decree within twenty-four hours thereafter; otherwise the injunction is deemed dissolved. Pa.R.C.P. 1581(f)(1). But in all the time that has intervened since the modified preliminary injunction was issued in the case at bar, no such demand has ever been made. If, as the dissenting opinion suggests, there are factors which make such a final hearing undesirable, all the aggrieved party need do is to stipulate that the proceedings on the preliminary injunction be taken as the final hearing and decree. The case would then be immediately ripe for final appellate review.</p>
