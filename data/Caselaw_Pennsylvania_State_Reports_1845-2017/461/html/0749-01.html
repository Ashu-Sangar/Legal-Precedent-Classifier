The thrust of appellant’s argument is not that the alleged adverse publicity permeated the indictment process and thus resulted in the return of a true or approved bill improperly, but rather that the publicity infected the trial and thereby denied him due process. It is therefore apparent that the relief sought, i. e., a motion to quash the indictment, was in no way related to the injury claimed. This Court has been, and is, steadfast in our denunciation of prejudicial and inflammatory news coverage which inundates a community and deprives one charged with crime the opportunity of a fair trial. To our knowledge, no jurisdiction or respected legal authority has ever advocated quashing the indictment as a remedy if, in fact, this type of wrong has been found to exist. The obvious remedies to be employed to rectify such a condition are either to permit the accused to be tried in an area which is free from the effects of the adverse publicity or to postpone the date of trial until the effects of the publicity have been sufficiently dissipated to allow for a fair and impartial trial.</p>

There is not a scintilla of evidence on this record that supports the claim of appellant that he was denied a fair trial because of adverse pre-trial publicity. Here, as stated, there were only two articles published approximately 11 months prior to the commencement of the trial. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Hoss, supra; Commonwealth v.

Four persons have been charged with that. It has been the experience of lawyers that there are some people who feel that it should be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and only one person should be charged and not two or four, even though two or four or more may have participated to some degree or may have been there in some capacity.</blockquote>

A review of the record refutes the assertion that these remarks amount to a material misstatement. Three of the eyewitnesses produced by the Commonwealth testified that there were “four or five” boys surrounding the decedent at the time; a fourth eyewitness testified that there were five and one stated that there were four. Whether there were four or five individuals was totally immaterial to the legal concept the court was attempting to convey to the jury at that juncture.

Upon staggering into his home, he collapsed on the living room floor and exclaimed, “Momma, the knife is still in my back.” He also stated, “Momma, I can’t breathe”, and pleaded with her to remove the knife from the wound. Within an hour after making the challenged statement, the victim was dead. It is evident that the foregoing circumstances surrounding the utterances justified the trial court in a finding that the declarant was aware that death was imminent.</p>

He would have us conclude that the sophistication of mankind today is such that the knowledge of impending death no longer engenders apprehension of the unknown and fails to deter falsehood and is incapable of inspiring truth. With this novel proposition we cannot agree.

This argument is premised from the fact that when the mother was first told that her son had expired and was asked by the police official whether or not he had told her who had stabbed him, she is alleged to have answered “No.” Even assuming that inconsistent evidence appears on the record, this does not provide a basis for excluding one of the alleged inconsistent statements. It is obviously within the province of the jury to reconcile the inconsistencies, if possible and where not possible, to ascertain where the truth lies.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

During cross-examination of Mrs. Clairborne, defense counsel attempted to establish that Mrs. Clairborne had indicated to the detective that her son had not given her the name of his assailant. This line of questioning was obviously an attempt to offset the effect of the dying declaration which she recounted during her testimony in chief. The following colloquy sets forth those statements which form the basis of this complaint:</p>

Mrs. Clairborne was interviewed by the detective within minutes of her son’s death. The testimony showed that at this point she was bordering on hysteria. It was during this time that she is alleged to have said that her son told her who had stabbed him. Thereafter, however, she explained that although her son had indicated the nickname of the person who stabbed him, in the excitement she had forgotten until another young man, who was also a witness to the event, repeated the nickname which caused her to recall the statement made by her dying son.</p>
