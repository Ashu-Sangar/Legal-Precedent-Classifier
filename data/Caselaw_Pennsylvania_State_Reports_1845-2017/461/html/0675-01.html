The crux of the PPC evidence, adduced from two environmental experts and several company officers, was that no desulfurization system had yet been demonstrated as workable on large coal-fired electric generating <a id="p686" href="#p686" data-label="686" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*686</a>boilers, that workability was not yet predictable, and that low sulfur fuel in quantity sufficient for PPC’s electric generating operating was unobtainable.

Pursuant to the provisions thereof, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency was required to determine which emissions were pollutants which adversely affected public health or welfare and to immediately promulgate regulations establishing national primary and secondary air quality standards defining the maximum concentration of pollutants allowed.

Since, in the instant case, <em>no </em>precaution was taken, prior to the September order’s issuance, to determine whether it was within <em>PPC’s </em>power to comply with the <em>new </em>sulfur dioxide standards <em>(i. e., </em>there was neither a DER nor court determination on this issue) the propriety of the court’s taking judicial notice of the sulfur dioxide standards, <em>in the first place, </em>is doubtful. Nevertheless, having failed to take precautions prior to issuing its order, it was incumbent on the court to take the “necessary precaution at the contempt proceeding.”</p>

In the amicus curiae brief filed by West Power Company, Monongahela Power Company and Potomac Edison Company, an additional reason is submitted for PPC’s not having raised its “impossibility” earlier. According to amici, PPC was inhibited from <em>petitioning </em>to modify the court order as such a petition would necessarily entail a direct attack on the “reasonableness” of the DER sulfur dioxide standards. Once the standards were federally approved, the amici contend § 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.A. § 1857h-5(b)(l) gives exclusive jurisdiction to Federal Courts of Appeal for review of the state emission standards <em>(Getty Oil Company </em>v. <em>Ruckelshaus, </em><a href="/f2d/467/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="467 F.2d 349" data-case-ids="251305" data-case-paths="/f2d/467/0349-01">467 F.2d 349</a> (3d Cir. 1972) cert. denied <a href="/us/409/1125-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="409 U.S. 1125" data-case-ids="6509038,6509120,6509175,6509242,6509313,6509476,6509561,6509651,6509740,6509823" data-case-paths="/us/409/1125-01,/us/409/1125-02,/us/409/1125-03,/us/409/1125-04,/us/409/1125-05,/us/409/1125-06,/us/409/1125-07,/us/409/1125-08,/us/409/1125-09,/us/409/1125-10">409 U.S. 1125</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20S.%20Ct.%20937" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="93 S.

Although appellant cites cases standing for the proposition that the failure to raise a defense to a court order prior to a contempt proceeding acts as a waiver of such defense, these cases are distinguishable. In each case cited, the alleged contemnor took the position that the court’s order had been irregularly obtained, was void or invalid, or was based upon an invalid statute (none of which defenses are advanced in this case). Moreover, in each of the cases cited a finding was made of willful disobedience based on the contemnor’s ability to perform.</p>
