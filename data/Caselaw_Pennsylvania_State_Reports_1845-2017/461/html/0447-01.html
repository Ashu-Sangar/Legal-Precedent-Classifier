Appellee claimed that the existence of the sewers on its land constituted a continuing trespass.

Hall was President and Director of the corporation, James H. Brennan was Secretary and Director of the corporation, and T. Robert Brennan was Treasurer, Assistant Secretary and Director. In 1951 James Brennan held record title to a six-acre tract of land on the southerly side of William Penn Highway in Wilkins Township, as trustee for George Beech and Mary Beech, his wife. One of Turnway Corporation’s first acts in 1952 was to enter into a lease with James Brennan for the six acres of land for a term of fifty years, at a rental of $250.00 per month.</p>

As a result, an agreement was reached whereby the Soffers and the Thorpes were to obtain a ninety-nine year lease on 1.274 acres of Brennan’s six acres; in return, the Soffers and Thorpes were to construct a fifty-foot right-of-way across the 1.274 acres, thus connecting their Penn Center property with the property leased by Brennan to Turnway Corporation. Although this leasing arrangement was reduced to writing, it never became effective because the Beech family instructed James Brennan not to deliver the executed copies of the lease to the Soffers and Thorpes.</p>

This 1962 agreement provided that Turnway got full title to the remainder of the six-acre tract, without any express mention of a right-of-way over the 1.274 acres. Turnway Corporation as such, did not sign this second agreement but the agreement was negotiated and signed by the same individual, James Brennan, who negotiated the undelivered ninety-nine year lease.

These demands were predicated upon the Turnway officers’ mistaken impression that the ninety-nine year lease was in effect and/or that the September 1962 agreement to convey had retained the right-of-way as part of the consideration. One letter, dated October 26, 1970, in addition to asking for the right-of-way, adverted to the fact that Turnway had discovered that Soffers’ sewers extended onto Turnway’s property. The letters made no reference whatsoever to the existence of a fifty-year lease.</p>

Appellants rely on the doctrine of agency by estoppel, which, if meritorious, would mean that James H.

For several years, appellee asserted its unjustified claim to have a right-of-way constructed by the appellants over the 1.274 acres. This claim was based on the' appellee’s officers’ misapprehension that such a right existed under the inoperative ninety-nine year lease. Nevertheless, appellee continually asserted a leasehold interest, even if under the wrong lease instrument. We are satisfied that there could not be an intention to abandon under those circumstances.</p>

The acreage involved was and still is vacant land. Moreover, neither rent nor any increase in taxes has been paid by appellee to appellants since appellants took title to the land in 1963. Nevertheless, whether there was an intention to abandon is a question of fact which the chancellor answered in the negative. In equitable actions, the findings of the chancellor approved by the court en banc are equivalent to a jury verdict, and, where supported by evidence, though in dispute, they are controlling on appeal. <em>Onorato v.

Brennan, and that, therefore, appellants had a license to place the sewer system on appellee’s property. Appellants claim that they were expressly authorized to put sewers on appellee’s land by the terms of <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>Section 9 of the Agreement to Convey of September 17, 1962, wherein it was stated:</p>

    <p id="b693-5" data-blocks='[["BL_693.5",693,[180,748,1147,699]]]'>This argument is initially undermined by our earlier holding here that the chancellor was correct in finding that James H. Brennan was not an agent for Turn way during the negotiations and execution of the conveyance agreement. Furthermore, it would be a strained and unnatural interpretation of the term “the land” in Section 9, above, if we held that term to refer not only to the 1.-274 acres conveyed to appellants but also to the remainder of the six-acre tract which was conveyed to Turn-way. Reading the agreement in its entirety, we can only interpret “the land” to mean the 1.274 acres which were soon to be conveyed to the appellants. There was no express license to place the sewers on appellee’s land.</p>

The implied license theory must fail, however, because there is sufficient evidence to show that the appellants placed no reliance on the silence of the appellee as the sewage systems were being installed. Indeed, none of the parties were aware that the sewers were on appellee’s land.</p>

Further, James Brennan and R. Robert Brennan had visited the construction site on at least one occasion. From these facts the chancellor might have inferred, contrary to appellee’s assertions, that Turnway officers had knowledge that the Soffer-Thorpe sewer lines extended into Turn-way property. But the following paragraph from the Adjudication of the chancellor is most telling:</p>
    <blockquote id="b694-4" data-blocks='[["BL_694.4",694,[317,761,1109,583]]]'>“The most significant testimony bearing on this Count of the complaint was offered by the defendant, Joseph Soffer. In his deposition, he testified that he was not aware that the sewer lines, manholes and inlets were constructed on the Turnway property and did not discover this until 1970 and knew of no basis on which the facilities were constructed on Turnway property. If he did not know that the construction was on Turnway property, how can it be said that Turnway Corporation knew or consented to said construction.”</blockquote>

Since appellants had no knowledge that their sewer systems were intruding upon appellee’s land, and since the deposition of appellant, Joseph Soffer, indicated that he knew of no basis upon which the intrusion was justified, we will sustain the finding of the chancellor that there was no implied license by equitable estoppel. It is essential that persons claiming equitable estoppel have relied upon the representation or conduct of the person sought to be estopped. <em>Stratford Arms, Inc. v.
