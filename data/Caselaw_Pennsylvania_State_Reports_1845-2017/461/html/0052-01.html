Mr. Smith is a first cousin of decedent. Mr. Leech, the only other relative of the decedent, is a nephew. Under the Pennsylvania law then in effect, Intestate Act of April 24, 1947, P.L. 80, § 3 (20 P.S. § 1.3), John Smith would not share in the intestate estate of the decedent since Harry Leech would take any intestate portion of the estate to the exclusion of all others.</p>

But the procedural effect of either rule is the same: both rules act to shift the burden of going forward to the proponent. These rules define for the contestant what is his prima facie case. Generally, undue influence, being somewhat akin to fraud, must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Brantlinger Will, </em><a href="/pa/418/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="418 Pa. 236" data-case-ids="1896077" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0236-01">418 Pa. 236</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=210%20A.2d%20246" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="210 A.2d 246">210 A.2d 246</a> (1965).

Much of the discussion centered around the question of whether the proponent John H. Smith was a stranger to the blood of the testatrix. For purposes of assigning the burden of going forward we may ignore this question since it is surplusage to this evidentiary issue in light of the fact that we require a showing only of weakened intellect, confidential relationship and substantial benefit to the proponent for the contestant to establish his prima facie case. Admittedly, the other three factors of the older rule reflect upon the ultimate issue of undue influence, but the initial issue is whether the contestant has made out a prima facie case before we need even consider the evidence in favor of the proponent.</p>

Testatrix was an elderly woman in her mid-seventies who had lived alone as a widow since 1951, caring for herself and handling most of her own business affairs for most of this time. From 1967 until her death, she was hospitalized nine times. She suffered from hypertension, anxiety, and depression, probably stemming from loneliness and a chronic psoriasis condition of the skin. During Mrs. Clark’s hospitalization from December 23, 1970 to January 5, 1971 (ten months before she executed the will) she suffered from cerebral arteriosclerosis and arteriosclerotic heart disease, commonly known <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>as hardening of the arteries. Her doctors described this ailment as an incurable, progressively degenerative disease which interfered with the flow of blood to the brain. Mrs. Clark exhibited the classic symptoms of the disease, i. e., the ability to recall matters from the distant past while being unable to absorb current matters. She exhibited cyclic changes which allowed her to appear normal and lucid during some intervals. Her doctors rendered an opinion that this condition would necessarily deteriorate by the time she signed the will in November of 1972. One doctor related that he did consider a commitment for Mrs. Clark but finally concluded that her demented condition during this hospitalization was not serious enough to require commitment to a mental hospital.</p>

Her attending nurses described periods of hostility, belligerency, and disruptive conduct. Several lay witnesses, including the contestant and his wife, testified that during the last two years of her life, Mrs. Clark showed “dependence,” “confusion,” “forgetfulness,” “repetition,” and “disorientation.”</p>

Mrs. Clark treated Harry Leech as “a son.” During the last few years of decedent’s life, John Smith befriended the testatrix and gradually assumed more and more of Alice Clark’s business duties. Years earlier, after Mrs. Clark’s husband had died, John Smith had handled the auction of some of Mr. Clark’s personal property. Afterward, Mrs. Clark had occasionally referred to Mr. Smith as a “crook.” However, on November 12, 1971, the date of decedent’s <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>will, she visited her bank with Mr. and Mrs. Smith and informed the bank manager that she wished to designate Mr. Smith as her attorney to sign checks on her account, and she signed a power of attorney to that effect.</p>

Doctor Tiegel treated Alice Clark regularly and last saw her on November 8, 1971. He testified that she was lucid during all of the office visits and that on November 8 she would have been capable of executing a legal document if it was explained to her. She comprehended everything that was said to her, but she would digress “into things she had done in the past.” (Significantly, all other medical testimony was based upon observations which were at least two months removed from the date of execution of the will). Other lay witnesses testified for the proponent that they had engaged in normal business relationships with the decedent during the fall of 1971.</p>

However sound that rule is, it cannot be imposed upon the law of undue influence. As we said before, weakened mentality as relevant to undue influence need not amount to testamentary incapacity. Undue influence is generally accomplished by a gradual, progressive inculcation of a receptive mind. The “fruits” of the undue influence may not appear until long after the weakened intellect has been played upon. In other words, the particular mental condition of the testatrix on the date she executed the will is not as significant when reflecting upon undue influence as it is when reflecting upon testamentary capacity. More credence and weight may be given to the contestant’s remote medical testimony.</p>

He testified that at the decedent’s direction, he wrote the will by hand as it was dictated to him by Mrs. Clark. He then procured a typewriter and paper and delivered them with the handwriting to a Mrs. Curtis, whom proponent paid to type the will. John Smith picked up the finished product on November 13, 1971, took it to Alice Clark and watched her sign it. He then obtained the signatures of Margaret Hamilton and Nell Martin as witnesses. Neither saw Mrs. Clark sign the will, and neither knew that it was a will she was witnessing. Both ladies, however, recognized the signature of Alice Clark and both spoke with the decedent on November 13 and found her in good spirits and mentally normal. John Smith took the will and all copies to his home where they remained until after Alice Clark’s death.</p>

The cited authorities are not clear regarding the risk of non-persuasion. As a general proposition, it appears that the risk of non-persuasion as to testator’s sanity and as to the absence of undue influence is upon the proponent of the will. But once the presumption of no undue influence is raised by the mere formality of admitting into evidence the record of the probate of the will, then the risk of non-persuasion is upon the contestant. Thus, in reality, at the trial of this issue devisavit vel non, the risk of non-persuasion is always upon the contestant, for it is he who is affirmatively asserting the existence or non-existence of certain facts. <em>See, </em>57 Am.Jur.
