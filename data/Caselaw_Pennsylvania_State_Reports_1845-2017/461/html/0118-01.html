The doctor testified that in his opinion, appellant was under the influence of the two intoxicants and at the time of the Patiri attack “his mind was such that he wasn’t able to form the proper conscious intent to take a life, to assault.” Defense counsel then attempted to elicit from the doctor an opinion as to whether or not Graves at the time of the incident “could consciously form the specific intent to take or steal from a person or individual.” An objection to this question was sustained and this ruling is assigned as error. Concomitantly, it is argued that the trial court erred in refusing a request to charge the jury that if they found Graves incapable of forming the intent to commit burglary or robbery because of the consumption of wine or the ingestion of the drug, or both, he could not be guilty of these offenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

It is a duty which everyone owes to his fellowmen and to society, to preserve, so far as it lies in his own power, the inestimable gift of reason. If such reason is perverted or destroyed by fixed disease, though brought on by his own vices, the law holds him not accountable.

Thus “[i]f the charge is <em>felonious </em>homicide, intoxication, which is so great as to render the accused incapable of forming a wilful, deliberate and premeditated design to kill or incapable of judging his acts and their consequences, may properly influence a finding by the trial court that no specific intent to kill existed, and hence to conclude the killing was murder in the second degree.” [Emphasis in original.] <em>Commonwealth v.

As the <em>Tarver </em>Court recognized, this exception to the general rule does not change the nature of the crime. Murder still remains murder. Only the degree of the crime has been affected. Because there exist no analogous degrees of robbery (and instantly burglary), the <em>Tarver </em>Court refused to extend this exception beyond the homicide area. To hold otherwise, and allow evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate the necessary specific intent required of both robbery •and burglary, would permit an individual’s voluntary intoxication to serve as a complete exoneration for all criminal acts committed while in that state. This cannot be tolerated.</p>

It matters little that the ma<a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>jority regards such evidence <em>as </em>only bearing upon an element of the crime, the specific intent of the perpetrator, rather than serving as a defense to such crime. The end result is the same and no amount of legal jargon will make it otherwise. If a criminal defendant, charged with either robbery or burglary, is found by the jury, because of voluntary intoxication, not to have had the requisite specific intent, he must be found not guilty. Only a person blind to reality could fail to perceive that there is no practical difference between the admission of evidence to negate an element of the crime and the admission of evidence to constitute a defense. The end result is that human life and property would hardly be considered any longer as being under legal protection. An individual will, henceforth, be permitted to avail himself of his voluntary intoxication to exempt him from any legal responsibility which would attach to him, if sober. As one noted annotator said in speaking of voluntary intoxication as a defense to criminal responsibility, “. all that the crafty criminal would require for a well-planned . . .
