After hearing evidence, the orphans’ court held the trust invalid and allowed appellee’s claim in full. Appellant filed exceptions asserting the validity of the trust and, on that basis, the immunity of the trust assets to appellee’s claim against Mrs. Fisher. In ruling on the exceptions, the orphans’ court reversed its initial decree and held that the trust was valid,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> but that appellee was entitled to reach the trust assets to the extent that decedent was entitled to exoneration out of the trust estate, an amount it fixed at $1,919.18.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This appeal followed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> challenging the right of appellee to reach any of the trust assets.</p>
