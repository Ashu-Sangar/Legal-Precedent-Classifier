    <p id="b475-7" data-blocks='[["BL_475.7",475,[182,887,1147,749]]]'>The Township Commissioners were not acting in a <em>judicial </em>capacity when discipline was imposed on the appellants. They were acting in their <em>executive </em>capacity. The situation is no different than one in which a single executive officer (governor, mayor, cabinet officer), suspends or fires an employee. The executive officer may be, and in many cases is, the only witness to the conduct which allegedly requires discipline. The situation should be no different simply because the executive authority in Upper Moreland Township is vested in a collective group rather than in a single individual. Under the reasoning of the opinion in support of reversal, an <em>executive </em>official could never suspend or fire anyone — even one who punched him personally in the mouth.</p>

    <blockquote id="AZA" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[313,693,1114,806]]]'>“Another independent ground for reversal is the position of conflict occupied by John Repasky. Repasky was a member of the Fire Board which originally complained about appellant and a member ,of the Civil Service Commission which heard appellant’s appeal. (He cast the deciding vote for suspension in a 2-1 Commission decision.) Appellees claim that no bias in fact has been shown and that Repasky took no part in making the original complaint. This is not to the point. ‘. . . [A] ny tribunal permitted by law to try cases and controversies must not only be unbiased but must avoid even the appearance of bias.’ <em>Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v.
