No action was taken by the officer, apparently because he did not believe the injury was in any way serious. About three hours later, Bryant again complained about his ankle and the investigating officer immediately sent him to the police surgeon who was on duty at police headquarters. The surgeon examined him and found the injury to be minor, and not of the nature requiring treatment. When Bryant was returned to Homicide Headquarters, he again complained of the injury and the officer, as a precautionary measure, sent him to Jefferson Hospital for a complete examination and X-rays.
