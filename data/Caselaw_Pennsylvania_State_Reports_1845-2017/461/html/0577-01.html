Hernandez, however, asserted his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and would answer no questions. At the end of the presentation of evidence appellant moved that Hernandez’s confession be admitted into evidence. Pursuant to a ruling obtained earlier in <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>the trial, the motion was denied on the ground that the statement was inadmissible hearsay.

The absurdity and wrong of rejecting indiscriminately all such evidence is patent . .</p>

Those who watched (in 1899) with self-righteous indignation the course of proceedings in Captain Dreyfus’ trial should remember that, if that trial had occurred in our own courts, the spectacle would have been no less shameful if we, following our own supposed precedents, had refused to admit what the French Court never for a moment hesitated to admit, — the authenticated confession of the absconded Major Esterhazy, avowing himself the guilty author of the treason there charged, and now known beyond a doubt to have been the real traitor."</blockquote>
