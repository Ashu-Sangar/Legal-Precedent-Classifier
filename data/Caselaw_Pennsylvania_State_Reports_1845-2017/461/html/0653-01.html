    <p id="b888-6" data-blocks='[["BL_888.5",888,[262,848,1162,416]]]'>.The statute confers no right to jury trial and the jury verdict is only advisory. Consequently, it is doubtful that any error in instructing the jury would ever be prejudicial error.

Exceptions to the charge must be presented before the jury retires. Pa.R.Civ.P. 227(b), 12 P.S. Appendix. Of the three points for charge relied upon by appellant as presenting his claim to the orphans’ court, two related to testamentary capacity, an issue resolved favorably to appellant below and not before this Court. The third read: “Testimony which reveals nothing but the existence of suspicion or conjecture of undue influence does not constitute probative fact.” Clearly this does not raise the issue which appellant now seeks to present. Consequently, this claim is waived. <em>Dilliplaine v.
