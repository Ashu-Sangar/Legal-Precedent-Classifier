A police search of the abandoned vehicle disclosed a sales slip on the front seat from Kaufman’s department store located in the shopping center where Mrs. Buczkowski was assaulted. The sales slip was issued in the name of Richard A. Buczkowski, which is the name of the husband of the victim.</p>

The chief of police of Pleasant Hills Borough then, noting that the robbery charge from West Mifflin Borough involved a purse snatching, asked Milton if he had been near the Pleasant Hills Shopping Center earlier that evening. Milton said “no”, but in a brief period of questioning that followed, he stated that the “Blue Torino” which the police pursued earlier in the evening was a “hot” car and the driver at the time of the chase was a Thomas Wormsley. Milton was then turned over to the custody of the West Mifflin Borough police.</p>
    <p id="b771-4" data-blocks='[["BL_771.4",771,[154,1291,1150,530]]]'>About 1:00 p. m., on November 23, 1973, Milton appeared voluntarily at the Allegheny County Detective Bureau at the request of the Captain of Detectives. In answer to questions, Milton explained how he knew Wormsley was the driver of the “Blue Torino” the police chased on the night of November 21st. The interview lasted about one and three-quarters hours and was recorded on a typewriter. In this interview, Milton said nothing self-incriminating and at its conclusion he was permitted to leave.</p>

He was escorted to the Allegheny County Detective Bureau arriving about 1:00 a. m. He was immediately advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and the reason for his arrest. After being “processed”, questioning by the Captain of Detectives commenced about 1:15 a. m. Initially, Wormsley said nothing incriminating, but when he was informed <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>Milton had told the police he was the driver of the “Blue Torino”, a “hot” car, he became “upset” and asked permission to phone a Samuel Gunter and a Gerald Parker. Permission was given and about 2:00 a. m., an effort was made to contact Gunter and Parker but without success. Wormsley then pressed the Captain of Detectives for a detailed account of what Milton had said. Sometime before 4:00 a. m., Wormsley admitted his involvement in the Buczkowski assault and theft. Then beginning at 4:00 a. m., and continuing for about one hour, he detailed the occurrence. This statement which was recorded on a typewriter, not only described Wormsley’s participation in the Buczkowski crime, but also identified Milton, Gunter and Parker as active participants.</p>

Upon his arrival at the Allegheny County Detective Bureau about 11:10 a. m., he was immediately advised of the nature of the charges upon which he had been arrested, as well as his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Milton was also informed that Wormsley had implicated him in the Buczkowski assault and theft. Without hesitation, Milton admitted he participated and said he was ready to make a complete statement. The recording of the statement began shortly after 12:00 noon and was completed within two hours. Milton and Wormsley were arraigned at 3:15 p. m.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appendix, and this “unnecessary delay . . . caused” the challenged statements to be given. See <em>Commonwealth v.

But as the uncontradicted testimony demonstrated there was no “unnecessary delay” between Milton’s arrest and his self-incrimination. His initial admission of involvement ensued within minutes of his arrival at the County Detective Bureau on November 24th, and his detailed statement of the crime and his participation therein was completed and recorded within a three-hour period. This cannot be viewed as the “unnecessary delay” contemplated by Rule 118. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Rowe, </em><a href="/pa/459/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="459 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="481025" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0163-01">459 Pa. 163</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="459 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="481025" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0163-01">327 A.2d 358</a> (1974).</p>

Even assuming, there was “unnecessary delay” between his arrest and self-incrimination,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> this does not “ipso facto” render evidence of his self-incriminations inadmissible at trial. <em>Commonwealth v.

In order for such evidence to be excluded, under Rule 118, the evidence must be reasonably related to the delay. In other words, a “nexus” between the delay and the challenged evidence must be established and the burden of proving this “nexus” is upon the party who asserts it. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <blockquote id="b776-5" data-blocks='[["BL_776.5",776,[319,722,1113,1238]]]'>“In <em>[Commonwealth v. </em>Wayman] it was not the length of time between arrest and confession that established a ‘reasonable relationship’ between the evidence and the delay. Rather, the relationship was established because delay had been manufactured by police to allow opportunity to elicit a confession. Therefore, to argue that the length of the delay itself should in any way be relevant to the issue at hand is to ignore the fact that the length of time between arrest and confession is determined merely by the power of the accused to withstand interrogation or by his inability to satisfy his interrogators. It is hence absurd to suggest that the strength of the relationship between the evidence given and the ‘unnecessary delay’ is dependent upon the number of hours the accused can resist questioning. On the contrary, since the evidence follows the interrogation during ‘unnecessary delay,’ and the delay in turn is created to permit such questioning, once the interrogation is begun the relationship is established independent of how long the delay lasts. It is the action of the police, therefore, that establishes the connection between unnecessary delay and the evidence obtained.”</blockquote>
