A passing motorist observed Mrs. Moore and saw a tall, thin, black man with his arm around her back and his right arm in front of her, as if he were supporting her. A flash of light was seen near Mrs. Moore’s face, and a gunshot was heard. As Mrs. Moore fell to the ground, the person whose arms were around her took her purse and entered the passenger side of a vehicle parked along the curb. A description of the au-. tomobile and its license plate number were furnished to the police, and investigation revealed that the auto belonged to appellant.

We do not agree. Appellant was arrested pursuant to a warrant that he alleges was defective because the magistrate was not presented with sufficient facts to establish probable cause. While agreeing with appellant’s contention concerning the warrant, we are of the opinion that the knowledge possessed by the officer in charge of the investigation was sufficient to establish probable cause for a warrantless arrest. Officer Pampeña, the officer in charge of the investigation, who dispatched the arresting officers, possessed the following information which would establish probable cause for a warrantless arrest: He knew that Mrs. Moore’s assailant was a tall, black male; that after the shooting the assailant entered a car with license plates that proved ownership by Carl Whitson, appellant; that appellant was a security guard employed by Allied Detective Agency and was issued a .38-caliber revolver; and that .38-caliber shells were found near the murder scene. Based <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>upon this information, the officer in charge certainly-possessed enough information to establish probable cause for appellant’s arrest.

We do not agree. Appellant was arrested on January 17, 1973, at or about 1:15 p.m., by officers of the Pittsburgh police force. He arrived at police headquarters at 2:15 p.m. and was advised of his rights. Appellant then gave police a statement in which he outlined his activities on the day of the murder. This initial interview lasted approximately thirty minutes. The police then left appellant alone and proceeded to check his story. At 6:00 p.m., appellant was again interviewed, and at 6:10 p.m. he gave an oral admission, which culminated in a formal statement concluded at 6:50 p.m. At 7:00 p.m., appellant was arraigned.

The record reveals that after appellant gave his initial statement to the police, in which he detáiled his activities on the night of the murder, appellant was left alone and his story was checked by the police officers. In <em>Futch, </em>we held that a delay in arraignment caused by the necessity to investigate a defendant’s story was permissible.

However, by doing both before appellant had been arraigned the police engaged in forbidden exploitation of the illegal delay in arraignment. See <em>Commonwealth v.
