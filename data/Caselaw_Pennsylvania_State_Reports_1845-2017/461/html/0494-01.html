Exceptions were filed and oral argument was had followed by a final order in which the Board ruled that the School District had failed to bargain in good faith with the Association on five of the remaining twenty-one items.

Board of Education of Shawnee Mission Unified School District No. 512, </em><a href="/kan/212/0741-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="212 Kan. 741" data-case-ids="41128" data-case-paths="/kan/212/0741-01">212 Kan. 741</a>, <a href="/kan/212/0741-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="212 Kan. 741" data-case-ids="41128" data-case-paths="/kan/212/0741-01">512 P.2d 426</a> (1973). In that decision the Court was confronted with a dispute between a teachers’ association and the board of education. In resolving questions relating to the scope of negotiations provided under their statute they recognized that “terms and conditions” which were negotiable under the terms of the statute as something more than minimal economic terms of wages and hours, but something less than the basic educational policies of the board of education. That Court suggested that the courts of that jurisdiction should resolve these issues on a case-by-case basis. As has been indicated, we also agree with the wisdom of this approach at this time. Further, the Kansas Court suggested:</p>

In so doing, school districts were created as an agency of the State charged with the responsibility of administering the educational program within its assigned territory. <em>Slippery Rock Area Joint School System v.

We believe that section 703 only prevents the agreement to and implementation of any term which would be in violation of or inconsistent with any statutory directive. The distinction between this view and that expressed by the majority of the Commonwealth Court (as we understand it) is best illustrated by an example. Under section 1142 of the Public School Code, a minimum salary scale is set forth. Section 1151 provides that school boards may pay <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>salaries in excess of the minimum salary. Framing the issue in accordance with the formulation suggested by the majority in the Commonwealth Court, section 1142 created a duty not to pay below the minimum scale and section 1151 granted the employer the prerogative to pay more than the minimum rate. Clearly, the parties are precluded from agreeing to a rate lower than the minimum scale but even though the statute vested in the public employer the prerogative to pay a higher rate, to do so as a result of collective bargaining is not “in violation of, or inconsistent with, or in conflict with” the statute in question. The mere fact that the General Assembly granted the prerogative to the employer does not exclude the possibility that the decision to exercise that prerogative was influenced by the collective bargaining process.</p>

The purpose of section 703 was not to further define “inherent managerial policy” but to recognize that Act 195 did not affect the continuing vitality of existing law at the time of that Act’s passage. Thus, the fact that a prerogative was statutorily recognized under section 1151 does not mandate that it be included within the “inherent managerial policy” concept of section 702. That determination rests solely on the considerations suggested in our discussion under Part II of this Opinion.

Many other legal scholars have, of course, made similar observations. This case is a striking illustration of the truth of that statement. The problem, of course, is that courts are called upon to ascertain the “intention of the legislature.” Where the legislature has had a real intention, one way or another, on a point, it usually expresses it clearly and there is no doubt about it. But when the legislature has had no specific meaning on a point, or when the question presented never occurred to it, the difficulties arise. <em>See </em>op. cit. <em>supra; </em>J.

The specific intent, however, as to what subjects are within the scope of collective bargaining, is, to say the least, elusive. While the title of the PERA refers to “defining the scope of collective bargaining,” see 43 P.S. 1101.101, note, the text of the Act on this subject seems to speak with two voices. Whereas Sec. 701 grants the right to bargain with respect to “wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment,” the following section, Sec. 702, stipulates that the right does not extend to “matters of inherent managerial policy.” This, of course, is the troublesome phrase. These matters are de<a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>fined to include, but are not limited to, “such areas of discretion or policy as the functions and programs of the public employer, standards of services, its [the employer’s] overall budget, utilization of technology, the organizational structure and selection and direction of personnel.” 43 P.S. § 1101.702. The section goes on, however, to require employers to “meet and discuss” (as distinguished from bargaining about) policy matters which affect wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment and “the impact thereon.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=43%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20886" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="43 Harv.

I also agree that this requires a balancing approach, and that in striking the balances undue emphasis must not be placed on either Sec. 702 or Sec. 703 of the Act, lest the innovative provision of Sec. 701 be lost in the shuffle. Thus, as the Court’s opinion states, an item of dispute must not be removed from the orbit of bargaining under Sec. 701 “simply because it may touch upon basic policy.” I have difficulty, however, with the Court’s statement that the Board is to “determine whether the impact of the issue on the interest of the employe in wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment outweighs its probable effect on the basic policy of the system as a whole.” Opinion of the Court, ante at 268, for I fear that in application this directive may prove no more lucid than the words of the Act of which we strive to give meaning. I am not sure how one identifies the “interest” of the employe in <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>wages, hours and conditions of employment, determines the “impact” of a particular issue upon such an interest, or weighs that impact against “probable effect on the basic policy of the system as a whole.” I venture to suggest that the governing test might preferably be formulated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b747-4" data-blocks='[["BL_747.4",747,[235,663,1103,1193]]]'>As to each item of potential dispute, (i. e., the items put forward in a request for bargaining) the factors to be balanced in determining the susceptibility of an item to collective bargaining are the probable effects of the granting or refusal of the item upon (a) the individual performance by the teachers of their duties as such, and upon (b) the school board’s overall operation of an educational system within its district. If the effect of the granting or denial of a request would be more direct, immediate and substantial upon the teachers’ individual performance of their duties than it would be upon the school board’s overall operation of an educational system, the item should be considered negotiable. On the other hand, if the effect would bear more directly, immediately and substantially upon the school board’s overall operation of an educational system, the opposite result should obtain — i. e., the item should be considered non-negotiable. Such balancing, of course, should be made with due regard for those areas of discretion or policy which by the terms of Sec. 702 are expressly included within the phrase “inherent managerial policy.”</blockquote>

However that may be, the Court’s opinion does not undertake to consider the specific issues involved in this litigation. (The items about which the teachers seek to bargain are merely listed in footnote 11 at the end of the opinion). The Court’s mandate is thus much like granting a “new trial” without telling the tri<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>bunal which must conduct it and the courts which, if called upon, must review the new result whether and wherein they erred as to any particular issue at the first “trial.” There is a risk, therefore, that to remand rather than decide the specific items of dispute which were addressed by the courts and Board below may prove to be a waste both of manpower and of time, and be but a postponement of the day when this Court will have to make the ultimate resolution. While normally such a course is to be avoided, I agree that the risk is worth taking in this case. The Pennsylvania Public Relations Board has more familiarity with the problems of school administration as they concern labor relations than does this Court. It is possible that no further recourse to the courts in this case will be necessary, and that in any event the issues requiring judicial attention may be substantially narrowed by a reconsideration in the light of the Court’s opinion.</p>

Quite simply, an agreement between the collective bargaining parties is forbidden to contain a provision the implementation of which “would be in violation of, or inconsistent with, or in conflict with any statute” or home rule charter. 43 P.S. § 1101.703. While in a particular case there may be disagreement as to whether such violation, inconsistency or conflict would be present, the legislative intent is clear enough. Thus I cannot agree with the majority opinion statement that items are excluded from Sec. 701 bargaining by Sec. 703 only where another statute “explicitly and definitively prohibit[s] the public employer from making an agreement” as to that item. There is no warrant for this rewriting of that section.</p>

No one specific item is all black or white and each contains substantial gray areas. This is recognized in the last sentence of Section 702 which provides <em>that policy matters affecting wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment as well as the impact thereon </em>are in that category which requires the parties to meet and discuss.

Of the 21 items proposed for bargaining, the Board had held 5 to be proper subjects, and 16 not. The Court of Common Pleas held none of the 21 items to be negotiable, and the Commonwealth Court agreed. The dissenters there concurred “in the legal analysis and rationale” of the majority, but found that this analysis, properly applied, required collective bargaining as to two of the 21 items (Nos. 3 and 22). (One of these, No. 3, had been found by the Board to be negotiable, while No. 22 had been found non-negotiable).</p>
