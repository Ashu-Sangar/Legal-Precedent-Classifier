We do not agree. The Commonwealth’s pathologist, Dr. Miller, who performed the autopsy on the victim, testified that the infant’s death was caused by a severe fracture of the skull and. internal hemorrhaging. Dr. Miller further testified that, in his opinion, the skull fracture was caused by a blunt instrument. On cross-examination, the doctor was asked if the injury could have been caused by the child's being hit with an automobile bumper. He answered it was possible, but that if an automobile had struck the child, there would have been areas of trauma other than the single area of the victim’s skull. He further testified that, because of the pressure needed to cause such a fracture as was found in the victim’s skull, it was not likely that the victim had fallen or struck his head on a stone or other hard substance. Moreover, the Commonwealth’s witness testified that there was a search of the area in which the infant’s body was found and there were no objects discovered that would be the type to cause the fracture, even if the infant had fallen from the top of an enbankment near where the body was <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>found. This proof was necessary to eliminate the pathologist’s testimony on cross-examination that if the child had fallen on a hard object, from a sufficient height, the fracture could have resulted. Finally, the child’s body was found some six-tenths of a mile from his home, which by the shortest route, would have required the two and one-half year old infant to cross two bridges.</p>

We do not agree. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the following facts support appellants’ guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. On the night the infant disappeared, appellants picked up the infant from a babysitter at about 2 a.m. (July 29, 1973). They subsequently drove the babysitter to Kit-tanning, Pennsylvania, and proceeded to their home, arriving at approximately 3 a.m. At 8:50 a.m., the same morning, appellants called the state police and reported the child missing. Both appellants fixed the time the child was discovered missing as 3:30 a.m. on the morning of July 29, 1973. Appellants testified that immediately before the child disappeared, they heard a car rapidly drive away from the area of their residence. At trial, the Commonwealth produced witnesses who saw appellant Crawford at about 2:30 a.m. on July 29, 1973 in the exact area where the infant was found. In addition, neighbors of appellants testified that at or about 3:00 a. m. on the night of the infant’s disappearance, they heard appellant Crawford return to his residence and say to appellant Young that he had been seen, to which she replied “Oh no, Oh no.” In addition the Commonwealth’s evidence establishes that appellants had the exclusive control of the infant from the time it was last seen alive, until its body was found by police. Under these facts, we are convinced that the Commonwealth’s evidence, while circumstantial, was sufficient to prove appellants’ guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth v. Paquette, </em><a href="/pa/451/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="451 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="1948574" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0250-01">451 Pa. 250</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20837" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="301 A.2d 837">301 A.2d 837</a> (1973), <em>Commonwealth v.
