A trial was had before a judge <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>and jury at the conclusion of which the appellant was found guilty of murder in the second degree. Post-trial motions were filed, argued, and, subsequently, denied. A sentence of from eight to twenty years imprisonment was imposed. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b467-4" data-blocks='[["BL_467.4",467,[204,564,1142,149]]]'>The sole issue presented in the instant appeal concerns the propriety of the trial court’s charge to the jury on the elements of voluntary manslaughter.</p>

    <p id="b467-6" data-blocks='[["BL_467.6",467,[202,856,1144,533]]]'>Two neighbors, Veronica Berry and Harry Beasley, became embroiled in a quarrel. Veronica Berry spit in Harry Beasley’s face and he in turn struck her, knocking her to the ground. Upon hearing his mother’s scream, the appellant, Donald Berry, came immediately to the scene of altercation, and found his mother on the ground. She related to her son what had happened and described how she had been illused by Mr. Beasley. Five minutes later the appellant went to the Beasley home, gained entry by force and fatally wounded the deceased.</p>
    <blockquote id="b467-7" data-blocks='[["BL_467.7",467,[243,1414,1103,803]]]'>During the course of the trial judge’s charge he stated: “Now in defining the law to you concerning voluntary manslaughter I have said it must be a sufficient or reasonable provocation. As I will instruct you as a matter of law, that a blow struck against a person who is near or dear to you by virtue of a relationship^ — and in this particular instance it is the relationship between a mother and a son, <em>that if the blow struck to the mother in the presence of the son was such that would be ordinarily reasonable and sufficient provocation, that that blow struck against his mother, though not struck against him, could be a sufficient provocation, </em>if you so found that blow to be a reasonable and sufficient provocation under the law.

However, when read in context with the remainder of the charge we are in agreement with the trial court’s observation that the implication was obscure at best and no objection was made by defense counsel at that time.</p>
    <p id="b468-4" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[273,633,1151,144]]]'>Pursuant to a request for further instruction by the jury during the course of their deliberation the following statement was made:</p>

    <p id="b468-6" data-blocks='[["BL_468.6",468,[274,1250,1150,205]]]'>At this point, the records show that counsel for the defense specifically objected to the court’s statement requiring the physical presence of the accused at the time of the assault upon the mother:</p>

I think the jury may find sufficient provocation because of the closeness of time and space, but the mere fact that they were six feet away, didn’t actually occur in their presence, would be sufficient.” </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>

The difference is this: manslaughter is never attended by legal malice or depravity of heart — that condition or frame of mind before spoken of, exhibiting wickedness of disposition, recklessness of consequences or cruelty. Being sometimes a wilful act (as the term voluntary denotes) it is necessary that the circumstances should take away every evidence of cool depravity of heart or wanton cruelty. Therefore, to reduce an intentional blow, stroke or wounding, resulting in death, to voluntary manslaughter, there must be sufficient cause of provocation, and a state of rage or passion, without time to cool, placing the prisoner beyond the control of his reason, and suddenly impelling him to the deed. If any of these be wanting — if there be provocation without passion or passion without a sufficient cause of provocation, or there be time to cool, and reason has resumed its sway, the killing will be murder.” <a href="/pa/58/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="58 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1013212" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0009-01">Id. at 17</a>.</blockquote>
