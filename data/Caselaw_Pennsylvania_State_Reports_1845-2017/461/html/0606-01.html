Appellant was repeatedly informed of his <em>Miranda, </em>rights, and, on the occasion of each recital, told the police he understood the warnings. Furthermore, appellant does not claim he was tricked or coerced by physical or psychological abuse into waiving his rights.

However, after considering all the circumstances, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence upon which the suppression court could conclude that despite appellant’s youth his waiver was valid. In reaching this decision, an important fact in our consideration is that appellant was 17 years and seven months old and apparently of normal maturity and development at the time he confessed. Thus appellant has almost reached the age at which he would no longer be considered to be in need of special protection when charged with violation of the criminal law. See Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1464, No. 333, §§ 1 et seq., 11 P.S. §§ 50-101 et seq. (Supp.1974). In these circumstances, the fact that appellant was without friendly adult advice is less significant in determining his ability to understand his rights and his capacity to assert them in the inherently coercive atmosphere of in-custody interrogation than in instances <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>where the accused is younger or less mature.
