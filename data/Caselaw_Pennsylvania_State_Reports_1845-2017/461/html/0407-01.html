Post-trial motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to imprisonment of not less than seven nor more than twenty years. This appeal centers on the admissiblity of two statements which appellant had made to the police and which constituted, substantially, the only evidence presented by the Commonwealth at trial. We conclude that, because of the illegality of appellant’s original arrest, the admission of the statements was constitutional error, and therefore reverse.</p>

After several months of fruitless investigation the police learned through questioning members of various street gangs that “Pops” Barton and a person named Tony, two members of the Master Street Moon Gang, had been “involved” in the incident. At approximately noon on November 22, 1972, Tony Whitaker, then seventeen years <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>old, was taken into custody by a Detective Ross and another detective and transported to the Police Administration Building for questioning. There he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and he signed a written waiver of his constitutional rights. In the course of the ensuing interview, appellant gave an oral statement in which he admitted that on August 31st he had accompanied John “Pops” Barton, whom he knew to be armed with a butcher knife, to the “turf” of a rival gang on South 59th Street. There Whitaker and Barton walked on separate sides of the street. Appellant heard Barton yell “58th Street” (an apparent reference to a member of the 58th Street gang), and turned to see Barton stabbing a man. Whitaker denied having participated in the assault and stated that he had immediately run from the scene. At 10:00 p. m. Whitaker’s mother arrived at the station and in her presence the substance of the oral statement was reduced to writing. After signing this statement, appellant was released from custody.</p>
    <p id="b642-4" data-blocks='[["BL_642.4",642,[266,1364,1161,983]]]'>Two days later, on November 24, 1972, acting upon the information provided by Whitaker, the police arrested Barton. Barton made a full confession in which he stated that Whitaker had participated in the attack by beating the victim, Benjamin Simmons, with his fists. Possessed of this additional information, the police went to appellant’s home on November 27, 1972 and, with Whitaker’s consent, took him to the Police Administration Building for further questioning. There Detective Grose informed Whitaker that Barton had been arrested and had given a statement accusing appellant of striking Simmons several times before Barton had used the knife. Whitaker was then again advised of his constitutional rights and again waived them in writing. He quickly then admitted, first orally and later in writing, that the events had occurred as Barton had described. After signing the written statement, appellant was formally placed under arrest.</p>

At the suppression hearing Detective Ross testified that at the time Whitaker was first apprehended on November 22 the police had no information that he had committed a crime; they had mere ly “picked up” Whitaker for questioning. The suppression judge found that the detention of appellant on November 22 constituted an arrest, and that the arrest was unlawful as without probable cause. He further held that the two statements made on that day were gained through exploitation of the illegal arrest and were, therefore inadmissible as “fruit of the poisonous tree.” A contrary result was reached, however, as to the two statements made on the 27th. The court reasoned that although the taking of Whitaker into custody on that day amounted to an arrest, probable cause for it was supplied by the confession of Barton, and the later statements were, therefore, untainted. It is this latter determination which appellant challenges today.</p>

Without belaboring the point, we think the record amply sustains these determinations. The Commonwealth does not dispute that the detention to which Whitaker was subjected on that day — twelve hours of intermittent interrogation —constituted an arrest. See <em>Commonwealth v. Bishop, </em><a href="/pa/425/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="425 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="1906762" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0175-01">425 Pa. 175</a>, 181, <a href="/citations/?q=228%20A.2d%20661" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="228 A.2d 661">228 A.2d 661</a>, 665 (1967). Neither does it argue that the arrest was valid. The police had no information about Tony Whitaker; they had merely learned, months previously, that a person known as “Tony” had been “involved” in the episode in which Simmons was killed. This may be thought to cast suspicion upon anyone in the vicinity going by that name, but mere suspicion is insufficient to support any arrest, with or <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>without a warrant.

In the present case the progression is more complex, but the fact that there are several links and a five-day time span in this chain of events is not significant; what is of critical importance for constitutional purposes is that there exists a real and direct causal connection between appellant’s unlawful arrest on November 22 and his ultimate confession on November 27. As the Commonwealth acknowledges in its brief, “ [a]s <em>a result of </em>appellant’s initial statements on November 22, 1972, the police arrested John Barton, and on November 24, 1972, he [Barton] confessed to the <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>murder and implicated Tony Whitaker, appellant, as a participant in the crime. . . <em>. As a result of </em>this information, appellant was arrested and on November 27, 1972 confessed his participation in the crime.” (Commonwealth’s brief, p. 6; emphasis added). Again it is said, “[o]n the strength of this evidence [i. e. Barton’s statement that Whitaker had taken part in the murder], appellant was arrested anew on November 27th, and <em>after being confronted with Barton’s accusation, </em>confessed his participation in the stabbing.” (Commonwealth’s brief, p. 8; emphasis added).</p>

It is argued that because the police knew the identity of Barton before appellant’s unlawful arrest, it cannot be assumed that, absent appellant’s incrimination of Barton, the latter would never have been arrested and so never would have made his confession implicating Whitaker. We cannot agree. In <em>Garvin, </em>the defendant was illegally arrested for robbery and taken to the scene of the robbery, where he was identified by one of the victims. The proof revealed that the victim had had an opportunity to observe her assailant for as long as five minutes under good lighting conditions. There was thus clearly a basis for the identification wholly independent of the unconstitutional arrest. We held that the identification evidence was not the product of the unlawful arrest because the arrest had “contributed neither to the knowledge of the witnesses nor to the accuracy of their identification.” <em>Commonwealth v.

It is worth repeating that in the almost three months prior to appellant’s arrest and statements on November 22, the police had learned nothing concerning the Simmons murder with the exception of a vague reference to two names; they had no evidence which would link Barton to the crime. It is possible, of course, that sooner or later the police might have amassed sufficient information from a source independent of the appellant upon which to arrest Barton, but the fact remains that, as far as the record shows, the investigation had not focused on Barton, nor was independent evidence implicating Barton available or likely to be so.

This concatenation of events completes the causal chain. The situation is the same, causally, as if Whitaker, in his first statement, had fatally implicated himself as well as Barton, rather than Barton alone.</p>
