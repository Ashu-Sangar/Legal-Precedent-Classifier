On May 16, 1973, appellant’s first trial on the charge of which he was convicted began. On May 23, before the completion of the Commonwealth’s case and during a recess, the trial judge became ill and the trial was continued by the president judge until May 29 in order to ascertain whether the original judge would be able to promptly resume the trial. When informed of the need for this delay, appellant’s counsel orally moved for a mistrial to avoid the danger of prejudicing the jury. Action on this motion was deferred until May 29.</p>

The president judge, however, stated that he had granted the motion for a mistrial before reading the motion to withdraw it. He also observed that it would be several weeks before the original j udge could resume his duties <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and concluded that it would be unfair to both parties and to the jury to continue the proceedings any further. The motion to withdraw the motion for a mistrial was formally denied and a mistrial declared. Subsequently appellant was retried and convicted of voluntary manslaughter. The claim that the second trial subjected appellant to double jeopardy has been asserted at all appropriate stages of the proceedings.</p>

In that case, the defendant moved for a mistrial at the end of the first day of jury deliberations on the ground that the jury was deadlocked. This motion was denied, but a mistrial was declared after the jury had deliberated for several hours the next day, the trial court expressing the view that the jury was exhausted and that forcing it to continue deliberations risked an unjust verdict. No new motion for a mistrial was before the court, but it asserted that it was “in effect” agreeing to the motion made the previous day. The Third Circuit held that a second trial would violate the double jeopardy clause. In disposing of the contention that retrial was proper because defendant had moved for a mistrial, that court wrote:</p>

A rule requiring a motion by the defendant for declaration of a mistrial in this type of case would entail total abandonment of the prosecution rather than merely its completion before an arguably imperfect tribunal., As the trial court in this case observed, “If a judge dies, and if the defendant has to be the one to make the motion for a mistrial, he would never come to trial.”</p>

These suggestions were rejected and a mistrial declared. We held that in the absence of more definite information on the nature of the illness or any effort to protect the defendant’s “valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal” there was no “manifest necessity” for declaration of a mistrial.

Because appellant had testified, the Commonwealth wished to introduce evidence of appellant’s plea of guilty to an indictment for burglary in another county to impeach his credibility. It therefore called the deputy clerk of courts of that county as a witness. After establishing his name and official position, the following colloquy occurred:</p>

First, it contends that evidence of a plea of guilty should be admissible even though no judgment of sentence has yet been entered upon the plea.
