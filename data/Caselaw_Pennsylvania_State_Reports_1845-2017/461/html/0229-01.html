Consequently, the issue of the admissibility of the confession was waived for purposes of appellate review. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>In his PCHA petition, appellant maintains that the waiver of the issue of the admissibility of the confession constituted ineffective assistance of counsel <em>on appeal. </em>However, trial counsel (who also served as counsel on direct appeal) did not waive the issue by neglecting to raise it on appeal; he waived it by failing to object to the introduction of the statement at trial. The waiver <em>at trial </em>precluded the assertion of the issue <em>on appeal. </em>Thus, in this case, counsel’s effectiveness on appeal can only be measured by a consideration of his effectiveness at trial. If counsel had some reasonable basis for his failure to preserve the issue at trial, appellant cannot now complain that the resultant unavailability of the waived issue denied him the effective assistance of appellate counsel. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The testimony of those witnesses placed the appellant at the scene and unequivocally inculpated appellant as the perpetrator of the homicide. Although appellant’s statement to the police contained an admission that he had shot the victim, it also indicated that he had acted in self-defense or at least in the heat of passion. By acquiescing to the ad<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>mission of the statement and by using the exculpatory portions of it to rebut or weaken the prosecution’s very strong case, counsel had an eminently <em>“reasonable basis </em>designed to effectuate [appellant’s] interest.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

Although other reasonable courses might have been chosen, counsel’s particular election of strategy does not lead to the conclusion that his choice constituted ineffective assistance at trial. <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

On the contrary, his strategy was very effective. Appellant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter rather than a degree of murder. Since counsel had a reasonable basis for his chosen course of action at trial, the resultant waiver of the issue cannot constitute ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.</p>
