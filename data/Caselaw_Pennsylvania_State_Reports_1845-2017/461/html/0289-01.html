After a denial of post trial motions, a sentence of life imprisonment <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>was imposed on the murder conviction.

Accompanied by Edmund Perry, he proceeded to his automobile which was parked nearby. As Hopkins started to unlock the door of the vehicle, four men, including the appellant Martin, approached with guns drawn. The gunmen threatened to kill them both unless they cooperated. Hopkins and Perry were ordered to enter Hopkins’ car. Three of the four gunmen joined them. The fourth followed closely behind in another car. The two vehicles traveled to 19th and Cumberland Streets. The captives were then ushered through an alley into a house through the back entrance. In the kitchen, Hopkins and Perry were searched and ordered to sit on the floor. The abductors took from Hopkins $400 in cash and his eyeglasses. Perry was also robbed of some monies. Their hands were then tied behind their backs and they were blindfolded. They were then led out the front door of the house and forced into the back seat of Hopkins’ car where they were joined by Martin. He ordered them to bend over <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>on the rear seat. In the meantime, Hopkins’ blindfold became partially dislodged and he was able to observe a rifle or sawed-off shotgun in the hands of a front seat passenger. He was also able to see through the rear view mirror the same car following that had followed them before. After driving awhile the car stopped. The captives were led into a house having a small passageway and ordered to kneel. It was pitch dark. A match was lit and a loud noise went off. Edward Perry was fatally shot in the head by a shotgun. He fell against Hopkins. Hopkins began to struggle, but he was pushed back to the floor and a second shot was fired. He yelled that he was struck albeit he was not. A third shot went off narrowly missing Hopkins’ head. At that time, he played dead. His would-be killers fled. After waiting a few minutes, Hopkins managed to free himself. He found assistance and reported the crime to the police.</p>

Initially, he complains of this officer’s opening statement to the jury. It is urged it contained “many knowing false, misleading or inadmissible assertions” which so inflamed and prejudiced the jury against Martin that a fair trial was impossible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a> One such alleged statement was that the evidence would show the killing was a “planned assassination for hire” by “hit men or professional assassins, killers and terrorists.” This was strong language, but in most part a legitimate inference to be drawn from the testimony. The brutal nature of the killing, and the systematic and cold execution thereof bespeaks of a gangland-type killing. It is true the trial evidence failed to show the killing was “for hire” and, hence, the assistant district attorney should not have so indicated in his opening,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> but this inadvertence, in itself, could not have given rise to the prejudice Martin asserts. And, as we have said previously, language of the prosecuting officer in the opening statement which will justify a reversal must be such that its unavoidable effect is to so prejudice the jury against the accused, as to prevent the finding of a true verdict. See <em>Commonwealth v. Hoffman, </em><a href="/pa/439/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="439 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1930989" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0348-01">439 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20726" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="266 A.2d 726">266 A.2d 726</a> (1970). It should also be noted that in more than one instance instantly the trial judge cautioned the jury that statements of counsel were not evidence and that the jury and only the jury was to determine the facts. Under all of the circumstances, we find the complaint under discussion to be without sufficient merit to require a retrial. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.
