The applicant sought permission to erect a dwelling on a specified lot of a subdivision which it proposed to lay out from a portion of its 50-.acre tract of unimproved land in East-town Township. The refusal of the permit was based Qn.the fact that, the lot upon which the proposed dwelling was. to be built was patently deficient in area, as <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>well as frontage, under the provisions of the township’s zoning ordinance. According to its title, the ordinance is known and cited as “The Easttown Township Zoning Ordinance of 1939” although enacted August 6, 1940. It is the same ordinance that was before us for interpretation and enforcement, in another connection, in <em>Devereux Foundation, Inc., Zoning Case, </em><a href="/pa/351/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="351 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="462762" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0478-01">351 Pa. 478</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20744" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="41 A.2d 744">41 A. 2d 744</a> (1945).</p>
    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[256,805,1148,766]]]'>As shown by the maps attached to and made part of the ordinance, property fronting on Greenlawn Road in Easttown Township is classified “A” residential. In such a district a single-family dwelling, inter alia, is a permissible structure on a lot of a minimum area of not less than 43,560 square feet (an acre) and having a frontage of 150 feet. For less restricted districts, the minimum lot areas and frontages are scaled downward by the ordinance and its incorporated maps. Greenlawn Road, which runs in a generally east-west direction, constitutes part of the northern boundary of Easttown Township and its center line is the division line between Tredyffrin Township on the north and Easttown Township on the south.</p>
    <p id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.6",104,[252,1584,1147,655]]]'>Tredyffrin Construction Co. acquired its land in Easttown Township in 1948. At least, a considerable part of the property abutted on Greenlawn Road and was, consequently, in an “A” residential zone. Nonetheless, the Tredyffrin Cónstruction Co. in 1955 applied to the Zoning Officer of Easttown Township for a building permit for the erection of a single-family dwelling on a lot fronting on Greenlawn Road, having an area of only 21,000 square feet and a frontage of 100 feet. The Zoning Officer understandably refused to certify the application as a compliance with the requirements of the ordinance.</p>

    <p id="b105-3" data-blocks='[["BL_105.4",105,[154,746,1156,1433]]]'>All that Tredyffrin Construction Co. offered in evidence at the hearing before the Board of Adjustment (in addition to the Easttown Township zoning ordinance) was the testimony of several witnesses that, under the Tredyffrin Township ordinance and its related maps, the minimum lot areas on the side of Greenlawn Road opposite Easttown Township were less than those prescribed for an “A” residential district under the Easttown ordinance, and that 21,000 squre foot lots, as proposed by Tredyffrin Construction Co., could be improved with dwellings with no greater burden to the township for the widening and improvement of streets or the disposal of sewage than one-acre lots would impose. The fact is that the lot area restrictions of the Tredyffrin Township ordinance to which the appellant thus made reference for comparative purposes, had been down-graded by a re-zoning made at the instance of Tredyffrin Construction Co., itself, which had owned, developed and sold the properties on the north side of Greenlawn Road in Tredyffrin Township to which it now pointed, first, as a reason for a requested down-grading by Easttown of its “A” residential zoning restrictions and, second, as proof of asserted unreasonableness and arbitrariness of, the Easttown ordinance as applied to the applicant’s property.</p>

Nor did the Bilbar Construction Company, Tredyffrin’s subsequent grantee which, on stipulation, was joined as a party appellant months after the matter had been appealed to the court, ever offer any evidence at any time touching the alleged invalidity of Easttown’s one-acre lot requirement in an “A” residential zone. The evidence as to lot areas and frontages in Tredyffrin Township was, of course, of no relevancy or materiality whatsoever even had Tredyffrin Construction Co. been seeking a variance which, for obvious reasons, it was avowedly not doing.</p>

It was manifestly a case of great hardship. Yet, there was nothing to be done about it because of the disparity in the zoning regulations of the two political subdivisions on their respective sides of the same public thoroughfare. It is plain enough that zoning restrictions in one township cannot be permitted to control or impinge upon the zoning regulations which a contiguous township may see fit to adopt. See <em>Gignoux v. Village of Kings Point, </em><a href="/citations/?q=99%20N.Y.S.2d%20280" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="99 N.Y.S.2d 280">99 N.Y.S. 2d 280</a>, 286.</p>

    <p id="b107-4" data-blocks='[["BL_107.5",107,[175,577,1148,713]]]'>The court below aptly epitomized the record before it as follows: “We do not understand the grounds of objection of appellants to the decision of the Board of Adjustment to be that the zoning regulations here involved have no substantial relation to public health, safety, morals or general welfare. Indeed, we find no evidence that they have no such substantial relation; and therefore, we may not interfere with their enforcement on that ground. See Gratton v. Conte, <a href="/pa/364/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="364 Pa. 578" data-case-ids="1223464" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0578-01">364 Pa. 578</a>, 584. Nor is there any evidence that the action of the Supervisors in establishing those regulations, or of the Board in its decision, was arbitrary or capricious.”</p>
    <p id="b107-5" data-blocks='[["BL_107.6",107,[176,1310,1149,982]]]'>The contention which the appellants have sought to advance boils down to the bald proposition that, under the meagre and immaterial facts which they adduced, the minimum lot area of one acre, which the Easttown ordinance prescribed for an “A” residential district, is presumptively unconstitutional. Certainly, there is nothing else in this case upon which to attempt an argument that the lot area restriction, as applied to the appellants’ property, is arbitrary, unreasonable and confiscatory or that the restriction bears no reasonable relation to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the community. The appellants contend, nonetheless, that the Easttown Township zoning ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to their property although the record, which the applicant presented to the Board of Adjustment and subsequently to the court below, and upon which the appellants now rest, affords no basis for the contention.</p>
