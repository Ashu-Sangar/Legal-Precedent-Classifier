On May 23, 1957, Tate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The lower court granted a rule to show cause and appointed a qualified member of the Lancaster Bar, who. was Tate’s co-counsel at the time of his original trial, to represent him in the present habeas corpus proceeding. The lower court, after hearing argument, dismissed Tate’s petition and this appeal followed.</p>

In a trial by jury in a criminal case, it is well settled that there are some matters which a defendant can waive and other matters and safeguards, which are so fundamental in nature, and implicit in trial by jury, that even the defendant cannot waive in a capital case: <em>Commonwealth v. Petrillo, </em><a href="/pa/340/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="340 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1203358" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0033-01">340 Pa. 33</a>, 34-46, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.2d%2050" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="16 A.2d 50">16 A. 2d 50</a>. A defendant in a trial by jury in a criminal case, cannot constitutionally waive a swearing of the the jury: <em>Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/317/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="317 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="8845822" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0321-01">317 Pa. 321</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.%20908" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="176 A. 908">176 A. 908</a>. However, there is no uniform or prescribed method of qualifying a jury by oath; in some counties jurors, after being chosen, are sworn individually, while in other counties the oath is not administered until the entire jury is chosen and the jury is then sworn. The system of swearing individual jurors prevails in Philadelphia County and has been approved by this Court in <em>Com</em>

    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[234,807,1147,1161]]]'>Tate’s next contention is that the sentence of life imprisonment was void because the sentencing judge failed to ask him if he had anything to say why sentence should not be passed upon him. The record fails to show whether this question was asked prior to imposing sentence, but the sentencing judge certified that it was his recollection and the recollection of the deputy clerk, as well as the recollection of counsel for Tate that the question was asked Tate at the time of sentence. In <em>Commonwealth v. Senauskas, </em><a href="/pa/327/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="327 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1176726" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0541-01">327 Pa. 541</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.%20646" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="194 A. 646">194 A. 646</a>, this Court, after reviewing the common law rule, prior decisions, and the reason for the rule, said (page 549) : “The practice of propounding to a prisoner in a capital case the above stated question [whether defendant had anything to say why sentence of death should not be pronounced against him] has been long followed and . . . careful judges will continue to make in such cases this ancient inquiry in unequivocal language. Failure to do so will constitute reversible error <em>only when it is shown that the prisoner has been thereby prejudiced.</em>

L. 872, §701, IS P.S. 4701, provides pertinently as follows: “. . .

The court shall impose the sentence so fixed, as in other cases. . . .” If there were error in this case it would be harmless error (1) because the jury’s verdict fixed the penalty at life imprisonment and the Court is required by statute to “impose the sentence so fixed”; and (2) because failure to ask such question does not void the conviction but.merely entitled defendant to a resentencing: <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
