Thereafter, the plaintiff performed the duties of his post until June 25, 1956, when, at a special meeting of the school directors, a resolution was passed abolishing the position of supervising principal and suspending plaintiff from his employment.

This power, we believe, necessarily carries with, it the right to abolish the position when, in the discretion of the board, the services of a supervising principal are no longer required: <em>Smith v.
