The petitioners are a childless couple in whose custody Gerald was placed on November 17, 1953, when he was not quite a year old, and with whom he has ever since lived at their home in Indiana, Pennsylvania.</p>

They alleged in their petition that Gerald had been abandoned by his natural parents and that the abandonment had endured for more than six months, parental consent not being a prerequisite to a decree of adoption where abandonment is pleaded and proven. The applicable statute (Act of June 30, 1947, P.L. 1180, 1 PS §1 et seq.) expressly provides in Section 2 that “The consent of a parent who has . . . abandoned the child, for a period of at least six months, shall be unnecessary, provided such fact is proven to the satisfaction of the court or judge hearing the petition, in which case such court or judge shall so find as a fact.” The hearing judge, after taking testimony, found that there had been no abandonment and entered an order refusing the prayer of the petition.</p>

George Bair, Carol’s husband, was then living temporarily in the State of Indiana. At that time, Mrs. Patricia Maytea (George Bair’s first cousin) together with her mother, Mrs. Twila Duncan, visited the home of Mrs. Louis Bair. During the course of the visit, Mrs. Louis Bair requested that Mrs. Maytea and her husband take Gerald into their home and care <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>for him. Gerald’s mother, who was present, made no objection to her mother-in-law’s proposal. The May-teas, having considered the matter for several weeks, on November 17, 1953, took custody of Gerald who, as already stated, has ever since been living at the the Mayteas’ home and has been supported, maintained and cared for by them exclusively.</p>
    <p id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[231,741,1159,1599]]]'>On February 11, 1954, approximately three months after Gerald had been placed in the Mayteas’ home, George and Oarol Bair, then temporarily reunited, called there. On that occasion George demanded that Gerald be returned to him. Andrew Maytea responded resentfully, telling George to take the baby and leave. However, George made no move to do so. Andrew then added that the Bairs could not take Gerald unless they paid the Mayteas |500 for the expenses of his maintenance and support while in their care. At the hearing on the adoption petition, Mrs. Maytea testified, with reference to the Bairs’ visit of February 11, 1954, that George Bair had said that he “came for his kid”; that his wife wanted the baby left where he was; and that “she [Mrs. Bair] disagreed with the husband, she said she wasn’t going to live with him, and didn’t know who was going to take care of the kids.” The Bairs left the Maytea house that day without taking Gerald with them. Following this episode, George Bair never again made any profession of a desire to take custody of Gerald until after the institution of the adoption proceeding when, during the court hearing on the adoption petition (January 26 and 28, 1955), he stated that he wanted the custody of Gerald. Mrs. Carol Bair who was also present at the hearing did not take the witness stand in support of her husband’s testimony. The bona fides of George’s conduct in the premises is indeed open to very serious question as will later appear.</p>

The court justified its order in an accompanying opinion on the basis of George Bair’s testimony, concluding therefrom that his failure to pursue his expressed desire for Gerald’s custody was due to his inability to pay the Mayteas the sum demanded by Andrew Maytea for Gerald’s maintenance and support while the child was living with them. The court accordingly held that there had been no parental abandonment of Gerald.</p>

Oñ December 14, <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>1955, counsel for the Mayteas, fearful that his clients might be held to be finally concluded by the order of October 27, 1955, if unappealed, took a precautionary appeal therefrom to this court. Then followed an utterly inexcusable example of “the law’s delay.” The appeal which, in ordinary course, would have appeared on this court’s list for the March 1956 Session in Pittsburgh, was continued to the September Session by counsel, the matter obviously not being ripe for appellate review since the court below had not taken any action on the rule which it had granted on November 4, 1955. In the meantime, a motion to quash the . appeal was filed by counsel for the respondents on the ground that it was premature. In that situation the appeal, together with the motion to quash, was placed on our list for the September 1956 Session in Pittsburgh. When the case was reached on September 25, 1956, and the situation was orally explained by counsel, we forthwith remanded the record to the court below for the taking of further testimony offered and for a final disposition of the matter. However, nothing was done by the court below throughout that fall; and, on January 1, 1957, the tenure of the judge who had heard the case came to an end by expiration of his term of office.</p>

The proposed amendment set forth in greater detail, by way of Exhibits A and B, certifications by the officer in charge of “Branch 7, Enlisted Services and Records Div., Bureau of Naval Personnel”, U.S.N., showing the disposition which George Bair and his wife, on their own sworn affirmation, had made of their four children, including Gerald. The certification, identified by the petition as Exhibit A, <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>stated that George Wilson Bair and Carol Jean Bair had placed theirs sons George Wilson Bair, Jr., and Martin Lee Bair, age 6 and 4 years respectively, with the Lake County Welfare Department (Gary, Indiana) for adoption; that they had placed their son, Jerry Harry Bair (Gerald) age 1% years, in the home of their cousins, Patricia and Andrew Maytea, 1130 Church Street, Indiana, Pennsylvania, <em>to be raised and cared for by them until he reaches legal maturity; </em>and that they still retained custody of their minor daughter, Sharon Joyce Bair, age 2% years, and desired to claim <em>only </em>her as their dependent. This affirmation by the Bairs had been made, as already stated, in May of 1954.</p>
    <p id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[196,1147,1147,980]]]'>The certification, identified as' Exhibit B, was a copy of a letter from the Lake County Department of Public Welfare, dated May 18, 1954, addressed to the chief officer of the United States Navy Recruiting Station at Gary, Indiana, the captioned subject matter being George Bair, Sr., who was then apparently an applicant for enlistment in the Navy. The letter of the Welfare Agency reads as follows in presently material part: “As per your request, we submit this statement that George Bair, Sr., and Carol Bair, husband and wife, signed consents on 2-19-54 for the adoptive placement of their two sons, George, b. 6-16-48 and Martin Bair, b. 10-17-50.

A very brief answer was filed on September 3, 1957. The only averments of the petition which the answer purported to deny were the paragraphs relating to the matter contained in the certifications by the Navy Department Officer, with respect to which, the answer merely alleged that “the' means of proof are in the exclusive control of petitioners and proof thereof, therefore is demanded.” This denial in its implied disclaimer of information, concerning the substance of the certifications was tantamount to an admission. See Rule 1029(b) and (c) of Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. It is, of course, not open to question that George and Carol Bair had first-hand knowledge as to whether or not they had affirmed, on oath, to the Navy Department in May, 1954, that they had placed their son, Gerald, with their cousins, the Mayteas, to be raised and cared for by them until he had reached legal maturity or that they also knew equally well whether they had placed the older two of their four children with the Lake County Department of Public Welfare, Gary, Indiana, on February 19, 1954, for adoption, as stated by the Welfare Agency’s letter in response to the inquiry of the U.S.N. Recruiting Station. The attempt of the respondents’ answer to deny their knowledge of the matters set forth in the proposed amendment was little less than an affront to the intelligence of the court.</p>

The court thereafter entered an order discharging the rule for a rehearing, holding that the additional evidence contained in the Mayteas’ petitions would not have sufficient probative value to change the findings and order of the court of October 27, 1955, refusing a decree of adoption. In the undis<a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>puted circumstances this conclusion was palpable error.

In fact, as already stated, Mrs. Bair did not take the witness stand. Nor has she ever once, since she placed Gerald with the Mayteas in November, 1953, requested or even expressed a desire that he be taken from them.</p>

The record makes that clear beyond cavil. His only request, from the time of the infant’s placement with the Mayteas until the hearing on the adoption petition fourteen months later, was when he and his wife called at the Mayteas’ home on February 11, 1954. Yet, within two weeks of that time (viz., on February 24, 1954) they placed their two older sons George, Jr., age 6, and Martin, age 4, with the Lake County Department of Public Welfare, <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>in Gary, Indiana, for adoption and three months after that (in May, 1954) they affirmed on oath to the Navy Department, in pertinent official connection, that they had placed Gerald'in the home of the Mayteas “to be raised and cared for by them until he reaches legal maturity.”</p>

The petitioners’ burden in respect of George Bair’s alleged abandonment of Gerald (the mother’s voluntary surrender of him to the Mayteas never having been questioned) was to prove that George Bair intended to escape parental responsibility for the child and in effectuation thereof had failed to support and maintain Gerald for a period of at least six months prior to the institution of the adoption proceeding on December 20, 1954. Certain it is that, except for George Bair’s request for Gerald at the time of his call at the Mayteas’ home on February 11, 1954, he never made any claim to a parent’s right to the child or ever attempted to perform the slightest parental responsibility for his support and maintenance. At the hearing on the adoption petition in January, 1955, Mrs. Patricia Maytea testified as follows: “Q. And since February 11, 1954, George Bair knew that you had that child, is that correct? A.

No. Q. Has he ever shown any desire to exercise any parental rights over the child since February 11, 1954? A. No.” Not only was this not contradicted but it was actually corroborated by George Bair, himself, when, on cross-examination) he testified as follows: “Q. Now, Mr. Bair, from February 11, 1954, until the date of this hearing •you knew that the May teas had your son? A. That is correct. . . . Q.

    <p id="b346-5" data-blocks='[["BL_346.6",346,[230,1528,1150,599]]]'>As to whether the Mayteas’ adoption of Gerald would be in the best interest of the child’s welfare the court below said, “Petitioners’ counsel strongly urges that petitioners would provide the child with a good home and that its welfare would be promoted by the adoption sought. We feel this may be admitted.” In so concluding, the court was but giving effect to the investigation and report which it had requested of a senior worker for the Indiana County Welfare Services, who testified that the home of the petitioners would be a satisfactory adoptive home for the child.</p>
    <p id="b346-6" data-blocks='[["BL_346.7",346,[230,2139,1144,212]],["BL_347.1",347,[185,354,1149,1440]]]'>In conclusion, we are impelled to say that it is time that this proceeding be terminated by the entry of a decree of adoption. The child in controversy is now in his sixth year; he has been with the petitioners <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>and cared for by them, as their child, since he was eleven months old; they are the only parents he has ever known; and their home is and for most of his life has been his only home. “The emotional disturbance to a child that would threaten from its being removed summarily and permanently from familiar and agreeable surroundings and associations, incident to the only parental control and supervision it has ever known, could have a very harmful effect on the child’s whole life. Fortunately, the law’s regard for a child’s welfare does not admit of any such injury or harm being done it.” <em>Davies Adoption </em>Case, supra, at p. 588. It is only where the law’s requirements have not been faithfully pursued, such, for example, as where a natural parent’s surrender of her right to her child’s custody is obtained by over-reaching, amounting to fraud and deception, that the intimate relation arising between the custodian and the child is to be disregarded in an attempted adoption by the custodian. Cf. <em>Ashton Adoption Case, </em>supra. The law favors adoption of children in need of homes who are without proper care by their natural parents; and, once a decree of adoption is entered pursuant to due legal procedure, the reciprocal rights and liabilities of foster parents and their adopted children are as firmly fixed in law as are those of natural parents and their offspring.</p>
    <p id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[184,1808,1145,204]]]'>The decree of the court below is reversed at the appellees’ costs and the record remanded for the entry of a decree of adoption as prayed for by the petitioners.</p>
