In this respect the court below erred. Section 2 of the statute opens public records to examination and inspection by <em>“any </em>citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsly vania”; Section 3 gives to <em>“any </em>citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania” the right to take extracts, make copies, photographs or photostats of public records; Section 4 grants the right of appeal from the denial of such right to <em>“any </em>citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Despite the all inclusive character of the statutory language the court below limited the application of the statute to those citizens who have no interest, personal or property, in the examination and inspection of the records. The rationale of this determination was that, since prior to the 1957 statute any person who had a personal or property interest was entitled to examine and inspect public records, the purpose of the statute was to “enlarge the rights of the general public for the examination and inspection of public records” and not to divest or restrict such rights previously vested in persons having a personal or property interest. Such a construction of the statute ignores the plain language of the statute, the state of the law on the subject prior to the statute and erroneously assumed that notes of field investigations were public records open for disclosure to appellee prior to the statute.</p>
