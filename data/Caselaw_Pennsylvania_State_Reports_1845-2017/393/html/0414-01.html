Distributor admitted the debt, but alleging the breach of an oral contract for the exclusive sale and distribution of Manufacturer’s products, counterclaimed for $22,682.78 which sum represented commissions allegedly due her on sales made in her territory in 1954 directly by Manufacturer.</p>
    <p id="b453-8" data-blocks='[["BL_453.11",453,[146,1468,1149,323]]]'>The issue of the existence of the alleged contract was submitted to a jury which returned a verdict in favor of Distributor on her counterclaim in the amount of $11,300. After Manufacturer’s motions for judgment n.o.v. and, in the alternative, for a new trial were dismissed by the court <em>en bane, </em>this appeal was taken.</p>

By the terms of the <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>agreement Distributor was granted an exclusive franchise to sell Manufacturer’s appliances to dealers within a radius of “approximately” 150 or 200 miles of the Borough of Yandergrift. No effective date for this agreement was specified, neither was the duration of the franchise fixed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In the event that Manufacturer sold air coolers directly to dealers within the territory, Distributor was to be paid a commission on each unit sold equal to “more or less” the difference between the distributor and dealer costs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It is upon this provision that Distributor bases her counterclaim for commissions on the sales made directly by Manufacturer in 1954.</p>

She did not agree to refrain from selling the air conditioning appliances of competitors, or from selling Manufacturer’s appliances outside her territory. As a matter of fact, Distributor did not even promise to invest either her time, money or effort to promote the sale of Manufacturer’s products; Distributor’s witness testified that such matters were left entirely to her discretion. In this regard the record indicates that she continued to engage in the plumbing and heating business at her establishment in addition to marketing Manufacturer’s air cooling units. In short, Distributor’s obligations under the oral agreement were illusory and capable of performance without detriment to herself or benefit to Manufacturer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This lack of consideration relieves Manufacturer from any obligation under the oral agreement for the exclusive sale and distribution of Manufacturer’s products.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
