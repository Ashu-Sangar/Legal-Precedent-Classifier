In the present case, the payment of the tax can be considered voluntary only in the most labored sense of the word. The primary transaction for which the corporation was organized, namely the purchase of the project, was in danger of being rescinded by the government agency because of the possible impairment of the mortgage. No logical or practical course of action was open to the Association and it was thus compelled to pay the tax under protest. Under the unique factual situation presented herein, there was no exclusive statutory remedy that would adequately protect the Association; the payment of the tax was <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>not voluntary, and the Association was entitled to rely on the common law remedy and sue in assumpsit for the recovery of the amount paid.</p>

    <p id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.6",530,[260,974,1152,1393]],["BL_531.1",531,[140,357,1146,428]]]'>The Enabling Act of 1947, as it existed prior to the previously enumerated amendments provides: “. . . school districts of the third class and school districts of the fourth class may, in their discretion, by ordinance or resolution, for general revenue purposes, levy, assess and collect or provide for the levying, assessment and collection of such taxes ... on persons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property <em>within the limits of such political subdivisions </em>as they shall determine . .Act of June 25,1947, P. L. 1145, §1, as amended. (Emphasis added). The School District’s resolution purported to tax the transfer of real estate, which it defined as “The . . . change of possession of real estate ... by the surrender of possession by the grantor or his agent . . . and the entry or constructive entry into possession by <em>the </em>grantee or Ms agent, <em>which . </em>. . <em>change of possession takes place at the site of </em>the real estate involved regardless of where the deed is prepared, executed, delivered, accepted, recorded or where settlement is consummated.” (Emphasis added). The Enabling Act thus authorized a School District to tax a transaction or privilege within the limits of its political subdivision. By the use of the italicized phrase, the School District obviously attempted to tax the actual or constructive physical <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>change of possession which <em>may </em>be involved in a real estate transfer, and which must take place at the situs of the real estate.

If the execution or recording of a deed which is only evidence of the transfer of legal title can be so regarded, then the actual or constructive change of possession of the real estate itself, if it takes place within the taxing jurisdiction, is also a taxable event whether it be considered as a transaction or a privilege. Although the settlement and the execution of the deed herein took place outside the school district, this is not the “transaction or privilege” that the instant resolution purports to tax. In <em>L.

The City had argued that the ordinance was a tax on the “privilege” of transferring real estate. However, the Court properly concluded that, even if this inference could reasonably be drawn from the wording of the ordinance, which in itself was doubtful, the <em>exercise </em>of the privilege by the making, issuing or delivering of the deed, which were the only events enumerated in the ordinance, was performed outside the taxing district. Under the instant resolution, there is no doubt as to the taxable event, and that the taxable event — the actual or constructive physical change of <em>possession </em>— if <em>it tooh place at all, </em>must have taken place within the school district.</p>
