According to their attorney, they both told him that they wanted and had agreed “ ‘ “ that whatever we have left, our residuary estate after the payment of taxes and so forth, shall go to institutions operated by or having some connection with the Catholic Church.” ’ He suggested to them that it was not necessary at that time to draw wills, but instead, ‘if that was their agreement that the property should go that way then they should agree right then and there that the survivor should make a will carrying out their joint wishes and they both said, “well, that is what we will do” and between themselves they said, “well, whoever the survivor is, the survivor will make the will” ’ .... In 1938 Mr. Gredler died; he left no will, all the property held as tenants by the entireties passing to his widow by operation of law.” In 1941 Mrs. Gredler executed a will in which she left legacies to Catholic institutions which were included in a list contained on a slip of paper which she told her attorney were “the institutions and the places that Bill [her husband] wants to have the money . . . .” In 1947 she made a new will in which she left her residuary estate to other institutions.
