From the class of “descendants” testatrix’s children are excluded both by her description of the events upon which “descendants” were to take and the share which they were to take: the reference in the third paragraph to certain named “grandchildren” did not operate to exclude them as “descendants” yet the terms of the fourth paragraph indicate that “grandchildren”, while includable in the class of “descendants”, would not necessarily represent the totality of membership in such class.

For instance, when testatrix describes certain possible recipients of her bounty as “next of kin” and “heirs and next of kin” she directs that the composition of each class shall be determined “in accordance with the intestate laws of the State of Pennsylvania”. Had testatrix simply described such possible distributees as “next of kin” and/or “heirs and next of kin” they would be construed as “including only those relatives who are in the nearest degree of relationship to the person designated, to the exclusion of the children of any relatives in that degree who died prior to the gift’s taking effect, even though the latter would have shared in the estate, under the applicable statutes, had the ancestor died intestate”: 57 Am.

However, the instant testatrix qualified such distributees “in accordance with the intestate laws of the State of Pennsylvania”. The result is that the words “next of kin” and “heirg and next of kin” “are to be regarded as <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>superfluous or having been used by the testatrix in their popular sense, meaning those who are entitled to the personal estate of a decedent under the statute of distribution”: <em>Garrett’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/249/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="249 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="1013663" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0249-01">249 Pa. 249</a>, 252, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.%20927" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="94 A. 927">94 A. 927</a>. Therefore had any of the events occurred upon which distribution was directed to be made under the will either to the “next of kin” or “heirs and next of kin” it would have had to be made to the persons entitled under the intestate laws, <em>including blood relatives as well as persons not of the blood, as a husband or a wife. </em>Furthermore, the power of appointment given by testatrix to her “last surviving child” under Paragraph 4(4) was <em>not </em>restricted to persons of the blood. Unless it be present in the word “descendants” there appears to be no restriction of distribution to persons of the blood under this will. If the testatrix did not see fit to weave into the fabric of this will a restriction of distribution of her estate to persons of blood descent does the employment of the word “descendants” compel that we do so? Neither etymologically nor legally does the word “descendants” connote a blood relationship.</p>

In the absence -of any language in this will from which an intent can be inferred to limit , the meaning of “descendants” to persons in the blood line and in view of the broad ■ meaning of “descendants”, to hold that adopted children are excluded from the .terms of this will would deprive them of the benefit of the statutory declaration conferring upon them <em>all </em>— not some — of the fights of a natural child. Had testatrix’s deceased child -been survived by natural children, obviously they would have been “descendants” of such deceased child. To exclude adopted children — occupying a status equating that of natural children — from the class of their adopted mother’s “descendants” on the, basis of an assumed intent on testatrix’s part to exclude from the word “descendants” persons not of the blood is without basis either in the provisions of this will or in the law in effect when testatrix died.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a> That appellants <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>were not adopted until long after the effective date of the will does not compel a contrary conclusion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a> Testatrix foresaw that the time of taking by her children’s “descendants” would-be in the distant future and she actually provided that only those “descendants” would take who survived her child or children; certainly testatrix knew that her child or children legally could and actually might adopt children before the event of taking. Is it any less logical to conclude that testatrix intended that adopted children be includéd in the class of takers than to conclude that testatrix intended that only natural children or children of the blood be included in such class? Neither etymologically nor historically has the word “descendants” acquired such significance that it points unerringly in this will— in the face of the legally accepted equation of status of an adopted child and a natural child — to an intent to excludé'fro'm a testatrix’s bounty children legally adopted by her children.</p>
