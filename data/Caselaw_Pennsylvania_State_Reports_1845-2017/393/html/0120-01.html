(2) A Court of Equity has jurisdiction to enjoin continuing flights of aircraft over a landowner’s property at heights which are below the minimum safe altitudes of flight. Whether a Court of Equity has jurisdiction to enjoin aircraft flights which are within the air space necessary for safe takeoffs or landings if such flights imminently endanger a property owner’s life or property, was not decided. (3) Flights of aircraft over privately owned land which are so low and so frequent as to be a direct and immediate interference with the use and enjoyment of the land amount to a “taking” of the land or, depending on the facts, may amount to a trespass or a nuisance. Even though only an “easement” of flight was taken, that easement, if permanent and not merely temporary, would normally be the equivalent of a fee simple interest. (4) The Act of May 2, 1929, P. L. 1278, which was reenacted in the Second Class County Code, specifically directs the appointment of viewers to ascertain, determine and assess damages in any condemnation proceeding when compensation cannot be agreed upon.
