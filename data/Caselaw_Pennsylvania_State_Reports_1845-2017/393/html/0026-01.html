    <p id="b65-7" data-blocks='[["BL_65.10",65,[141,1055,1148,209]]]'>Cities Service Oil Company appeals from the lower court’s refusal to decree specific performance of an option to purchase real estate, which option was included in other agreements entered into with the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b65-8" data-blocks='[["BL_65.11",65,[140,1275,1150,814]]]'>On May 16, 1951, Cities Service was the owner of certain premises located on the corner of West James Street and Harrisburg Avenue in the city of Lancaster. On that day Cities Service entered into a distributorship sales agreement with Haller for a term of one year, with renewal rights. Subsequently, and on October 9, 1952, the same parties entered into three separate agreements, which were to be coterminous and coextensive with the sales agreement, namely: (1) an agreement of sale, whereby Cities Service agreed to sell and convey the said lot to Haller upon certain terms and conditions; (2) a lease agreement of the premises in issue from Haller to Cities Service, containing the option to purchase the premises; and (3) a lease agreement of the premises from Cities Service to Haller.</p>

Pursuant to their agreements the parties continued their respective relationships until October 27, 1955, when by mutual consent<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the sales agreement of May 16, 1951, was “terminated” by Cities Service and Haller (effective October 31, 1955); and, by the same instrument, the existing leases were also “cancelled and terminated” by the parties.</p>

      <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>Thereafter, by letter dated December 29, 1955, Cities Service notified Haller of its intention to purchase the premises under the provisions of the option clause of Haller’s lease to Cities Service. Haller refused; hence this litigation.</p>
    <p id="b67-4" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[154,638,1148,757]]]'>In Pennsylvania, as in other jurisdictions, an option clause has been considered to be an offer for the stated terms and purposes set forth in the clause. So considered the option, as an offer, may be accepted during the term thereof, or rejected or terminated by failure to act within the requisite time. The pertinent provisions of this option clause are as follows: “Tenant [Cities Service] shall have the option upon expiration or earlier termination of the term hereby created and 60 days thereafter to purchase the demised premises and all buildings. . .” Under the circumstances here present, Cities Service by its own letter declared that the lease agreements were “. . . cancelled and terminated, . . .” effective October 31, 1955.</p>

The letter constituted an effective rejection of Haller’s offer, and Avas intended to conclude any and all rights that each may have obtained from their contractual relations. To declare otherAvise, as Cities Service contends, would have the effect of rewriting the agreements of the parties.</p>
