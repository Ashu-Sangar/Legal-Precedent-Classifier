The roll was available to the public from October 1, 1956 until November 1, 1956, but no appeal was filed during this period with the board. On January 24, 1957, the Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes notified the borough and school district by letters that the assessment for the property for the year <em>1957 </em>had been fixed at $750,000. Thereafter, on February 11, 1957, the borough and school district filed appeals with the board which were dismissed because they were not timely filed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The borough and school district then filed further appeals with the court below which the court dismissed affirming the board’s determination that the appeals first taken to it had been filed too late.

The pertinent text of the amendment follows: “When the board . . . shall fix the valuation of property which has not theretofore been separately fixed, whether such . . . new valuation is made before or after an appeal has been heard by the board or by the court of common pleas, the board shall give notice of such . . . new valuation <em>... to the secretary of the school district in which the assessed property is located, and to the secretary of the borough ... in which the assessed property is located.

    <p id="b593-6" data-blocks='[["BL_593.6",593,[154,1581,1150,751]]]'>The borough and the school district contend that since the appeal from the <em>1956 </em>assessment on the property was still being litigated in the courts, this assessment was as yet undetermined and not “separately fixed.” Hence, they reason that when the 1957 valuation of |750,000 was made, it was an assessment on property which had theretofore not been separately assessed, and consequently they had thirty days after written notice of the 1957 assessment to appeal therefrom to the court of common pleas. Since their appeals were taken within the prescribed thirty days, they conclude that they were timely filed in the court below, if not with the board, and therefore should not have been dismissed.</p>
