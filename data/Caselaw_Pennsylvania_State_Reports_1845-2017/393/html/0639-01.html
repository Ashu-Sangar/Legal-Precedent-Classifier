Sections 409 and 411 refer exclusively and solely to highway-rail crossings <em>; </em>the authority which §411 vests in the Commission to allocate “the expense of <em>such </em>construction, relocation, alteration, protection or abolition of any crossing” is limited and restricted to those expenses which have been incurred by the railroad, railway or the owners of the highway, i.e., the State, state agency, or municipal corporation.

The only exception to this rule is that imposed by the Legislature in §411: that the Commonwealth may, in the discretion of the Commission, be required to pay the relocation costs of the facilities of a transportation public utility (as described in §409) and <em>only </em>then when such costs have been expended in the construction, relocation, alteration, protection or abolition of a highway-rail crossing accomplished under the procedure prescribed in §409. The Electric Company and the Commission would have this Court usurp the legislative powers and declare an additional exception which the Legislature has not seen fit to declare. In the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent in §411 to impose on the Commonwealth an obligation, in the Commission’s discretion, to pay the relocation costs of a non-transportation public utility in any highway-rail crossing construction, etc. and under §409, we must follow not only the well established, but thoroughly logical, rule of the common law as enunciated by this Court for many years.</p>
