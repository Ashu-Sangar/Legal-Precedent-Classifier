Bonham died testate leaving a will dated December 10, 1912, and probated in York County, in which she named the Guardian Trust Company as executor and trustee. The trust was for the benefit of three daughters, Elizabeth S. Bonham, Amy Bonham and Eleanor Bonham, to invest the principal and pay the income annually in equal parts to the beneficiaries named, with a gift over upon the decease of any of her daughters without children. In the event any of <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>the daughters died without issue, then her share should go to the surviving daughter and the issue of any deceased daughter, per stirpes, upon the same trust as theretofore set forth.</p>

Bonham as the only surviving daughter of the testatrix. She is now past 82 years of <em>age; </em>and it is admitted that she has never married and is incapable of bearing children.</p>
    <p id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.6",395,[161,942,1146,319]]]'>On her petition to do so, the orphans’ court terminated the trust, concluding that the entire corpus is now vested absolutely in the petitioner, Elizabeth S. Bonham, and directed the trustee to file its final account. The pertinent portions of the will of Kebekah L. Bonham appear on the margin hereof.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The answer rests upon a determination of the testator’s intention as evidenced by the words of her will; and we find that the case is controlled by <em>Hay don’s Estate, </em>infra.</p>

The gift <em>to </em>Mary read as follows: “I give to my daughter Mary Haydon the same amount, [as was given to Bertha] Fifty thousand dollars to be placed in trust. . ., the interest on which to be paid her semi-annually during' her life. If she dies without issue the said sum of Fifty thousand dollars will revert to her sister -Bertha H. Morris.” There was a like prevision with a gift over to Mary in case of the death of Bertha H. Morris. The residuary - clause gave the residue of his estate to his wife for-life, and provided that upon her death the executor should divide the residue between the two daughters or their direct heirs in blood relation.' Bertha died without issue and her fund in the trust was awarded to Mary by the orphans’ court in accordance- with the gift over to her. Mary died without issue. The trustee filed an account of the second trust and asked the court to distribute the balance.

We also declared that Mary received an interest in fee, subject' only to the condition that if she died without issue, her estate should pass to her sister. We there posed the question: “Does the gift’ over of Mary’s share take effect upon Mary’s death without issue where Bertha has already died without leaving issue?” We held that “ ‘. . . .mere technical rules of construction must give way to the plainly expressed intention of a testator, if that intention is lawful. . and that <em>“where an absolute estate is </em>de-• <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>
