Yowell and the injury óf his. wife, Viola, who were in one of the vehicles. Ronald Koch was driving the other automobile which was owned by Edward Dreistadt. Mrs. Yowell and Clarence Waters, the administrator of the estate of her husband, brought actions for personal injuries and wrongful death against Koch, the driver, and Dreistadt, the owner. Dreistadt filed an answer denying that Koch had permission to drive his automobile and was discontinued as a party defendant. The actions resulted in verdicts for the plaintiffs against Koch alone on which judgments were entered. In order to satisfy the judgments plaintiffs brought this present suit against the New Amsterdam Casualty Company on its. policy of <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>insurance issued to Dreistadt insuring “the named insured and also . . . any person while using the automobile . . . provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named insured or <em>with his </em>permission.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b288-4" data-blocks='[["BL_288.5",288,[254,627,1148,1550]]]'>At the trial in the court below the plaintiffs introduced evidence to show that Dreistadt was the owner of the automobile, Koch the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident, and that judgments against Koch were obtained in the earlier suit. The plaintiffs then rested. The defendant moved for a compulsory nonsuit contending that the plaintiffs failed to establish that “the actual use of the automobile was by the named insured or with his permission.” The motion was denied by the trial judge who determined that a presumption of permissive use of the automobile arose from proof of Dreistadt’s ownership of the vehicle. The defendant then introduced testimony to prove that Koch did not have permission to drive the automobile, but that he had only temporary custody of the vehicle in order to wax and polish it. At the close of the evidence the trial judge refused defendant’s request for binding instructions and charged the jury that the plaintiffs were entitled to a presumption that Koch was operating the automobile at the time of the accident with the permission of the owner until and unless the defendant overcame this presumption by a preponderance of the evidence. The issue of whether defendant’s evidence was sufficient to rebut this presumption was left with the jury. The jury returned verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs and, after defendant’s motions for judgment n.o.v. and a new trial were refused by the court <em>en lane, </em>these appeals were taken.</p>

Since the pre<a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>sumption is no more than a procedural technique designed for trial convenience to facilitate the production of proof by requiring the party with easier means of access thereto to come forward with evidence, its consequence may be stated as follows: If the defendant fails to introduce credible evidence negating agency, then the issue is decided in favor of the plaintiff as a matter of legal ruling. If the defendant does offer credible evidence to the contrary the presumption disappears as a rule of law and has no further effect upon the outcome of the case. See <em>Watkins v.

The defendant insurance company appealed, seeking judgment notwithstanding. the verdict. This Court has refused judgment n.Q.v., but it has surprisingly ordered a new trial. By doing so it has, in my .opinion,, not only inflicted an injustice, on the. plaintiffs, but it is requiring a wholly unnecessary and superfluous thing. It is ordering a trial which , has already been properly terminated, it is asking for the ascertainment of a verdict which has already been legally ascertained, it is compelling parties, witnesses, judge, lawyers and jurors to do what has already been correctly done — and all for no possible conceivable reason which can be justified in law, justice, or pragmatic perception.</p>

This conflict in positions, maintained energetically throughout the trial, created a factual controversy which was submitted to a jury.

The Majority says that “if the plaintiff fails to produce evidence that permission had been granted, the court should direct a verdict for the defendant.” What does the Majority mean that “the court <em>should </em>direct a verdict”? The word “should” presupposes no mandate or compulsion. Thus, the trial court, in such a situation, would still have a choice as to whether or not to direct a verdict. And if the trial court has a choice, is this not exactly the case where it <em>must </em>submit the issue to the jury? It is elementary law that there may be no directed verdict unless “it is inconceivable on any reasonable hypothesis that a mind <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>desiring solely to reach a just and proper conclusion .... . after viewing the evidence in the light most advantageous to the plaintiff, could determine” the issue in the plaintiff’s favor. <em>(Virgilio v. Walker, </em><a href="/citations/?q=254%20Pa.%20244" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="254 Pa. 244">254 Pa. 244</a>, 245.)</p>
    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[238,633,1147,825]]]'>I have filed many dissenting opinions but this is one of the most difficult I have had to write because I must reply to a Majority Opinion which ignores the record, is indifferent to established law, and advances strange theories which have no basis in reason, logic, or known jurisprudence. For instance, the Majority says that the trial judge charged the jury “that the so-called presumption that one acts rightfully rather than wrongfully shifted the burden of persuasion and. required the <em>defendant </em>to prove Koch’s lack of permission by the preponderance of the evidence.” (Emphasis in original.) But there is absolutely nothing in the record about the Judge charging anything on “burden of persuasion”. . Is it possible that the Majority is reading from a different record?</p>

So, in the present case plaintiff is given the burden of persuading the jury from all the evidence that Koch had the consent of Dreistadt to operate the automobile.” (Emphasis in original.) In using the phrase “burden of persuasion” the Majority speaks of a trial as if it were a social function with the. host or hostess seeking to persuade a guest to take another cup of tea, to join in a game of cards, or to participate in a rollicking quadrille. The function of contending parr ties is not. to persuade but to <em>convince.. ■ </em>Generally speaking, to persuade means to appeal to the emotions, to. the sensibilities, and to fancy, but to convince is to <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>appeal to the intellect and the integrities of logic, honesty, and justice.</p>
    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[155,467,1151,1324]]]'>The Majority says “The ‘presumption’ that one acts rightfully, like the ‘presumption’ of innocence in criminal cases, is actually a judicial determination that the litigant who alleges the illegality, wrongfulness or impropriety of the acts of another party has the burden of producing evidence and persuading the factfinder on the issue.” What does this mean? The Majority explains that: “The use of the term ‘presumption’ in such cases is misleading. What is meant is that there are certain issues as to which this Court has determined for various reasons of policy that the burden of persuasion shall be borne by a party other than the one who normally would be expected to have this obligation.” Here again we have the cryptic “burden of persuasion.” Are we now to abandon presumptions and burden of proof and take up persuasions? While this Court may, by a majority vote, do anything it pleases, I do not believe it can, even with its supreme authority, change by a decision the nomenclature of jurisprudence. Nor do I think that it can with impunity substitute for words and phrases, which bear the imprint of approval of the centuries, novel expressions which neither inherently or by connotation impart precise and definitive meaning.</p>
    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.6",303,[152,1804,1149,543]]]'>The Majority Opinion runs with citations, it is peppered with names and numbers of litigated causes, but I am constrained to say that not one of them supports the finally announced decision and, as a matter of research, it develops that most of them bear no relevancy whatsoever to the issue on appeal. It might be germane at this juncture to ask what is the issue on appeal. It certainly is not what the Majority discusses in its digit-studded opinion. The defendant insurance company asks for judgment n.o.v., not for a new trial.</p>

The Majority does not say. The Majority says that the plaintiffs must persuade the factfinder on the issue— but what is the issue? One searches in vain for a delineation of the issue in the Majority Opinion. The insurance company, however, well defines the issue in its brief when it says: “By various pleadings filed in the case the only real issue was joined in regard to whether the driver, Ronald Koch, was operating with the permission of the owner and assured, Edward Dreistadt.”</p>

      <em>That </em>was the issue and it was decided by the jury after the Trial Judge had instructed them in a charge that was abundantly clear in its meaning, strictly impartial in its presentation, and adequately comprehensive in its discussion of the law and the facts involved. In speaking of the presumption that every person has conformed to the law, the Trial Judge emphasized that this was a <em>rebuttable </em>presumption. He then explained: “This presumption operates for the benefit of the plaintiff, as I have already said, members of the jury, unless the same is overcome by the evidence offered by the defendant, which in this case contends that the- operation of the Ford in question, at the time of the accident by Ronald Koch, was not with the permission of the insured; that Edward F. Dreistadt never authorized or permitted Ronald Koch to drive the car away from in front of the home of Ronald Koch where it had been placed by Edward F. Dreistadt, the owner, under an agreement with Ronald Koch to wax and polish it; that Ronald Koch had agreed to wax and polish the car of Edward F. Dreistadt; and that' he did not have permission to use it for his pleasure or <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>his own use has also been testified to by Edward F. Dreistadt, the insured and owner of the car, and by Ronald Koch himself, the operator at the time of the accident and collision.”</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[167,576,1145,370]]]'>The Trial Judge made clear that the burden of proof devolving on the plaintiff never changed: “If you are not satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence under the law as given to you by the Court that the plaintiffs in this case are entitled to a verdict, you will return and use that verdict which has already been prepared on behalf of the defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.6",305,[165,967,1146,768]]]'>Perhaps I may seem unduly critical in this Dissent but I cannot let go unchallenged other statements in the Majority Opinion which can find no support in the law of Pennsylvania. For instance, the Majority says: “If the defendant fails to introduce credible evidence negating agency, then the issue is decided in favor of the plaintiff as a matter of legal ruling.” It is not enough to say that this statement is unwarranted. It cannot be described negatively. It must simply be labelled as <em>wrong. </em>If the defendant presents evidence which involves credibility, an issue arises which must be submitted to a jury. Credibility is always a question of fact, and never a question of law. And, therefore, never “a matter of legal ruling.”</p>
    <p id="b305-6" data-blocks='[["BL_305.7",305,[164,1748,1145,599]],["BL_306.1",306,[247,353,1144,367]]]'>The Majority climbs still higher on an unbuttressed ladder when it says: “If the defendant does offer credible evidence to the contrary the presumption disappears as a rule of law and has no further effect upon the outcome of the case.” Here, again, the Majority does not merely reason faultily. It makes a statement which is <em>wholly </em>incorrect, <em>without any saving virtue whatsoever. </em>A presumption does not disappear merely because the defendant offers credible evidence to the contrary. When the defendant offers evidence controverting the presumption, a question of fact arises for a <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>jury’s deliberation, namely: Does the evidence overcome the announced presumption? Evidence may be credible and yet not preponderate over the presumption. A question of fact still remains as to whether the presumption has carried the day with its burden of proof as against the evidence submitted by the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[242,742,1148,654]]]'>No worthwhile purpose will be served in any further discussion of the. matter. I hope I have made it abundantly clear that I wholly disagree with the Majority Opinion because it is incongruous in its findings, illogical in its exposition, and unauthortative in its conclusions. I hope further that I have left no doubt that it is my firm conviction that the Majority has unjustly deprived the plaintiffs of a verdict which they won fairly and squarely before a jury under proper instructions by the court; and to require the plaintiffs to undergo the travail of another trial is an arbitrary act of judicial usurpation.</p>
