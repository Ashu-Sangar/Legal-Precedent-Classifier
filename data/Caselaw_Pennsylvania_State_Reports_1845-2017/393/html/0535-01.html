    <p id="b574-4" data-blocks='[["BL_574.7",574,[239,404,1144,770]]]'>Kennedy was convicted by a jury, on April 30, 1954, of murder in-the first degree, with life imprisonment. Kennedy filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on June 7, 1956, which was dismissed by the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County. Kennedy filed a second petition for a writ of habeas corpus on March 18,1957, which was dismissed by the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County. The order of the lower court dismissing the petition was affirmed in a comprehensive opinion by this Court: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Kennedy v. Mingle, </em><a href="/pa/388/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="388 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1272544" data-case-paths="/pa/388/0054-01">388 Pa. 54</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.2d%20161" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="130 A.2d 161">130 A. 2d 161</a>. Kennedy filed a third petition for a writ of habeas corpus on May 10, 1957. That petition was dismissed by the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.</p>

The lower court appointed a qualified attorney to represent him. Answers were filed by Myers and by the District Attorney. The lower court, after hearing argument, dismissed the petition. From the order dismissing the petition, this appeal was taken.</p>

The letter, dated March.6, 1954, was written to the District Attorney by Dr. Petry, Superintendent of the Harrisburg State Hospital, regarding Kennedy. It was available to defense counsel, and when it was offered in evidence by the District Attorney, defense counsel stated he had no objection to its admission. The letter stated that Kennedy was a psychopathic case and that his family had a tendency toward mental disease. However, the letter also said tha.t Kennedy “was supposed to have been connected with a barn fire near his home” in 1950. The letter <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>was inadmissible, but as the District Attorney aptly says, it was probably helpful to Kennedy in inducing the jury to impose life imprisonment instead of death, especially since Kennedy contended that he was mentally ill.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>
