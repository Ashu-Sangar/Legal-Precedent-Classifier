While awaiting trial on these charges he escaped from the Bucks County prison and was recaptured on the day of escape. Subsequently, the appellant entered a guilty plea on the five bills of indictment which charged him with burglary, larceny, receiving stolen goods and prison breach. Prior to sentence appellant admitted the larceny of still another automobile in Washington, D. C. in August 1945, although the charge against him in that instance was “dropped”, presumably because of his service in the Navy. The late Judge Boyer sentenced the appellant on one of the burglary charges to a term of imprisonment of not less than 3 nor more than 10 years. Judge Boyer also sentenced appellant to a further and consecutive term of not less than 1 nor more than 2 years on the indictment charging prison breach. Sentence on the other bills of indictment was suspended. At the time of the trial, appellant was 22 years of age.</p>

An allocatur was allowed by this Court. The petition originally raised several issues, but on this appeal appellant presses only one, namely, the sentence imposed in 1946 was illegal and void because the sentencing Judge was informed of and considered the appellant’s Juvenile Court record in imposing sentence. Appel-» lant had been found delinquent when he was approxi<a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>mately 17 years of age as the result of a burglary then committed by him. Appellant contends that the use of said Juvenile Court record in the consideration of the aforesaid sentences was in violation of §19 of the Act of June 2, 1933, P. L. 1433, 11 PS §261. Section 19 of that Act provides as follows: “No order made by any Juvenile Court shall operate to impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by the criminal laws of the Commonwealth, nor shall any child be deemed to be a criminal by reason of any such order or be deemed to have been convicted of crime. The disposition of a child or any evidence given in a Juvenile Court shall not be admissible <em>as </em>evidence<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> against the child in any case or proceeding in any other Court.”</p>
    <p id="b265-3" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[159,1198,1150,937]]]'>Generally speaking, there are several cogent reasons why juvenile records and evidence given in juvenile proceedings should not be used as evidence against a child in any case or proceeding in any other court. Juvenile Court proceedings are normally informal, and many of the important constitutional and statutory guarantees afforded a defendant in a criminal trial do not apply to a juvenile in a hearing before a Juvenile Court: <em>Holmes’ Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/379/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="379 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1253624" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0599-01">379 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.2d%20523" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="109 A.2d 523">109 A. 2d 523</a>. For these reasons, it would be unjust and illegal to allow the introduction of juvenile records or evidence given in juvenile cases to be later introduced as competent evidence in criminal cases or proceedings in any other court, in the same manner as criminal convictions or evidence taken in criminal proceedings may in certain instances be competent evidence in other criminal proceedings.</p>

S. 241</a>, the court pointed out that, as distinguished from the situation where the question for consideration is the guilt of a defendant, it has always been the right of a court in sentencing to consider information concerning the defendant’s past life, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities, even though such information is obtained outside the courtroom from persons whom the defendant has not been permitted to confront or cross-examine. The court said: (p. 247) ‘Highly relevant — if not essential — to his selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant’s life and characteristics. And modern concepts individualizing punishment have made it all the more necessary that a sentencing judge not be denied an opportunity to obtain pertinent information by a requirement of rigid adherence to restrictive rules of evidence properly applicable to the trial.’ And further (p. 249) : ‘Under the practice of individualizing punishments, investigational techniques have been given an important role. Probation workers making reports of their investigations have not been trained to prosecute but to aid offenders. Their reports have been given a high value by conscientious judges who want to sentence persons on the best available information rather than on guesswork and inadequate information.’ ”</p>

A judge whose duty it is to determine the proper sentence imposed on those convicted of crime cannot be expected to limit himself to only that which appears in the record of the trial of the prisoner. It is to the benefit of society and it may be of benefit to the prisoner, to have the sentencing judge consider facts other than those adduced at the trial.

It was said that persons of tender years should not be tried with all the formalities and rigidities of a court procedure geared for older people. It was said that children who got into trouble innocently or otherwise should be brought for judgment before a judge who would not be bound by rules of evidence. It was said that a relaxation of these rules would enable the judge to obtain a better picture of the child’s background, environ<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>ment, weaknesses, temptations, and so on, and in that way the judge could better decide what would be best for the child’s welfare.

The proponents of the change replied that the object of a juvenile court proceeding would not be to find a child guilty or not guilty, as those terms are understood in criminal proceedings. The opponents of the change countered with: “Yes, but if you allow this type of unreliable evidence to be used and the court concludes that the child is delinquent, the Juvenile Court record may be introduced against him in the criminal courts if he should be charged with crime after he reaches adulthood.” The proponents laughed at this spoken fear. “Perish the thought!” they replied. “Since a juvenile court proceeding is not a trial, it follows naturally that any adverse finding against the child is not to be regarded as a conviction, and certainly it could never be used against him later on in any way, shape, manner, form, sise, guise or contour.”</p>

While doing this, he kindled his emotions, he stoked the fires of his indignation, he called upon the furies of vengeance — and from the heights of his Olympian wrath he hurled these thunderbolts : “This Court tried to help you many years ago by placing you on probation when you were charged with burglary as a boy. You committed a serious crime there . . . This Court was so anxious to help you and to make a man of you that instead of sending you away, as we might have done, we placed you on probation in charge of Miss Bright, the Probation Officer. We did not hear any more about you after that until this occurrence here. That should have taught you several things. It should have taught you in the first place, that it is foolish, it is stupid, it is just plain dumb, to commit crimes. There is nothing gained by it. You are no richer than you were because of these crimes. You haven’t won any respect from anybody. Everybody that knows you will now despise you. They will look down upon you. Everybody of any intelligence, everybody of any standing or decency now looks down upon you as just a stupid, common criminal. Now can you think of anything that could be said in your own favor? I can’t think of anything.”</p>

On April 13, 1956, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the proceedings of 1946 on two grounds: (1) that he was denied counsel at this hearing, and (2) that it was illegal to introduce against him the juvenile court records of 1942.</p>

We know, however, from the undisputable transcript, that the quarter sessions judge not only did not attempt to exclude the juvenile court record from his consideration, but he went out of his way to announce that he was giving it specific and emphatic attention. This is what he said: “This Court tried to help you many years ago by placing you on probation when you were charged with burglary <em>as a boy. </em>You committed a serious crime there.” It is as plain as language can express one’s thoughts that he was punishing Robert Hendrickson because he was <em>charged </em>with burglary when he was a boy.

At the hearing a detective testified orally to an alleged confession by a third person who, he said, charged Holmes with involvement in the crime. The detective did not produce the confession, he did not produce the person alleged to have confessed, and the minor defendant was not given an opportunity to face the stranger who had supposedly implicated him. If such testimony had been presented in a court of quarter sessions it would have been laughed out of court. When Holmes grows up, if he should appear in criminal court as a defendant, his juvenile court record will, under the present decision of this Court, be produced to prove he was once a church robber!

But the Majority overlooks that in Pennsylvania our General Assembly has specifically said that it does not regard a juvenile court record of sufficient probative value to be introduced against a minor in subsequent proceedings and it has accordingly prohibited the use of such a record in any subsequent proceeding in any other court. The statute does not differentiate between what is to be produced during a trial and what is to be presented after a trial. If the Legislature had intended to exclude the record only from trials it could easily have said so, namely, “The disposition of a child or any evidence given against him in juvenile court shall not be admitted against the child in any trial in any other court.” But it did not say that.
