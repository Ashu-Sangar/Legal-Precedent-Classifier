On October 3, 1956 the Department of Welfare issued a license to appellee, dated February 11, 1956, to operate a private convalescent home accommodating a maximum of thirty-seven patients. On April 4, 1957 the Department advised appellee that her license, which expired February 10, 1957, was not being renewed because she had failed to maintain certain standards and facilities required by the Department. Following conferences between departmental representatives and appellee’s counsel, the appellee was notified on July 10, 1957 that her license would not be renewed and she was directed to discontinue operation of the home. Appellee then instituted a mandamus action against the Department in the Dauphin County Court seeking the restoration of her license and that action is still pending. On August 29, 1957 the Department advised appellee’s counsel that no further proceedings would be taken against the appellee pending the decision in the mandamus action “unless it should apr pear from complaint or inspection hereafter made that the well-being of patients urgently requires it.”</p>

L. 68, 71 P.S. §775.1-775.4 (Supp.). As indicated by its title, the purpose of the act was to authorize the Commonwealth “to proceed by injunction <em>... to prohibit and restrain any unlicensed person . . . from engaging in an activity for which a license is required. . . .” </em>(Emphasis supplied) This legislation was not designed to empower the Commonwealth to restrain only <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>the operation of nursing homes that were nuisances, that were improperly operated, or that endangered the well-being of the inmates. The Commonwealth had those powers through the established licensing procedures. The act simply empowered the Commonwealth to restrain forthwith the operation of any nursing homes operated without a license. Although the legislature believed that immediate corrective action might be necessary in such cases, it also recognized that a defendant ought to be afforded an opportunity at the earliest possible moment to show that the Commonwealth’s action was based upon a mistake, and that he, in fact, was authorized to conduct a nursing home. Hence, while it provided in section 2 of the act that a court may issue a ■temporary restraining order, it provided that the court “shall determine any such action on its merits as soon as possible. . . .” But the “merits” the court is authorized to determine are not whether the operation of the nursing home is a nuisance, nor whether its continued operation would adversely affect the inmates, nor whether the patients in the home require the protection of the Commonwealth. The sole issue “on the merits” is: — does the operator, of the nursing home have a license? If the operator has such a license the restraining order should be dissolved. If the operator does not have such a license, an injunction should be granted. Any other interpretation of the term “merits” as used in the act would make a nullity of the statute and deprive the Commonwealth of its power to protect expeditiously the inmates of a nursing home by peremptorily restraining unlicensed operators.</p>
