Jeffries, testator, died on February 23, 1922, leaving a last will dated January 27, 1922. He left his residuary estate in trust for certain persons and purposes. Testator then provided in the Seventh item of- his will pertinently as follows: “Seventh : I confer power upon my Trustees during the activity of the trust: ... To retain any investments which I may have made, and to alter, vary, and change investments and reinvestments from time to time, without being <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>confined to wliat are known as legal securities;. but they shall have no power to purchase shares of stock.”</p>
