Konstanty, who had been living apart, did not learn of the transaction until 1948. When Carrie refused Konstanty’s demand to convey the property to both of them as tenants by the entireties, Konstanty filed a complaint in equity in 1949 to impose a resulting trust upon the property for the benefit of himself and Carrie Godzieba, tenants by the entireties, and to compel Carrie to make an appropriate conveyance of the property. Because this action was brought in the name of Konstanty alone, the chancellor held that the failure to join Carrie as a party plaintiff was a fatal defect and so dismissed the complaint. In his opinion the chancellor went further, and by way of dictum, commented that the merits were adverse to Konstanty’s contentions. We do not now pass upon the propriety of the chancellor’s <em>action; </em>no appeal therefrom was taken. Instead, in 1952, Konstanty instituted the present action in equity in the name of Konstanty Godzieba and Carrie Godzieba tenants by the entireties, asking that his wife, Carrie Godzieba, the defendant herein, be declared to hold the property for them both <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>as tenants by the entireties, that she be enjoined -from disposing of or encnmbrancing the premises, and that she be directed to execute and deliver a deed to herself and her husband as tenants by the entireties. The chancellor correctly concluded that the dismissal of Konstanty’s prior action was not an adjudication on the merits so as to be <em>res judicata </em>of the present proceedings. <em>Weigley v. </em>Coffman, <a href="/pa/144/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="144 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="823769" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0489-01">144 Pa. 489</a>, 498, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.%20919" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="22 A. 919">22 Atl. 919</a> (1891,).

Anthony’s oral promise to reconvey the premises did not remove the transaction from the category of resulting trusts and put it in the category of express trusts; the effect of his oral agreement was to negate any inference of a gift, and to confirm the inference that the persons who paid the purchase price were to have the beneficial interest in the real estate. 4 Scott, Trusts, supra, §441.2 at 3028.</p>

However, the evidence does not indicate that he was even aware of the necessity of joining in the institution of the action for the wrongful death of his daughter. In a discussion with their attorney before the complaint was filed, Konstanty stated' that Stella was born before his marriage to the defendant. Counsel apparently was misled by this statement into believing that Konstanty was not Stella’s father, and therefore brought the suit in the name of Carrie alone. Rather than constituting a repudiation of his parenthood of Stella, all that may be inferred from Konstanty’s remark is that he did not comprehend the effect of his subsequent marriage to the defendant upon his legal status as father of Stella.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
