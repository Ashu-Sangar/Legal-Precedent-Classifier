She and her parents brought an action in trespass against the Pittsburgh Railways Company and the operator of the involved automobile, Charles Baier. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs and against both defendants. The defendant railways company has <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>appealed seeking judgment n.o.v. or a new trial.

She took a seat in the middle of the car and then, when it got to Third Street, which was the regular car stop immediately prior to the Terminal Way stop, she advanced to the front of the car and handed the motorman her transfer ticket. She turned and faced the doors, awaiting the car’s arrival at her destination. There was nothing to visually apprise her of the Terminal Way stop since Carson Street at this stretch of the thoroughfare on its southern side (which she was facing) is shadowed by a massive 20-foot-high retaining stone wall which offers no marking or architectural feature to designate the Terminal Way stop. The car ground to a halt, the motorman threw open the doors, the girl descended to the street and took two or three steps on the pavement when she was violently struck in the rear by an automobile which had been following the street car for some distance but which, as the car passed Terminal Way, moved abreast and alongside the car. The plaintiffs presented evidence to show that the street car ignored the Terminal Way stop and proceeded to a point 90 feet beyond it, where the motorman discharged <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>Miss Coyne at the moment that the automobile, having swung around the rear of the car, was now seeking to pass it, the driver believing that the car, since it had passed Terminal Way, would now unabatedly continue on its way up Carson Street. With this showing of evidence, the plaintiffs contended that the motorman was guilty of a specific act of negligence in that, after having failed to halt his car at a regular car stop, he discharged, his passenger at a manifestly dangerous spot.</p>

Of course, these diametrically opposing stories as to whether the car did or did not stop at Terminal Way passed through the crucible of the jury’s deliberations and fused in the verdict which now proclaims on the imperishable tablets of a factual finding that the street ear disregarded the Terminal Way stop. Thus, we have no question on this appeal <em>where </em>the car stopped. We are concerned only with, whether, in taking Miss Coyne 90 feet beyond the regular stopping place, the motorman precipitated his passenger into a dangerous situation which he, with cautionary foresight, could have avoided.</p>

However, at night, with the southern side of the street free of- parked automobiles, the mobile automobiles travelled by the side of the street cars in overtaking and passing them. All this was known to the motorman who had been operating a car on this particular route for six months and had been employed by the company for an overall period'of five years.

Proximate cause is peculiarly a jury question.

History is rer píete with momentous events .which, with but slight alteration in chronology, dramatic cast, or order of appearance of the characters, could well have drastically changed the story of mankind. What would have happened if Caesar had not crossed the Rubicon, what would have been the course of history if Blucher had not arrived on time at Waterloo, or if Hamilton had not accepted Burr’s challenge to a duel? What would have happened if Baier’s automobile had not come along at the fateful moment which it did? Obviously, Miss Coyne would not have been injured. But the fact remains that she was injured, and any wishful turning back of time cannot alter that reality. If the street car motorman had stopped at Terminal Way or had not opened the doors at the 90-foot mark until after Baier’s car had passed, the accident would not have happened either. The street car and the automobile operated independently of one another but unconsciously concatenated to bring about the collision. In reconstructing the unfortunate mishap it is the exercise of common sense and practical reasoning, — and not elaborate and labyrinthian disputation — which determines whether or not the negligent act of the motorman was the proximate cause of the accident. It was thus strictly a question for the jury and that issue was submitted to the jury in an able and comprehensive charge, free of error.</p>
