She left her residuary estate in trust for certain persons and purposes. Item Tenth of the Will provides: “Tenth: My Executor and Trustee shall have power to retain as part of my estate any investments I may have made, whether legal or not, it being my desire that the same shall not be needlessly sacrificed; and I <em>direct </em>that my Executor and Trustee <em>shall </em>have power to invest and reinvest in Government Bonds <em>only</em>

This account showed an investment on March 27, 1957 in ten shares of the 5% cumulative preferred stock of General Motors Corporation and a sale of said stock on the same day, with a resultant loss of $26.63. The guardian and trustee ad litem demanded that the trustee be surcharged for this loss because the investment was unauthorized by the Will. The Auditing Judge imposed a surcharge. <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>The exceptions filed by the trustee were sustained by three judges, with two judges dissenting, and the Court instructed the guardian and trustee ad litem to appeal from this decision to this Court.
