Warren Kelsey made a Deed of Trust on July 16, 1914 in which he assigned certain enumerated bonds, having an approximate value of $300,000, and $100,000 in cash to the Germantown Trust Company, Trustee, in trust for certain persons and purposes therein set forth.</p>

The account showed an investment on October 25, 1955 in 20 shares of the common stock of Philadelphia Electric Company and the sale of those shares later on the same day, with a resultant loss of $34.58. The guardian ad litem and trustee ad litem demanded that the trustee be surcharged for this loss because the investment was unauthorized by the Deed of Trust. The Orphans’ Court held by a majority of 3 to 2 that the restriction in the Deed of Trust was not an “express restriction” against investments which were authorized by statute. From the final decree the guardian and trustee ad litem took this appeal.</p>
