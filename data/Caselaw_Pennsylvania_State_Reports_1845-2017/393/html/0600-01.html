The pleading expressly moved for judgment for the plaintiffs on the ground that the matters alleged by the defendant’s answer were insufficient in law as a defense to the action, and concluded with a prayer that judgment be entered for the plaintiffs. What the pleading actually amounted to in substance and effect was a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 1034 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, and is to be so regarded.

By 1953, he had four separate policies with face amounts totalling $28,000 and one additional policy for $3,500. On or about October 9, 1953, he accepted a single policy from the company in the face amount of $25,000 and allowed the four policies for $28,000 to lapse, the policy for $3,500 lapsing January 27, 1954. The $25,000 policy was permitted to lapse around March 15, 1955, upon the insured’s acceptance <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>of the policy, now in suit, which he carried until the time of his death. By the terms of this policy, upon proof of death of the insured, no immediate payment was to be made to the beneficiaries but income benefits in the amount of $500 a month would be paid to an expiry date specified in the policy, such monthly payments terminating with the last monthly income payment prior to the date of expiry when a final payment in a lump sum of the proceeds of the policy would be made.</p>

This application is the one whereof a copy is attached to the policy in suit and contains the alleged misrepresentations of the applicant that are the basis of the insurance company’s defense. After Syme had signed the application, the insurance company’s general agent penned an addendum on the face of it, requesting the insurance company to write, in addition to the policy for which Syme had thus made application, a second policy for a like face amount but with family benefits of $500 per month to the specified expiry date. This addition to the application, as written by the agent, was placed upon the part of the application entitled “Additional Requests” and read as follows: “Date <em>doth </em>policies January 27th, 1955. One alternative policy — $25,000. Champion with waiver &amp; D. I. with 10 year Family Income period-20-month per 1000. Only <em>1 </em>policy will be delivered and one will be returned for cancellation.” When the agent later came to deliver one or the other of the policies, Syme accepted the one carrying the <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>larger amount of monthly family benefits. Thus it was that the policy in suit happens to have attached to it a copy of the agent-altered application made for the other policy which Syme did not accept and which was to be returned to the company for cancellation.</p>

The inviolability of this requirement was accentuated by us in <em>Sandberg v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>supra, at p. 328, where we said that “There can be no doubt but that when the Act of 1921 requires that a copy of the application be attached to the policy if it is to be considered a part of the contract, the Legislature meant that the whole application, <em>as' signed by the applicant, </em>must be attached” (Emphasis supplied). True enough, the insured’s signature does appear at the end of the application, but it was placed there before the agent made the alteration which was never authenticated by the applicant’s signature. Judged in the light most favorable to the defendant company, the alteration is nothing more than an unsigned declaration and, as such, violates the mandatory requirements of the statute. The effect of a violation of the terms of the Act was forcibly stated in <em>Sandberg v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>supra, at p. 329, as follows: “Since [the amendment] was not attached to the policy, as required by the Act of 1921, which is mandatory in its requirement, no other part of the application may be considered as part of the contract.”</p>

There is no provision in the Act authorizing the validation of statements in an application written by a person purporting to act for the applicant. The statutory requirement is that the application must be signed by the applicant; ratification by him is not sufficient.

We there declared that “. . . unless a correct copy of [the application] was attached to the policy, it could not under the Act of May 11, 1881, P.L. 20, be considered a part of the policy or contract between the parties.

The Court, in excluding the entire application, stated: “ ‘The omission of a part, which of course includes a supplementary part, operates to exclude the whole’ . . . . If the company has suffered an unnecessary loss it has resulted solely from its own negligence.” What was there said is equally pertinent here.

In that case, the insured made application for a $5,000 policy. Without the applicant’s expressed authorization, the insurance agent directed the insurer to issue an additional policy for $10,000. At no time did the insured apply for the latter policy. In the end, he accepted both policies. The Court, in holding that the application for the $5,000 policy was not a part of the contract for the $10,000 insurance coverage, said that “On [the insurance company’s] own showing, therefore, it is clear that [the insured] made no written application for the $10,000 policy, nor authorized [the insurance company] to attach thereto a copy of the application for the earlier policy. The taking of a written application, containing the insured’s version of his physical history and. condition, was solely for [the insurance company’s] benefit, and if it desired to use such application for purposes not authorized in the writing itself, [the insured’s] consent was essential. Since [the insurance company] failed to show that such consent had been given, it follows that the application formed no part of the policy on which suit was brought.”</p>

Consequently, for this additional reason, the application is not admissible in evidence as a part of the contract.</p>
    <p id="b650-4" data-blocks='[["BL_650.5",650,[250,683,1149,1088]]]'>Counsel for the defendant has placed great reliance on the case of <em>Reeder v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/340/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="340 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="1203334" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0503-01">340 Pa. 503</a>, 507, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20879" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="17 A.2d 879">17 A. 2d 879</a>, which permitted the defendant insurance company to use, in its defense, certain misrepresentations contained in an application for a larger policy than that which was finally accepted by the insured. The court, in discussing the plaintiff’s contention that the application should be disregarded, stated: “It need only be said in this connection that throughout her pleadings, plaintiff pleaded the policy and the application here in question as the entire contract upon which she based her action, and at no time until now did she claim that the application here involved was not the one upon which the policy issued . . . .” If anything more need be said about that case, it will suffice to add that the attached application contained no altex’ations and no unsigned declarations. The copy was an exact duplicate of what had been signed by the insured. The <em>Reeder </em>case obviously is not presently germane.</p>
    <p id="b650-5" data-blocks='[["BL_650.6",650,[252,1784,1147,594]]]'>Here, the insurance company seeks to rely upon an application containing an alteration unsigned by the applicant and requesting a policy entirely different from the one accepted by the insured. The strict requirements for establishing insurance contracts, as ordaixxed by The Insurance Company Law of 1921 does not permit the inaccurate copy of the application to be introduced as a part of the insurance coxitract. The insurance company’s defense, based on alleged misrepresentations in the copy of the application attached to the policy in suit, is not available to the defendant.</p>
