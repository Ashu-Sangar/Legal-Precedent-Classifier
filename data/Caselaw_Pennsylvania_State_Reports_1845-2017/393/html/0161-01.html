Mrs. Mary Louise Bosley, the wife-plaintiff, sought to recover damages for a heart disability which resulted from her fright and shock upon being chased by a Hereford bull owned by defendant. The bull did not strike or touch plaintiff, and plaintiff suffered no physical injury. The Superior Court sustained the entry of a nonsuit. Considering the record in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the facts may be thus summarized.</p>

Plaintiffs’ daughter and grandson were driving the cattle off plaintiffs’ property. Plaintiff, Mrs. Bosley came out to help them. Plaintiffs’ daughter testified as follows: “As I was driving the cattle, . . . mother was started up towards where I was at to help me and I told her . . . That she didn’t need to help me, that they were going all right, so she turned to go up to where my son was and when she turned a bull charged mother out of the herd as she turned and I hollered to her and I told mother then, I says, ‘Mom, look out, there’s a bull after you.’ As she turned her head to look, the bull was charging her and <em>she started to run and as she started to run, she collapsed."</em>

Her daughter called a doctor. Mrs. Bosley’s two doctors, Dr. Gilbert A. Diehl and Dr. A. C. Ernstene, a heart specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, agreed that prior to this episode with the bull, Mrs. Bosley had had arteriosclerosis and cardiac insufficiency,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">*</a> which resulted from arteriosclerosis ; and that <em>“the episode with the hull did not cause the coronary arteriosclerosis </em>but it does constitute the. trigger mechanism that brought the symptoms into clinical prominance.” Arteriosclerosis is a hardening of the arteries which comes with age and is usually a long gradual process.</p>

They were certain that in the fields across the highway which bordered their owner’s domain, the grass was greener, the earth fresher, the trees shadier, and the skies above bluer. Thus from time to time they would leave their own preserves and invade the Bosley farm on the other side of the road where, with the spirit of bovine buccaneers, they devoured their neighbor’s corn- and wheat, destroyed his vegetable gardens, knocked over young peach trees, damaged the apple orchard, mangled berry bushes, and eventually departed, leaving behind them a wide swath of ruin and destruction.

By noon, however, they forgot their defeat of the morning and decided to visit the Bosleys for lunch. This time they came, eight of them, with reinforcements.

Mr. Hereford and Mrs. Bosley saw each other at the same time. Mrs. Bosley screamed, and the truculent Hereford lowered his head to charge. Terror-stricken, Mrs. Bosley tried to run, but, as in a bad dream one cannot flee although disaster is at one’s heels, she froze to the spot. As she later described the agonizing moment: “I turned around and looked, and he was coming at me with his head down, and I started to run, but I thought I could not get my legs to go and I choked up and I collapsed, and momentarily, I thought he was going to get me, I could just even feel that he was on top of me.”</p>

Specifically, he asked if an automobile accident, or sudden death in the family, might not have been capable of precipitating a heart attack such as Mrs. Bosley experienced.

Adams Express Co., </em><a href="/pa/269/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="269 Pa. 280" data-case-ids="1063483" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0280-01">269 Pa. 280</a>, there was the situation of a woman who was ascending the stairs in her home when a truck collided with the outside of the dwelling, causing her to fall and sustain an injury to her back. The truck in no way touched her. The defendant in that case argued the usual Pennsylvania rule that there could be no recovery because there was no physical impact between the tortfeasor’s instrumentality and the victim of the tort. Justice Walling, however, speaking for a unanimous Court, said: “Here there were no visible external marks upon the person of Mrs. Howarth, but her own testimony, and that of her physicians, indicate an actual physical injury to her back, sufficient to take the case to the jury . . . While a recovery should not be sustained in such case upon dubi<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>ous evidence, <em>it cannot be affirmed as matter of law that the physical injury must be externally visible.”</em>

There, the plaintiff was thrown to the floor of a street car which had left the tracks. She sought damages for a succeeding neuritis. The railway company argued that she had sustained “no physical injury whatever,” and that “at most the evidence discloses nothing moro than a case of nervous shock or fright from the unusual occurrence unaccompanied with physical injury.” Therefore, the case should not have been submitted to the jury. This Court held to the contrary. Justice Stewart, speaking again for a unanimous Court, said: “The testimony of the plaintiff herself as to the immediate occurrence and conditions which immediately followed with respect to her sufferings, which have continued remediless to this time, supported as it was by the testimony of her attending physician, who gave it as his judgment that her disability resulted from the injuries she received in the accident, established a prima facie case. On this state of the evidence it would have been clear error to have withheld the case from the jury.” In logic and sheer rationalization, what is the difference between being thrown to the floor because of a rampaging street car and being thrown to the ground because of a rampaging bull when, in neither case was there any contact between the tortfeasor’s instrumentality and the victim?</p>

This all produces in the law a heterogeneous pattern which did not escape Judge Ervin of the Superior Court, who, in his powerful dissenting opinion when that tribunal passed on this controversy, said: “There can be no doubt that the plaintiff could have recovered if the bull had caught up with her and had butted her, even gently, and there can be no doubt that she would have recovered, not merely for the bruises resulting from being gently butted, but also for any heart condition which resulted from her emotional excitement. Likewise, there can be no doubt that if, in running away from the bull, she had fallen and had damaged her eye by running a weed into it, she could have recovered for that damage. To say that when she runs from the same trespassing bull and falls and suffers a heart attack, she cannot recover for the heart injury is making a distinction which cannot be justified.” To carry Judge Ervin’s splendid argument a little further, suppose that Mrs. Bosley had already had an injured foot or even a rheumatic leg prior to April 10, 1950, but the strain of running away from the bull aggravated that condition. Would this Court, under its previous rulings, not have to hold, in such a situation, that she would be entitled to recover for what she suffered because of the aggravation of a previous condition?

    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[254,1385,1145,486]]]'>Judge Ebvin states in his dissenting opinion in the Superior Court, and I agree with him, that this section is peculiarly applicable to the facts in the case at bar, and that the reasoning in Section 436(2) is sound: “The reasoning is supported by nearly all of the textbook authorities in the country and certainly by a great majority of the state courts. In view of this modern trend it seems entirely fitting that Pennsylvania should reconsider its position.”</p>
    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[251,1894,1147,322]]]'>It is interesting to note also, as Judge Ervin says, that the New York case which was relied upon by this Court in <em>Huston v. Freemansburg, </em>supra, was overruled in the case of <em>Comstock v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/ny/257/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="257 N.Y. 231" data-case-ids="1998392" data-case-paths="/ny/257/0231-01">257 N. Y. 231</a>, by a Court composed of such brilliant juriats as Cardozo, Pound, Crane, Kellog, O’Brien, Hubbs and Lehman.</p>
    <p id="b230-6" data-blocks='[["BL_230.7",230,[253,2237,1145,99]],["BL_231.1",231,[137,350,1146,607]]]'>In conclusion I would say that the Majority Opinion has concentrated its argument principally on the prop<a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>osition that it would be unwise to allow recoveries for mental and nervous disorders following fear, fright, and shock. However, the plaintiff is not claiming damages because of any mental or nervóus ailment. At the risk of tiresome repetition I must repeat that she is asking for a verdict as the result of <em>physical damage </em>done to her heart. The fact that the heart is locked in one’s breast does not make it inaccessible to doctors nor unfelt by its owner. Thus, in considering the nature and the extent of the plaintiff’s disability we are dealing with something very tangible and very concrete.</p>
    <p id="b231-4" data-blocks='[["BL_231.5",231,[136,969,1147,701]]]'>The heart may be injured by a blow as easily as the lungs, liver, or any other internal organ. And that blow may be administered through the application of force against the outer walls or through the channels of the senses. It is a matter of common knowledge that persons afflicted with certain ailments must avoid excitement, not only the excitement of physical movement but that which is felt through the senses of sight, hearing, and possibly smell. The interlinking between sensory excitation and physiological reaction is such a historical, demonstrable, and everyday reality that to dwell on it at length would be like carrying the proverbial coals to Newcastle or crocodiles to the Nile.</p>
    <p id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[135,1692,1147,656]],["BL_232.1",232,[259,356,1143,98]]]'>Although afflicted with arteriosclerosis, Mrs. Bosley could have relished life in all its beneficial fullness. By observing whatever limitations doctors might have placed on her activities, there is no reason why she could not have looked forward to a reasonably long existence, enjoying with full flavor the many sweetnesses that normal living affords. The books are filled with cases of people who, because of an arterial burden, may not run as fast as athletes run for a train, bus, or street car, but who adjust themselves admirably to a less rapid pace and find more , time to breathe in-the fragrance of the garden of good, wholesome living. Mrs. <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>Bosley had every reason to look forward to that prospect.</p>
    <p id="b232-4" data-blocks='[["BL_232.5",232,[254,468,1147,489]]]'>A trespasser came to her home and struck her down. The bull belonging to the defendant was as much a trespasser and invader as a robber breaking through a window at night. As soon as the bull crossed the frontiers of the Bosley farm, its owner, Dale Andrews, was guilty of a trespass. Whatever damage succeeded that invasion, and because of that invasion, was Dale Andrews’ responsibility. Under the law of <em>quare clausum fregit, </em>Andrew’s liability was almost automatic.</p>
    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.6",232,[251,970,1146,709]]]'>Since the doctors have stated categorically that Mrs. Bosley’s heart disability is the direct result of the bull’s aggression, and since it is conceded that the bull’s presence on the Bosley property constitutes an almost wanton trespass, it is inexplicable how this Court can legally dispose of a controversy which is peculiarly one for a jury’s determination. The explanation offered in the Majority Opinion does not explain. To say that to grant what the law allows in this case might create an untoward situation in other cases is like saying that the fountain of justice should be boarded up because of the possibility that someone might drown in its salutary waters.</p>
    <p id="b232-6" data-blocks='[["BL_232.7",232,[247,1693,1147,487]]]'>I would have the fountain flowing at all times, assured that the established safeguards of the law will keep away those who would defile its pure and refreshing essence just as those same safeguards are prepared, if not shackled, to hold responsible those who allow ferocious animals to roam at large to the hurt and grievous loss of the innocent and the unsuspecting, in the tranquil enjoyment of their homes, their gardens, and the prospect of a safe and cloudless future.</p>

In the <em>Chittick </em>case the plaintiff, who was sitting at a window 200 to 300 feet away from an electric explosion, was thrown to the floor, sustaining bruises to her person. She also was blinded temporarily, suffered pain in her eyes, followed by some impairment of vision and nervous weakness. The jury, returned a verdict in her favor but this Court overruled, ignoring the fact that the plaintiff had actually received physical injuries apart from, nervous shock and weakness. . , .,</p>
