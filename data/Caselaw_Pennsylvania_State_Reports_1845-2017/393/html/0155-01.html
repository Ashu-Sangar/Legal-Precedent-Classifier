He left the Peltz Bar with the intention of going home and crossed from the north side to the south side of West Ludlow Street in front of the Peltz Bar and started through an empty lot located on the south side of West Ludlow Street. He then turned around and walked to the south side of West Ludlow Street, and took up a position four or five feet to the east or in front of the Nahn car which was parked in front of the Nahn home. The Nahn car was parked directly across the street from their home, being two and one-half to three feet off the concrete portion of West Ludlow Street. The plaintiff was standing in front of the Nahn car, and on the south side of it or the side next to the vacant lot. The plaintiff looked to the east and west and saw no cars coming. He then walked north in front of the parked car and looked to his right or east and again saw nothing coming. The plaintiff then turned to look to his left or west and was struck. At one point in his testimony, the plaintiff testified that he was on the dirt shoulder when he was struck, but, when confronted with prior inconsistent statement, he admitted that, at the instant of collision, he had one foot on the concrete portion of West Ludlow Street. The defendant’s car was coming from the plaintiff’s left, or from west to east. Mrs. Nahn testified that it was threatening rain but not raining, and Officer McArdle stated that it had been raining off and on for about an hour before the accident, and that, at the time the accident was reported <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>to him, there was a slight drizzle coming down. Mrs. Nahn testified that she did not know the exact point where the defendant’s car struck the plaintiff as she only noticed the plaintiff when he was some place in midair. She also testified that when she saw the plaintiff in the air, the defendant’s car was on its own side of the road and directly opposite the Nahn car.”</blockquote>

An examination of the testimony indicates that appellant simply proved that he was struck by appellee’s motor vehicle while stepping onto the cartway from the berm of the road, that he was thrown into the air and that appellee’s motor vehicle came to stop approximately 45 feet from the place of impact. The record lacks any evidence of excessive speed on appellee’s part, that appellant was on the cartway for a sufficient length of time to have been seen by appellee in the exercise of due care or that appellee was at such a distance from appellant when he first was apprised of appellant’s presence on the cartway so as to enable him to bring his motor vehicle under control. Appellant’s own witness, Mrs. Nahn, places appellee’s motor vehicle at the instant of impact “on its own side of the road” and the uncontradicted testimony indicates that appellant was struck immediately after emerging from behind a parked motor vehicle located on the right-hand side of the highway in the direction in which appellee was proceeding. It is clear that appellant stepped onto the cart-way from behind a parked car directly into the path <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>.of appellee’s motor vehicle. Under such circumstances appellant has completely failed to establish any act of negligence upon appellee’s part and, on this ground alone, the refusal of the court below to lift the nonsuit should be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[241,638,1152,1434]]]'>On the question of contributory negligence, appellant testified that as he approached the cartway and came to the parked automobile, he then, while on the berm, looked both to the east and to the west, and saw nothing approaching; appellant then crossed in front of the parked automobile and as he came to the edge of the cartway looked first to the west then to the east and while stepping on the cartway and looking in a westerly direction was struck by appellee’s motor vehicle. Appellant testified that he did not see appellee’s motor vehicle until instantly before the moment of impact. His failure to observe appellee’s motor vehicle not only is unexplained but inexplicable. Under the record it is vain for the appellant to say that he looked and failed to observe appellee’s motor vehicle because in fact, under his own testimony, had appellant looked he could not have failed to observe the presence of appellee’s motor vehicle proceeding in an easterly direction. The law is clear that when a plaintiff steps into the cartway and is struck — immediately— by a vehicle which he could have seen had he been looking, he is barred from recovery by his own negligence : <em>Rafferty v.
