There the testatrix gave to her daughter “all my personal effects including clothing and household goods”. There was no residuary clause. This Court held that the words “personal effects” as used in conjunction with “clothing and household goods” and with no residuary clause, were limited to personal effects and did not include cash or stock.</p>

      <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>Mr. Leaver did not merely leave Ms daughter “All . . . household furniture, and furnishings, books and all articles of private possession ... as contained in my home, <em>in my safety deposit </em>box, <em>or </em>elsewhere”, he went further and specified and defined what he meant by “articles of private possession” when he added thereto “(excluding only stocks, bonds and/or documentary evidence of investment)”. The will leaves no doubt that Leaver intended to give his daughter more than his son, although how much more is of course the debatable question. We believe that he intended Ms gift of “any real estate, stocks, bonds and/or documentary evidence of investment of which I may die possessed” “in equal shares” to his daughter and his son, to be a residuary clause, and to cover and include everything which he had not theretofore willed his daughter. Furthermore any other interpretation would result in an intestacy if cash was never disposed of by the will; there is not only a presumption against intestacy but it is clear from the testator’s will that he intended to dispose of all his property.</p>
    <p id="b98-4" data-blocks='[["BL_98.5",98,[230,1534,1148,825]],["BL_99.1",99,[157,345,1147,270]]]'>Construing the will as a whole, we believe the testator intended to give his daughter all his personal property whether contained in his home or in his safety deposit box or elsewhere excepting and excluding only stocks, bonds and documentary evidence of investment; and to give equally to his daughter and his son (and his son’s child and issue) his stocks, bonds and documentary evidence of investment, as well as his real estate. We are, therefore, of the opinion that Mrs. Mac-peak was entitled under her father’s will to the household furniture and furnishings, the jewelry, the United States Postage Stamps, the United States Coins, the Hamilton watch, and the cash of which he died possessed, namely, the cash on his person and the cash in his safe deposit box and the cash in the National Bank <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>of Boyertown and the cash in the Florida National Bank, but not to the sum of $9,237.26<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> representing the amount due the decedent from Boyertown Burial Casket Company under a peculiar building-sale-occupancy written agreement dated November 18, 1947.</p>
