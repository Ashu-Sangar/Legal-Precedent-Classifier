Thereupon one of Mrs. Dean’s sons negotiated a royalty contract with Denver Chemical Company which provided for new royalty rates for Dr. Hand’s remedies and <em>for new remedies and for revived or modernized formulas and for foreign sales. </em>Unlike S.K.F., the patent medicine business was Denver’s special field, and it enjoyed a reputation for skill in the marketing of patent medicines in foreign countries. In these fields S.K.F. had no interest — indeed it had never sold the Hand remedies outside the United States. Dr. Hand’s testamentary trustee and S.K.F. thereupon cancelled in the fall of 1956 the contract between Dr. Hand and S.K.F.; the trustee executed and delivered to S.K.F. a “cancellation and release”, and (virtually) contemporaneously therewith executed the new contract with Denver Chemical Company.

      <em>any source. </em>Disregarding all the other language, they point to the following language in Dr. Hand’s letter of November 10, 1920, in which <em>in referring to a reimbursement </em>by Cromwell to him he says: “. . . under my agreement to pay him fifty (50) per cent, of any excess of $18,000 received by me or my estate and paid under and pursuant to any subsequent contract, change or modification thereof.” We cannot agree with this interpretation. For a few hours work in successfully renegotiating the royalty rate in 1920 (which contract was modified 8 times thereafter), Cromwell and his estate have received under or pursuant to Dr. Hand’s contracts with S.K.F. excess royalties totaling approximately $257,000. We are convinced from the language as well as the spirit of the three 1920 agreements that the excess royalty payments promised therein were limited and were intended to be limited to those payable under the S.K.F. contracts with Dr. Hand and were not to extend to any royalty contract which Dr. Hand’s testamentary trustee might make with another and entirely different manufacturer.</p>
