        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThis is an appeal from the order of the Court of Common Pleas No. 7 of Philadelphia County denying defendants\u2019 petition to strike a judgment entered against them by confession.\nIn 1957, the defendants entered into an indemnity and surety agreement in which they agreed to serve as sureties for a principal debtor, Bassman, Inc., in the event that this corporation defaulted on its obligations to the plaintiff under a separate accounts receivable financing contract. Pursuant to authority granted them in the surety instrument, attorneys for the plaintiff in an amicable action subsequently confessed judgment against the defendants in the sum of $86,250 representing $75,000 principal, and $11,250 attorneys\u2019 collection fees. Thereafter, plaintiff issued attachment execution against one of the individual defendant sureties. The defendants filed a petition and rule to strike off the judgment which the trial judge denied without prejudice, however, to their rights to file a petition and rule to open the judgment in whole or in part.\nThe defendants contend that the trial judge erred in refusing their motion to strike the judgment because (1) the warrant of attorney expressly conditioned the confession of judgment upon the default of the corporate principal, whereas plaintiff averred default only on the part of the sureties and not by the principal; (2) the confession of judgment did not contain a specific statement of the nature of the alleged default; (3) the averment of default was not verified and (4) plaintiff did not aver that a demand for payment had been made and refused.\nWe turn first to defendants\u2019 contention that the failure to aver default of the principal debtor rendered the confession of judgment defective.\nThe surety agreement provided: \u201cPrincipal and Sureties, jointly and severally, agree that, in the event of any default or failure on the part of principal . . . [the creditor may confess judgment against them].\u201d (Emphasis supplied). The record discloses that at the time judgment was entered the only default alleged was against the \u201cdefendants,\u201d that is, the sureties. Defendants argue that since the principal debtor was not made a party defendant, it cannot be comprehended within the term \u201cdefendants\u201d and that therefore the failure to aver the default of the principal is fatal to the judgment.\nOn this issue we agree with the plaintiff that, since the default of the principal is a sine qua non to the liability of the sureties, unless there was a default by the principal first it could not be averred that the sureties had defaulted. Consequently, the averment of the default of the defendant sureties necessarily includes the default of the principal.\nThe second argument of the defendants is that the averment of default herein, i.e., \u201cthe defendants . . . have failed to make payments on account when due,\u201d is defective for indefiniteness.\nUnfortunately for their position we have recently held otherwise: \u201cIn the case ... of a judgment entered in an amicable action in pursuance of a warrant of attorney it is necessary only that the affidavit on which the confession of judgment is based should set forth defendant\u2019s default justifying the entry of the judgment and the amount alleged to be due as a result thereof; it is not an objection to the validity of the judgment that the facts supporting such averments can be ascertained only from evidence dehors the face of the obligation; if such facts are contested the defendant\u2019s remedy is by rule to open the judgment, not to strike it off.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Kros v. Bacall Textile Corp., 386 Pa. 360, 364-65, 126 A. 2d 421 (1956). If the defendants believe that the averment of default in the confession of judgment was unjustified or that the damages were overstated, they may properly raise these objections under the order of the court below in proceedings to open the judgment.\nAs the other contentions of the defendants were neither raised in their petition to strike nor presented to the court below, we need not consider them here.\nOrder affirmed.",
