        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nThis appeal challenges the validity of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County dismissing an election contest proceeding.\nAt a municipal election held on November 5, 1957 in Birmingham Township, Chester County, there were three candidates for school director, two to be elected: Frederick J. Wolter, a Democrat, and Eobert Earl Barnett and Phoebe S. Wylie, both Eepublicans. The official count of the County Board of Election and a recount conducted under supervision of the court both indicated that Eobert Earl Barnett and Phoebe S. Wylie had received the highest number of votes for the office of school director.\nOn behalf of Frederick J. Wolter a petition for an election contest under the Election Code was filed wherein it was alleged that the local election board had counted certain ballots which should have been declared void and, if such ballots had not been so counted, Wolter would have received the second highest number of votes and would have been elected in place of Phoebe S. Wylie. Upon presentation of this petition the court below issued a rule directing that Robert Earl Barnett and Phoebe S. Wylie answer the contest petition and, further, directed that a bond be filed by the petitioners. In accordance with this court order, a bond signed by five of the petitioners with a sufficient surety was filed. One \u201cDorothy Wolter\u201d signed the petition, the petition affidavit and the bond.\nThe answer to the contest petition denied an averment that the petitioners were \u201cregistered electors of Birmingham Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, who voted at the Municipal Election held in said Township on Tuesday, November 5, 1957\u201d; therefore, the petitioners called the Chief Registrar of the Registration Office to prove this averment.\nThe official records indicated that one \u201cDorothy A. Wolter\u201d was a registered elector of Birmingham Township and that she had voted at the municipal election therein. There was no record of the registration or of voting at said election by a person named \u201cDorothy Wolter\u201d. Petitioners then moved to amend the petition and affidavit to show that petitioner and affiant \u201cDorothy Wolter\u201d was one and the same person as \u201cDorothy A. Wolter\u201d and to be permitted to produce evidence in proof thereof. Over appellee\u2019s objection to both the motion to amend and the offer of evidence, testimony was taken which clearly identified \u201cDorothy Wolter\u201d as the \u201cDorothy A. Wolter\u201d who appeared both on the registration and voting lists, proved that there was no other person residing in Birmingham Township known by either of said names and that the signature on the permanent registration card and on the list of those who voted at the municipal election was that of \u201cDorothy Wolter\u201d, although she signed on both occasions \u201cDorothy A. Wolter\u201d.\nSubsequent to the hearing appellee filed a motion to dismiss the election contest on the ground that \u201cDorothy Wolter\u201d, a petition affiant and a principal on the bond, was not a \u201cregistered elector\u201d of Birmingham Township. The court below dismissed the election petition on the ground that neither the petition, nor the affidavit, nor the bond could be amended and that oral evidence in proof of the identity, of \u201cDorothy Wolter\u201d as \u201cDorothy A. Wolter\u201d was inadmissible. From that order this appeal was taken.\nThe rationale of the action of the court below was that Section 1756 of the Election Code, supra, limited amendments to \u201cadditional specifications of complaint\u201d and, since \u201cDorothy Wolter\u2019s\u201d status as a \u201cregistered elector\u201d involved a jurisdictional fact, an amendment could not be allowed, the statutory time having expired. Reliance was placed on Williams v. Johnson, 16 W.N.C. 223 and Blythe Township School Director\u2019s Contested Election, 10 D. & C. 810. In our opinion an amendment was unnecessary and both the Williams and Blythe cases are inapposite.\nThe petition, the affidavit thereto, and the bond all appeared to sufficiently and completely comply with the requirements of the Election Code. Any doubt concerning non-compliance with the Code arose only as the result of the introduction of the Chief Registrar\u2019s testimony admitted by the court below without objection.\nAn amendment either to the petition, the affidavit or the bond would have been necessary only if and when it appeared that either or all of them were defective'or failed to comply with the statutory requirements. The sole question before the court was whether there was a defect in the petition, the bond or the affidavit. The determination of that question rested upon the status of \u201cDorothy Wolter\u201d as a \u201cregistered elector\u201d of Birmingham Township. The oral evidence rejected by the court was simply to show that \u201cDorothy Wolter\u201d was a \u201cregistered elector\u201d and that, in that respect, the petition, affidavit and bond were not defective. The rejection of such evidence was erroneous.\nAn examination of the record, including the oral evidence which should have been , admitted, clearly and convincingly demonstrates that \u201cDorothy Wolter\u201d and \u201cDorothy A. Wolter\u201d were. one . and the same person. \u201cDorothy Wolter\u201d who signed the petition, the affidavit and the bond was \u201cDorothy A. Wolter\u201d who signed the permanent registration card and the voting list at the contested election. Nothing in the Election Code nor in the Permanent Registration Act proscribes the reception of the oral evidence herein presented nor requires the exactitude compelled by the result reached in the court below.\nAn election contest is a method to insure the honesty and validity of elections. While the statutory requirements must he followed, mere technicalities should never thwart the inherent and basic purpose of a proceeding to test the validity of an election.\nOrder reversed. Costs to abide the event.\nAct of June 3, 1937, P, h. 1333, Art. XVII, \u00a71756, et seq., 25 PS \u00a73456, et seq.\nSection 1757 of the Election Code, supra, 25 PS \u00a73457 requires that petitioners \u201cshall be registered electors who voted at the primary or election . . . contested\u201d and that the petition affidavit shall be signed by five of the petitioners. Section 1759 of the Election Code, supra, 25 PS \u00a73459 provides that the- bond shall be signed by \u201cat least five of the . . . petitioners . . . with two or more individual sureties or a corporate surety . . .\u201d\nAct of 1937, P. L. 487, 25 PS 951.\nUnder the ruling of the court below had \u201cDorothy A. Wolter\u201d used the name on the petition, affidavit or bond as \u201cMrs. Dorothy A. Wolter\u201d would she not be disqualified as a \u201cregistered elector\u201d?\nIn Bratton v. Seymour, 4 Watt\u2019s Reports 329, 330 it was said: \u201cAn initial letter interposed betwixt the Christian and surname is no part of either. Franklin v. Talmadge, 5 Johns 84. It is evidently no part of the surname, for it is supposed to be the exponent of an appellative received in baptism; and it is no part of the Christian name, for no person can have more than one Christian name.
