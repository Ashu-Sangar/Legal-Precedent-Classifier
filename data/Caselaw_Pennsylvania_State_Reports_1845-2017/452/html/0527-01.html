      <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>In 1936, Mrs. Bok negotiated with the solicitor for the Board of Commissioners of Cheltenham Township for the establishment of a public park in memory of Cyrus H. X. Curtis. On March 11, 1937, Mrs. Bok, by conveyances, transferred approximately forty-three acres to the township. The conveyances numbered eight, but were identical in every material aspect except the legal descriptions of the property conveyed. The conveyances were entitled “Deeds of Gift” and read in the relevant portions:</p>

      <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>On January 23, 1943, Mrs. Bok released the general testamentary power of appointment given her in the testator’s will. On January 4, 1970, Mrs. Bok died<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and appellees herein demanded that the township return the land in question to them. They alleged that Mrs. Bok was not the owner in fee simple, but merely held a life estate, so that at her death they became the owners of the land under the terms of Cyrus H. K. Curtis’s will.</p>
    <p id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[161,828,1150,595]]]'>The township refused this demand. Appellees then filed a petition in the Orphans’ Court Division of Montgomery County, requesting that court to determine ownership of the property in question. The township filed preliminary objections alleging that the lower court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter in question. This was overruled by the court below, and on appeal we affirmed. <em>Curtis Estate, </em><a href="/pa/445/0603-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="445 Pa. 603" data-case-ids="1940077" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0603-01">445 Pa. 603</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=284%20A.2d%20500" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="284 A.2d 500">284 A. 2d 500</a> (1971).

    </p>
    <p id="b624-7" data-blocks='[["BL_624.6",624,[192,1269,1156,697]],["BL_625.1",625,[153,336,1150,374]]]'>Appellant next argues that under the rule in <em>Shelley’s Case, </em>1 Coke Rep. 93b, 76 Eng. Reprint, 206 (1581), the language of the testator’s will, stating: “. . . to my daughter, Mary Louise Curtis Bok, for her lifetime . . . but failing [the exercise of the power of appointment] upon her death, I give the same in equal shares to such of my grandchildren as shall be living at the death of my said daughter . . . ,” gave a full fee simple to Mrs. Bok,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> thus making the conveyances to appellant a fee simple determinable. The rule in <em>Shelley’s Case </em>has been defined as follows: “When a person takes an estate of freehold, legally or equitably, under a deed, will, or other writing, and in the same instrument there <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>is a limitation by way of remainder, either with or without the inter-position of another estate, of an interest of the same legal or equitable quality, to his heirs or heirs of his body, as a class of persons to take in succession from generation to generation, the limitation to the heirs entitles the ancestor to the whole estate.” 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estates, §102.</p>
    <p id="b625-5" data-blocks='[["BL_625.4",625,[152,721,1153,1031]]]'>The classic example of a conveyance subject to the rule is A for life, remainder to the heirs of A. The crucial element for the operation of the rule in <em>Shelley’s Oase </em>is that the heirs in the remainder must take by inheritance from the person holding the previous freehold estate. In the instant case, the persons taking upon the failure to exercise the power of appointment were designated by the testator as “my grandchildren”, not as the life tenant’s “heirs”. In <em>Stout v. Good, </em><a href="/pa/245/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="245 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="326013" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0383-01">245 Pa. 383</a>, 386, <a href="/citations/?q=91%20A.%20613" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="91 A. 613">91 A. 613</a> (1914), when discussing the application of the rule in <em>Shelley’s Case </em>to facts similar to that of the instant case, we stated: “. . . before the life estate can be enlarged to a fee, it must clearly appear from the language employed that the remainder-men are to inherit from the original devisee, and not to take as devisees directly from the testator; particularly, when, as is so often the case, the application of the rule will have the effect of defeating the testator’s express declaration. . . .”</p>
    <p id="b625-6" data-blocks='[["BL_625.5",625,[155,1764,1149,144]]]'>It is clear from the language used by the testator that he intended the gift over to appellees to descend from him and not from the life tenant.</p>
    <p id="b625-7" data-blocks='[["BL_625.6",625,[155,1929,1151,427]],["BL_626.1",626,[201,336,1152,153]]]'>Having held that Mrs. Bok did not hold the real estate in question in fee simple and did not, therefore, convey a fee simple determinable by her quit claim deeds, we must now consider whether her actions constituted a sale under the power to sell given her by the will. Although Mrs. Bok, by the terms of the testator’s will, was given full power to sell and deliver good and sufficient deeds to a purchaser, she was required <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>to substitute tbe proceeds of tbe sale for tbe land. Tbe conveyance in question to tbe township did not, in fact, involve tbe transfer of any “proceeds” to Mrs. Bok.</p>
    <p id="b626-4" data-blocks='[["BL_626.4",626,[198,501,1157,1085]]]'>Tbe township asserts that, 'in exchange for tbe transfers, Mrs. Bok received tbe promise of tbe township to maintain tbe public park and that this promise should be considered “proceeds” from her sale of tbe real estate. However, in tbe absence of a further definition in tbe testator’s will of tbe term “proceeds”, we must conclude that be intended tbe word to mean money that would be realized from tbe sale. Cf. <em>Earle’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/331/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="331 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="1184370" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0023-01">331 Pa. 23</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.%20173" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="199 A. 173">199 A. 173</a> (1938). While tbe benefit that accrued to Mrs. Bok could be termed consideration, it clearly was not proceeds that could be substituted for tbe real estate. In addition, each of tbe deeds of conveyance was specifically designated “deed of gift” and in a letter written by Mrs. Bok, introduced into evidence without objection, addressed to tbe Chairman of tbe Township Board of Commissioners, Mrs. Bok stated that she proposed to transfer tbe property in question “as a gift”. Tbe deeds and this letter reinforce tbe conclusion that tbe conveyances in question were gifts, rather than sales, as alleged by tbe township.</p>
