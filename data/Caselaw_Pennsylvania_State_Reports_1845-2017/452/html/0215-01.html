Following denial of post-trial motions in the trial court, appellant prosecuted a direct appeal to the Superior Court where the judgment of sentence was affirmed in a unanimous <em>per euriam </em>order. We granted review to consider appellant’s contention that he had been illegally arrested.</p>

The trooper discovered that Krall possessed neither an operator’s license nor registration for the car, and that the car appeared (from external inspection) to contain burglary tools on the floor. Both Krall and Bwanger were immediately arrested for possession of burglary tools and were escorted to a nearby magistrate. The police obtained a search warrant and returned to the car, finding there many tools suitable for use in the commission of burglaries. While the two occupants of the vehicle were still present in the magistrate’s office, word came from Myerstown that the Post Office there had been entered during the night. A button discovered in that building matched those on a coat-worn by Swanger, one button of which happened to be missing. Neither Krall or Bwanger was immediately charged with burglary. They were charged instead with possession of burglary tools and, since neither was able to post bail, were detained in the Lebanon County Jail.</p>

Thereafter, on July 29, 1970, appellant filed in the lower court a motion entitled “Application To Dismiss Charges” in which it was alleged that the complaint and the arrest warrant failed to provide the issuing authority with information from which she could have made a neutral and independent determination of probable cause for the defendant’s arrest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> No hearing was <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>held, however, and this motion was ultimately denied by the court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thereafter, Krall was indicted for burglary, and on December 15, 1970 was convicted after a trial by jury. Post-trial motions were refused, including a motion in arrest of judgment on the ground that “defendant’s constitutional rights were violated by an unlawful arrest.” The appeal to the Superior Court followed.</p>

He contends that all proceedings which followed, including trial and conviction, were therefore rendered nugatory. No attack has been made on the search warrant nor on the evidence seized pursuant thereto. Nor has it been alleged that any evidence obtained by the police was the fruit of an unlawful arrest.
