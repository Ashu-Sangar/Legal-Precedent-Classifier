As crime prevention is the gravamen of these provisions, <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>rather than prosecution of a crime already committed, time is of the essence in processing the action.

Appellee was not charged with an offense triable by jury at common law. The offense was created by statute and the procedure thus prescribed. <em>Commonwealth v. Taub, </em>supra. We hold that <em>Commonwealth v. Taub </em>was properly decided in that the right to prosecution by indictment and trial by jury do not invalidate this crime-preventive process.</p>

A defendant is convicted absent due process only where the proceedings are so summary and informal that there is a lack of accusation in proper form, notice and opportunity to interpose a defense.

However, it would derogate from the fundamental rights guaranteed in that section (trial by jury, speedy trial, etc.) to suggest that the existence of these basic rights hinge upon the particular procedure that the legislature might design to initiate the action. When <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>this Court was called upon to interpret an analogous provision guaranteeing that all persons accused of “indictable” crimes would receive the protection afforded by a grand jury,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> we focused on the nature of the maximum punishment authorized for such crimes. <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Gamo, </em>we acknowledged that “the term ‘indictable offense’ refers to common law and statutory offenses, the punishments for which are ‘infamous’ such as death or imprisonment in a penitentiary as distinguished from imprisonment in a county jail.” (citations omitted) Therefore, all felonies and most misdemeanors are indictable and other misdemeanors proceed by information. It is significant, however, that <em>Gano </em>recognizes a third category known as summary offenses. <a href="/pa/389/0639-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="389 Pa. 639" data-case-ids="1274052" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0639-01">389 Pa. at 651</a>.
