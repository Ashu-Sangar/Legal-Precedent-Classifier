Shaffer, </em>this Court delineated the applicable criteria for determining whether an evidentiary inference satisfies the “more-likely-than-not” test. The inquiry necessitates that we look to the following: “the lapse of time between the crime and the discovery of the property; the type and kind of property; the amount and volume of the property; and the ease in which it may be assimilated into trade channels.” <a href="/pa/447/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="447 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="1942932" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0091-01">447 Pa. at 109</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20727" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="288 A.2d 727">288 A. 2d at 737</a>. In <em>Shaffer, </em>the appellant was apprehended twenty-four hours after the two burglaries which were attributed to him and was found possessed of twenty-five pieces of jewelry bearing the initials and names of other individuals. Under those factual circumstances we allowed that the inference of complicity in the burglary could “more likely than not” flow from the proved fact of possession of recently stolen, non-negotiable property.</p>
    <p id="b531-4" data-blocks='[["BL_531.7",531,[125,1874,1150,153]],["BL_532.1",532,[200,338,1155,921]]]'>In the present case the Commonwealth established that the burglary had been committed at the home of Antonio Sansone, that property valued at $263,000 was <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>taken and that the appellants were apprehended eleven months and six days after the burglary, possessed of some, but not all, of the stolen securities. These treasury bonds were negotiable by delivery alone, but the Commonwealth adduced testimony that bonds of this size are not easily negotiated. The Commonwealth relied heavily upon the clandestine nature of the appellants’ meetings with undercover state police agent Albert Pistone, the Commonwealth’s principal witness. Agent Pistone testified that he met the appellants covertly and negotiated a purchase price of $60,000, one-half the face value of these bonds. Agent Pistone also testified to the following utterance by McFarland in the presence of Talley: “What the hell, we’ll grab it [the $60,000 offer]. We’ve been all over the damn country spending money trying to get rid of them [the bonds].”</p>
    <p id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[198,1271,1155,972]]]'>The Commonwealth’s case does support the inference that the appellants knew the bonds were stolen property, and thus supports the verdicts of guilty on charges of receiving stolen goods, but there is not sufficient evidence to sustain the inference that appellants participated in the burglary and larceny merely because the stolen items were found in their possession over eleven months later. There is nothing in this record suggesting how the bonds came into the appellants’ possession. Since the possibilities of acquisition which do not involve complicity in the Sansone burglary aro numerous, we do not believe that the circumstances of appellants’ possession meet the “more-likely-than-not” test established by <em>Shaffer. </em>Because the evidentiary inference of burglary and larceny cannot arise from mere possession in this factual setting, the Commonwealth has not sustained its burden of proof on the burglary and larceny indictments.</p>
    <p id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[199,2256,1153,98]],["BL_533.1",533,[138,341,1150,979]]]'>Finally, the sentences imposed upon the convictions for receiving stolen goods are defective in part because <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>they include the provision that appellants malee “restitution of property feloniously received”. Since the three bonds found in appellants’ possession were returned to the Sansones, we can only assume that the restitution provision was intended by the court to attach to the burglary sentence so that the Sansones would be compensated for property stolen but not recovered. In any event, the restitution provision is inoperative. If it is considered a part of the sentence imposed upon the burglary conviction, it must fall away with the reversal of that conviction. If restitution is part of the sentence for receiving stolen goods, as the court below seems to have intended, the provision is meaningless because the securities found in the possession of the appellants have already been restored to the Sansones. We cannot countenance a sentence provision requiring compensa.tion for property which the Commonwealth has not proven was either stolen or received by the appellants.</p>
