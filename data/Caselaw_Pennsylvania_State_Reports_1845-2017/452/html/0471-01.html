On July 10, 1972, the Supreme Court ordered District Justice Getty removed from office pursuant to Article Y, Section 18(d) of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. Thereafter, in an order dated October 27, 1972, the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County abolished the neighboring Magisterial District 32-2-9 (the Borough of Media) and merged that district with the former District 32-1-10, thereby creating a new consolidated district which it labelled 32-1-10.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> De<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>fendant, Gessler, who had been the District Justice of the Peace for the former District 32-2-9 was designated by the Common Pleas Court’s Order to serve as the District Justice for the newly merged District 32-1-10.

Article Y, Section 16(a) of the Constitution which provides that “justices of the peace shall be compensated by the Commonwealth,” further indicates that all judicial officers are officers of the Commonwealth. Moreover, Rule 317 of our Pennsylvania Rules of Conduct, Office Standards and Civil Procedure for Justices of the Peace states: “A justice of the peace may issue subpoenas throughout the Commonwealth to require the attendance of witnesses in any cause of action triable before him.” The undeniable implication of Rule 317 is that an official with statewide subpoena powers is an official with statewide jurisdiction.</p>

Plaintiff argues that the Order of the common pleas court, approved by this Court on November 1,1972, cannot extinguish that exclusive, constitutionally mandated authority of the Governor to fill, by appointment, existing vacancies in judicial offices. Therefore he concludes that the Governor’s appointment of December 1, 1972, established plaintiff as the only lawful district justice of the peace for Magisterial District 32-1-10.</p>

More specifically, <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>Article Y, Section 7 directs that: “(b) . . . The number and boundaries of magisterial districts of each class within each judicial district shall be <em>established </em>by the Supreme Court or by the courts of common pleas under the direction of the Supreme Court <em>as required for the efficient administration of justice </em>within each magisterial district.” (Emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[126,730,1154,1321]]]'>Plaintiff urges that the use of the word “establish” in this section restricts the “general supervisory and administrative authority” of this Court over magisterial districts only to the initial creation of each district, and that “this directive was never intended to continue after the magisterial districts had been established.” However, we are not persuaded that the word “established” must be given such a restrictive interpretation, especially when read in the context of Section 7. That section gives the Supreme Court the power to establish “the number and boundaries of magisterial districts . . . <em>as required for the efficient administration of justice </em>This latter phrase carries the clear implication of a <em>continuing power </em>to establish boundaries for these districts <em>if the need arises </em>(“as required”) to insure the efficient administration of justice. It would, indeed, be anomalous for the Constitution to grant general supervisory powers to the Supreme Court over these districts, to empower the Court to “create” these districts “as required for the efficient administration of justice,” and yet to withhold from the Court the power to continue to supervise these districts should the needs of the efficient administration of justice change at some later date.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

So, too, the Pennsylvania Constitution does not intend that magisterial districts, once created by this Court, are unalterably established, and thus effectively removed from the expressly granted “general supervisory and administrative authority” of this Court over those districts. Such an interpretation would freeze the districts as initially created, regardless of the need for the “efficient administration of justice.” The Pennsylvania Constitution, vests in this Court, the power to merge or consolidate magisterial districts as required by the needs of justice, and the efficient and effective administration of the state’s unified judicial system.</p>

After Distinct Justice Getty had been removed, his vacant district was merged with defendant’s district in which there was no vacancy. (As noted previously the numbers employed to designate the abolished and merged districts are of no legal significance and cannot affect the substance of what was actually accomplished by the merger of the two districts. See note 1, supra.)
