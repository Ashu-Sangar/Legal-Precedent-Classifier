    <p id="b155-4" data-blocks='[["BL_155.6",155,[152,409,1150,753]]]'>Plaintiff-appellee, Miscellaneous, Inc., an Ohio corporation, registered to do business as a foreign corporation in Pennsylvania. On November 18, 1969, plaintiff received a certificate from the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia permitting it to carry on business under the fictitious name “Mise., Inc.” or “Miscellaneous, Inc”. On November 26, 1969, plaintiff received another similar certificate from the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. Plaintiff operates a total of nine gift stores, only one being located in Pennsylvania, at the Monroeville Mall, Allegheny County. The Pennsylvania store, in operation since October, 1970, offers for sale certain women’s accessories and other notions.</p>
    <p id="b155-5" data-blocks='[["BL_155.7",155,[148,1184,1152,1134]]]'>Appellant, Klein’s Fashions, Inc. (Klein’s), is a Pennsylvania corporation engaged in selling women’s apparel. In June of 1969, approximately five months prior to the time plaintiff had received its certificates, Klein’s was authorized to conduct business under the fictitious name “Mise.” Klein’s has several stores throughout Western. Pennsylvania. In March of 1972, plaintiff learned that Klein’s was planning to open a new store in Monroeville Mall, some sixty feet from plaintiff’s establishment. Before Klein’s had begun its Monroeville operation, plaintiff had by letter requested Klein’s to refrain from using the designation “Mise.” This request was denied and Klein’s opened its women’s apparel store under the designation “Mise.” on May 12, 1972. Plaintiff filed a complaint in equity seeking to enjoin Klein’s from using the name. A hearing was held on the complaint and the chancellor issued a decree nisi, enjoining Klein’s from using the name “Mise.” or any similar name, within the Borough of Monroeville. Exceptions were taken, argued and denied, and a final decree was entered. This appeal followed.</p>

The evidence offered by plaintiff, that customers frequently came into plaintiff’s store looking for goods sold only by Klein’s, is further evidence that plaintiff’s use had not achieved a secondary meaning for its name.</p>
