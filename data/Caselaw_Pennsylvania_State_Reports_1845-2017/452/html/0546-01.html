See <em>Commonwealth v. Culbreath, </em><a href="/pa/439/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="439 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1930960" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0021-01">439 Pa. 21</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20643" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="264 A.2d 643">264 A. 2d 643</a> (1970) (dissenting opinion of Justice Roberts, joined by this writer). It seems to me, however, that if we really mean that the tidal court has discretion in deciding whether or not to permit withdrawal of a plea, we must uphold the exercise of it in this case. If we mean that “any fair and just reason” will support a withdrawal (provided no substantial prejudice to the Commonwealth), that must mean something other than a complete retraction of everything the defendant had previously stated under <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>oath in response to meticulous questioning. I find it difficult to accept as a fair and just reason what to the hearing court was obviously a cock-and-bull story. If the mere <em>desire </em>to change a plea is a fair and just reason, then a plea change becomes an absolute right (again, absent substantial prejudice to the prosecution) and we should declare it as such rather than talk in terms of discretion.</p>
    <p id="b646-4" data-blocks='[["BL_646.4",646,[185,764,1156,427]]]'>Finally, I point out that the ruling of the lower court here complained of was entered prior to our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Forbes, </em>supra, decided January 19, 1973. If <em>Forbes </em>in effect changed the law to say that a belated protestation of innocence is, by itself, reason to allow a change of plea, then it should not be applied retroactively, as the Court appears here to do.</p>
