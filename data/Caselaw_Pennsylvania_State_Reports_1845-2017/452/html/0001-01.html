An estimated $1500 was stolen in the robbery. The victim’s wife, Edith Ticktin, seeing the two holdup men enter the premises, immediately ran out the back door, screaming for help.

From these witnesses, police, who soon arrived on the scene, learned that two men, one wearing a light-colored raincoat, dark glasses and a hat, and the other wearing a dark jacket, were seen jumping out of a car, driven by a woman, and entering the store before the shooting and were again seen running back from the store and entering the same car, a black Oldsmobile with a license plate ending with the digits 965, after the killing. Several police officers, having received descriptions of the car, its license plate and the occupants, participated in the apprehension of the holdup participants. A car matching the description of the Oldsmobile involved was encountered within minutes of the robbery by police patrolling in the area. After a high-speed chase, which took nearly ten minutes, these police forced the black Oldsmobile to a halt. The two male occupants of the car jumped out and ignored an order to stop. One of them, the appellant, William Smith, was shot as he attempted to flee and was arrested immediately. The other male, William Barks-dale, see <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b97-4" data-blocks='[["BL_97.5",97,[146,1247,1152,1108]]]'>Appellant raises several contentions in his appeal for a new trial. He first argues that the eyewitness identification by the decedent’s widow, Mrs. Edith Tick-tin, should not have been admitted because it was based, not upon her “fleeting, frightened glance of the robber’s face,” but upon a photographic lineup where Mrs. Tick-tin was shown nine to ten photographs, including a picture of appellant, after appellant had already been taken into custody, and without the presence of counsel for appellant. Appellant argues that this procedure violated our ruling in <em>Commonwealth v. Whiting, </em><a href="/pa/439/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="439 Pa. 205" data-case-ids="1930974" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0205-01">439 Pa. 205</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20738" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="266 A.2d 738">266 A. 2d 738</a> (1970), and, therefore, that the court erred in failing to grant his motion to suppress Mrs. Ticktin’s testimony. However, we do not believe that our decision in <em>Whiting </em>should be applied retroactively. Since the photographic identifications challenged here occurred in March of 1968, and our decision in <em>Whiting </em>was not made until July 2, 1970, appellant will not be permitted to take advantage of our <em>Whiting </em>decision.</p>

We would agree with appellant that it is better in all such cases to give these warnings without the jury being present, so that if a co-conspirator chooses to exercise basic Fifth Amendment rights, the defendant will not be prejudiced. Compare <em>Namet v.

However, when the co-conspirator chooses not to exercise those rights, such as happened in the instant case, we cannot see how the defendant is unfairly prejudiced. We are convinced that when Miss Johnson readily admitted on the stand that she had in fact planned with appellant and Barksdale to commit the crime in question, the jury would have been well aware that Miss Johnson’s testimony was self-incriminating, even if they had not been present when she was warned to that effect.</p>

The defendant’s automobile had been immobilized for several hours and was safely in the custody of the police at the police station. There was “no alerted criminal bent on flight, no fleeing opportunity on an open highway after a hazardous chase.” <em>Coolidge v.

Ct. 1975</a> (1970), supports the result reached by the majority. The Supreme Court in <em>Chambers </em>stated: “For constitutional purposes, we see no difference between on the one hand seizing and holding a car before presenting the probable cause issue to a magistrate and on the other hand carrying out an immediate search without a warrant. Given probable cause to search, either course is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.” <a href="/us/399/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="399 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="6168334" data-case-paths="/us/399/0042-01">Id. at 52</a>, <a href="/us/399/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="399 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="6168334" data-case-paths="/us/399/0042-01">90 S.

In <em>Chambers </em>the Court sustained a search, without a warrant, of an automobile that was in the custody of the police. However, a crucial distinction exists between <em>Chambers </em>and this case. In <em>Chambers no </em>search was conducted contemporaneously with the initial arrest of the defendants. As the Court noted: “It was not unreasonable <em>in this case </em>to take the car to the station house. <em>All occupants in the car were arrested in a dark parking lot in the middle of the night. A careful search at that point was impractical and perhaps not safe for the officers, </em>and it would serve the owner’s convenience and the safety of Ms car to have the veMcle and the keys together at the station house.” <a href="/us/399/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="399 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="6168334" data-case-paths="/us/399/0042-01">Id. at 52, n.10</a>, <a href="/us/399/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="399 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="6168334" data-case-paths="/us/399/0042-01">90 S.

      <em>Chambers </em>simply held that when, because of legitimate concerns over their own safety, the police are unable to conduct a search contemporaneously with an arrest, an exigent circumstance arises which allows the police to subsequently search without a warrant. Such a holding is of course consistent with the Fourth Amendment general requirement of a warrant, a principle wMch was expressly acknowledged in <em>Chambers </em>and reaffirmed thereafter in <em>Coolidge, </em><a href="/us/403/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="403 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="12027286" data-case-paths="/us/403/0443-01">supra.</a> The compelling circumstance in <em>Chambers </em>is not present in this case. Here the police had an opportunity to search the automobile when the defendant was arrested, and in fact did so. During the course of that search the police recovered a weapon used in the crime, the money taken in the robbery, and a bloodstained coat. Thus there existed no “exigent circumstance” justifying the officers from not obtaining a warrant before they searched the automobile a <em>second time several hours later </em>at the police station.</p>
