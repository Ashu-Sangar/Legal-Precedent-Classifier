    <p id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[150,989,1153,1248]]]'>“It is a fundamental precept of the common law that the prosecution may not introduce evidence of the defendant’s prior criminal conduct as substantive evidence of his guilt of the present charge. It has been succinctly stated that £[t]he purpose of this rule is to prevent the conviction of an accused for one crime by the use of evidence that he has committed other unrelated crimes, and to preclude the inference that because he has committed other crimes he was more likely to commit that crime for which he is being tried. The presumed effect of such evidence is to predispose the minds of the jurors to believe the accused guilty and thus effectually to strip him of the presumption of innocence.’ Commonwealth v. Trowery, <a href="/pa-super/211/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="211 Pa. Super. 171" data-case-ids="781537" data-case-paths="/pa-super/211/0171-01">211 Pa.

Recognizing the prejudicial effect of such evidence, there is no justification for indirectly allowing the introduction of prior criminal activity by reference to photographs of the accused. <em>Once it is determined that a jury could reasonably conclude from the photographic reference prior criminal activity on the pa/rt of the defendant prejudicial error has been </em>committed.” <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20171" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="235 A.2d 171">Id. at 181-82</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20373" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="292 A.2d 373">292 A. 2d at 375</a>.

I went through a great deal of my files, and all of a sudden I thought of the name Groce, . . .” Why would a police officer from the performance of his duties recognize a name? Why would a man’s name be in police files? The obvious answer is the party had engaged in prior criminal activity, and we rule the jury could reasonably infer this from the testimony. Hence, prejudicial error was committed.</p>

However, the repetition of an objection is needless where the same or similar evidence, already duly objected to, is again offered and the trial court’s ruling has indicated that an objection to such evidence will again be overruled. See 1 Wigmore, Evidence §18 (3d ed. 1940). Additionally, after reading the record in its entirety, it is our conclusion the erroneously admitted evidence probably had a substantial influence in bringing about the jury’s verdict.</p>

That answer, however, does not strike me as conveying to the jury a prior police record of the defendant. It is true that there was a reference to searching police files. But the name “Groce” was linked to the name “Nino” not by reason of any file disclosure, but because the testifying officer “all of a sudden . . . thought of the name ‘Groce’.” The files, apparently, were barren.</p>

Through our investigation and a door-to-door check, we came up with the name Nino. Then at this point . . . Mr. Duffy [Attorney for the Defendant] : I object to that, sir, and move to strike.” It is apparent to me that the ground of defense counsel’s objection, although general in form, was that what the witness learned through a door-to-door investigation was hearsay. It is quite certain that the objection <em>could not have been </em>to the introduction of “other crimes” testimony for the simple reason that there was no such testimony yet uttered and none apparently in the offing. When the Avitness later testified as to how he had connected in his memory the name “Nino” with the name “Groce”, defense counsel evidently detected no prejudice and remained silent.</p>
