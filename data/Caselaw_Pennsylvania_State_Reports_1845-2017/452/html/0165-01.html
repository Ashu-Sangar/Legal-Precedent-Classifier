The child, Robbie, was conceived and born out of wedlock. During her pregnancy appellant was referred to the Butler County Bureau of Children’s Services (“Bureau”). Appellant gave custody to the Bureau and her son was placed in foster care on February 17, 1970. Appellant signed a “Parent’s Placement Agreement” on February 20, 1970, which provided for temporary placement of the child, but permitted removal from foster care by appellant upon ten days’ prior notice to the Bureau.

We have already noted that the child’s welfare is irrelevant to the issue of abandonment. Thus, we may not consider the allegation that appellant would not be a suitable parent. The remaining specific allegations of abandonment necessitate a resolution of the question of whether appellant’s recanted <em>voluntary </em>termination can support a decree of <em>involuntary </em>termination on grounds of abandonment where appellant relinquished custody of her child to the Bureau for a period in excess of six months.

Act of July 24, 1970, P. L. 620, §301, 1 P.S. §301. To insure an intelligent, voluntary and deliberate consent to the termination of parental rights <em>(see Watson Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/450/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="450 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="1947028" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0579-01">450 Pa. 579</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20861" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="301 A.2d 861">301 A. 2d 861</a> (1973)), the legislature has required a hearing on the petition for <em>voluntary </em>relinquishment. <em>Id,. </em>§303. In the present case, pursuant to the Adoption Act, appellant placed her son in the care of the Butler County Bureau of Children’s Services on February 17, 1970, and twice furnished written consent to the child’s adoption. Before the hearing and decree of termination by the court, the appellant manifested an intent to halt the <em>voluntary </em>termination proceedings. The appellee urges that the child’s placement in the Bureau’s custody <em>for </em>a period of more than <em>six </em>months “has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to [the] child” and justifies a decree of <em>involuntary </em>termination.

We find neither neglect nor the intent to abandon in this situation. Appellant placed her child with the Bureau pending a final decree in her petition for <em>voluntary </em>relinquishment. She properly withdrew her petition before a final decree was entered. That the period of time between the child’s placement in foster care and the withdrawal of appellant’s consent exceeded six months cannot, in itself, support a decree of <em>involuntary </em>termination.
