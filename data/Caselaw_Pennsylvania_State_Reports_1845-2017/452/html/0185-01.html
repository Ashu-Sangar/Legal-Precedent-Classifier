A Joseph Meier, resident of the Club’s second floor, surprised the felons and was struck a fatal blow. The crime was similar in nature to three other burglaries which had been perpetrated within a ten day period immediately preceding June 10 and which occurred within a narrow geographical area of the North Side; in all four, entry was accomplished through a broken <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>window and in ail four the object was to remove the coin boxes of automatic vending machines. On June 12, 1961-, police arrested the appellant George Schmidt and two of his friends, Kenneth Baurle and William Thorton. Although appellant for several days denied any connection with the Caecilia Mannerchor Club burglary and murder, he did admit that the three earlier crimes were of his doing. His friends, however, admitted participation in all four, and placed the Meier murder weapon in Schmidt’s hands. When faced with the willingness of Baurle and Thorton to detail the events of June 10, Schmidt in turn confessed that he had in fact so acted, and joined in a tape-recorded session in which all three admitted burglarizing the Mannerchor Club. Schmidt’s statement was then reduced to writing and signed. The appellant and Kenneth Baurle were indicted for murder, and Thorton was indicted on the charge of accessory before and after the fact of murder.</p>

Illi</em>nois, <a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">378 U.S. 478</a>, <a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">12 L.

Appellant testified on Ms own behalf and attempted to repudiate his confession only to the extent that it related to the Mannerchor Club burglary. He affirmed his participation in the earlier crimes, but asserted that his confession with regard to the fatal burglary was involuntarily extracted by police threats to prosecute his mother, by physical abuse administered by interrogating officers, by relentless questioning and by misrepresentation of the law. As its verdict shows, the jury did not accept this account of coercion. By our earlier decision we affirmed the lower court’s finding that the confession was not involuntary.</p>

Section 4 then creates a rebuttable presumption that a failure to raise an issue was knowing and understanding, 19 P.S. §1180-4(c) (Supp. 1972-73); the burden of rebutting the presumption is upon the PCHA petitioner. 19 P.S. §1180-4 (b)(2) (Supp. 1972-73).</p>

Indeed, as the cases cited above indicate, the doctrine was one of unvarying and untempered conclusiveness. Because this doctrine existed, there is here no obstacle to following the legislative mandate of section 4(c) of the PCHA. It follows that the failure to raise this issue “before the trial” will be regarded as “knowing and understanding” until the petitioner-appellant demonstrates to the contrary.

At the former, when examined by the Commonwealth with regard to the question of probable cause to arrest, the trial counsel testified as follows: “Q. Did you at that time [prior to trial] feel there was a probable cause lacking for the arrest? A. No. My recollection is that we felt that a murder had been committed, and the police were ‘hot’ on it and they had rounded up a couple of these boys, and as I recall, we can’t say that I felt there was a probable cause for it, but let me put it this way, that I can’t say that we felt there was a lack of probable cause at the time.” It is apparent from the record of the suppression hearing that appellant’s counsel not only did not <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>feel <em>that there was a </em>lack of probable cause to support the arrest, but that the reasons motivating that arrest might be turned to good advantage. The motion to suppress was a two-pronged attack on the confession obtained by the police from Schmidt: It asserted (1) that <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">supra,</a> had been violated, and (2) that under all the circumstances, the confession was not voluntary. During the hearing on that motion, appellant’s counsel attempted to elicit from police officers the information that had led them to arrest Schmidt. The Commonwealth objected on grounds of relevancy, arguing that the question went beyond the scope of the issues raised in the motion. In reply, appellant’s attorney stated that he thought it important to develop that at the moment Schmidt was arrested, the police had already accumulated information which led them to believe that appellant was involved in the murder, and that therefore, under <em>Escobedo, </em>the investigation had become accusatory and had focused on Schmidt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Thus, not only did appellant’s counsel be<a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>lieve that it was not worthwhile to argue that probable cause did not exist for the arrest, but further believed and attempted to show that the police possessed information prior to arrest to support the conclusion that Schmidt was implicated in the murder of Joseph Meier. In this failure to question the legality of the arrest, we find not only a knowing and intelligent decision by counsel, but further a decision made as a matter of strategy hopefully of benefit to appellant. We conclude, therefore, that the legality of the arrest cannot now be questioned in this PCIIA proceeding, because it must be considered waived within the meaning of section 4 of the PCHA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>
