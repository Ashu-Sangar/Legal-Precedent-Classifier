As we have noted on several occasions: “A plea of guilty to murder generally is sufficient of itself to sustain a conviction of murder in Lie second degree. Commonwealth ex rel. Bostic v. Cavell, <a href="/pa/424/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="424 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1904920" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0573-01">424 Pa. 573</a>, 576, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20662" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="227 A.2d 662">227 A. 2d 662</a>, 664 (1967). Thus the only issues which would have been available for appellant to challenge on direct review would have been the validity of the plea and the lawfulness of the sentence.

The record of the arraignment in ths case<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> shows that the trial judge explained the plea procedure in murder cases to the appellant and repeatedly warned him that he should not <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>plead guilty if lie felt that he was innocent. At that point, the following colloquy transpired: “The Depend-ant: I admit killing him but I did it in self-defense. The Court: Then we can’t accept your plea. It will be up to the Jury to decide. If you say you did it in self-defense you will have to be tried before a jury. The Dependant: Yes, Sir. The Court: So you wish to change your plea? The Dependant: Yes, sir, because I wasn’t aware of what was on the plea. The Court: What? The Dependant: I wasn’t aware of what was on the plea that he read off, on the inside. Mr. Cavanaugh : He wasn’t aware that the facts were as I read them off in the indictment. The Court: You weren’t aware that you must plead guilty generally, is that what you are saying? The Dependant: Yes, sir. The Court: Because it is my duty then to fix the degree. The Dependant : I will plead guilty to general charge of murder and leave the decision up to you. The Court : What? Mr. Cavanaugh : He will plead guilty to general charge of murder and let the decision up to you. The Court : You are satisfied to do that then, are you? The Dependant: Yes. The Court: Because I cannot accept any plea of guilty here if you say you are not guilty. I cannot do that. You have a right to be tried before a jury. You say now that you are willing to leave it up to me? The Dependant: Yes, sir. The Court: As to the degree of guilt, is that it? The Dependant: Yes, sir. The Court: All right.” The appellant urges that the tidal judge should have conducted a more probing inquiry at this juncture explaining that a plea of guilty to murder generally precludes a finding of innocence by reason of self-defense.</p>

We cannot emphasize strongly enough, however, that our inquiry ceases and counsel’s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had <em>some reasonable basis </em>designed to effectuate his client’s interests. The test is <em>not </em>whether other alternatives were more reasonable, employing a hindsight evaluation of the record. Although weigh the alternatives we must, the balance tips in favor of a finding of effective assistance as soon as it is determined that trial counsel’s decisions had any reasonable basis.” (Citations <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>omitted.)

[The appellant] stated he would give us an oral statement; however, he would not sign a written statement without an attorney being present. I told him this would be satisfaetoiy. “Q. Did you explain that he did not have to make any oral statement? A. Yes, sir. I told him he could remain silent to start with.” In view of the officer’s testimony that the appellant expressed an immediate willingness to give an oral statement after being warned of his right to remain silent, a motion to suppress stood little chance of success. Moreover the impact of the statement was negligible since it differed from the facts which the appellant related at trial only in that it failed to mention that the deceased had made a motion for the gun. There were many reasonable explanations for this omission making the need to resort to an attempt to suppress the statement unnecessary. We therefore hold that appellant’s trial counsel had a reasonable basis not to file the suppression motion.</p>
