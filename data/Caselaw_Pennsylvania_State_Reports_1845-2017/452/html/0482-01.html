The City Council of Philadelphia, for example, fixes the number of assistant district attorneys, as well as their salaries. The operating budget for fiscal year 1974 reveals that the District Attorney “Department” has been alloted, by City Council, over $2,300,000 to pay the more than 140 assistant district attorneys. Additionally, the Council has budgeted over $1,100,000 for other office personnel and more than $250,000 for materials, supplies, equipment, and purchase of services. It would be anomalous, indeed, to conclude—as appellants urge—that, although the City establishes the number of assistant district attorneys and fixes their salaries, the assistants are not employees of the City of Philadelphia.</p>

Moreover, it is noteworthy that the Philadelphia Code §20-207 specifically exempts “all assistant district attorneys ... from the civil service.” Obviously, the Philadelphia Code would not include within its provisions references to those who are not City employees.

Obviously, the legislature could conclude that campaigning for such offices would inevitably interfere with the employee-candidate’s time, energy, and devotion to his official duties. No one acquainted with the demands of a campaign for a county office, such as clerk of court, would deny that such demands could, and most likely would, affect a candidate’s regular job performance. Undoubtedly, the legislature was not unaware of the probability that an employee seeking such an office could use the prestige of the office he was seeking or his state office to gain special treatment from his superiors—such as leaves of absence and special work assignments—or that his campaign activities would promote or retard his advancement. Further, the legislature doubtless foresaw both the probability of the employee’s using his state employment to favor those who might directly or indirectly aid him in Ms campaign, and, in the context of the rather unique nature of the political structure in this state, where most elective offices (including the legisla<a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>tive offices and all elective county offices) are declared by statute to be 'nonpartisan’, the probability of Ms exposure to involvement in partisan political activities —with all the potentially disruptive abuses that such involvement could produce.</p>
