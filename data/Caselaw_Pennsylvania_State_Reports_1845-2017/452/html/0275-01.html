Under the instant facts, the assault and battery necessarily involved the act of resisting arrest, and the act of resisting an officer in making the arrest; hence, the offenses merged. After the assault and battery was established, no additional facts were required to prove the two additional offenses. This is clear from the pertinent statute, the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §314, 18 P.S. §4314, defining the crime of obstructing an officer in the execution of process. It is as follows: “Whoever knowingly, wilfully and forcibly obstructs, resists or opposes any officer or other person duly authorized, in serving or attempting to serve or execute any legal process or order, or in making a lawful arrest without warrant, or <em>assaults or beats any officer or person, </em>duly authorized, in serving or executing any such legal process or order or for and because of having served or executed the same; or in malting a lawful arrest without warrant; or rescues another in legal custody; or whoever being required by any officer, neglects or refuses to assist him in the execution of his office in any criminal case, or in the preservation of the peace, or in apprehending and securing any person for a breach of the peace, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding one (1) year; or to pay a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500), or both.” [Emphasis added.]</p>

And after he was done being x-rayed, we attempted to put cuffs on, and the defendant stated we wasn’t going to put the cuffs on. And as I began to grab him, he gave me a left forearm to the chest. I went back to the wall. My partner then grabbed for him, and he hit my partner. I tackled him around the neck. We struggled down on the floor, and I got one cuff on him. I was kneeling on him, pulling on his arm trying to get the two arms together to get him recuffed. At this time the defendant said we weren’t going to cuff him, and threw me and my partner. We again tackled him and the nurse called for assistance and several officers came in, and we took him to P.G.H,”</p>

But where there is a presence of deterring power and threats of physical force, either express or implied, if the service of the writ or process is executed, it comes within the contemplation of the statute.
