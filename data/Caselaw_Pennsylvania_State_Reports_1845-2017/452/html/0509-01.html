One of Mrs. Morris’ four children however, filed a petition for a declaratory judgment seeking a ruling on the nature of Mrs. Morris’ remainder interest in the trust.

Paragraph 3 dealt with the disposition of the trust fund after settlor’s wife’s death and began with the words “Upon the death of my said wife”. Whereas the majority passed over these words without comment, my brother Pomeroy properly recognized their fundamental significance. In his dissenting opinion in <em>Benson, </em>he said: “It seems incontrovertible to me that paragraph 3 ... is flatly conditioned upon the death of the settlor’s wife, Alberta H. Pew. Until that occurs, there is to be no division into shares for children, including this decedent, and <em>all the language of that paragraph, spelling out what happens to each share for children, is so far inoperative. </em>The instrument nowhere expressly gives this decedent any interest of any Mnd in the trust estate, even a right to any portion of income, until the death of her mother; I cannot see the justification for construing it as if it does. <em>In my view, the reading of the majority effectively extirpates the words (Upon the death of my said wife, Alberta H. Pew’, which introduce the third paragraph and constitute a precondition to all of its </em>provisions.” <a href="/pa/447/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="447 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1942937" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0062-01">447 Pa. at 73-74</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20101" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="285 A.2d 101">285 A. 2d at 107</a>.</p>

In <em>Thompson, </em>a settlor’s deed of an inter vivos trust provided that the trustee was to collect dividends and pay them to settlor’s granddaughter for her life and from and after her death to pay the dividends to her children (settlor’s great grandchildren). As each child reached the age of 21, the trustee was to transfer to each child a pro rata share of stock <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>and, in default of any such child reaching 21, to transfer said stock to the settlor’s heirs. This Court held that the great granddaughter who predeceased her mother, having attained the age of 21 years and 26 days, had a contingent remainder. Tn <em>Thompson, </em>after examining the trust instrument, this Court reasoned that there were no express words of gift independent of the direction and time for transfer. Since the gift was implied from the direction to transfer, it was inseparable from the direction and necessarily partook of the quality of the direction; that is, the gift was to be made to the great granddaughter only if she survived her mother and attained the age of 21. Similarly, the interests of settlor’s daughters in the present case are unquestionably contingent on their surviving their mother and attaining the designated ages.</p>
