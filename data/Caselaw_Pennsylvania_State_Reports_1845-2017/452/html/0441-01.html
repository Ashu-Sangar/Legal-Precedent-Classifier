    <p id="b535-4" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[120,448,1149,379]]]'>The question of the necessity of a guardian for Laura H. Heidtman’s estate is not in issue: her incompetence was conclusively established by medical testimony in the proceedings below and is not disputed by the appellants. The only question before us is whether the lower court properly appointed the incompetent’s husband to serve as guardian.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[118,841,1150,546]]]'>Laura Heidtman was admitted to the Reading Hospital on March 30, 1972. She was examined there by Dr. Elmer Horst, who found her “acutely disturbed and very paranoid.” Laura Heidtman’s husband, Walter Heidtman, petitioned the court for an adjudication of incompetence. He also requested that he be appointed as guardian of Laura Heidtman’s estate. After a hearing on May 5, 1972, the court issued its June 7, 1972, decree of incompetence and appointed Walter Heidtman as guardian of the estate.</p>
    <p id="b535-6" data-blocks='[["BL_535.6",535,[116,1402,1149,604]]]'>On June 22,1972, Estelle Gray, Florence Hirst and George Harnly, siblings of the incompetent, filed exceptions to the lower court’s exclusion of offered evidence, its appointment of Walter Heidtman as guardian and the failure to appoint a “disinterested” guardian. On October 16, 1972, the court issued a decree sustaining these exceptions for the limited purpose of determining the admissibility of the excluded evidence and to judge whether such evidence, if admitted, could establish circumstances which would warrant a denial of the appointment of the incompetent’s husband as guardian.</p>
    <p id="b535-7" data-blocks='[["BL_535.7",535,[117,2018,1143,99]],["BL_536.1",536,[206,336,1154,213]]]'>A second hearing was held on November 10, 1972.

Estelle Gray and Florence Hirst have taken this appeal from the court’s decree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[205,559,1157,1385]],["BL_537.1",537,[135,340,1148,550]]]'>The Rules of the Orphans’ Court, Section 14, Rule 142(a) (8), provide that “[a] petition to adjudicate a person incompetent and to appoint a guardian of his estate shall set forth ... an averment that the proposed guardian has no interest adverse to the alleged incompetent.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> From this basic rule the appellants would have us extrapolate a corollary that a husband cannot be appointed guardian of the estate of his incompetent wife. The appellants cite legislation affording married women property and contractual rights (Act of July 15, 1957, P. L. 969, §1, 48 P.S. §32.1), the right to control separate earnings (Act of April 3, 1872, P. L. 35, §§1, 2, 48 P.S. §§34, 35), the right of a married woman to control property upon the husband’s desertion (Act of May 4, 1855, P. L. 430, §§2, 4, 48 P.S. §§42, 43) and the right of a married woman to be free from liability for her husband’s debts (Act of April 11, 1848, P. L. 536, §6, 48 P.S. §64). Appellants maintain that in view of legislation establishing the independence of a <em>competent </em>married woman from her husband’s proprietary control it would be anomalous to permit an <em>incompetent </em>woman to be “victimized” by her husband. On the strength of this argument alone, we are urged to promulgate a rule which would raise a presumption of adverse interest in the husband seeking appointment as <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>guardian of Ms wife’s estate, a presumption based solely upon Ms marital relation to the incompetent wife. The effect would be novel, but untenable: the husband would bear the burden of coming forward with evidence that Ms wish to serve as guardian of the incompetent wife’s estate is uncompromised by the opportunity for personal gain. We believe that the court below has properly placed the burden of proof of adverse interest with those who have challenged the husband’s petition for appointment as guardian.</p>
    <p id="b537-4" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[134,903,1149,940]]]'>Appellants argue, alternatively, that on the evidence presented the court should not have appointed the appellee as guardian of his wife’s estate because adverse interest is factually indicated. When a decree of incompetence is entered the incompetent is made a ward of the court appointing the guardian, and his estate is in the custody of that court. “Necessarily, therefore, the appointment of guardians for the incompetent . . . is within the sound discretion of the court to which the application has been made; and [the appellate] court will not reverse unless there has been an abuse of discretion.” Vosh<em>ake’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/125/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="125 Pa.
