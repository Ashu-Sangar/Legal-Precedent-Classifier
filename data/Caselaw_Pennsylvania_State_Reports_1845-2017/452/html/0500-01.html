The scene of the shooting was not far from the home of appellant and the trailer home of appellant’s father. The police were alerted to the fact that someone had been shot by telephone calls which Ross made to the office of the sheriff and of the state police from his father’s trailer. To the sheriff he declared he had “shot a man and he isn’t moving”. A little later the victim’s father, Herman Sampsell, telephoned to Ross to inquire what was going on. Ross replied, “I got a hell of a lick’n and I know I shot a man”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The police in due course arrived at the trailer of <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>Loss, Sr., having first located the scene of the shooting and found Sampsell’s body. Immediately upon their arrival, appellant blurted out that he had shot someone, but did not know who. This was repeated several times despite admonition by the police to keep quiet until he had been informed of his constitutional rights. After <em>Miranda </em>warnings had been given, appellant again declared that he had shot a man, this time to the county coroner, a medical doctor, who gave Ross a physical examination. Appellant was placed under arrest and taken to the police station within an hour and a half of his arrest.</p>

After daylight on the morning of the shooting the police had conducted a search of the wooded area in which Sampsell was killed for the weapon used. Finding nothing, they went to the trailer of Ross, Sr., who delivered to the police his son’s rifle. The gun had been found by the father leaning against the trailer. The police had no search warrant for the weapon, but according to the Commonwealth testimony, it was handed over to the police voluntarily. The suppression judge found that there was valid consent, and we see no reason to disturb that holding. The mere fact that, according to Mr. Ross, one of the state police officers told him “we have to have that gun” and that Ross was not instructed that he had no obligation to surrender it does not warrant us in concluding as a matter of law, as appellant urges, that the “consent” was really duress and coercion.</p>

They tended to counter the defendant’s theory of self-defense. Ross, testifying on his own behalf, stated that he shot straight at a person in standing position who gave the appearance of aiming a rifle at him, and his shot would have gone “straight through” that person. Prom the pictures the jurors could see for themselves that SampseH had been shot in the left side of the neck and could infer that he was shot, as the pathologist had indicated, while in a crouching position by someone off to his left. (His left trouser knee gave indication of kneeling on the ground.) The defendant had said that the person he had shot was in the open, not among trees; the pictures, however, showed that Sampsell had been shot in a wooded area, since there was no indication from the pictures that the leaves on the ground had been disturbed by a dragging of the body. As in <em>Commonwealth v. Robinson, supra, </em>we can conclude from the return of a verdict of manslaughter on facts which could well have justified <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>a verdict of murder that the passions of the jury were not in fact inflamed.

The testimony in question concerns a statement by the pathologist, a Dr. Mikhail, that the fragments of the bullet remaining in the deceased’s body “exceed the size of a .22 bullet”. Appellant argues that because Dr. Mikhail was not a ballistics expert he was thereby unqualified to state an opinion on this subject. We disagree.</p>
    <p id="b599-4" data-blocks='[["BL_599.5",599,[132,1102,1151,591]]]'>Dr. Mikhail was a medical doctor with over ten years experience in pathology; he had examined “fifteen or twenty” cases of gunshot wounds. This experience and training qualified him to make the limited appraisal he gave as to the size of the projectile that struck and killed Sampsell. He did not testify as to the exact size of the bullet, just that the amount of lead fragments remaining in the body of the deceased, as revealed by x-rays and the fact of an exit wound, indicated that the bullet was larger than a .22. The doctor was competent to state this opinion.</p>

Q. Was there ever a body found out there that was dead? that had a bullet hole right through him there? A. I couldn’t testify actually my buUet would’ve hit the man, but— Q. But did you aim at him there and you shot. A. I just aimed at an object. I just took and whirled and fired. Q. Why would you ever have told all these people you shot a man if you shot at some object? A. There was a possible chance of it and I didn’t— Q. What do you mean ‘a possible chance?’ A. There was a possible chance that I hit that man. Q. You knew you hit that man! He was right there on his knees and you shot him! A. I didn’t do no such thing like that. Q. Where is this body that you shot, then? There was one body out there, it was Lester Sampsell, and you know how the wound was inflicted. You heard the testimony and you know how he died. There was nobody else. Henry Ulrich is still here. All of the same people that were with you are still on this earth but Lester Sampsell, and he’s not here because of you! Me. Show altee: I object, Your Honor. That’s prejudicial. Me. Wilson : I’m through. Me. Show alter: I would also like to object to the fact that everybody isn’t here. The Court : It would be more properly used in the final argument rather than this time; however, it’s cross-examination and we’re not going to restrict either of you on cross-examination.”</p>
