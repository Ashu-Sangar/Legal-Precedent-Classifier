Almost nine years later, on April 23, 1970, David Babe was declared competent and the guardian was directed to file its final account.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At the hearing on audit of the account, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a claim of |5,817.90 against the former incompetent’s estate for care and maintenance provided to Babe at Torrance State Hospital during the period November, 1960 through July, 1968. On the authority of the Act of June 1, 1915, P. L. 661, §6, 71 P.S. §1786, the Commonwealth argued that its claim must take precedence over those of all general creditors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.4",306,[200,465,1155,539]]]'>The lower court in its adjudication and decree of distribution allowed the claim of the mortgagee Bank as a preferred claim, taking precedence over that of the Commonwealth. Because the assets of the estate were insufficient to pay all claims proved, the decree allowed the Commonwealth only the sum of $419.58 in satisfaction of its claim. The Commonwealth’s exceptions were overruled and this appeal followed. We will vacate the decree of distribution and remand the matter for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

Beyond the mortgaged property, however, the mortgage does not constitute a lien and hence, as against other property, the mortgagee’s status is that of a general creditor. 24 P.L.E. <em>Mortgages </em>§101, at 521; <em>Cake Estate&gt; </em><a href="/pa/157/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="157 Pa. 457" data-case-ids="846556" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0457-01">157 Pa. 457</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20A.%20773" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="27 A. 773">27 A. 773</a> (1893); <em>Elbert Estate, </em><a href="/citations/?q=3%20Pa.%20C.%20611" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Pa.

Nor does that property appear in the guardian’s second and final audit. It follows that the Western Pennsylvania National Bank in this proceeding is a general creditor only and has no lien on assets distributed by the decree of the lower court. Therefore, as between the Commonwealth and the mortgagee, a general creditor, the Commonwealth has statutory priority.<a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>
