It is the most natural thing in the world for any lawyer in his summation to point out that salient points of his client’s case have not been disputed or denied, or that important testimony has not been contradicted.

This is quite different from specific comment on the defendant’s failure to take the stand. The remarks of the prosecutor and the judge in Griffin were held to violate the privilege because the California rule permitting them was ‘in substance a rule of evidence that allows the State the privilege of tendering to the jury for its consideration the failure of the accused to <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>testify.’ 380 U.S. at 613, 85 S. Ct. at 1232. The thought was that ‘when the court solemnizes the silence of the accused into evidence against him,’ id. at 614, 85 S. Ct. at 1233, the state is in practical effect exercising the compulsion the Fifth Amendment forbids. As against this, presumably no one would argue that the self-incrimination clause in any way inhibits the state’s production of evidence, even evidence which no one but the defendant can successfully contradict. If the state is free to do this, it must also be free to engage in normal advocacy so long as it does not point a finger at the accused’s remaining silent in the courtroom. It is one thing to prevent the state from making capital of the defendant’s invocation of the constitutional privilege but quite another to say that an accused who avails himself of it is entitled to impose on the prosecution shackles that would be unavailable to a man who testifies in his own defense. The Fifth Amendment was not aimed at the kind of ‘compulsion’ generated by the evidence and fair argument about it. Indeed it was a recognition of the plight of the defendant who was <em>unable </em>to take the stand that led to the enactment of statutes by almost every state, beginning with Maine in 1864, and by the United States, Act of March 16, 1878, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20Stat.%2030" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="20 Stat. 30">20 Stat. 30</a>, now <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A73481" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="18 U.S.C. §3481">18 U.S.C. §3481</a>, making him competent to testify on his request; generally, these statutes also provided, in the language of the federal act, that ‘his failure to make such request shall not create any presumption against him.’ See Reeder, Comment on Failure of Accused to Testify, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%2040" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="31 Mich.
