(Suburban), have taken this appeal from a final decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County denying their request for mandatory injunctive relief and damages against the Main Line Board of Realtors. Margaret Collins, the individual appellant, is a vice president of Suburban, the corporate appellant.</p>
    <p id="b438-6" data-blocks='[["BL_438.8",438,[190,928,1157,910]]]'>In the three years of 1966, 1967 and 1968, Margaret Collins and Suburban Fair Housing, Inc., both real estate brokers licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, sought membership in the Main Line Board of Realtors, a Pennsylvania non-profit corporation, which maintains a real estate multiple listing service exclusively for its members. In 1966, Collins’ and Suburban’s applications for membership were rejected and the reasons for the rejection were discussed with the applicants. In 1967, the applicants were again refused membership, but were given a formal notice and reasons for the denial, all of which dealt with an allegation that Collins and Suburban had “falsely, improperly and unethically” charged the Main Line Board of Realtors and some of its members with improper conduct. The applicants were again denied membership in 1968 but no additional reasons were given to them.</p>

The Chancellor, in his adjudication, dismissed Collins’ and Suburban’s complaint, concluding that their membership applications had been denied for just cause, that they had no vested property right to membership in the Board, and that nothing in the Board’s rules, regulations or by-laws constituted a restraint of trade or a violation of Collins’ or Suburban’s constitutional rights. Exceptions were taken to the Chancellor’s adjudication and dismissed by the court en banc. Thereafter, this appeal was taken.</p>

Each member has “exclusive listings”— listings originally brought to the member’s office by prospective sellers of real estate. All exclusive listings of all members are then centrally pooled and made available to all other members to sell. The listing member and the selling member of any property share the sales commission.</p>

United States, </em><a href="/us/326/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="326 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6156179" data-case-paths="/us/326/0001-01">326 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/326/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="326 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6156179" data-case-paths="/us/326/0001-01">89 L. Ed. 2013</a> (1945). That case involved a co-operative association of newspaper publishes whose purpose <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>was to expedite the collection, assembly and distribution of news. The by-laws of the association prohibited all members from selling news to nonmembers and gave members the power to block membership to nonmembers. The government brought a suit against the Associated Press under the Sherman Act (<a href="/citations/?q=26%20Stat.%20209" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="26 Stat. 209">26 Stat. 209</a>, 15 USCA §1) alleging that the association constituted a combination in restraint of trade in news. The Associated <em>Press </em>case arose under the applicable federal law —the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. However, the theory of that case and the result is applicable here. This Court has previously recognized that the Sherman Act “. . . is merely the application of the common-law doctrine concerning the restraint of trade to the field of interstate commerce.” <em>Schwartz v. Laundry &amp; Linen Supply Drivers’ U., Etc., supra. </em>In <em>Associated Press v. United States, <a href="/us/326/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="326 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6156179" data-case-paths="/us/326/0001-01">supra,</a> </em>the Court stated: “The Sherman Act was specifically intended to prohibit independent businesses from becoming ‘associates’ in a common plan which is bound to reduce their competitor’s opportunity to buy or sell the things in which the groups compete. Victory of a member of such a combination over its business rivals achieved by such collective means cannot consistently with the Sherman Act or with practical, everyday knowledge be attributed to <em>individual </em>‘enterprise and sagacity’; such hampering of business rivals can only be attributed to that which really makes it possible —the collective power of an unlawful combination.”</p>

    <p id="b442-4" data-blocks='[["BL_442.4",442,[204,502,1156,910]]]'>An agreement among 83 firms, doing $75 million in multiple listing business, not to do business in a significant manner with other properly licensed individuals in the same area per se restricts competition unreasonably. Economic or business competitors are not permitted to enter such agreements in restraint of trade because they are unreasonable. In <em>Schwartz v. Laundry &amp; Linen Supply Drivers’ U., Etc., supra, </em>this Court said: “. . . the law will not permit an arrangement, understanding, agreement, or combination among all those in the trade in a given locality, the effect of which is to deprive others of the right to engage in that industry and to deprive the public of the benefits of fair competition therein. No group may enhance its own interests at the expense of the legal rights of others, nor, by acts or agreements violating public policy, interfere with the interests of the public. . . .”</p>

Combinations are no less unlawful because they have not as yet resulted in restraint. An agreement or combination to follow a course of conduct which will necessarily restrain or monopolize a part of trade or commerce may violate the Sherman Act, whether it be ‘wholly nascent or abortive on the one hand, or successful on the other.’ For these reasons the argument, repeated here in various forms, that AP had not yet achieved a complete monopoly is wholly irrelevant. . . .”</p>

This cannot be done in a field that has already been preempted by State regulation. Pennsylvania provides for the regulation and licensing of real estate brokers. A Real Estate Commission exists which has the power to refuse, suspend or revoke licenses after complaints have been filed and hearings held. The Commission also has formulated specific enumerated wrongful acts which are the basis for refusing, suspending or revoking a real estate broker’s license. <em>See </em>Real Estate Brokers License Act of 1929, Act of Miay 1, 1929, P.

The appellee corporation cannot privately decide that someone should not be a licensed broker. Such judgments are for the proper state agency. Neither the appellee corporation nor the courts should in the first instance usurp the prerogative of the Pennsylvania Real Estate Commission. Until that agency properly acts, a licensed real estate broker is entitled to be treated as an equal with all other licensed brokers in determining membership in the appellee corporation.</p>

Although the charge was dismissed by the Commission, the Board felt that Collins had maligned its reputation by bringing the charge. We think it sufficient to say that Collins and Suburban should not now be permitted to be penalized for assisting a client in an attempt to assert his constitutional right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. The court below also listed various other reasons which it considered valid enough to justify the rejections. However, none of these reasons were ever given to Collins and Suburban and were, in fact, only superficially mentioned at trial.

One commentator has suggested what commends itself to me as a sensible test for resolving the problem: “[E]xclusionary measures should be permitted when [1] essential for efficient operation of an entire industry or [2] when justified by public policy.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> will discuss this case in terms of these two criteria.</p>

As the Chancellor’s opinion, below states, “[T]he multiple listing service of the Main Line Board of Realtors is not an economic necessity in the buying and selling of real estate.” Indeed, the data cited in the Chief Justice’s dissenting opinion would indicate that some 58% of the dollar value of real estate business in the Main Line area was transacted without the benefit of multilisting. And while the multiple listing arrangement may tend to promote efficient operation in the sale of real property, no reason is apparent why all qualified brokers in a geographic area should not participate. In short, I do not think that it can be said that the practice of multiple listing of properties for sale by less than all licensed brokers of the area is <em>“essential </em>for efficient operation of an entire industry.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

United States, </em>which motivated the <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>United States Supreme Court to strike down certain by-laws of the Associated Press. Neither of those factors is present in the instant case. First, the Associated Press by-laws absolutely prohibited the sale of news by members of the association to nonmembers. This rule made it impossible for any nonmember to obtain news from an Associated Press member. The by-laws of the Main Line Board of Realtors and the multiple listing service are clearly distinguishable. There is no rule, either written or informal, which prohibits members of the Main Line Board from cooperating with nonmembers in the sale of any parcel of real estate. Indeed, there was testimony presented at the hearing and the chancellor found as a finding of fact that <em>“ </em>[m] embers of defendant Board have on numerous occasions participated in and cooperated with plaintiffs in the sales of real estate in the Board’s territory.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

Whereas newspapers which would not be in competition with established Associated Press members could join the association quite easily, it was virtually impossible for a newspaper in competition with an existing member to gain admittance. The effective exclusion of all competitiors denounced in <em>Associated Press </em>clearly is not present in this case. At the time of the hearing there <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>were eighty-three individual firms who were members of the Board-all selling real estate in the three-township Main Line area. Moreover, the record reveals that the Board was continuing to accept new members who fulfilled the admission requirements set forth in the by-laws.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> In <em>Associated Press, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that the “joint effect” of the exclusive dealing requirement coupled with the systematic exclusion of all competitiors from membership was an unreasonable restraint of trade. Since neither of the factors crucial to the decision in <em>Associated Press </em>is present in this action, it is difficult to discern how that case can be regarded as primary or even persuasive authority for the decision reached by the majority.</p>
    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[189,1100,1154,748]]]'>Similar distinctions can also be drawn between the provisions of the Main Line Board of Realtors’ multiple listing service and the contract which was invalidated in <em>Schwartz v. Laundry &amp; Linen Supply Drivers Union. </em>The effect of the invalid contract provisions was to prevent the entry of any more independent laundry jobbers into the industry by <em>prohibiting </em>all signatories of the contract from dealing with any independent jobbers not under contract at the time the contract was executed. Once again the distinction is obvious: members of the Main Line Board are not only permitted to cooperate with non-members—they are encouraged to do so. The majority is in error when it states that “such cooperation is irrelevant.”</p>

      <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>T cannot agree with the majority’s statement that the multiple listing service at issue in this case “per se restricts competition unreasonably.” The lengthy testimony presented at the hearing and the facts as found by the chancellor do not support that conclusion. As noted earlier, not every restraint of trade or every agreement which confers some competitive advantage on its principals is void as a restraint of trade. It is only when the agreement results in an unreasonable restraint that it is subject to judicial interference. I agree with the chancellor that the operation of the Main Line Board’s multiple listing service does not unreasonably restrain trade. An analysis of all real estate sales negotiated by members of the Main Line Board from 1965 through 1969 reveals three major categories of sales made during that period: (1) sales of properties by a member broker which were never listed with the multi-list service; (2) direct sales which, although listed on the multi-list service, were sold by the listing broker and did not involve cooperation between brokers; and (3) cooperative multi-list sales where the property was listed by one broker and sold by another member broker. Only the third category, cooperative sales, involved the active operation of the multiple listing service. Between 1965 and 1969 this category of sales never exceeded 42% of the total dollar volume of sales negotiated by members of the Main Line Board of Realtors. In other words, 58% of the sales consummated by member realtors were independent of the multi-list service, involving only the seller, the listing broker and the buyer. On the basis of those figures I believe the chancellor was justified in finding that the multiple listing service, while admittedly benefiting its members, did not constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade.</p>

The majority seems to intimate that private as<a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>sociations with restrictive membership requirements are impermissible in fields which are regulated and licensed by the Commonwealth. I cannot find any support for that position and strongly disapprove it. The Legislature has created licensing provisions for virtually every occupation which involves some measure of public trust—from auctioneers to weighmasters. The purpose of state licensing is to insure that every person engaged in a regulated activity meets certain <em>minimum </em>standards of honesty and competency. There is nothing in this legislatively created scheme of regulation which suggests that individuals engaged in a regulated occupation should be prohibited from banding together in professional associations with an eye toward enhancing the prestige and expertise of their members. Judicial intervention in the membership decisions of private associations is only warranted when association membership is such an essential element of the profession that a nonmember is precluded from practicing his profession, provided that the membership requirements do not violate rights created by statute or by the Constitution. <em>Commonwealth Human Relations Commission v.

The record clearly demonstrates that that assumption is erroneous. It can hardly be said that the Main Line Board was “privately deciding that someone should not be a licensed broker” where there <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>was ample evidence that membership in the Main Line Board and participation in its multiple listing service was found not necessary for economic survival as a realtor in that area.</p>
    <p id="b457-3" data-blocks='[["BL_457.4",457,[130,549,1148,1133]]]'>In holding that the Board must open its membership to all licensed brokers, the majority opinion overlooks the substantial interest the existing members of the Board have in <em>selecting </em>those they desire to bind themselves to in a contractual manner. The heart of the multi-list service is its mandatory nature. Any property not sold by the broker who initially lists the property must be referred to the multi-list service for dissemination to all other members. Thereafter, if another member produces a buyer for the property, the original listing broker is required to share his commission with the selling broker. The effect of the majority decision is to force the existing members of the multi-list service into a binding relationship with anyone who meets the minimum qualifications prescribed by the State. Since participation in the multiple listing service is not essential for survival as a realtor on the Main Line and the operation of the service does not constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade, there is no justification for this invasion of private contract rights.</p>
