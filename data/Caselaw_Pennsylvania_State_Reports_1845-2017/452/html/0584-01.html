Costello later died of the wound.

He testified that between four-thirty and five o’clock in the morning he had seen the appellant- and the victim in the general area where the crime occurred. He was then asked if he had seen, a knife, to which he responded he had not after first unsuccessfully attempting to invoke the protection of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Beyond refuting the statement that he had not seen a knife, the earlier testimony and statement were used to establish that he had at one time maintained that the appellant was the one in possession of the weapon, that appellant had expressed an intention to rob someone, and that he (Berry) had attempted to restrain the appellant but that the deceased had already been fatally wounded.</p>

The only statement occasioning surprise that Berry uttered during this trial was, “I didn’t see no knife.” The very most that the prosecutor was entitled to bring out, in view of the defense’s failure to object initially to the surprise plea, was the fact that Berry had previously testified that he had seen a knife. The additional facts which the prosecutor elicited could not possibly have been relevant to show that any portion of Berry’s testimony was mistaken, because at that point Berry had given no testimony concerning those facts.

In <em>Dancer, Stafford </em>and <em>Knudsen </em>the thrust of the objection was the allowance of the right to cross-examine whereas in the case before us today that objection had been waived because of the failure of the appellant to interpose a timely objection. Here the complaint focused upon the scope of that cross-examination which permitted a number of damaging pieces of evidence to <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>be placed before the jury which were totally unrelated to the statement for which impeachment was allowed. In <em>Stafford </em>and <em>Knudsen </em>the court concluded that, since the objection went to the right to cross-examine and the witnesses in the respective cases adhered to their trial testimony, no prejudice was suffered by the court’s erroneous allowance of cross-examination. Here completely unrelated to the statement to be impeached —i.e., “I didn’t see no knife”-—the erroneous latitude granted by the Court permitted the introduction of the fact that the only eyewitness, Berry, had on two prior occasions stated not only that he had seen the knife but that it was in the hands of appellant, that appellant had expressed an intention of committing a robbery and that although he had attempted to intervene the appellant did in fact stab the victim. Although here too the witness repudiated these prior statements, prejudice resulted from the introduction of facts which the witness did not specifically controvert at trial and which served no permissible evidentiary purpose.</p>

When Berry was asked whether he at any time had seen a knife, after being unsuccessful in attempting to invoke the Fifth Amendment, Berry stated that he did not see the knife. The Commonwealth, claiming surprise, was then permitted to cross-examine Berry concerning whether he had made specific statements to the contrary at his own trial. When confronted with these prior statements, Berry responded, as to each one, “I said what my lawyer told me to say.” The Commonwealth went through much of Berry’s previous trial testimony until he finally was asked whether he had said: “Q. Now, Mr. Berry, ‘Question—you walked in where? Answer—I walked in the second area. Question—into <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>the room where the toilets were? Answer—yeah. Question—what did you see?

When Berry replied “They knew more than I did,” and claimed he was “sleepy” and couldn’t remember what he had told the police, he was read the portion of his statement which concerned the knife in the appellant’s hands and was asked whether he had said that.

Admittedly the prior testimony and the statement which Berry made to the police were not limited to neutralization of Berry’s testimony at trial denying that he had seen appellant with a knife at the time of the killing and upon previous occasions, but instead dealt with the entire crime. However, given the facts in this case, I do not believe the Court abused its discretion in permitting such broad cross-examination. When Berry de<a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>nied, on direct examination, that lie bad seen tbe murder knife in appellant’s band, this denial became a piece of substantive evidence wbicb tbe jury could consider in determining its verdict. Since Berry’s testimony was totally unexpected, in tbe light of tbe testimony at bis own trial, it was perfectly proper for tbe court to permit tbe Commonwealth to confront Berry with bis previous statement for purposes of impeaching tbe credibility of bis denial that be actually bad seen tbe knife.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> If tbe matter bad ended there, with Berry’s admission of bis previous remarks, it might have been error to permit any further cross-examination on tbe subject. However, tbe matter did not end there. Berry next claimed that bis lawyer had told him what to say at bis trial. It was then perfectly proper to permit tbe Commonwealth to confront Berry with all of bis trial testimony and bis substantially similar previous statement to tbe police to attack tbe credibility of his claim that bis lawyer told him what to say at tbe time of bis trial. (After all, Berry could not claim that bis lawyer also told him what to say to tbe police, since bis lawyer was not present at that time.)</p>

Moreover, in <em>DiPasquale, </em>the witness was called by the court, at the Commonwealth’s suggestion, after the Commonwealth decided not to call the witness after she had told them she would change her testimony. Thus, in <em>DiPasquale, </em>by cross-examining the recalcitrant witness, concerning the contents of her previous statement, the Commonwealth was attempting to introduce items into evidence which it knew it would not otherwise be able to introduce. In the instant case, on the other hand, the Commonwealth did not know that Berry would change his testimony until he took the stand.</p>
    <p id="b687-4" data-blocks='[["BL_687.4",687,[197,1175,1150,707]]]'>Moreover, I am of the opinion that, even if the court erred in granting the Commonwealth so much latitude in its cross-examination of Berry, under the standard established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Chapman v. California, </em><a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">386 U.S. 18</a> (1967), such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In view of the evidence in this case, particularly appellant’s full and detailed confession, the testimony of various eyewitnesses to the events occurring before and soon after the murder, and the discovery of the murder weapons at appellant’s place of residence, there can be no doubt that appellant would have been convicted even if Berry had not been called to the stand.</p>

Dancer, </em><a href="/pa/452/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="452 Pa. 221" data-case-ids="574824" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0221-01">452 Pa. 221</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20364" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="305 A.2d 364">305 A. 2d 364</a> (1973). In <em>Dancer, </em>the Commonwealth’s witness testified on direct examination that she could not see the stabbing because her line of vision was blocked. We held that this testimony did not justify permitting the Commonwealth to impeach its witness because it was not prejudicial or injurious to the Commonwealth’s case. In contrast, in the instant case, Berry, although he admittedly had an unobstructed view, specifically testified that he saw no knife on the appellant, testimony which clearly prejudiced the Commonwealth’s case because it could lead the jury to infer that, contrary to the Commonwealth’s contention, appellant had no knife.</p>
