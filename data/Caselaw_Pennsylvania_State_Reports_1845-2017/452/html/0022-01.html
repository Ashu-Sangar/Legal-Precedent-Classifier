No appeal was taken. In 1965, appellant filed pro se a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Original trial counsel was appointed by the court to represent the appellant. An order denying relief was affirmed on appeal. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Goldsmith v.

In 1970, appellant filed pro se a PCHA petition, claiming for the first time that he had not knowingly and voluntarily waived his appeal rights following his conviction in 1958. The public defender was appointed by the court to represent the appellant. The POHA hearing resulted in a finding that the appellant had not knowingly and voluntarily waived his right of appeal and, thus, appellant was permitted to file post-trial motions. These motions were filed by the public defender. Later, appellant’s original trial counsel was substituted for the public defender and argued the post-trial motions. Relief was denied and appellant, represented by original trial counsel, is now before us on direct appeal from his judgment of sentence.</p>

The difference is not material. A meaningful appellate review is impossible absent a full transcript or an equivalent picture of the trial proceedings.

Indeed, in appellant’s previous appeal, this Court assumed—and appellant did not contend otherwise—that the appellant had knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights to a direct appeal. For this reason the missing transcript did not entitle the appellant to any relief in his habeas corpus proceeding. If the appellant had waived his appeal rights in 1958, which we assumed in his first appeal, the missing transcript years later would be immaterial. An appellant who waives his appeal rights after trial cannot request relief years later in a collateral attack on the basis that he cannot obtain a transcript. That is why, in appellant’s first appeal, we said, “[sjince the [appellant] withdrew his motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment originally filed by him, and waited ten years before taking any action with regard to alleged deprivation of rights, he may not now use mere passage of time as an asserted basis of px*ejudice against him.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

The indigency of the appellant is irrelevant. Neither indigency nor the lack of indigency can deprive an appellant of his rights. Both must knowingly and voluntarily waive appeal rights.

Apparently, the Commonwealth’s theory is that the presence of trial counsel for appeal purposes is an adequate substitute for a full transcript or an equivalent picture. That theory, however, presupposes that an equivalent picture has been captured and retained by a photographic memory with which all trial counsel are endowed. It is true that new counsel on appeal must of necessity have a blank memory as far as trial proceedings are concerned. It does not follow, however, that trial counsel has a perfect memory. Without a transcript or equivalent picture, trial counsel can be just as severely handicapped as new counsel on appeal. Often, the significance of occurrences during the course of a trial cannot be perceived without the availability of a complete transcript. Even issues that may be recalled without the help of a transcript frequently cannot be properly assessed by trial counsel or a court without a transcript. Additionally, under the doctrine which permits appellate review of constitutional or fundamental error, even if there has been no objection during the trial, it is impossible, without a transcript, to present a full and meaningful appeal.</p>

As correctly noted in the Court’s opinion, appellant has not been deprived of a transcript through any fault of the Commonwealth. Rather, the untimely illness of the court reporter immediately following trial, his subsequent death, and the inability of any other reporter to read his shorthand notes com<a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>bined to limit the transcription to only 309 pages of testimony from the five-day trial. The Supreme Court of the United States, faced with a similar situation arising in an Illinois trial, i.e. unavailability of the trial transcript due to the death of the court reporter, held that Due Process and Equal Protection did not require the state to afford the defendant a new trial. <em>Norvell v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/373/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="373 U.S. 420" data-case-ids="11718610" data-case-paths="/us/373/0420-01">373 U.S. 420</a>, <a href="/us/373/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="373 U.S. 420" data-case-ids="11718610" data-case-paths="/us/373/0420-01">10 L. Ed. 2d 456</a> (1963). That case, in my view, is controlling here. Said the Supreme Court: “When through no fault of the State, transcripts of criminal trials are no longer available because of the death of the court reporter some practical accommodation must be made. . . . ‘The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations— illogical, it may be, and unscientific. . . . What is best is not always discernible; the wisdom of any choice may be disputed or condemned.’ The ‘rough accommodations’ made by government do not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment unless the lines drawn are ‘hostile or invidious.’ ” <em><a href="/us/373/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="373 U.S. 420" data-case-ids="11718610" data-case-paths="/us/373/0420-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/373/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="373 U.S. 420" data-case-ids="11718610" data-case-paths="/us/373/0420-01">at 424</a>; <a href="/us/373/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="373 U.S. 420" data-case-ids="11718610" data-case-paths="/us/373/0420-01">10 L.

Admittedly, the same presumption does not attach here. The Post Conviction Hearing court held that appellant had been denied his appellate rights because of fear of the imposition of the death penalty after retrial. See <em>Commonwealth v. Littlejohn, </em><a href="/pa/433/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="433 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1921080" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0336-01">433 Pa. 336</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=250%20A.2d%20811" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="250 A.2d 811">250 A. 2d 811</a> (1969).

In the present case, appellant can support his need for a transcript with only the baldest assertion that he recollects numerous trial errors, particularly in the court’s charge, none of which he specifies. It is not unwarranted to assume that such errors are alleged only because a transcript of that portion of the trial cannot be reproduced. In an analagous situation, the Supreme Court of the United States held that where a defendant’s grounds for error make out a <em>colorable need </em>for a complete transcript, the burden is on the state to show that something less will suffice. <em>Mayer v. Chicago, supra </em>at 195, 30 L. Ed. 2d at 378-9. To require in the instant case, where part of the transcript is unavailable through no fault of the state, the showing of a <em>colorable need </em>for the missing portion seems <em>to me </em>to be the type of “rough accommodation” sanctioned by <em>Norvell. </em>While avoiding the automatic release of those with spurious challenges, it affords those with meritorious claims the opportunity to vindicate their rights.</p>

In addition, it is customary for trial counsel to take at least rough notes of the proceedings, particularly of questionable passages in the charge of the trial court. Admittedly, these sources may not qualify as an equivalent picture for complete appellate review. <em>Commonwealth v. Anderson, supra. </em>I do not suggest, however, that appellant substantiate Ms claims of error by means of these sources, only that he demonstrate a colorable right to relief. His naked assertions fall short of this standard.</p>
