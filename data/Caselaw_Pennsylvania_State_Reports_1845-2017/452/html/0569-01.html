In May of 1968, trial proceeded on all bills except involuntary manslaughter. At the conclusion of the testimony, a demurrer was sustained as to carrying a concealed deadly weapon. The jury returned verdicts of guilty of first degree murder, conspiracy, both counts of aggravated robbery, and burglary. After post-trial motions were denied by a court en banc, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder charge and to concurrent terms of from ten to twenty years on the two aggravated robbery indictments; sentence was suspended on the conspiracy and burglary charges. This direct appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

At some point, one of the three men left the bar, leaving appellant and the third man talking to “Parks”. After about twenty minutes of conversation, the appellant suddenly pulled “Parks” forward by his shirt and shot him.</p>
    <p id="b665-3" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[159,878,1150,637]]]'>At that moment, a patron entered the bar. Appellant grabbed the patron by the arm, and, according to the testimony of Deborah White ripped a watch from the patron’s wrist. Appellant then ordered everyone to move to the rear of the bar into the ladies room. Everyone remained in the ladies room for five or ten minutes, after which they returned to the barroom to find that the appellant and his companion had disappeared, and that the cash register drawer was open, and empty. Eleven days later, on January 8, 1968, the appellant was arrested on a warrant at the home of his girl friend, Bertha Wilson.</p>

On April 24, 1968, appellant was arraigned without counsel and pled not guilty to charges of conspiracy, aggravated robbery (two counts), carrying a concealed deadly weapon, and burglary with intent to commit a felony. Counsel was appointed on June 10, 1968. On May 23, 1969, the appellant received a counseled arraignment in open court on the murder bill and pled not guilty. He argues that the April 24 arraignment on the non-homicide charges was fatally defective because he lacked counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. “It is central to [the prin<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>ciple of right to counsel] that in addition to counsel’s presence at trial, the accused is guaranteed that he will not stand alone against the State at any stage of the prosecution, formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel’s absence might derogate from the accused’s right to a fair trial.” <em>United States v. Wade, </em><a href="/us/388/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="388 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6168076" data-case-paths="/us/388/0218-01">388 U.S. 218</a>, 226 (1967). In keeping with that principle, our rules of criminal procedure provide that: “In all indictable cases, at the time of arraignment, if the defendant is without financial resources or otherwise unable to employ counsel, counsel shall be appointed by the court to represent him unless he intelligently and understanding^ elects to proceed without counsel and signs a written waiver of counsel.” Pa. R. Crim. P. 317 (c). This rule insures that if the accused is still unrepresented by the time of arraignment, an attorney will be appointed quickly to avoid the possibility of an uncounseled guilty plea, confession, or confrontation of witnesses.</p>
    <p id="b666-4" data-blocks='[["BL_666.4",666,[191,1358,1162,924]],["BL_667.1",667,[154,356,1147,98]]]'>In the case at bar, the accused appeared at the arraignment without counsel, signed the pauper’s oath (See Pa. R. Crim. P. 318A), and pled not guilty. Counsel was appointed shortly thereafter, before appellant’s ability to conduct a defense had suffered any prejudice whatsoever. This case is, therefore, clearly distinguishable from cases where the accused was permitted to plead guilty without representation. See, e.g., <em>White v. Maryland, </em><a href="/us/373/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="373 U.S. 59" data-case-ids="11716498" data-case-paths="/us/373/0059-01">373 U.S. 59</a> (1963) ; <em>Commonwealth v.

It is also distinguishable from cases where an uncounseled accused waived important rights or strategical opportunities. See, e.g., <em>Coleman v.

Mere, both the accused and Ms attorney were well aware of all of the charges at issue and the entry of the plea of not guilty at a time that he was not represented in no way adversely affect his defense. Had he been represented at that time it is obvious that the same plea would have been entered. We, therefore, fail to find any deprivation of dne process occurring during that proceeding. <em>Commonwealth v. Phelan, </em>supra. Cf., <em>Commonwealth v.

The appellant relies upon Rule 317(b*) adopted by the Board of Judges of Philadelphia County: “In all cases where the defendant or his attorney has been summoned at least ten days before . . . trial, arraignment <em>may </em>take place on the day of the trial.” (Emphasis supplied.) That rule is clearly discretionary. In this case, where the appellant had already received one valid arraignment, and where at the time of the arraignment in the murder bill counsel raised no request for a second arraignment on the non-homicide charges, the trial judge acted within his discretion in not requiring the defendant to be rearraigned on the non-homicide charges.</p>
    <p id="b668-4" data-blocks='[["BL_668.4",668,[207,1066,1158,757]]]'>The appellant further asserts that the jury was confused by the introduction into the case of charges that were not part of the May 23, in-court arraignment. We disagree. The reading of technical charges from an indictment does little to aid the jury’s understanding of the case. The arraignment is not designed to frame the legal issues for the jury. Rather, it is the judge’s charge at the conclusion of the evidence that fulfills that function. Often, as was the case here, a charge will be withdrawn from the jury’s consideration after the Commonwealth has presented its case. We will not assume, therefore, that the jury was confused based solely on an allegation that all charges were not read in their presence prior to trial.</p>
    <p id="b668-5" data-blocks='[["BL_668.5",668,[209,1834,1155,317]],["BL_669.1",669,[156,358,1149,701]]]'>To support the argument that confusion occurred, appellant points to the fact that juror number one when first questioned during the poll of the jury announced her verdict as guilty of murder. She immediately amended her statement to designate the verdict as murder in the first degree. To attempt to support a con<a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>elusion that the entire jury was confused because of the failure to arraign the appellant before them on the non-homicide charges from this obvious inadvertence on the part of one juror is absurd. Appellant also urges that the jury’s attempt to render a verdict on the voluntary manslaughter bill after the first degree murder verdict had already been recorded is farther evidence of its confusion. The record reveals no such attempt on the part of the jury. It shows only a dialogue between the Court and defense counsel as to whether that verdict should be announced and recorded. Again, we see no evidence of confusion on the part of the jury.</p>
    <p id="b669-3" data-blocks='[["BL_669.4",669,[157,1072,1149,318]]]'>Finally, appellant cites the fact that the jury returned requesting supplemental instructions on conspiracy and aggravated robbery as evidence of its confusion. Such requests are specifically authorized by Pa. R. Grim.

The record reveals the following colloquy: “Thu Court: You can do what you believe the facts indicate. I give you the law, the law is simply this, relating to the conspiracy, if you believe from the testimony that the defendant was acting in concert to [g] ether with the man who put his hand in the cash register, and the defendant killed the deceased, then the defendant is equally guilty of the robbery and this thus becomes a, felony murder, if you believe that testimony. Now, you have heard the testimony, and if you believe it, you are <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>justified, iu finding the defendant guilty of first degree murder, based on tbe felony degree murder ascertained to tbe cash register tbat were tbe tbe conspiracy as involved tbis defendant himself, according to testimony, put tbe gun to bis bead of another man and took bis wrist watch— The Foreman : Is tbat aggravated robbery? In other words, tbat would be tbe charge of tbat? The Court: Let me answer tbat question. You have tbe two counts of aggravated robbery against tbis defendant is tbe taking of tbe money out of tbe cash register. Tbe second count of aggravated robbery is tbe taking of a wristwatch, a man who has a gun to bis bead. The Foreman : I think tbat clears it up, sir. It seems to me— The Court: I don’t want a comment, just your questions. If you have any more questions, you ask them.” We note tbat tbe trial judge based his instructions on tbe only version of tbe facts presented, and be carefully prefaced those instructions by tbe phrase, “Now you have beard tbe testimony and <em>if </em>you believe it—.” Clearly, tbe judge did not invade tbe jury’s province to find tbe facts. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Archambault, </em><a href="/pa/448/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="448 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1944724" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0090-01">448 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%2072" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="290 A.2d 72">290 A. 2d 72</a> (1972).

A verdict of murder in the first degree is necessarily a rejection by the jury of a voluntary manslaughter claim, thus the voluntary manslaughter bill was superfluous.

We agree that such a procedure is unique and is discouraged because it allows the possibility that the jury’s verdict on the lesser charges will be improperly influenced by the broad range of evidence that is permitted at penalty hearings which is not properly before the <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>jury during the adjudicatory stage. If any evidence having a potentially prejudicial effect on the defendant had been presented at that hearing, a serious question as to the validity of the subsequent verdicts on the lesser charges would have been raised. Here, however, the prosecution offered no evidence at the penalty hearing since it was content with a life sentence. The only evidence presented at that hearing was very favorable to the appellant, showing Ms close family ties, his record of prior military service, favorable references from former employers, and the absence of a prior criminal record. Thus, the penalty hearing could only have aided appellant’s cause with regard to the other charges, and defense counsel wisely chose not to object to the procedure.</p>

Pearl Gilliam was subpoenaed and did appear in court, malring her equally available to the defense counsel if he desired her testimony.
