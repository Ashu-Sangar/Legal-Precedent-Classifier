    <p id="b315-4" data-blocks='[["BL_315.7",315,[152,622,1141,97]]]'>The Commonwealth’s evidence established the following facts:</p>
    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.8",315,[146,731,1150,636]]]'>At approximately 12:30 a.m. on the morning of October 23, 1971, Albert Tatum, brandishing a knife, entered the house of Suzv Hayes with the announced purpose of killing Elsie Turner, Mrs. Hayes aunt. Tatum, evidencing some degree of intoxication, searched about briefly for Mrs. Turner and when asked to leave, swung at the Hayes woman with his knife. At this point, Dancer, the appellant, who had been making repairs to a room of the house, armed himself with a knife and intervened, scuffling briefly with the victim. As the door was locked against him, Tatum said, “Mack you cut me” and “I’ll be back.”</p>
    <p id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.9",315,[144,1381,1148,368]]]'>About 2:30 a.m. Tatum’s body was discovered by the Lancaster police on the sidewalk about thirty yards from the Hayes’ house. Medical examination revealed he had been dead from one and a half to two hours, and death was caused by a single puncture wound in the left mid-thoracic region which resulted in massive hemorrhaging.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Therein, Dancer admitted the altercation with Tatum, saying that after the latter had thrust his knife at Mrs. Hayes, he [Dancer] “made a hit at him [Tatum] with my knife. I don’t know if he was hit or not, I did not stab Mm. I made a cutting motion with the knife. It <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>was all over then, he said, ‘I’ll be back.’ When he walked out the front door he said, ‘You cut me, I’ll get you.’ ”</p>

In support of his request for a new trial, appellant contends: (1) the lower court committed error in permitting the Commonwealth to impeach its own witness, Mrs. Hayes, by introducing on redirect examination a prior inconsistent statement; and (2) the court compounded this error by presenting the contents of the statement in its charge as substantive evidence.</p>
    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.5",316,[202,1004,1155,533]]]'>We need not reach the merits of the second contention. A study of the record discloses that no specific exception to the challenged instruction was made of record. More importantly, however, this alleged assignment of error was not raised in the motion for a new trial or at any time in the court below. Under such circumstances, this question may not be raised now. <em>Commonwealth v.

She said she saw Dancer make a stroking motion alongside decedent’s left leg but did not notice a knife in Dancer’s hand until after the door was shut against decedent. Asked by the district attorney whether she saw Dancer withdraw a knife from Tatum’s chest, the witness answered, “No, whatever happened was so fast. No I didn’t. No, I can’t say that I did.” Questioned whether a knife was anywhere near Tatum’s chest, Mrs. Hayes responded, “Not that I saw. Mack was between me and him. I was standing behind Mm and I don’t know what took <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>place when they went together. But I know that I saw the two of them go together.” She further testified that when the combatants drew apart, she thought she saw a spot of blood near the decedent’s stomach and heard Tatum say, “Mack you cut me.” The district attorney then asked Mrs. Hayes if her testimony was in any way different from statements made to the police who interviewed her on October 23rd. The witness said she could not remember what she had told the police but said that she didn’t think she had left anything out in her present account. On that note, direct testimony was ended.</p>
    <p id="b317-3" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[128,1004,1149,641]]]'>On redirect, Mrs. Hayes was asked if she had ever given a written statement to the police and she readily admitted doing so. Over defense counsel’s objection, the witness was then directed to read aloud the following portion of this statement: “At this time, everything happened so fast but I saw Albert and Mack Dancer come together and then I saw Mack pull his knife out of Albert’s chest and I saw blood on the knife.” Afterwards, Mrs. Hayes said: “I don’t remember making that statement.” It is contended permitting this cross-examination and impeachment of Mrs. Hayes was prejudicial error.</p>

In all the cited cases, however, the witness sought to be cross-examined had made statements at trial which were directly contradictory to statements the witness had made earlier, and the in-court testimony, if believed, was such as to aid the opposing party. ‘On the other hand, our courts have been loath to allow cross-examination for purposes of impeachment by use of prior statements when a witness states that he does not know or that he cannot remember. This is so for the reason that such an in-court declaration does not harm the calling party nor aid the opposing party, [citations omitted] Hence, when a witness claims he does not know or cannot remember, the prior statements should not be introduced because of the danger that the prior statements will be considered as substantive evidence by the jury.’ ” <a href="/pa/443/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="443 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1936904" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0412-01">443 Pa. at 414-15</a>.

Tatum’s body was found at about 2:30 a.m. on the sidewalk thirty yards from the spot where the fight took place. The deputy coroner estimated death had occurred one and a half to two hours earlier.

The <em>only </em>evidence of trauma to the body was the single puncture wound of the chest caused by a sharp instrument.

Even if we accept the Hayes statement as substantive affirmative proof, her statement <em>does not </em>establish murder. According to the majority, Suzy Hayes said “At this time, everything happened so fast but I saw [the victim] and [the appellant] come together and then I saw [the appellant] pull his knife out of [the victim’s] chest and I saw blood on the knife.” That statement in the context of the other <em>uncontradicted testimony </em>still leaves a very serious doubt as to whether murder occurred. The other <em>uncontradicted testimony </em>is that the victim entered the home of Suzy Hayes with the <em>announced purpose </em>of killing the aunt of Suzy Hayes. The victim, according to the majority, evidenced some degree of intoxication searched about briefly for the aunt and when asked to leave, swung at Suzy Hayes with Ms knife. At this point, the appellant, who had been making repairs to a room of the house, armed himself with a knife and intervened, scuffling briefly with the victim. According to the facts of the majority, which were not contradicted, the appellant intervened to stop a man who was <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>brandishing a knife and swung it at another human being in the home of that other human being, Suzy Hayes. A more classic example of justifiable homicide by reason of defense of person could not be found. The alleged prior inconsistent statement of Suzy Hayes only corroborates the other evidence that the appellant stabbed the victim <em>in defense of a human being. </em>The appellant was working in the home of Suzy Hayes when the victim showed up intoxicated with an announced intention to kill and swinging a knife. Six children were asleep in the home at the time the aggressor arrived. The appellant came to the aid of Suzy Hayes which can only be described as an heroic act in the face of the knife being brandished and swung by the victim. In the ensuing scuffle which “happened so fast”, according to the relied-on prior inconsistent statement, the appellant stabbed the victim. What evidence is there that the appellant did not act as a completely reasonable man? If anything, the appellant acted with a heroism in defense of another human being. It was the Mnd of heroism that we don’t expect from everybody, but for which the appellant should be given a medal and not sent to jail for murder.</p>

I cannot so conclude. The error pointed out by the majority was not harmless.</p>
