S. Route 422, a four-lane highway in Patton Township, Centre County. At the same time, defendant Ritsky, driving his own automobile, pulled onto the highway from a “Dairy Queen” parking lot on the easterly side of the highway. Ritsky’s car and Flickinger’s motorcycle collided, resulting in the death of the cyclist. A week prior to this occurrence, defendant-appellee Marona Construction Company [hereinafter “Marona”] had, in the course of laying a sanitary sewer line, piled dirt from the sewer excavation onto the berm of the highway. The dirt pile was located 138 feet south of the point at which Ritsky exited from the parking lot and in the direction from which Flicldnger approached the point of collision.</p>

The Eestatement (Second) of Torts §453 (1965) (Comment b) makes quite clear this division of responsibility as between court and jury: “If, however, the negligent character of the third person’s intervening act or the reasonable foreseeability of its being done is a factor in determining whether the intervening act relieves the actor from liability of his antecedent negligence, and under the undisputed facts there is room for reasonable difference of opinion as to whether such act was negligent or foreseeable, the question should be left to the jury.” See also <em>Bleman v. </em>Gold, <a href="/pa/431/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="431 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1917370" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0348-01">431 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=246%20A.2d%20376" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="246 A.2d 376">246 A. 2d 376</a> (1968).</p>

At the same time it is necessary to recognize that normally such situations present essentially factual questions under the principles of section 447 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, and that where reasonable minds could differ, resolution of such questions is properly left to the jury.</p>

Prosser, Law of Torts §49, at 286 (1964); this Court will no longer attempt to solve questions of proximate causation by resort to the label “passive”. As Professor Prosser puts it, “it is not the distinction between 'cause’ and 'condition’ which is important, but the <em>nature of the risk </em>and the <em>character of the intervening cause”.

While conscious of the dirt, there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that he was <em>aware of the risk </em>created by the dirt.
