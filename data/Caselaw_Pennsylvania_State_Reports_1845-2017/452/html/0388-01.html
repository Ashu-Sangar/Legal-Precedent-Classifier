      <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>Tlie orphans’ court held that paragraph seventh did not prohibit sale of the 1 <em>y2 </em>acres and, thus, court approval was not required as provided in the Act of April 18, 1949, P.

The court reasoned that since the lessee released his interest in the <em>V/&gt; </em>acres, the lease was no longer “operative” as to that parcel. Therefore, the court concluded, the trustee had authority, under her general powers, to sell the property, despite paragraph seventh’s prohibition.</p>
    <p id="b485-4" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[139,892,1150,424]]]'>We are unable to agree with this determination. The court properly stated: “Decedent ivas obviously aware that if the trustee was to offer the real estate for sale, the option of the lessee would be thereby activated, in which case the lessee would have the right to buy the valuable asset for only f40,000. <em>The restriction in the will was therefore to avoid activating lessee’s option.” </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>

Here, the trust received only one-fourth the value of the land. The remaining amount was paid to the lessee for release of his interest in the 1%-acre portion of the property. Paragraph seventh was clearly designed to avoid such a result. We must conclude that the will prohibits sale of any of the <em>22 </em>acres while the lease remains “operative” as to any portion of the property. To hold otherwise would divert the major portion of the proceeds of the sale from the trust to the lessee— as payment for his release—and, thus, defeat decedent’s testamentary intention and scheme of distribution.</p>
