Adjacent to the Harmar Mine is the abandoned Indi anola Mine. Although a coal barrier separates the two <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>mines, the accumulation of water in the Indianola Mine threatens the Harmar Mine and the safety of its miners: the accumulating water might create sufficient hydrostatic pressure against the barrier to cause it to give way and flood the Harmar Mine. In order to make its mine safe for operation, Harmar must pump 6.48 million gallons per day of untreated acid mine drainage<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> from the Indianola Mine and discharge it into the Deer Creek, a tributary of the Allegheny River. Pittsburgh’s Hutchinson Mine is the last operating deep mine in a large coal basin. As a result of ground water accumulating in the abandoned mines, a large underground pool has formed in the basin. A barrier of coal separating the Hutchinson mine from the adjacent mines in the basin is unable to protect the Hutchinson Mine from intruding fugitive water as it travels to gravity discharges. In order to operate the mine Pittsburgh must discharge 3.44 million gallons per day of acid mine drainage—including the 2.17 million gallons that finds it way into the Hutchinson Mine from the basin. In its application for a permit Pittsburgh proposed to treat only the 1.27 million gallons per day of acid mine drainage originating in the Hutchinson Mine. Both Pittsburgh and Harmar admit that the discharge contains iron and acid concentrations in excess of the maximum established by the Board.</p>

Prior to the enactment of the original Clean Streams Law (the Act of June 22, 1937, P. L. 1987), acid mine drainage had been specifically excluded from pollution control. (Purity of Waters Act of April 22, 1905, P. L. 260, §4, and the Act of June 14, 1923, P. L. 793, §1). Section 310 of the 1937 Act dealt specifically with acid mine drainage as follows : “The provisions of this article shall not apply to acid mine drainage and silt from coal mines <em>until such time as, in the opinion of the Sanitary Water Board, practical means for the removal of the polluting properties of such drainage shall become known ” </em>(Emphasis added.) In the 1945 Amendments Section 310 was <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>modified by requiring the Board to protect certain clean waters by regulation, but permitted the continuing pollution of already polluted waters.

In denying the applications of Pittsburgh and Harmar the Board applied Section 315 broadly in order to give effect to the “Findings and Declarations of Policy” in Section 4. In <em>Harmar </em>Coal, the Board concluded that it could regulate the discharge from the Indianola Mine since it was the operation of the Harmar Mine which resulted in the Indianola discharge. The Board read “discharge from the mine” to refer to “all drainage which flows out of, or is affected by the mining operation.” Similarly in <em>Pittsburgh </em>Coal, the Board read “discharge from the <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>mine” to encompass “drainage caused by whatever source,” and found that Pittsburgh had not demonstrated that the discharge of the fugitive water would not cause “pollution” to the “waters of the Commonwealth.”</p>

In reversing the Board’s order, the Court held that the underground pool already “unclean” with “noxious and deleterious substances” was not intended to be termed as a “noxious and deleterious substance” itself, so as to be classified “pollution” as defined in Section 1 of the 1965 form of the Clean Streams Law. The intent of the Clean Streams Law was that “pollution occurs when noxious and deleterious substances are <em>first </em>discharged into any of the ‘waters of the Commonwealth,’ ” 4 Pa.

The Court also held that Pittsburgh was not responsible for all discharges “caused by whatever source,” and that, although the Clean Streams Law is concerned with the discharge of “industrial waste,” which is defined in Section 1 of the 1965 and 1970 Amendments as including “mine drainage,” the polluted water finding its way into the Hutchinson Mine and subsequently discharged into the surface waters was neither mine drainage nor any other type of industrial waste within the meaning of the Clean Streams Law.</p>

The pumping of the mine drainage from the Indianola Mine is essential to the safe operation of the Harmar Mine and is, therefore, a vital part of the complete drainage plan. Harmar indicated that it considered this pumping part of its operation when it applied for the permit. We do not believe that the Legislature intended Section 315 to apply only to discharges from the mine being worked when the same section requires the Board’s approval of “complete drainage plans.” Moreover, we agree with the dissenters below that the initial words of Section 315, “Before <em>miy </em>coal mine. .

Nothing in the Clean Streams Law justifies the Court’s holding that pollution occurs <em>only </em>when polluting substances are <em>“first </em>discharged into <em>any </em>‘waters of the Commonwealth,’ ” in this case the underground pool. Appellant argues, and we agree, that the critical and principal illegal conduct under the Clean Streams Law is the discharge into the surface waters. The Court below, however, failed to distinguish between pollution of waters, created by min<a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>ing, which remain underground and those waters which are discharged to the surface. In the Clean Streams Law and the Rules and Regulations thereunder, this distinction is crystal clear. Section 315 of the 1965 Amendments states that a permit would not be issued if in the Board’s opinion the discharge from the mine would endanger the “public health, animal or aquatic life, or . . . the use of the water for domestic or industrial consumption or recreation.” In the 1970 Amendments this language was deleted. Section 315 now prohibits discharges from mines unless the discharge is authorized by the Board’s Rules and Regulations or the mine operator has first obtained a permit.

The pH of discharges of mine drainage shall be maintained between 6.0 and 9.0.” The latter was adopted by the Board only after the holding of a public hearing and reviewing treatment facility experiments conducted by the Department of Mines and Mineral Industries. The Board determined that the effluent standard, taking into consideration dilution by the receiving stream, would protect the beneficial uses of the receiving stream, and is within the capability of the industry, both technologically and financially. Harmar’s <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>own data submitted to the Department of Health revealed that the iron concentration of the mine drainage discharged from the Indianola Mine was at times as great as 56 milligrams per liter, clearly in excess of the standards set forth in Section 6(B) of Article 900. Harmar does not attack the reasonableness of the regulation, but rather asks that we substitute our judgment, by requiring an aquatic study, for that of a body selected for its expertise whose experience makes it better qualified than a court to establish technical standards. This we will not do. In the absence of a purely arbitrary exercise of an agency’s duties or functions <em>“judicial </em>discretion may not be substituted for <em>administrative </em>discretion.” <em>Blumenschein v.

Section 315 in both the 1965 and 1970 Amendments unambiguously uses the phrase “discharge from [the] mine.” A strong indication that the Legislature intended the Act to apply to all discharges is found in the introduction to the 1965 Amendments where the Clean Streams Law was described as <em>“[a\n act . </em>. . <em>extending and increasing penalties for the discharge of any industrial waste into the waters of the Common</em>wealthIt is evident from the Commonwealth’s statement of policy in Section 4 of the 1965 Amendments, that no less than total treatment would be tolerated: <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>to repeat, Section 4 in part provides that: “It is the objective of the Clean Streams Law not only to prevent further pollution of the waters of the Commonwealth but, also <em>to reclaim and restore to a clean, unpolluted condition every stream in Pennsylvania that is presently polluted. </em>. . <em>.” </em>(Emphasis added.) In order to prevent further pollution and to reclaim and restore those surface waters presently polluted, <em>any </em>polluting discharge essential to the operation of a mine must be treated. If the operator of a mine need not treat these discharges, pollution will not end and the general public will be subjected to either the continued degradation of its surface waters or be forced to subsidize the coal industry by paying for treatment of this polluted water through its taxes. We are supported in our view by the statutory presumption “that the legislature intends to favor the public interest as against any private interest.” Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1987, P. L. 1019, §52, 46 P.S. §552. <em>See Commonwealth ex rel. Shumaker v.

The public interest is not served if the public, rather than the mine operator, has to bear the expense of abating pollution caused as a direct result of the profit-making, resource-depleting business of mining coal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>
