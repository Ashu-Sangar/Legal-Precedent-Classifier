The child testified she ran away from the Blair County Child Welfare Center, where she had been committed by the juvenile court, and for several days lived in a trailer with several men, one of whom was the appellant. She further testified that appellant and others had sexual relations with her and served her beer. Appellant denied most of the young girl’s testimony. However, he did acknowledge that the child remained at the trailer overnight and that he made no effort to get her to leave or to inform the proper authorities when they came to the trailer looking for her. Other witnesses also testified that the child did stay at the trailer overnight. The jury may have disbelieved the young girl’s story regarding the beer and the sexual relations, but was convinced that the girl had stayed overnight at the trailer.

      <p id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.6",478,[211,1891,1156,439]]]'> A careful reading of <em>Stroik </em>reveals that the Superior Court did not hold that the mere failure of a person to report a minor whom he knew to be a runaway truant was, by itself, insufficient to warrant a conviction. The Superior Court in <em>Stroik </em>never had to reach this question, because the court was presented with a record establishing <em>additional acts </em>by the defendant, which, together, clearly contributed to the minor’s delinquency. What the Superior <em>Court </em>said in <em>Stroik </em>was that <em>perhaps </em>each of the acts in question, individually, <em>might not </em>have been sufficient to constitute a violation of the statute.</p>
