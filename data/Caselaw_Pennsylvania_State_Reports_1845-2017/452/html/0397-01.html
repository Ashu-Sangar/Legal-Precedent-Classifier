Appellant, a 17-year-old at (he time of his trial,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> maintains that he was denied equal protection of the laws because section 9 of the Act of May 11, 1925 prohibited persons under 21 years of age from being called in the venire in Allegheny County, whereas in other counties of the Commonwealth persons between 18 and 21 were eligible to serve as jurors subsequent to the adoption of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment. Essentially appellant is attacking the jury selection system in Allegheny County in effect at the time of his trial. He contends the system was constitutionally defective because eligibility for jury service varied with the class of county. Appellant asserts that because in other counties prospective jurors were <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>only required to be “qualified electors”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> tbe 21-year-old requirement in Allegheny County was unconstitutional after tbe adoption of tbe Twenty-Sixth Amendment, on July 5, 1971.</p>

First of all, the Commonwealth argues, and we agree, that the right to vote does not necessarily confer the right to sit on a jury. Recently the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York responding to a similar jury challenge arrived at the same conclusion. “There is simply no justification for defendant’s claim that merely because 18-to-21-year-olds have been given the right to vote, the Constitution compels that they be given the right to serve on juries. The right to vote and the right to sit in judgment of others have certain fundamental differences which cannot be overlooked. The act of voting is a personal expression of favor or disfavor for particular policies, personalities, or laws. The voter is motivated by his personal self-interest, or what he considers best for the general populace.</p>
