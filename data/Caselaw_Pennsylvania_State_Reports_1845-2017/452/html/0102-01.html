Following an adjudication of guilt, she was placed on three years probation on the charge of aggravated assault and battery, and sentence was suspended on the charge of wantonly pointing a firearm. In June of 1970, Miss Kates was again arrested, this time for homicide, and on July 16, 1970, a revocation of probation hearing was conducted. Primarily on the basis of an incriminating statement attributed to the appellant, the hearing judge found that she had shot and killed Frank Jordan. Her three year probation was revoked and she was sentenced to three years in the State Correctional Institution at Muncy, which was subsequently reduced to twenty-three and one-half months. Appellant did not testify at this hearing.</p>

At the hearing, a police officer testified that he saw the appellant struggling with a young lady, pulling her in one direction while she was pulling away from him, and that as soon as the police car approached the girl came over to it and appellant quickly walked away. Appellant was advised by counsel not to testify at the hearing since his testimony there might prejudice him at his subsequent trial on the criminal charges.</p>

The most recent provision is the Act of August 6,1941, P. L. 861, §25, 61 P.S. §331.25, which provides: “Whenever any person shall be found guilty of any criminal offense by verdict of a jury, plea, or otherwise, except murder in the first degree, in any court of this Commonwealth, the court shall have the power, in its discretion, if it believes the character of the person and the circumstances of the case to be such that he is not likely again to engage in a course of criminal conduct and that the public good does not demand or require the imposition of a sentence to imprisonment, instead of imposing such sentence, to place the person on probation for such definite period as the court shall direct, not exceeding the maximum period of imprisonment allowed by law for the offense for which such sentence might be imposed.” The earlier acts were the Act of June 19, 1911, P. L. 1055, §1, <em>as amended, </em>19 P.S. §1051, and the Act of May 10, 1909, P. L. 495, §1, 19 P.S. §1081.

No such condition for the payment of money shall be considered as the imposition of a fine or a sentence nor prevent the court from thereafter sentencing any defendant under the act under which he or she was convicted, upon violation of his or her parole.”</p>

Section 1 restricts the imposition of probation to one who has been convicted of crimes other than murder, administering poison, kidnapping, incest, sodomy, buggery, rape, assault and battery with the intent to ravish, arson, robbery or burglary. Section 25 only excludes one convicted of murder in the first <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>degree from receiving the benefits of its provisions.

We disagree with the trial judge who concluded that since the Act of 1941 did not provide for revocation that there was no statutory provision for revocation of a probation imposed under section 25. As has been stated before, in draft<a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>ing the Act of 1941 the legislature was concerned with the powers and duties of the Board and only referred to probation because it wished to provide the court with the election to place the supervision within the control of the Board. However, there being no change intended in the power to revoke probation where a violation had occurred, there was no need for additional legislation and the power remained as provided by the Act of 1911. We therefore hold that section 4 of the Act of 1911<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> controls revocations whether the probation was entered under the authority of the Act 1911 or the Act of 1941.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Section 4 provides: “Whenever a person placed on probation, as aforesaid, shall violate the terms of his or her probation, he or she shall be subject to arrest in the same manner as in the case of an escaped convict; and shall be brought before the court which released him or her on probation, which court may thereupon pronounce upon such defendant such sentence as may be prescribed by law, to begin at such time as the court may direct.” From this review of the applicable statutes it is clear that there is no statutory restriction in this State that would prevent the court from holding a hearing where the alleged violation is the commission of an offense during the probationary period prior to the trial for the subsequent offense.</p>

The constitutional argument is based on an alleged “unjustifiable tension” that this procedure supposedly creates between the right against self-incrimination and the right of due process. Appellants rely heavily on <em>Simmons v. United States, </em><a href="/us/390/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="390 U.S. 377" data-case-ids="6170914" data-case-paths="/us/390/0377-01">390 U.S. 377</a> (1968), which they consider analogous to the cases before us. In <em>Simmons, </em>the defendant, Garrett, was placed in the dilemma of electing to assert a Fourth Amendment claim under the pain of losing a Fifth Amendment right. The testimony necessary to establish this standing to assert the Fourth Amendment claim was an admission of an element of the crime necessary to establish guilt which might not have otherwise been proven. In that case, the Supreme Court reasoned “Those courts which have allowed the admission of testimony given to establish standing have reasoned that there is no violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Self-Incrimination Clause because the testimony was voluntary. As an abstract matter, this may well be true. A defendant is ‘compelled’ to testify in support of a motion to suppress only in the sense that if he refrains from testifying he will have to forgo a benefit, and testimony is not always involuntary as a matter of law simply because it is given to obtain a benefit. However, the assumption which underlies this reasoning is that the defendant has a choice: he may refuse to testify and give up the benefit. When this assumption is applied to a situation in which the ‘benefit’ to be gained is that afforded by another provision of the Bill of Bights, an undeniable tension is created.” <a href="/us/390/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="390 U.S. 377" data-case-ids="6170914" data-case-paths="/us/390/0377-01">390 U.S. at 393-94</a> (footnotes omitted).</p>

      <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>We are not persuaded by this argument for two reasons. First, we are not convinced that <em>Simmons </em>is analogous to the appeals presently before us. In <em>Simmons, </em>the defendant did in fact testify during the suppression hearing, the testimony was in fact incriminatory, and the court did permit that testimony to be used against him in the subsequent trial. In the cases of <em>Commonwealth v. Kates </em>and <em>Commonwealth v. McClellan, </em>the appellants elected to rely upon their Fifth Amendment rights and were permitted to do so. In the case of <em>Allen v. Reed, </em>the proceedings were interrupted before the violation hearing was held. Thus, in the appeals before us, the record is barren of any incriminatory statements which could in fact be used against these appellants at the subsequent trial. Also, in this situation it is difficult to conceive of any testimony that may have been helpful during the violation hearing that would be incriminating at the time of trial. The position of the appellants in the instant case is tantamount to a request that we attempt to speculate as to what may have occurred if the appellants had elected to testify and their testimony was introduced against them at the subsequent proceeding. We have held in many cases that we will not attempt to resolve constitutional issues unless the specific issue is before the court and the resolution of the issue is absolutely necessary to the decision of the case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

California, </em><a href="/us/402/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="402 U.S. 183" data-case-ids="11733438" data-case-paths="/us/402/0183-01">402 U.S. 183</a>, 212-13 (1971) : “While we have no occa<a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>sion to question the soundness of the result in Simmons and do not do so, to the extent that its rationale was based on a ‘tension’ between constitutional rights and the policies behind them, the validity of that reasoning must now be regarded as open to question, and it certainly cannot be given the broad thrust which is attributed to it by Crampton in the present case. The criminal process, like the rest of the legal system, is replete with situations requiring ‘the making of difficult judgments’ as to which course to follow. McMann v. Bichardson, 397 U.S., at 769, 25 L. Ed. 2d, at 772. Although a defendant may have a right, even of constitutional dimensions, to follow whichever course he chooses, the Constitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose. The threshold question is whether compelling the election impairs to an appreciable extent any of the policies behind the rights involved.”</p>

      <em>McG-autha </em>makes it clear that the constitution does does not eliminate the making of difficult judgments.

This argument assumes that the issues in the two proceedings are identical. We do not agree. At the subsequent trial the issue is whether the elements of the offense or offenses charged are present and the burden is upon the Commonwealth to establish all of the requisite elements beyond a reasonable doubt. The focus of a probation violation hearing, even though prompted by a subsequent arrest, is <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>whether the conduct of the probationer indicates that the probation has proven to be an effective vehicle to accomplish rehabilitation and a sufficient deterrent against future antisocial conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

However, we believe that the possibility of duplicating effort is far outweighed by other policies which dictate that the court’s right to adjudicate a parole violation prior to the subsequent trial should not be curtailed. This is true because the basic objective of probation is to provide a means to achieve rehabilitation without resorting to incarceration. When it becomes apparent that the probationary order is not serving this desired end the court’s discretion to impose a more appropriate sanction should not be fettered. Initially, when the court decides to impose a probation order it is only after first balancing the interest of society in protecting against possible future criminal behavior of the individual with the benefit he would receive by remaining free from prison.

Although the revocation order was based partly upon a finding that the appellant was guilty of a hit-run violation, a charge for which he was not prosecuted in the state court, the Court of Appeals also noted that the order was based in part on charges which were then pending in the state court, and of which appellant was later acquitted.

    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[146,1584,1149,434]]]'>The majority, in effect, deprives a person on probation of constitutional protections which are not taken away from <em>any person </em>by the Pennsylvania Constitution or the federal Constitution and which have not been taken away by the legislature from persons on parole. The majority’s attempt to take away the normal constitutional protections from persons on probation has no support except “silent statutes.”</p>

A person is presumed innocent of criminal conduct until proven guilty in a criminal trial. The presumption of innocence even applies to a prisoner <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>accused of a crime while serving his term. An incarcerated person cannot be given any additional imprisonment time because <em>he is accused of crime. </em>No penalty of any kind can be imposed on such incarcerated person until a criminal trial is held. A person who is convicted of a crime and <em>has not been incarcerated </em>should not have less rights.</p>

The majority concludes that persons <em>acquitted </em>of a crime can nonetheless suffer a penalty because of the very crime of which they have been acquitted. Such a result is illogical and unconstitutional. In the criminal <em>trial, </em>the defendant is acquitted but in the probation revocation <em>trial, </em>the defendant is guilty.

A statement obtained in violation of a person’s constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and under Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution cannot be used for any <em>affirmative </em>purpose by the government. <em>Harris v. New York, </em><a href="/us/401/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="401 U.S. 222" data-case-ids="11712077" data-case-paths="/us/401/0222-01">401 U.S. 222</a>, <a href="/us/401/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="401 U.S. 222" data-case-ids="11712077" data-case-paths="/us/401/0222-01">28 L.

In this case the unconstitutionally obtained statement was used in a positive way by the government. Even in <em>Harris, </em>which permitted the government to use such a statement as a shield, the court was emphatic that the <em>affirmative </em>use of such a <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>statement is prohibited.

    <p id="b221-3" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[143,1033,1152,1164]]]'>In the appeal of Oleo McClellan, another unfairness, of the practice condoned by the majority, becomes apparent. The defendant while on probation for an eight-year period, allegedly committed the crime of assault and battery <em>and </em>the crime of assault and battery with intent to rape. After a probation hearing and while the defendant was still presumed innocent, his probation was revoked and a sentence imposed of three to ten years’ imprisonment. Subsequently in the criminal trial, the defendant Avas <em>acquitted </em>of the higher offense of assault with intent to rape, although he was convicted of the lesser crime of assault and battery. Can it be said that the imposition of the prison term of three to ten years was not imposed in part because of a finding of <em>guilt </em>at the <em>probation trial </em>even though the defendant was subsequently acquitted, of the crime of assault and battery with intent to rape? The unfairness is obvious. In the McClellan appeal the order revoking probation should be reversed and the matter remanded for reconsideration in light of the appellant’s acquittal of the more serious charge.</p>
