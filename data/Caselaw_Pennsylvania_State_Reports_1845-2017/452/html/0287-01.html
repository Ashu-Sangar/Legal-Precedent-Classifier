As one authority has pointed out “[t]here is nearly complete agreement that book value does not accurately represent the fair value of the corporate assets.” Note, 79 Harv. L. Rev., supra, at 1457. This is so for the reason that the balance sheet usually lists assets at original cost, which may differ greatly from present useable value or the present cost of equivalent assets. Normally, the total assets are worth more than the sum of their parts, because they include qualities useful in the context of a particular business that they would lose if put to different uses. In <em>Borg. v. International Silver Co., </em><a href="/f2d/11/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="11 F.2d 147" data-case-ids="1649425" data-case-paths="/f2d/11/0147-01">11 F. 2d 147</a>, 152 (2d Cir. 1925), the court cautioned, “The suggestion that the book value of the shares is any measure of their actual value is clearly fallacious. It presupposes, first, that book values can be realized on liquidation, which is practically never the case; and second, that liquidation values are a measure of present values. Every one knows that the value of shares in a commercial or <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>manufacturing company depends chiefly on what they will earn, on which balance sheets throw little light.”</p>

Hence, the fair market value of the stock is $113.50.</p>
    <p id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.5",389,[118,888,1150,426]]]'>We also conclude the lower court erred in declining to award appellant interest and costs.

L. Rev., supra, at 1472.</p>

The difference between the corporation’s offer and the trial judge’s undiscounted appraisal is |16,292.52.

It must, however, to use the words of a legal decision, be broad enough to ‘. . . cover a sufficient period to show the settled condition of things.’ ” See also Volume 1, Bonbright, Valuation of Property, p. 253 (1st ed. 1937), where the author states: “There is still an agreement among writers that a capitalization of average earnings over a period of 3 to 5 years (occasionally 10 to 15 years) is preferable in most cases, to a capitalization of the earnings of any single year.” While our research disclosed no cases on point in this jurisdiction, the Delaware Chancery Court has held it error to use only the two years prior to appraisal, <em>Adams v.
