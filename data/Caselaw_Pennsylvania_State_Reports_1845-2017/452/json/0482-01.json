        "text": "Opinion op\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nOn March 7, 1973, appellants, Alessandroni, Brereton, Cohen, Stevens, Jr., Sweeney, and Sylvester\u2014 assistant district attorneys in the City of Philadelphia \u2014became candidates for nomination for judge of the court of common pleas for the May, 1973, primary. Appellant Lundy, also an assistant district attorney, became a candidate for nomination for judge of the municipal court.\nOn the following day, Martin Weinberg, City Solicitor, directed the Finance Director, appellee Lennox Moat, to withhold appellants\u2019 pay. In Formal Opinion No. 343, the City Solicitor explained that assistant district attorneys are city employees and, as such, are subject to Section 10-107(5) of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter. That section provides: \u201cNo officer or employee of the City, except elected officers running for re-election shall be a candidate for nomination or election to any public office unless he shall have first resigned from his then office or employment.\u201d Pursuant to the City Solicitor\u2019s direction, appellee withheld appellants\u2019 compensation.\nAppellants filed a complaint in mandamus seeking an order declaring appellants the rightful holders of positions as assistant district attorneys and requiring appellee to compensate them. On March 27, 1973, the complaint was dismissed. This appeal followed and we now affirm.\nI.\nInitially, appellants contend that they are \u201cquasi-judicial state officers\u201d, and, thus, not affected by Section 10-107(5) of the Home Rule Charter which applies only to officers and employees of the City of Philadelphia. While on prior occasions this Court has discussed the applicability of the Charter to the district attorney, we have not previously been confronted with the status of assistant district attorneys. Indeed, on one occasion it was said: \u201cIn the present case, we do not mean to or need to intimate a view as to whether employees of the District Attorney\u2019s office are subject to the civil service provisions of the Charter, since that issue is completely distinct from the question as to whether the Charter affects the duties and functions of the district attorney.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v. Freed, 424 Pa. 503, 516 n.7, 228 A. 2d 382, 386 n.7 (1967). Cf. Schultz v. Philadelphia, 385 Pa. 79, 122 A. 2d 279 (1956).\nAppellants maintain that since they perform functions primarily on behalf of the Commonwealth, they should be classified as state employees, rather than employees of the City of Philadelphia. See Lennox v. Clark, 372 Pa. 355, 93 A. 2d 834 (1953). We are unable to agree with this contention. The function an employee performs is only one factor in determining whether that individual is a City employee within the meaning of the Charter.\nCertainly, it could not be argued that the Mayor is a state officer merely because he has the duty to \u201ccause the ordinances of the city and the laws of the State to be executed and enforced.\u201d Act of June 25, 1919, P. L. 581, art. II, \u00a76, 53 P.S. \u00a712127 (emphasis added). As the City Solicitor properly noted in Formal Opinion No. 343:\n\u201cMany officials perform state functions. The Sheriff of Philadelphia performs duties solely on behalf of the courts of Philadelphia County, whose judges are officers of the Courts. See Dwyer v. Dilworth, 392 Pa. 123 (1958). The Police Commissioner of the City of Philadelphia enforces the criminal laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Under the Home Rule Charter Section 440(d), the City Solicitor is empowered.\n\u201c \u2018With the approval of the Mayor, ... (to) ... investigate any violation within the City of the statutes of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the ordinances of the City which may come to its notice, and shall take such steps and adopt such means as may be reasonably necessary to enforce within the City such statutes and ordinances.\u2019 \u201d\nOther indicia of employment lead us to conclude that assistant district attorneys are City employees and subject to the provisions of the Charter. The City Council of Philadelphia, for example, fixes the number of assistant district attorneys, as well as their salaries. The operating budget for fiscal year 1974 reveals that the District Attorney \u201cDepartment\u201d has been alloted, by City Council, over $2,300,000 to pay the more than 140 assistant district attorneys. Additionally, the Council has budgeted over $1,100,000 for other office personnel and more than $250,000 for materials, supplies, equipment, and purchase of services. It would be anomalous, indeed, to conclude\u2014as appellants urge\u2014that, although the City establishes the number of assistant district attorneys and fixes their salaries, the assistants are not employees of the City of Philadelphia.\nIn reaching our determination that appellants are City employees, we are also persuaded by the fact that assistant district attorneys are included in the City\u2019s pension plan. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the Philadelphia Code \u00a720-207 specifically exempts \u201call assistant district attorneys ... from the civil service.\u201d Obviously, the Philadelphia Code would not include within its provisions references to those who are not City employees. In view of these circumstances, we are persuaded that assistant district attorneys are City employees within the meaning of Section 10-107(5) of the Home Rule Charter.\nII.\nAppellants further urge that the prohibition against political candidacy for public office\u2014expressed in Section 10-107(5)\u2014is an unconstitutional infringement upon their First Amendment rights.\nManifestly, appellants are correct in their assertion that freedom of political expression and activity is embodied in the First Amendment. As the United States Supreme Court said in Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250, 77 S. Ct. 1203, 1212 (1957) : \u201cEqually manifest as a fundamental principle of a democratic society is political freedom of the individual. Our form of government is built on the premise that every citizen shall have the right to engage in political expression and association. This right was enshrined in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. Exercise of these basic freedoms in America has traditionally been through the media of political associations.\u201d\nSo, too, it is now beyond cavil that public employees may not be denied constitutional lights on the theory that public employment is a privilege, not a right. \u201c \u2018[T]he theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.\u2019 \u201d Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 1734 (1968) (quoting from Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 605-06, 87 S. Ct. 675, 685 (1967)). Accord, Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 81 S. Ct. 247 (1960); Slochower v. Board of Higher Education, 350 U.S. 551, 76 S. Ct. 637 (1956); Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 73 S. Ct. 215 (1952); Chalk Appeal, 441 Pa. 376, 272 A. 2d 457 (1971). See also Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 91 S. Ct. 1848 (1971); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S. Ct. 1790 (1963).\nHowever, the United States Supreme Court has specifically recognized that the State does have certain interests, as an employer, in regulating the activity of its employees. In Pickering v. Board of Education, supra at 568, 88 S. Ct. at 1734-35, the Court said: \u201cAt the same time it cannot be gainsaid that the State has interests as an employer in regulating the . . . [activity] of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation ... of the citizenry in general. The problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the . . . [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d\nIn striking this balance, we are guided by further principles enunciated by the Supreme Court. In United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 67 S. Ct. 556 (1947), for example, the Court rejected a constitutional attack on portions of the Hatch Act and held that Congress may \u201cregulate the political conduct of Government employees \u2018within reasonable limits,\u2019 even though the regulation trenches to some extent upon unfettered political action.\u201d Id. at 102, 67 S. Ct. at 571. See also Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Commission, 330 U.S. 127, 67 S. Ct. 544 (1947).\nSince the Court\u2019s decision in Mitchell, some additional tests have emerged to determine the constitutionality of restrictions of First Amendment rights. The \u201creasonableness\u201d test employed by the Court in Mitchell has been amplified by the \u201ccompelling interest\u201d standard. \u201cWhere there is a significant encroachment upon personal liberty, the State may prevail only upon showing a subordinating interest which is compelling.\u201d Bates v. City of Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 524, 80 S. Ct. 412, 417 (1960). Accord, Sherbert v. Verner, supra; Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Com., 372 U.S. 539, 83 S. Ct. 889 (1963); Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority v. United States Civil Service Commission, 437 F. 2d 1346 ( 4th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 936, 91 S. Ct. 2254 (1971); National Association of Letters Carriers v. United States Civil Service Commission, 346 F. Supp. 578 (D.D.C. 1972), cert. granted, 409 U.S. 1058, 93 S. Ct. 560 (1972); Mancuso v. Taft, 341 F. Supp. 574 (D.R.I. 1972); Minielly v. State, 242 Ore. 490, 411 P. 2d 69 (1966); Fort v. Civil Service Commission, 61 Cal. 2d 331, 392 P. 2d 385, 38 Cal. Rptr. 625 (1964).\nAs the Supreme Court of Oregon recently stated: \u201cThe state must show that it has a compelling governmental interest warranting a restriction of a First Amendment right. Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 524, 80 S. Ct. 412, 4 L. Ed. 2d 480 (1960); Gibson v. Florida, 372 U.S. 539, 555, 83 S. Ct. 889, 9 L. Ed. 2d 929 (1963); NAACP v. Button, supra, 371 U.S. at 438. Such compelling interest must be the controlling justification for the statute.\u201d Minielly v. State, supra at 505, 411 P. 2d at 76.\nAdditionally, the governmental unit has the burden of showing that the restriction on the First Amendment activity is the least drastic means for achieving the governmental purpose. \u201cIn a series of decisions this Court has held that, even though the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that purpose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved. The breadth of legislative abridgment must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose.\u201d Shelton v. Tucker, supra at 488, 81 S. Ct. at 252 (footnotes omitted). Accord, Sherbert v. Verner, supra; Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority v. United States Civil Service Commission, supra; National Association of Letter Carriers v. United States Civil Service Commission, supra; Mancuso v. Taft, supra.\nApplying these standards here, we hold that the prohibition on political candidacy in Section 10-107 (5) is a constitutionally permissible restriction on the political activity of Philadelphia\u2019s officers and employees. While the test employed in Mitchell may not be all inclusive the principle it announced is very much alive today. \u201c \u2018The evident purpose of Congress in all this class of enactments has been to promote efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties, and to maintain proper discipline in the public service.\u2019 \u201d United Public Workers v. Mitchell, supra at 96-97, 67 S. Ct. at 568.\nWe conclude that the City of Philadelphia has a compelling governmental interest which justifies requiring City officers and employees to resign before becoming a candidate for nomination or election for any public office. The reason\u2014as stated in the Annotation to Section 10-107(5)\u2014for imposing this requirement is \u201cbecause an officer or employee who is a candidate for elective office is in a position to influence unduly and to intimidate employees under his supervision and because he may neglect his official duties in the interests of Ms candidacy.\u201d\nSection 10-107(5) is designed to prevent numerous other interferences with the efficency and integrity of the discharging of public duties. The Minnesota Supreme Court summarized the possible abuses in Johnson v. State Civil Service Department, 157 N.W. 2d 747, 751-52 (Minn. 1988) :\n\u201cWe are persuaded that the legislature could justifiably determine that the evils referred to constitute a direct threat to the objectives and purposes of a merit system. It could reasonably conclude that to allow employees in the competitive classified service to run for offices which are usually sought for the purpose of earning a livelihood or advancing one\u2019s political career would interfere with the efficient and impartial administration of public business by exposing employees and the merit system to the same type of political activities and abuses inherent in a spoils system which the merit system was designed to obviate. Obviously, the legislature could conclude that campaigning for such offices would inevitably interfere with the employee-candidate\u2019s time, energy, and devotion to his official duties. No one acquainted with the demands of a campaign for a county office, such as clerk of court, would deny that such demands could, and most likely would, affect a candidate\u2019s regular job performance. Undoubtedly, the legislature was not unaware of the probability that an employee seeking such an office could use the prestige of the office he was seeking or his state office to gain special treatment from his superiors\u2014such as leaves of absence and special work assignments\u2014or that his campaign activities would promote or retard his advancement. Further, the legislature doubtless foresaw both the probability of the employee\u2019s using his state employment to favor those who might directly or indirectly aid him in Ms campaign, and, in the context of the rather unique nature of the political structure in this state, where most elective offices (including the legislative offices and all elective county offices) are declared by statute to be 'nonpartisan\u2019, the probability of Ms exposure to involvement in partisan political activities \u2014with all the potentially disruptive abuses that such involvement could produce.\n\u201cWhile these and many other conceivable abuses may not materialize in every case, the threat the legislature may have feared most was the cumulative effect on the morale and efficiency of all employees by the campaign activities of those who, absent the restriction, would file for office and thereby either directly encourage others to do so or, by their example of the advantages to be gained, induce them to engage in political activities inconsistent with the objectives of the merit system and the efficient and impartial discharge of official duties. To forestall the probability of these and other abuses is, in the judgment of the legislature, the compelling need justifying the restriction.\u201d (Footnotes omitted).\nIt must be concluded that the governmental interest in insuring efficient and impartial administration of public service and avoiding the possible abuses described above may be classified as a compelling governmental interest. See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma ex rel. Oklahoma State Personnel Board, 338 F. Supp. 711 (W.D. Okla. 1972), cert. granted, 409 U.S. 1058, 93 S. Ct. 550 (1972) ; Gray v. Toledo, 323 F. Supp. 1281 (N.D. Ohio 1971); Stack v. Adams, 315 F. Supp. 1295 (N.D. Fla. 1970); Swinney v. Untreiner, 272 So. 2d 805 (Fla. 1973).\nMoreover, the approach adopted in Section 10-107 (5) is the least drastic means to achieve the desired end. It is only by requiring City officers and employees to resign before running for political office, that the people of PMladelpMa will be assured of the efficient and impartial discharge of official duties. Unlike many of the statutes which have been held unconstitutional, Section 10-107(5) of the Home Rule Charter suffers from neither vagueness nor overbreadth. See Wisconsin State Employees Association v. Wisconsin Natural Resources Board, 298 P. Supp. 339 (W.D. Wis. 1969); Swinney v. Untreiner, supra.\nThus we agree with the Court in Wisconsin State Employees Association v. Wisconsin Natural Resources Board, supra at 350, \u201cthat the relinquishment of the right to run for partisan political office can constitutionally he made a condition of public employment.\u201d\nIII.\nAppellants\u2019 remaining arguments are untenable. It is suggested that Section 10-107(5) provides a procedure for removal which is inconsistent with Art VI, \u00a77 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, as implemented by the Act of August 9, 1955, P. L. 323, \u00a7450, as amended, 16 P.S. \u00a7450 (Supp. 1973). That Act provides that removal of county officers shall be by \u201cimpeachment, or by the Governor for reasonable cause ... or upon conviction of misbehavior in office, or of any infamous crime. . . .\u201d\nAppellants maintain that the effect of Section 10-107(5) is to create an additional method of removal not authorized by the Act. They urge that since the City may not exercise its powers \u201ccontrary to . . . acts of the General Assembly .. .\u201d (Act of April 21, 1949, P. L. 665, \u00a718, 53 P.S. \u00a713133), the provision of the Home Rule Charter must fail.\nThe fatal weakness in this argument, however, is that the Act of August 9, 1955, directs the methods for removal of officers. We agree completely with the trial court that appellants are employees, not officers, within the meaning of the removal provisions. The trial judge stated: \u201cAn Assistant District Attorney is not appointed for a fixed term, but serves purely at the pleasure of the District Attorney. He has no independent powers or authority, but can only exercise such authority as the District Attorney grants to him. The District Attorney can impose such restrictions upon him as he deems fit. The District Attorney can determine whether or not the Assistant can engage in private practice. Under some of his predecessors, Assistants were permitted to devote some of their time to private practice. Important policy questions, such as the practice of plea bargaining, are determined only by the District Attorney and not his Assistants. I think it is clear that Assistant District Attorneys are employees and not public officers.\u201d (Footnote omitted). See Commonwealth ex rel. Foreman v. Hampson, 393 Pa. 467, 143 A. 2d 369 (1958).\nFinally, appellants argue that the Finance Director does not have the authority to declare that assistant district attorneys have forfeited title to their positions and deny compensation. This contention is merit! ess. We need not decide whether the Finance Director has power to take such action on his own initiative for, here, appellee acted pursuant to the direction of the City Solicitor who has the authority to \u201ctake such steps . . . as may be reasonably necessary to enforce within the City [the] statutes and ordinances [of the Commonwealth and City].\u201d Philadelphia Home Rule Charter \u00a74-400(d).\nOn this record we find no basis for disturbing the order of the trial court dismissing appellants\u2019 complaint in mandamus.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones concurs in the result.\nAdopted by public referendum in 1951.\nOn March 30, 1973, by order of this Court, appellee was directed to pay appellants \u201cpending final decision on the issues.\u201d The order further provided that such payment \u201cshall not render the case moot.\u201d\nSee Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v. Bauer, 437 Pa. 37, 261 A. 2d 573 (1970) ; Chalfin v. Specter, 426 Pa. 464, 233 A. 2d 562 (1967) ; Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v. Martin, 426 Pa. 102, 232 A. 2d 729 (1967) ; Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v. Freed, 424 Pa. 508, 228 A. 2d 382 (1967).\nSee Act of August 26, 1953, P. It. 1476, \u00a72, 53 P.S. \u00a713132(c) (Supp. 1973) (sheriff subject to Home Rule Charter).\nTliis case was argued with Broadrick v. Oklahoma ex rel. Oklahoma State Personnel Board, 338 F. Supp. 711 (W.D. Okla. 1972), in April, 1973, 41 U.S.L.W. 3521 (1973). See note 8, infra.\nSee note 4, supra.\nSee, e.g., Hobbs v. Thompson, 448 F. 2d 456 (5th Cir. 1971) ; National Association of Letter Carriers v. United States Civil Service Commission, 346 F. Supp. 578 (D.D.C. 1972), cert. granted, 409 U.S. 1058, 93 S. Ct. 560 (1972) ; Huerta v. Flood, 103 Ariz. 608, 447 P. 2d 866 (1968).\nAppellants also contend that they are denied the equal protection of the laws because state officers and employees are not required to resign before running for office. This argument, however, is specious. The \u201cfunction of the Equal Protection Clause, rather, is simply to measure the validity of classifications. . . .\u201d San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 93 S. Ct. 1278, 1310 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring) (emphasis in original).\nHere, the classification created by the Home Rule Charter relates only to City officers and employees. The Charter does not\u2014\u25a0 and, indeed, could not\u2014include state officers and employees. As the trial court correctly stated: \u201cEmployees of the City of Philadelphia are subject to regulations even though such regulations may not be applicable to state employees or employees of other counties.\u201d\nJust, prior to the filing of this opinion, the United States Supremo Court delivered its opinion in Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 603, 93 S. Ct. 2908 (1973) and United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 93 S. Ct. 2880 (1973), in which the Supreme Court held that restrictions on political activity\u2014similar to those in the Home Buie Charter\u2014are constitutionally permissible.",
