        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Roberts,\nThese three appeals were argued together during the September 1972, Term, and will be disposed of in this opinion.\nOn September 7, 1968, a justice of the peace found appellant Peter T. Campana not guilty of disorderly conduct, a charge arising out of an August 17, 1968, incident. Additional charges arising from the same incident of resisting arrest and assault on a police officer were dismissed for lack of sufficient evidence. Subsequently the Commonwealth again instituted the charges of resisting arrest and assault on a police officer before another justice of the peace who bound appellant over to the grand jury. On February 5, 1969, appellant was tried by jury and convicted of both crimes. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was placed on probation for a period of one year. The Superior Court affirmed in a per curiam order, with Judge Hoeeman noting a dissent. Commonwealth v. Campana, 217 Pa. Superior Ct. 818, 270 A. 2d 231 (1970). We granted allocatur and heard argument during the January 1972, Term. Subsequently we ordered reargument during the September 1972, Term.\nAppellants John Doe, et al., were convicted by a justice of the peace on June 10, 1968, of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace for their conduct in a Berks County bar on May 19, 1968. Each appellant was ordered to either pay a fine of $300.00 or undergo imprisonment for thirty days. The justice of the peace also bound appellants over to the grand jury on charges of aggravated assault and battery, riot, riotous destruction of property and malicious mischief, all charges originating from the May 19,1968, disturbance. On June 10, 1969, appellants were tried by jury and convicted of riot, riotous destruction of property and malicious mischief. In addition appellants John Hall and Charles Ginder were found guilty of assault and battery. Motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were argued. The motion in arrest of judgment was granted only as to the malicious mischief charge. Each appellant was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of not less than one and one-half nor more than five years. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam with Judge Hoffman filing a dissenting opinion in which Judge Spaulding joined. Commonwealth v. John Doe, 217 Pa. Superior Ct. 148, 269 A. 2d 138 (1970). We granted allocatur and, after first hearing argument dining the January 1972, Term, ordered re-argument during the September 1972, Term.\nOn February 28, 1969, appellant Bobert Earl King was ordered to pay a fine of $500.00 by a justice of the peace for disorderly conduct that occurred the same day. The justice of the peace also bound appellant over to the grand jury on charges of assault and battery on a police officer in execution of a legal process and resisting arrest, both charges stemming from the February 28, 1969, incident. On September 11, 1969, appellant in a nonjury trial was convicted of both charges, and a sentence of not less than six months nor more than one year was imposed. No post-trial motions were filed but on March 8, 1971, appellant was allowed to file post-trial motions as if timely filed. After their denial the Superior Court affirmed with a per curiam order. Commonwealth v. King, 220 Pa. Superior Ct. 771, 286 A. 2d 416 (1972). We granted allocatur and ordered the appeal heard at the time of reargument of the above cases.\nPresented for consideration in these consolidated appeals is whether appellants, by virtue of their second prosecutions, were subjected to \u201cDouble Jeopardy\u201d in contravention of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. We hold that all charges resulting from the criminal \u201cepisode\u201d of each appellant should have been consolidated at one trial, and consequently the second prosecutions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly we reverse the judgments of sentences imposed as a result of the second prosecutions.\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause reads in deceptively simple terms: \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; . . .\u201d Although the language of the clause remains cryptic, leading authorities generally turn to Justice Black\u2019s opinion in Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187, 78 S. Ct. 221, 223 (1957), as an impassioned yet reasoned statement of the policies underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause: \u201c[T]he State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nWhile courts and commentators remain undecided whether the clause governs the question of how many separate criminal offenses a defendant can be punished for at a single trial, authorities are unanimous that the principal purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is to prevent \u201crepeated attempts to convict an individual of an alleged offense\u201d through a series of prosecuticois. As Mr. Chief Justice Burger has noted: \u201c \u2018The prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy . . . .\u2019 The \u2018twice put in jeopardy\u2019 language of the Constitution thus relates to a potential, i.e., the risk that an accused for a second time will be convicted of the \u2018same offense\u2019 for which he was initially tried.\u201d Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S. 323, 326, 90 S. Ct. 1757, 1759 (1970).\nAt its inception in early common law the defense of double jeopardy was remarkably equipped to prevent successive prosecutions. Criminal statutes were relatively few in number and broad in coverage. An acquittal at one trial could not generally be followed by another prosecution, because the second trial would by necessity be based on precisely the same charge as that of the first. A conviction resulted in a severe sentence, generally death, leaving little incentive for the prosecution to seek another trial.\nAs countless legal scholars have noted, however, the modern age of criminal procedure has witnessed a proliferation of penal statutes. A consequence of this development is the judiciary\u2019s responsibility \u201cto recognize that new rules must be devised to cope with the fact that a single factual situation, may today give rise to a number of substantive offenses.\u201d Prosecutors, \u201cby consulting a Thesaurus,\u201d are presently able to dissect a single criminal \u201cact\u201d, \u201ctransaction\u201d, \u201coccurrence\u201d, \u201cepisode\u201d or \u201ccircumstance\u201d, and produce a variety of criminal charges. Unless the judiciary properly meets its responsibility, a prosecutor, if he is for any reason dissatisfied with Hie result of the first trial, could circumvent the generally accepted prohibition against state appeals with a new set of charges for a second prosecution. Such \u201ctrial run\u201d prosecutions are, in Mr. Justice Stewart's words, \u201cprecisely what the constitutional guarantee forbids.\u201d\nThe Pennsylvania Double Jeopardy Clause, differing only stylistically from that contained in the Fifth Amendment, has been thought to be limited only to what were heretofore \u201ccapital\u201d offenses. Nevertheless, defendants in this Commonwealth have been afforded a measure of protection against successive prosecutions by common law pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. These pleas prevent a prosecutor, after a conviction or acquittal of a \u201cconstituent\u201d or lesser included offense in the first trial, for initiating a second prosecution for a greater offense.\nSimilarly we have construed our Double Jeopardy Clause to protect a defendant upon retrial in a murder prosecution from conviction in the second trial of a greater offense than that of the first, or greater punisment. In Dinkey v. Commonwealth, 17 Pa. 126 (1851), this Court applied collateral estoppel to prevent a second prosecution where an issue necessary to sustain the charge was resolved in defendant\u2019s favor at the first trial. In Commonwealth v. Lloyd, 141 Pa. 28, 30, 21 Atl. 411 (1891), we unanimously prohibited a second prosecution because the state could have joined both counts at the first trial: \u201c[W]e do not think the commonwealth can prosecute for the one offence in one county, and for the other in a different county. In other words, there may be two counts, but not two prosecutions. The commonwealth has elected in this instance to proceed in Luzerne county, and we think is bound by such election. . . (Emphasis supplied.)\nMany jurisdictions, including perhaps this one at times, have applied a \u201csame evidence\u201d test to determine whether a second prosecution is for the \u201csame offense.\u201d That test has been almost unanimously regarded as totally ineffective to implement the important double jeopardy guarantee of preventing successive prosecutions. As one commentator in the Yale Law Journal aptly noted: \u201cAttempting to choose which version of the same evidence test would best implement the double jeopardy prohibition is like deciding which of five lumber jacks would be the most handy with a violin.\u201d\nThe United States Supreme Court has recently responded to the problem posed by successive prosecutions in two landmark cases. In Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 90 S. Ct. 1184 (1970), the Court held impermissible as a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause a second prosecution that was concededly for the \u201csame acts\u201d that the defendant had been punished for in a court of limited jurisdiction. More significantly, Mr.\nJustice Stewart, speaking for the .Court in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S. Ct. 1189 (1970), gave specific recognition to the \u201cpossibility] [of] prosecutors . . . spin[ning] out a startingly [sic] numerous series of offenses from a single alleged criminal transaction.\u201d As a partial response to that \u201cstartling\u201d possibility, the Court held a second prosecution impermissible where an application of \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d revealed that an \u201cultimate fact\u201d essential to the offense in the second trial had been decided in defendant\u2019s favor at the first.\nThe protection afforded a defendant against successive or repeated prosecutions by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, however, is diminished considerably by its inherent limitations. That imprecise doctrine has proven quite difficult and burdensome for appellate courts to properly and uniformly apply. Before the doctrine of collateral estoppel can apply the first trial must end in acquittal, and a \u201crational\u201d reading of the record must disclose that the jury based its verdict of acquittal on but one issue. As Mr. Justice Schaefer of the Illinois Supreme Court has succinctly observed: \u201cCollateral estoppel is therefore of limited value because it is not often possible to determine with precision how the judge or jury has decided any particular issue.\u201d\nIt has been noted that the doctrine of collateral estoppel places defense connsel on the horns of a dilemma. If defendant is to gain any chance of protection under the doctrine he is better off by limiting his defense at the first trial thus placing fewer facts at issue before the jury. Such a consideration might impair counsel\u2019s ability to effectively represent a defendant.\nBy far the most efficient and enthusiastically received proposal for preventing successive prosecutions is that advanced by the American Law Institute Model Penal Code (\u00a71.07(2)) : \u201c[A] defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal episode, if such offenses are Imown to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial. . . ,\u201d The commentary to \u00a71.08 of the Model Penal Code, which bars a second prosecution \u201cbased upon the same facts\u201d as that of the first, states that the purpose of the section is to protect defendants from: \u201csuccessive prosecutions based upon essentially the same conduct, whether the purpose in so doing is to hedge against the risk of an unsympathetic jury at the first trial, to place a \u2018hold\u2019 upon a person after he has been sentenced to imprisonment, or simply to harass by multiplicity of trials.\u201d\nThe ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance \u00a71.3 (Approved Draft, 1968), with specific reference to the Model Penal Code, accords a defendant the right to request joinder of all charges if they are \u201cbased on the same conduct or arise from the same criminal episode.\u201d \u201cEpisode\u201d is defined as \u201c \u2018an occurrence or connected series of occurrences and developments which may be viewed as distinctive and apart although part of a larger or more comprehensive series.\u2019 \u201d ABA Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance \u00a71.3(a) (commentary). As the commentary to the ABA Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance \u00a71.3(a) states: \u201cIt is the view of the Advisory Committee that, except where the ends of justice would otherwise be defeated, the defendant should not be subjected to multiple trials of related offenses. ...\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn recent months the Oregon Supreme Court, after careful analysis of the inadequacy of existing proteetions against successive prosecutions, held that \u201ca second prosecution is for the \u2018same offense\u2019 and is prohibited if (1) the charges arise out of the same act or transaction. . . .\u201d State v. Brown, 497 P. 2d 1191, 1198 (Ore. S. Ct. 1972). That court observed that the House of Lords in England, the birthplace of the concept of double jeopardy, had recently promulgated a rule of court \u201cthat the prosecution must as a general rule join in the same indictment charges that \u2018are founded on the same facts, or form or are part of a series of offenses of the same or similar character....\u2019 \u201d\nThe Oregon Supreme Court in State v. Brown, supra, further noted that New Jersey and Hawaii among several states have either adopted a \u201csame transaction\u201d test or have long applied one. In California, Illinois, New York and Minnesota compulsory joinder of all offenses arising from a criminal transaction is accomplished by legislative enactment. Compare Pa. R. Crim. P. 219(b) which provides: \u201cTwo or more offenses . . . may be charged in the same indictment if they are . . . based on the same act or transaction.\u201d\nWhile the Supreme Court iu Ashe v. Swenson, supra, had only to decide whether collateral estoppel was within the aegis of the Double Jeopardy Clause, three concurring Justices indicated that the clause requires \u201cthe prosecution ... to join at one trial all charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction\u201d. 397 U.S. at 453-54, 90 S. Ct. at 1199 (footnote omitted). Mr. Justice Brennan, writing for himself and Mr. Justices Douglas and Marshall, further stated: \u201cThis \u2018same transaction\u2019 test of \u2018same offence\u2019 not only enforces the ancient prohibition against vexatious multiple prosecutions embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause, but responds as well to the increasingly widespread recognition that the consolidation in one lawsuit of all issues arising out of a single transaction or occurrence best promotes justice, economy, and convenience\u201d\nThe \u201csame transaction\u201d test is not, in Mr. Justice Brennan's words, \u201cself-defining,\u201d but experience in civil law has proved that the concept is both workable and fulfills important societal objectives. By requiring that all causes of action arising from a set of operative facts be consolidated at one proceeding, the concept avoids repetitious litigation and assures finality without unduly burdening the judicial process.\nProponents of the \u201csame transaction\u201d test in criminal law have noted that both interests sought to be preserved by the Double Jeopardy Clause <md important societal interests will equally and effectively be served. By requiring compulsory joinder of all charges arising from a single \u201ctransaction,\u201d a defendant need only once \u201crun the gauntlet\u201d and confront the \u201cawesome resources of the state.\u201d After the jury\u2019s verdict he may have the security and peace of mind that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to protect. As the New Jersey Supreme Court noted almost a century and a half ago: \u201cIf in civil cases, the law abhors a multiplicity of suits, it is yet more watchful in criminal cases, that the crown shall not oppress the subject, or the government the citizen, by unnecessary prosecutions. . . . [This] is a case where the state has thought proper to prosecute the offence in its mildest form, and it is better that the residue of the offence go unpunished, than by sustaining a second indictment to sanction a practice which might be rendered an instrument of oppression to the citizen.\u201d State v. Cooper, 13 N.J.L. 361, 375-76 (1833).\nEqually as important, the \u201csame transaction\u201d test protects vital societal interests. Compulsory joinder of all offenses arising from a single \u201ctransaction\u201d avoids piecemeal litigation and thus conserves precious judicial and professional manpower as well as the time of jurors, witnesses, and the use of public resources. All outstanding charges against an accused are swiftly brought at one proceeding, and, if proven guilty, the punishment of a defendant is commensurate with all crimes actually committed. The \u201csame transaction\u201d test prevents the \u201ctrial run\u201d and inadequately prepared prosecutions that the Court in Aslie found offensive to the double jeopardy provision. 397 U.S. at 447, 90 S. Ct. at 1196.\nAs the Oregon Supreme Court so appropriately noted in People v. Brown, 497 P. 2d at 1195: \u201cThe [United States Supreme Court] has not made its position clear in multiple prosecution cases.\u201d In Ashe, the Court established that as a constitutional minimum the Double Jeopardy Clause incorporated the doctrine of collateral estoppel, but did not reach the issue we confront today.\nAlthough we are thus left without specific guidance from the Supreme Court on this particular issue, it nevertheless remains this Court\u2019s responsibility to decide an issue which, as here, is not governed by the previously announced constitutional minimum standard. We hold, in light of the persuasive authority discussed above, that the Double Jeopardy Clause requires a prosecutor to bring, in a single proceeding, all known charges against a defendant arising from a \u201csingle criminal episode.\u201d\nIt should be noted that in Pennsylvania, it is clear that both summary offenses and indictable offenses may be considered at a single common pleas proceeding: \u201cIn those cases where the evidence presented to the jury on the indictable charge applies equally and is dispositive of the summary offense, it is not necessary that a separate hearing on the summary offense be held.\u201d Commonwealth v. Dawkins, 216 Pa. Superior Ct. 198, 201 n.3, 264 A. 2d 722, 723 n.3 (1970). See also Commonwealth v. Ray, 448 Pa. 307, 292 A. 2d 410 (1972) (summary offense and indictable offense consolidated at one proceeding); Commonwealth v. Rose, 214 Pa. Superior Ct. 50, 251 A. 2d 815 (1969), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 437 Pa. 30, 261 A. 2d 586 (1970); Commonwealth ex rel. Levine v. Fair, 186 Pa. Superior Ct. 299, 144 A. 2d 395 (1958), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 394 Pa. 262, 146 A. 2d 834 (1958); see March v. Commonwealth, 10 Sadler 479, 14 Atl. 375 (1888).\nAs this Court recognized in Commonwealth v. Ray, supra at 309 n.3, 292 A. 2d at 412 n.3: \u201cWhere an individual is charged with a summary and an indictable offense arising out of the same facts and is held for court on the latter charge, we are informed a magistrate in Philadelphia as a matter of practice returns all charges for disposition at trial.\u201d\nAlthough Dawhins, supra, and Ray, supra, are cases from the City of Philadelphia, it is clear beyond cavil that the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court is precisely the same as that of all other common pleas courts.\nTurning our focus to the records in each appeal, it is clear that all charges brought in the two successive prosecutions against each appellant originated from but one criminal episode.\nThe evidence adduced at the first and second prosecutions involving appellant Campana established that on August 17, 1968, a disturbance was reported to the police. Upon their arrival two policemen noticed appellant \u201ctussling\u201d with his friends. When appellant was asked for his identification, he pushed the officer and rammed an automobile door into the officer\u2019s stomach. During the ensuing struggle to arrest appellant the other officer was also struck. All parties concede that the events were part of a single transaction. Thus appellant, who was initially acquitted of disorderly conduct, should not have had to \u201crun the gantlet\u201d for a second time on charges arising from the same criminal episode.\nAppellants John Doe, et ah, on May 19, 1968, entered a Berks County bar and initiated a \u201cbrawl.\u201d The event lasted, according to eyewitnesses, \u201ca couple of minutes,\u201d \u201ctwo or three minutes.\u201d After the incident appellants immediately fled. The Commonwealth argues, notwithstanding this testimony, that there were actually two episodes. Belying on the testimony of one witness concerning minimal property damage outside the bar, the Commonwealth contends that there was one episode in the bar and one outside. We reject that metaphysical division, because the record discloses that any damage outside the bar was done during appellants\u2019 quick flight from the brawl. Because the record establishes but a single criminal episode it is clear that all charges brought against appellants should have been consolidated in a single proceeding.\nAppellant King on February 28, 1969, placed a phone call to the police to seek assistance. When two policemen arrived and appeared reluctant to arrest certain individuals appellant claimed were interfering with his automobile, appellant began to use abusive language directed at the police. After giving appellant several warnings, the police informed appellant that he was under arrest. During the attempt to effectuate the arrest, appellant struck one of the officers. The record disclosing only a single criminal episode, all charges brought against appellant should have been consolidated at a single proceeding.\nThe judgments of sentences imposed at No. 151. September Term, 1968, Lycoming County, No. 255 September Sessions, 1968, Berks County, and No. 520 April Sessions, 1969, Allegheny County, are reversed. The judgment of sentence at No. 325 October Sessions, 1968 Allegheny County is affirmed.\nAppellants John Doe and Gerald Ereese were fugitives at the time of the second criminal prosecution and were not tried. Although their names appear in the caption on the briefs, we do not pass upon the merits of their contentions.\nIn Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 2062 (1969), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment . . . app[li.es\u2019] to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Benton is retroactive and thus applicable to all these appeals. See Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S. 323, 330 n.9, 90 S. Ct. 1757, 1762 n.9 (1970) ; Commonwealth v. Richbourg, 442 Pa. 147, 153, 275 A. 2d 345, 348 (1971).\nAppellants John Doe, et ah, had their two trials before the Supreme Court decided Benton. Therefore the fact that appellants did not raise the issue of double jeopardy until their appeal to the Superior Court does not bar them from relief. See Commonwealth v. Stevens, 429 Pa. 593, 599-600, 240 A. 2d 536, 540 (1968) ; see also Commonwealth v. Cheeks, 429 Pa. 89, 239 A. 2d 793 (1968).\nAppellant King, although tried after the decision in Benton, did not raise the issue of double jeopardy either at trial or during post-trial motions. The record discloses, however, that appellant in his pro se Post Conviction Hearing Act petition raised the issue of double jeopardy. As a result of that petition, counsel was appointed and appellant was allowed to file post-trial motions as if timely filed. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that appellant has forfeited his right to litigate this issue. See Commonwealth v. Cheeks, supra, cf. Commonwealth v. McGrogan, 449 Pa. 584, 297 A. 2d 456 (1972). See also Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396 (1967) ; Commonwealth v. Baker, 429 Pa. 209, 239 A. 2d 201 (1968).\nSee text following note 32, infra.\nIn light of our disposition we do not reach appellant Campana\u2019s contention that before he could be convicted of resisting arrest the Commonwealth must establish that the arrest was \u201clawful.\u201d\nLikewise we do not reach appellants John Doe, et al.\u2019s contentions that (1) there was insufficient evidence to prove that appellant John E. Hall participated in the alleged riot or assault and battery; (2) the representation of all appellants by the same counsel created a conflict of interest; (3) the trial court did not comply with Pa. R. Crim. P. 1106 in the jury selection.\nAppellant King has also appealed his judgment of sentence at No. 325, October Sessions, 1968, imposed for aggravated assault and battery, a charge arising from an entirely separate occurrence. We find sufficient evidence to support the conviction and affirm.\nOur discussion today deals only with the issue of successive prosecutions. We do not intimate a view on whether, at one trial, appellants could have been convicted of both the summary offenses and the indictable offenses. As a commentator in the Stanford Law .Review has observed: \u201cBecause of the different policies underlying the two protections, the question of permitting double prosecution should be considered independently from the issue of punishment.\u201d Note, The Protection Against Multiple Trials, 11 Stan.

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen :\nWhile I agree with the result reached by the majority, I cannot agree with the rule of law espoused to reach that result.\nWe are herein confronted with one question for consideration, that is: What does the constitutional phrase \u201csame offense\u201d mean in the context of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment? This question, although deceptively simple on first impression, is truly a most difficult and troublesome question.\nFor an understanding of my disagreement with the majority opinion, a brief recitation of the underlying purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is essential. The foundation of the Double Jeopardy Clause rests on the theory that a single fair trial on a criminal offense forecloses successive prosecutions for that same offense, thus, double jeopardy is a rule of finality. Encompassed within the double jeopardy concept of finality is the fact that once an accused is given a fair trial for an offense the matter is considered closed, thereby allowing the individual to plan his life accordingly, as well as protecting him from continued distress in the form of reprosecution. Additionally, enveloped within the Double Jeopardy Clause are such basic principles as the presumption of innocence, the right to speedy justice and the courts should not be used as a tool of harassment and oppression.\nI agree with, the majority opinion that past efforts to give full meaning to the before-related purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause have fallen short of that goal, but I cannot agree with its conclusion that the \u201csame transaction\u201d or \u201csame episode,\u201d test, as fashioned by the majority, is the proper answer to the problem of determining if successive prosecutions constitute double jeopardy where a summary offense and a higher offense are involved. My basic disagreement with this test is its premise that all crimes which occur in the same transaction or same episode are necessarily the \u201csame offense\u201d in the constitutional sense. I am not persuaded this is so, particularly where a summary offense and a higher grade of crime (misdemeanor or felony) are involved. Moreover, to conclude all such crimes are the \u201csame offense,\u201d I submit, is in effect a rewriting of the Constitution by substituting the word \u201cepisode\u201d for the word \u201coffense\u201d in the Fifth Amendment. Also, such a position completely ignores the nature and purpose of the second criminal charge and focuses exclusively on the acts committed.\nThe weakness of the majority opinion stems from the fact that it adopts a rule of law which was fashioned to operate where two or more felonies or misdemeanors, or a combination of both are involved, to a situation where a summary offense and a felony or a misdemeanor are involved. This type of approach may be viable in that situation where only felonies and misdemeanors are involved, but it is not viable here, because it focuses strictly on the acts committed, as opposed to the \u201coffense\u201d as the Constitution mandates. It cannot be questioned the Commonwealth has a right and duty to protect the interests of its citizenry through statutory enactments of different kinds and grades of crimes. For example, a law making disorderly conduct a crime may be enacted to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth from this type of disturbance and annoyance. At the same time the Legislature may enact a law applicable to acts which constitute homicide. Are these two crimes the \u201csame offense\u201d? Clearly, they are not. But under the rule of law adopted by the majority opinion if there were a prosecution for disorderly conduct, and a subsequent attempt to prosecute for homicide, the homicide prosecution would be barred if the homicide grew out of the same episode as the disorderly conduct. The absurdity of this is self-evident. Other examples could be cited leading to the same ludicrous result.\nThe approach which the majority opinion adopts leaves the Commonwealth and its citizens unprotected in many cases, and will lead in some instances to the defeat of the ends of justice by unreasonably extending the meaning of the constitutional phrase \u201csame offense.\u201d It likewise destroys the purpose of many statutory enactments. I would propose to adopt a rule which would not only fully protect the interests of the accused, but also the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. As opposed to the position of the majority opinion, I would focus on the various offenses charged as opposed to focusing exclusively on the acts involved, for it is my belief that all offenses within one episode are not the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes.\nInitially, I would propose a joinder requirement such as the majority opinion does. Whether you choose to name this requirement the same act, same conduct, same transaction, or same episode is not important. I would require the Commonwealth to join in one trial all crimes which follow from a continuous and uninterrupted conduct, so joined in time, place and circumstances, that such conduct is directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective. However, to this general rule I would add a very significant exception, that is, a second prosecution may be instituted if the purpose of the crime then charged is to prevent a substantially different harm or evil. Under such limited circumstances, I would hold the second prosecution is not for the \u201csame offense\u201d and, hence, does not constitute double jeopardy.\nI believe such a rule with this exception is fair and completely consistent with the goals of the double jeopardy clause. This can be seen by analyzing the aforementioned goals. Probably, the most important of these is to foreclose the use of the courts as a tool of harassment and oppression. The rule herein suggested would accomplish this objective. It would also promote finality. But, and very importantly, it would protect the interests of the people of the Commonwealth in those situations where the rule advanced by the majority opinion leaves them unprotected and results in many criminals escaping justice without good reason.\nAlthough the rule suggested may be criticized, because courts would be forced to determine if different crimes are \u201cintended to prevent a substantially different harm or evil,\u201d I do not think this determination would be any more difficult than we make in other areas of the law or, for that matter, any more difficult than determining which crimes fall within one \u201cepisode\u201d which the majority opinion admits is not \u201cself-defining.\u201d The formula could not be mechanical, but rather it would consider the basic interests of society sought to be protected or vindicated by the different crimes, as well as broad objectives of our criminal law, such as prevention of future crimes, rehabilitation of the criminal, and punishment for criminal activity.\nIn the cases now before us, it is my view that the crimes involved in the initial prosecutions, as well as those charged in the second prosecutions, were all part of a continuous and uninterrupted conduct and directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective. Since I am not convinced the crimes charged in the second prosecutions were intended to prevent a substantially different harm or evil, I would hold as the majority opinion does, that these crimes were the \u201csame offense\u201d in the constitutional sense, and, hence, the second prosecutions constituted double jeopardy.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones joins in this concurring opinion.",

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. Justice Nix:\nI agree that the offenses at issue here, with the exception of appellant King\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault and battery, should have been joined in a single trial. I do not agree with the opinion of those members of this court who would base such joinder on constitutional grounds.\nA review of the historical basis of the double jeopardy clause convinces me that the suggested extension of that clause would be totally unwarranted. At the time of Blaclcstone, the common law principle governing two trials for the same offense was the plea of autrefois acquit. That plea was \u201cgrounded on this universal maxim of the common law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life more than once for the same offense. And hence it is allowed as a consequence, that when a man is once fairly found not guilty upon any indictment, or other prosecution, before any court having competent jurisdiction of the offence, he may plead such acquittal in bar of any subsequent accusation for the same crime.\u201d 4 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries *335. By the time of the drafting of the state and federal constitutions in this country, the concept of double jeopardy had been expanded in two ways: (1) It applied to felony and non-felony offenses and thus was no longer limited to jeopardy of life; and (2) It could be invoked after a prior verdict of guilty as well as an acquittal. Kirk, \u201cJeopardy\u201d During The Period Of The Year Books, 82 U. Pa. L. Rev. 602 (1934). Thus, the double jeopardy prohibition has two functions: (1) It denies the government an opportunity to convict a defendant of an offense after he has once been acquitted of that offense; and (2) It prohibits the government from exacting multiple punishments for the same offense. Note, Statutory Implementation Of Double Jeopardy Clauses: New Life For a Moribund Constitutional Guarantee, 65 Yale L.J. 339 (1956). While these principles are easily stated, their implementation is difficult.\nLess than a year after extending the reach of the Double Jeopardy Clause to the states, the United States Supreme Court held that where an issue of ultimate fact has been resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor by a valid judgment, it would constitute double jeopardy to permit the government to relitigate that fact. Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970). Ashe dealt with the situation where a defendant is acquitted of one charge and is subsequently tried on a second charge involving the same \u201cultimate fact\u201d. Thus, Ashe is concerned with the first function of the double jeopardy clause noted above\u2014i.e., the prohibition against allowing the government to re-litigate that which has already been resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor.\nAshe has not been interpreted as determining that the government may not re-litigate issues which were resolved against the defendant at a previous trial. Under the facts of the Ashe case, if the defendant had been convicted at the first robbery trial, there is no suggestion that he could not have been subsequently tried on the remaining robbery charges. Thus, I cannot read Ashe or the Double Jeopardy Clause as prohibiting the government from bringing a defendant to trial on an offense after obtaining a conviction for a different offense arising from the same transaction, so long as punishment for both of the offenses would not run afoul of the second function of the double jeopardy prohibition (i.e., double punishment). Of course, where a defendant is charged with several offenses that involve the same factual issues, the Commonwealth would be well advised to try the cases together rather than risk falling within Ashe\u2019s prohibition should the first trial result in an acquittal\nEven if Ashe could be interpreted to require joinder, such joinder would be necessary only where the two offenses have factual issues in common. The opinion of my brother Mr. Justice Roberts expressly disavows the same evidence test, and would compel joinder where the offenses arise from the same criminal episode. Such a result has no basis in the policy of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAs a matter of public policy this court should adopt the joinder rule advocated by the American Law Institute Model Penal Code (\u00a7107(2)): \u201c[A] defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal episode, if such offenses are known to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial. ...\u201d I agree that this test \u201cprotects vital societal interests\u201d in avoiding piecemeal litigation thereby conserving \u201cprecious judicial and professional manpower as well as the time of jurors, witnesses and the use of public resources.\u201d While such a rule could appropriately be applied prospectively as suggested by my brother Mr. Justice Pomeroy, it would not be inconsistent with the policy of giving litigants an incentive to raise new issues before the bar of this court to grant these appellants the benefit of the rule. See generally, Willis v. Department of Conservation & Economic Development, 55 N.J. 534, 264 A. 2d 34, 37-38 (1970).\nI therefore concur in this court\u2019s reversal of the judgments of sentence imposed at No. 151 September Term, 1968, Lycoming County, No. 255 September Sessions, 1968, Berks County, and No. 520 April Sessions, 1969, Allegheny County.\nPennsylvania was unique in continuing to limit the Double Jeopardy Clause to capital offenses. See Hall, Kamisar, LaFave, Israel, Modern Criminal Procedure (1969) at 1213.\nBenton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (1969).\nA minority of the Ashe court, Justices Brennan, Douglas and Marshall, would have adopted the same criminal episode test expressed by Mr. Justice Roberts.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Pomeroy:\nI do not disagree with the philosophy expressed today by the Court that prosecutors should not have the power to force a defendant through multiple trials of offenses arising out of \u201cthe same criminal episode\u201d, even though each trial involves an admittedly separate offense. I do disagree with the method by which the majority has carried that philosophy into law.\nThe majority, well into its opinion, states that \u201c[w] e are thus left without specific guidance from the Supreme Court on this particular issue . . . .\u201d I find that statement to be incorrect, and therein lies the basis of my disagreement. There is decisional law of the Supreme Court of the United States on precisely this issue, law which that Court has on three occasions recently refused to reconsider.\nIn 1958 the Supreme Court of the United States decided the companion cases of Hoag v. New Jersey, 356 U.S. 464, 2 L. Ed. 2d 913 (1958) and Ciucci v. Illinois, 356 U.S. 571, 2 L. Ed. 2d 983 (1958). Hoag involved several robberies committed in a raid on a tavern. Giucci involved the simultaneous, multiple murder of four members of the same family. The defendant Hoag was tried on three separate occasions by the State of New Jersey for the separate robberies of three of the tavern patrons and on each trial was acquitted. On the trial for robbery of a fourth person, however, a conviction was finally obtained. Ciucci, on the other hand, was tried in the first two trials for murder, was convicted on each occasion, and received sentences of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and 4.5 years\u2019 imprisonment respectively. In a third trial for the murder of yet another victim, the prosecutor obtained a conviction and the sought-for death penalty. In both cases the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not embody a rule of compulsory joinder of different offenses. Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the majority in Hoag, wrote: \u201cWe do not think that the Fourteenth Amendment always forbids States to prosecute different offenses at consecutive trials even though they arise out of the same occurrence. The question in any given case is whether such a eourse has led to fundamental unfairness. Of course, it may very well be preferable practice for a State in circumstances such as these, normally to try the several offenses in a single prosecution, and recent studies of the American Law Institute have led to such a proposal. See Model Penal Code \u00a71.08(2) (Tent. Draft No. 5, 1956). But it would be an entirely different matter for us to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment always prevents a State from allowing different offenses arising out of the same act or transaction to be prosecuted separately as New Jersey has done. For it has long been recognized as the very essence of our federalism that the States should have the widest latitude in the administration of their own systems of criminal justice.\u201d 356 U.S. at 467-68. In Ciucci v. Illinois, decided in a per curiam opinion on the same day as Hoag, the following appears: \u201cThe State was constitutionally entitled to prosecute these individual offenses singly at separate trials, and to utilize therein all relevant evidence, in the absence of proof establishing that such a course of action entailed fundamental unfairness. Hoag v. New Jersey . . . .\u201d 356 U.S. at 573.\nThe decision in Hoag has been overruled to an extent by Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 25 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1970). That case presented exactly the same factual situation as did Hoag and the Court held that principles of collateral estoppel embedded in the Fifth Amendment barred a prosecution for an offense if a prior prosecution for a different offense had resulted in an acquittal and that result was necessarily premised on a finding of the non-existence of an element essential to success in the second prosecution. Mr. Justice Stewart, writing for the majority of the Court, was careful to demonstrate the narrowness of the issue : \u201cThe question is not whether Missouri could validly charge the petitioner with six separate offenses for the robbery of the six poker players. It is not whether he could have received a total of six punishments if he had been convicted in a single trial of robbing the six victims. It is simply whether, after a jury determined by its verdict that the petitioner was not one of the robbers, the State could constitutionally hale him before a new jury to litigate that question again.\u201d 397 U.S. at 446. Mr. Justice Brennan filed a concurring opinion in which Justices Douglas and Marshall joined; that opinion appears to be the model for this Court\u2019s opinion in the case at bar.\nThe decision in Ciucci v. Illinois\u2014which, unlike Hoag, involved not prior acquittal of a different offense but rather prior conviction\u2014was undisturbed by the collateral estoppel rationale of Ashe v. Swenson; in fact, it is unmentioned in that case. Giucci continues to represent the controlling federal constitutional law on the subject of successive prosecutions for separate offenses arising out of the \u201csame criminal episode\u201d. That this is so becomes clear from the following quite recent developments:\nFirst: On April 3, 1972 the Supreme Court of the United States denied a writ of certiorari in the case of Miller v. Oregon, 405 U.S. 1047, 31 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1972). Mr. Justice Brennan, in an opinion in which Justices Douglas and Marshall joined, dissented from that denial on the basis that his view of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution, as set forth in his concurring opinion in Ashe v. Swenson, supra, would indicate that having tried petitioner for violation of an ordinance of the City of Portland (possession of a concealed weapon), the State of Oregon should be held powerless to try him in a second prosecution for the crime of use of a weapon during the perpetration of a felony on the person or property of another, a different offense arising from the same criminal transaction.\nSecond: On November 13, 1972 the Supreme Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari, in Grubb v. Oklahoma, 109 U.S. 1017, 34 L. Ed. 2d 309 (1972). Mr. Justice Brennan again dissented and again was joined by Justices Douglas and Marshall. As appears from the dissenting opinion, the State of Oklahoma had convicted the petitioner Grubb in one trial of armed robbery and in a second trial of kidnapping. Both the offenses had arisen from the \u201csame transaction\u201d within the meaning of Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s test in his Ashe v. Swenson concurrence.\nThird: In Robinson v. Neil, 109 U.S. 505, 35 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1973), the Supreme Court considered a double jeopardy claim made via federal habeas corpus sought by a state prisoner, a claim which is on all fours with the situation presented by the appeals at bar. The petitioner had been tried and convicted in a municipal court of violation of an ordinance of the City of Chattanooga (assault and battery) and subsequently indicted by a grand jury of assault with intent to commit murder under state law. He pleaded guilty to the state charges, but later attacked the conviction on double jeopardy grounds. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider the question of retroactivity of the decision in Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 25 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1970), and, holding that decision fully retroactive, remanded for determination of \u201cwhether the state and municipal prosecutions were actually for the same offense109 U.S. at 511 (emphasis added). Once more Mr. Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Douglas and Marshall, dissented. This dissenting opinion took the position that Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s proposed rule of constitutionally compelled joinder would require the prosecutor \u201cto join at one trial all the charges against a defendant that grow ont of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction.\u201d 409 U.S. at 511.\nRobinson v. Neil can only be read as holding that successive prosecutions for different offenses arising from the same transaction, however defined, are constitutionally permissible, the views of the three dissenting members of the Court to the contrary notwithstanding. Ciucci v. Illinois, in other words, is today the existing constitutional law on the subject.\nUnder our federal system, of course, this Court undertakes to pronounce federal law only when the highest authority in that field, the Supreme Court of the United States, has not spoken to the issue. Here that is not the ease; the issue which the majority has today framed and answered in the affirmative\u2014whether the federal constitution contains a rule requiring joinder of admittedly separate offenses arising from the \u201csame criminal episode\u201d\u2014has already been answered for us in the negative. Ciucci v. Illinois, supra. The Court\u2019s failure to recognize this fact, in my view, bids fair to disturb in a serious manner the allocation of power as between our State courts and the United States Supreme Court.\nThe Court does not purport to bottom its decision on any theory of Pennsylvania as distinguished from federal constitutional law. Nor could it do so without overruling our prior cases. As the opinion of the Court points out, we have heretofore construed the Double Jeopardy Clause of our own Constitution, Art. I, \u00a710, as applicable only to \u201ccapital offenses.\u201d Commonwealth v. Baker, 413 Pa. 105, 196 A. 2d 382 (1964); McCreary v. Commonwealth, 29 Pa. 323 (1857). None of the offenses involved in the cases now before us is \u201ccapital.\u201d\nEven were we to construe our Double Jeopardy Clause in such a way as to make it applicable to all offenses, I would not favor announcing a rule of compulsory joinder (such as that set forth today) as a matter of state constitutional law for two reasons:\nFirst: There is a vital and palpable distinction between being\u2014(a) on the one hand twice convicted and twice punished for the \u201csame offense\u201d or in being convicted and punished following an earlier acquittal of the \u201csame offense\u201d (areas in which the Fifth Amendment traditionally operates), and (b) on the other hand, twice made to appear in court to answer to two separate charges that the State would admittedly be entitled to press in a single prosecution. To equate the two is to say that being convicted and imprisoned is an imposition of the same order as being made to attend a judicial proceeding. Clearly, however, these detriments are not of the same order, and while it is doubtless wise to have a prohibition against the former written into the Constitution as a principle of fundamental fairness shared by all civilized people, the latter is not of that fundamental dimension required for a constitutional precept.\nSecond-. There is our well-founded reluctance to decide issues of constitutional law (or at least novel issues of constitutional law) when disposition can be had on some other adequate ground. As we are empowered to adopt rules of criminal procedure, it is both unnecessary and unwise for us to proceed by the more rigid and inflexible route of constitutional adjudication. We have only recently recognized that the rule-adoption route is the better alternative. Commonwealth v. Milliken, 450 Pa. 310, 300 A. 2d 78 (1973). Cf. Commonwealth v. Phelps, 450 Pa. 597, 301 A. 2d 678 (1973). I mention below briefly my preference for what such a rule should contain were we to adopt one.\nThe majority has made mention in its opinion of two different rules proposed by highly respected institutions\u2014the American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice and the American Law Institute. The ALI proposes, in brief, that joinder should be required \u201cfor multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal episode. . . .\u201d The American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards, however, would afford the defendant the right to request joinder if the charges are \u201cbased on the same conduct or arise from the same criminal episode.\u201d\nThe majority adopts the ALI proposal as constitutionally required; joinder will be the rule and severance can be obtained only if the defendant can \u201cdemonstrate prejudice.\u201d Although I have no more information than does the majority on the subject of defendants\u2019 attitudes toward multiple trials, I strongly suspect that many defendants will regard a single trial of multiple offenses as having the proverbial book thrown at them. It appears possible to me that clustering into one trial all chargeable offenses arising from a single criminal episode will work to the detriment of a sizeable number of defendants in that it may discourage the assertion of other fundamental rights (such as the right to plead not guilty and to demand a jury trial). If a defendant does intend to assert these rights at least as to some of the offenses, he will doubtless regard the presence of a multitude of charges as a distinct embarrassment and Avill consequently move for severance. Because the mere fact of joinder of multiple offenses cannot possibly be tbe prejudice of which the majority speaks (since the joinder is now constitutionally required), a hearing will be necessary to determine whether the defendant is sufficiently prejudiced by the joinder to be entitled to severance. To require yet another hearing in the tortuous process of criminal procedure is unlikely to conserve judicial resources. I am therefore highly doubtful that the goals of the majority\u2014\u201cconservation] of precious judicial and professional manpower as well as the time of jurors, witnesses, and the use of public resources\u201d\u2014will be realized.\nTo my mind the better (but, by today\u2019s decision, unconstitutional) approach is that of the American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice. The ABA proposal would bar the prosecutor from pursuing a defendant in multiple prosecutions by the simple expedient of empowering the defendant to require joinder of separate offenses arising from the same criminal episode. Adoption of this device (1) would not burden judicial resources because the defendant could regulate joinder or severance without the necessity of a hearing, and (2) would cure whatever unfairness and hardship inheres in multiple prosecutions for different offenses arising from the same episode. Furthermore, if the rule proved deficient in operation, then this Court would be at liberty to alter it as it might see fit.\nAdoption of a rule of criminal procedure granting a defendant the right to request joinder, however, would be of no benefit to appellants in the cases at bar. It would be necessary therefore to decide the instant appeals by reaching the question which appellants actually argued before this Court: whether they had been twice prosecuted for the same offense in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. Resolution of that question is beyond the scope of this dissenting opinion; the general approach is sketched in the margin.\nI note, finally, that the excursion into constitutional law which the Court now undertakes will predate the effectiveness of this state\u2019s new Crimes Code, Act of December 6, 1972, P. L. 1482, 18 P.S. \u00a7101 et seq., by only two months. That Code (effective June 6, 1973) contains provisions on compulsory joinder which, would accomplish as a matter of state statutory law what the Court here does (erroneously aud unecessarily, as I think) by interpretation of the federal constitution.\nIn sum, the Court\u2019s holding that the federal constitution compels joinder in one trial of different offenses arising out of the same criminal episode is not only incorrect, but is also unwise as a matter of constitutional law in general, and is unresponsive to any argument made to this Court by the parties. Beyond this, it preempts an area which could be better handled by adopting a rule of criminal procedure, or, in light of the Crimes Code provision cited supra, by leaving the matter to the Legislature. It is for these reasons that I dissent.\nIt seems to me clear that today\u2019s decision has the effect of declaring unconstitutional Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 219, a rule promulgated by this Court:\n\u201c(a) Where murder is alleged in an indictment, no other counts may be joined in the indictment except voluntary and involuntary manslaughter.\n\u201c(b) Two or more offenses, of any grade, other than murder, may be charged in the same indictment if they are of the same or similar character or are based on the same act or transaction or on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan. There shall be a separate count for each offense charged.\u201d\nIt well may be that this Court will now feel obliged to invalidate convictions obtained in separate trials by Commonwealth prosecutors who operated in reliance on the permissive nature of our Rule. See note on retroactivity, footnote 5 infra.\nIn Ashe v. Swenson, the defendant had allegedly robbed the several participants in a basement poker game. In Hoag the robbery was of the several patrons of a tavern.\nIt should also be noted that while the Supreme Court has statutory authority to propose changes to existing rules of federal criminal procedure, it has not acted to alter the current language of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a) : \u201c (a) Joinder of offenses: Two or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment or information in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged, whether felonies or misdemeanors or both, are of the same or similar character or are based on the same act or transaction or on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\u201d (Emphasis added). Professor Wright notes that \u201cRule 8(a) is permissive only,\u201d and Professor Moore remarks in 1971 that \u201cthe Advisory Committee on the Criminal Rules has apparently abandoned any intention of amending Rule 8 to provide for compulsory joinder of offenses. ...\u201d 1 C. A. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7143, at 313 (1969) and 8 J. Wm. Moore, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice para. 8.07, at 8-61 (Cum. Supp. 1971).\nBecause the issue here has a controlling federal precedent, the cases cited by the majority in note 40 of its opinion (eases in which this Court has of necessity decided an issue of federal law in an unplowed field) are of no value.\nOne obvious problem created by the majority\u2019s decision to dispose of these appeals on constitutional grounds is the question of retrospective application of this new rule of joinder. Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 23 U. Ed. 2d 707 (1969), which applied the Fifth Amendment to the states, was held fully retroactive in Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S. 323, 26 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1970). Similarly the decision in Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 25 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1970), was hold fully retroactive in Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 35 11. Ed. 2d 29 (1973), discussed in text supra.\nIf today\u2019s decision is likewise to be fully retroactive, we are likely to be confronted by a PCHA petitioner\u2019s claim that his earlier conviction for violation of the Uniform Firearms Act, for example, precluded the Commonwealth from later obtaining the conviction of first degree murder under which he is now imprisoned. Is such a prisoner to be regarded as having been afforded \u201ca relatively painless form of immunity\u201d by the circumstance that the slate happened to prosecute the less serious offense first?\nALI, Model Penal Code \u00a71.07(2) (Proposed Draft 1902).\nABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance \u00a71.3 (Approved Draft 1968).\nMajority Opinion, note 37.\nThe idea that defendants may not regard today\u2019s decision as an unmitigated blessing is evidently shared by two noted commentators on criminal procedure.\nProfessor Wright, after noting that there exist proposals for compulsory joinder of multiple offenses arising from the same criminal transaction, concludes that \u201cthere would be serious difficulties in any such procedure . . . .\u201d 1C. A. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7143, at 313 (1969). Professor Moore would agree: \u201cBy eliminating the opportunity for afterthought, compulsory joinder would deprive the prosecutor of the means to correct what he considers a failure of justice. Thus put on notice that there will be no second chance, the prosecutor\u2019s probable reaction wiU be to multiply and magnify the possible offenses within a single indictment, thereby enhancing the likelihood of conviction, and the chance of cumulative punishment A realistic appraisal of the operation of the adversary system recognizes that any marked shift in the balance of advantage inevitably produces a counteraction. TMs perspective malees one approach the compulsory joinder proposal with some ambivalence.\u201d 8 J. Wm. Moore, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice para. 8.07[3], at 8-64 (emphasis added).\nABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance \u00a71.3, 22 (Approved Draft 1968) (Comment) (emphasis added) : \u201cIt is the judgment of the Advisory Committee that it is preferable to place this burden on the defendant [of requesting joinder], for whose protection this joinder-of-related offenses requirement is intended. In this way the trial court will be spared the necessity of holding a hearing on the question of whether related offenses should be tried together or separately in those cases in which the defendant concludes that it is in his best interests not to attempt to force a joint trial of related offenses. There may be many occasions when the defendant will make this judgment\u201d\nTlie fact that appellants\u2019 first convictions were before a justice of the peace does not affect the operation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 25 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1970). It is therefore open to appellants to argue, as they have, that the second prosecution in the court of common pleas is barred because it was for the \u201csame offense\u201d within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. What is the test for determining when one offense is the \u201csame offense\u201d as another?\nThe federal courts have developed what is generally referred to as the \u201csame evidence\u201d test to determine whether two offenses are the same for double jeopardy analysis. Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1405 (1958) ; Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932) ; United States v. Brisbane, 239 F. 2d 859 (3d Cir. 1956).\nIn Pennsylvania we have developed a doctrine of \u201cmerger\u201d whereby we determine whether one offense necessarily involves another, as, for example, rape involves fornication, and robbery involves both assault and larceny. Commonwealth ex rel. Moszczynski v. Ashe, 343 Pa. 102, 104, 21 A. 2d 920 (1941) ; Commonwealth v. McCusker, 363 Pa. 450, 70 A. 2d 273 (1950) ; Commonwealth v. Comber, 374 Pa. 570, 97 A. 2d 343 (1953). If one offense is found to have \u201cmerged\u201d with another, then prosecution or conviction for the second offense is barred.\nThis Court has not had occasion to consider the question whether, following application of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause to the states in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969), our \u201cmerger\u201d decisions might satisfy the requirements of federal double jeopardy law. Our merger test, however, focuses on the conduct of the defendant rather than on evidentiary considerations and as such is generally thought more lenient to defendants than the \u201csame evidence\u201d tests. See Note, Twice in Jeopardy, 75 Yale L.J. 262, 275 (1965).\nWere the Court to decide these appeals on the question actually presented\u2014whether the second prosecution was for the \u201csame offense\u201d, then I think it would be a matter of applying our merger test.\nSection 110 of the Crimes Code provides (emphasis added) :\n\u201cWhen Prosecution Barred by Former Prosecution for Different Offense\n\u201cAlthough a prosecution is for a violation of a different provision of the statutes than a former prosecution or is based on different facts, it is barred by such former prosecution under the following circumstances:\n\u201c(1) The former prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction as defined in section 109 of this title (relating to when prosecution barred by former prosecution for same offense) and the subsequent prosecution is for:\n\u201c(ii) any offense based on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal episode, if such offense was known to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial and was within the jurisdiction of a single court unless the court ordered a separate trial of the charge of such offense;.. .\u201d",
