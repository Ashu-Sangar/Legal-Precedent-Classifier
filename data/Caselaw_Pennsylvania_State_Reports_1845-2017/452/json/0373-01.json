        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Jones,\nRicky Ricardo Green (Ricky), the son of separated parents, Nathaniel and Ruth Green, was born on September 10,1955, and has had two attacks of poliomyelitis, causing problems of obesity. In addition, Ricky now suffers from paralytic scoliosis (94% curvature of the spine). Ricky\u2019s mother, with whom he lives, consented to a recommended \u201cspinal fusion\u201d to relieve Ricky\u2019s bent position but since she is a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, refused to consent to any blood transfusions which are necessary for surgery. This caused the Director of the State Hospital for Crippled Children at Elizabeth-town, Pennsylvania, to file a \u201cpetition to initiate juvenile proceedings\u201d seeking to have Ricky declared a \u201cneglected child\u201d and himself appointed guardian so that he could consent to the transfusions.\nThe Court of Common Pleas, Family Court Division, Juvenile Branch, of Philadelphia dismissed the petition, following an evidentiary hearing. The Superior Court unanimously reversed and remanded the matter for the appointment of a guardian. Green Oase, 220 Pa. Superior Ct. 191, 286 A. 2d 681 (1970). We granted allocatur.\nIn an opinion filed on June 28, 1972, Green Appeal, 118 Pa. 338, 292 A. 2d 387 (1972), we recognized that although the operation would be beneficial, Ricky\u2019s life was not immediately imperiled by his physical condition. Therefore, as between Ricky\u2019s mother and the state, the state did not have an interest of sufficient magnitude to outweigh the parent\u2019s religious belief. We went further, however, in that in our view the ultimate question was \u201cwhether a parent\u2019s religious beliefs are paramount to the possibly adverse decision of the child.\u201d Since the record at that time gave no indication of Ricky\u2019s thinking, we reversed the Superior Court\u2019s order and remanded the matter to the lower court so that an evidentiary hearing could be held, at which time Ricky\u2019s wishes could be ascertained. Meanwhile we retained our jurisdiction.\nOn March 28,1973, an evidentiary hearing was held. The hearing judge found the following:\n\u201cRicky is a good looking young man of seventeen with a pleasant facial expression. He appeared a little overweight but not obese at this time. He sat erect in his wheelchair without visible appearance of the curvature of his spine. He is in the tenth grade at Widener School and hopes to graduate in June, 1975.\n\u201cHe answered all questions without hesitation and appeared to understand the benefit he might receive from the operation and the possible complications if he did not have it. In view of all the testimony, it is clear that he does not wish to have this operation.\u201d In addition, a review of the notes of testimony of the evidentiary hearing discloses that Ricky\u2019s decision was not based solely on religious grounds. He also stated that he liad been in the hospital a long time already, a.nd that no one \u201csays it is going to come out right.\u201d\nWe find, therefore, that under the circumstances, the Director\u2019s petition was properly dismissed since Ricky was not a \u201cneglected child\u201d within the meaning of the Juvenile Court Law.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed and the order of the Court of Common Pleas, Family Court Division, Juvenile Branch, of Philadelphia is affirmed.\nMr. Justice Eagen, Mr. Justice Roberts and Mr. Justice Pomeroy dissent.\nThis action was taken pursuant to the Juvenile Court Law, Act of June 2, 1933, P. L. 1433, \u00a71 et seq., as amended, 11 P.S. \u00a7243 et seq.\nMr. Justice Eagen filed a dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Roberts and Mr. Justice Pomeeoy joined.",
