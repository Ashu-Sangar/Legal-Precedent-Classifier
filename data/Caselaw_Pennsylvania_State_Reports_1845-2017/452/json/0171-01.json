        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nAppellant, Curtis Davis, was arrested in December of 1968 and charged with murder, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter and robbery. A timely filed pre-trial motion to suppress evidence was denied. Thereafter, on September 25, 1969, appellant was adjudged guilty, by a jury, of murder, voluntary manslaughter and two counts of robbery. Appellant was sentenced, by the jury, to death on the murder conviction, and from ten to twenty years imprisonment, by the court, on the robbery convictions. Post-trial motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial were denied. This direct appeal followed. We now reverse and remand for a new trial.\nAppellant contends that the assistant district attorney committed reversible error by attempting to create an impermissible adverse inference in the minds of the jurors regarding appellant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights at trial. Appellant alleges that this was accomplished by the prosecutor\u2019s persistent references in his closing argument, over objection, to the evidence against the defendant being \u201cuncontroverted.\u201d Review of the record supports appellant\u2019s contention that the prosecution\u2019s repeated use of the words \u201cuncontroverted\u201d and \u201cuncontroverted fact\u201d created an adverse inference prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Article 1, \u00a79 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and the Act of May 23, 1887.\nIt is well settled that the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489 (1964), forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence at trial or instructions by the court that such is evidence of guilt. Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S. Ct. 1229 (1965). \u201cUpon the present record, [we] believe that the prosecutorial comment about the \u2018uncontradicted\u2019 [or \u2018uncontroverted\u2019] nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s case runs directly afoul of the Griffin prohibition.\u201d Commonwealth v. Allen, 445 Pa. 156, 159, 281 A. 2d 634, 635 (1971) (Roberts, J., dissenting from an opinionless per curiam affirmance, joined by Eag-en, J., and O\u2019Brien, J.).\nHere, where appellant neither testified at trial nor offered any other defense, the \u201c. . . prosecutor\u2019s statement [s] implied that the . . . [defendant himself ivas] the only [one] who could and should have denied the charges against [him]. The jury might reasonably have inferred from [these] statement [s] that [his] failure to do so was evidence of [his] guilt.\u201d Commonwealth v. Reichard, 211 Pa. Superior Ct. 55, 60, 233 A. 2d 603, 606 (1967). Such an inference is patently contrary to the mandate of Griffin, supra.\nAs th.e First Circuit recently stated in United States v. Flannery, 451 F. 2d 880, 881-82 (1971) : \u201c. . . [W]e [have] held that for the government to say, in summation to the jury, that certain of its evidence was \u2018uncontradicted,\u2019 when contradiction would have required the defendant to take the stand, drew attention to his failure to do so, and hence was unconstitutional comment. Desmond v. United States, 1 Cir., 1965, 345 F. 2d 225. We do not adopt the reasoning of those courts which state, as it seems to us, ingenuously, that to say that the government\u2019s witnesses\u2019 testimony was uncontradicted is simply a statement of historical fact. There are many \u2018facts\u2019 which are benign in themselves. The difficulty is that such reference, when only the defendant could have contradicted, clearly calls to the jury\u2019s mind the fact that he failed to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added) (Footnotes omitted).

Ct. 1362.\nOn this record, where appellant did not testify and offered no other witnesses or evidence at trial, it would be an act of sophistry to conclude that the remarks of the assistant district attorney could have been taken as anything other than a reference to the fact that appellant, and appellant alone, failed to rebut the evidence against him. The prosecutor\u2019s attempt to have the jury equate appellant\u2019s guilt with his silence at trial was improper. Such comments, even by implication, are violative of Griffin, supra. See also Hand-man, supra.\nNot only were appellant\u2019s rights under the United States Constitution violated, but also his rights under Article 1, \u00a79 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and the Act of May 23, 1887 which implements it. It is well settled that any comment by the prosecution or the court violates the Act of 1887 if it \u201c. . . draws attention to or focuses on the fact that no one except the defendant can rebut the Commonwealth\u2019s case. . . .\u201d Reichard, supra at 58, 233 A. 2d at 604. It is obvious, on this record, that the prosecutor\u2019s comments clearly did that which is prohibited by the Act. \u201cWe think the assistant district attorney went too far, both under the Act of 1887 and under the Fifth Amendment proscription as enunciated in Griffin.\u201d Commonwealth v. Camm, 443 Pa. 253, 268, 277 A. 2d 325, 333 (1971).\nWe hold that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were error, and also that they were harmful error, necessitating the grant of a new trial. On this record, the prosecution\u2019s comments cannot be held to be \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\nOur analysis of the gravity and impact of the error is guided by two general precepts. First, \u201c. . . before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 828 (1967). See Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 251, 89 S. Ct. 1726, 1727 (1969); Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S. 427, 92 S. Ct. 1056 (1972). This reasonable doubt standard reflects a fundamental belief that once constitutional error has been established, it is far worse to conclude incorrectly that the error was harmless than it is to conclude incorrectly that the error was reversible. Cf. In Re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068 (1970).\nThe second general precept with which we approach the determination of whether a particular constitutional error was harmless is that the burden is on the Commonwealth to establish that the error was harmless. Chapman v. California, supra at 24, 26, 87 S. Ct. at 828, 829; Fontaine v. California, 390 U.S. 593, 596, 88 S. Ct. 1229, 1231 (1968). It should be noted that placing the burden on the Commonwealth is in accordance with \u201cthe original common-law harmless-error rule [that] put the burden on the beneficiary of the error either to prove that there ivas no injury or to suffer a reversal of his erroneously obtained judgment.\u201d Chapman v. California, supra, 386 U.S. at 18,20-23, 87 S. Ct. at 828 (citing 1 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a721 (3d ed. 1940).\nKeeping these precepts in mind, we must determine whether \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility\u201d that the constitutional error \u201cmight have contributed to the conviction.\u201d Chapman v. California, supra, 386 U.S. at 24, 87 S. Ct. at 828. If there is such a possibility, the constitutional error is reversible. But if there is no reasonable possibility that the constitutional error might have moved \u201cthe minds of an average jury\u201d toward conviction, then it can be said that the error was harmless.\nCases subsequent to Chapman have established one exception to the general proposition that if there is a reasonable possibility that the constitutional error might have contributed to the conviction, the error cannot be harmless. That exception is presented by those cases where the \u201cproperly admitted evidence of guilt is so overwhelming, and the prejudicial effect of the . . . [constitutional error] is so insignificant by comparison, that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the . . . [constitutional error] was harmless error.\u201d Schneble v. Florida, supra at 430, 92 S. Ct. at 1059; see Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S. Ct. 1726 (1969).\nIt should be emphasized that a conclusion that the properly admitted evidence is \u201cso overwhelming,\u201d and the prejudicial effect of the constitutional error is \u201cso insignificant\u201d by comparison, that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error is harmless, is not to be arrived at lightly. For the effect of such a conclusion is to affirm a conviction where it is conceded that an error of constitutional proportions contributed in some degree to the conviction. In addition, such a conclusion operates to undermine \u201cthe deterrent effect of such cases as Mapp v. Ohio; Griffin v. California; Miranda v. Arizona; United States v. Wade; and Bruton v. United States, on the actions of both police and prosecutors, not to speak of trial courts. . . .\u201d Harrington v. California, supra, 395 U.S. at 255, 89 S. Ct. at 1729 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).\nApplying these standards to the present case, we do not believe that the Commonwealth has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the constitutional error present in this case was harmless. The Commonwealth, during its closing address to the jury, thoroughly exploited appellant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right not to take the witness stand. The prosecutor argued that \u201c'under the uncontroverted facts the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant is guilty of murder in the first degree and robbery.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The prosecutor also repeatedly used the term \u201cuncontroverted\u201d or \u201cuncontroverted facts\u201d at least three other times in referring to portions of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. This argument was obviously calculated to move the jury toward conviction: \u201cIndeed, the very persistence of the government in making these remarks is proof that it attached much importance to them.\u201d Rodriguez-Bandoval, supra at 581. We must conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that the prosecutor\u2019s unconstitutional argument \u201cmight have contributed to the conviction.\u201d\nWe also do not believe that the evidence against appellant in this case can be characterized as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d The only witness who could definitely identify appellant at the trial had been unable to identify appellant at a pre-trial lineup. One other witness was unable to identify appellant at all. The murder weapon was linked to appellant only by showing that it was found at an apartment belonging to a woman described by one witness as appellant\u2019s girl friend, an apartment to which appellant had a key and near which appellant\u2019s car was observed some two and one-half hours after the shooting. Ownership of the weapon was never proved by the Commonwealth. The only other evidence against appellant was a tan hood and a dark jacket, found at the same apartment, which were by no means unique but which were similar to the hood and jacket which two eyewitnesses described the perpetrator as wearing. Although the case against appellant was reasonably strong, it nevertheless is certainly a case in which \u201chonest, fair-minded jurors might very well have brought in not guilty verdicts.\u201d Chapman v. California, supra, 386 U.S. at 26, 87 S. Ct. at 829.\nThe judgment of sentence is reversed and a new trial granted.\nMr. Justice Eagsn concurs in the result.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones dissents.\nAppellant also contends that additional errors were committed by the trial court and that certain evidence, allegedly illegally seized, should have been suppressed. Appellant also challenges the legality of his arrest However, in view of our disposition, we need not decide these issues.\n\u201cNo person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\" U. S. Const Amend. V.\n\u201c[The accused] cannot be compelled to give evidence against himself . . . .\u201d Pa. Const. Art. I, \u00a79.\n\u201cExcept defendants actually upon trial in a criminal court, any competent witness may be compelled to testify in any proceeding, civil or criminal; but he may not be compelled to answer any question which, in the opinion of the trial judge, would tend to criminate him; nor may the negleet or refusal of any defendant, actually upon trial in a criminal court, to offer himself as a witness be treated as creating any presumption against him, or be adversely referred to by court or counsel during the trial.\u201d P. L. 158, \u00a710, 19 P.S. \u00a7631.\n\u201cAs the Supreme Court stated in Griffin, the presumption of innocence in favor of a defendant in a criminal case is seriously jeopardized by any comment concerning his silence. Realistically, the defendant\u2019s words and actions will be viewed with a critical eye if he chooses to testify. \u2018It is not everyone who can safely venture on the witness stand though entirely innocent of the charge against him. Excessive timidity, nervousness when facing others, and attempting to explain transactions of a suspicious character, and offenses charged against him, will often confuse and embarrass him to such a degree as to increase rather than remove prejudices against him. It is not everyone, however honest, who would, therefore, willingly be placed on the witness stand.\u2019 Wilson v. United States, 149 U.S. 60 at 66 (1893). A defendant may refuse to testify for reasons wholly unrelated to his innocence or guilt. Consequently, permitting comment upon the defendant\u2019s failure to testify subjects the accused to the hard choice of testifying or running the risk of a jury\u2019s unwarranted inference of guilt from his silence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Reichard, 211 Pa. Superior Ct. 55, 59-60, 233 A. 2d 603, 605 (1967) (footnotes omitted).\nThe use of the word \u201cuncontroverted\u201d in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was error for another reason, since the defendant at trial need not affirmatively deny any allegation at all. There is always a jury question as to every issue, except those expressly conceded, on which the government has the burden. See, e.g., Minor v. United States, 445 F. 2d 637 (8th Cir. 1971) ; United States v. Alessio, 439 F. 2d 803 (1st Cir. 1971) ; DeCecco v. United States, 338 F. 2d 797 (1st Cir. 1984).\nSee notes 3 and 4, supra.\nIt should also be noted that federal standards govern what constitutional error must be considered prejudicial. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 21, 87 S. Ct. 824, 826-27 (1967).\nHarrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S. Ct. 1726, 1728 (1969).\nAt one point in summation the prosecutor stated: \u201cIt is also uncontroverted that Curtis Davis received a paper bag from Mr. Darlak and said something, I can\u2019t remember the exact word, but it is something like, I am going to give you this, or words to that effect, and then fired two shots in quick succession.\n\u201cYou can find from this series of uncontroverted facts, members of the jury, that Mr. Davis, the defendant here, was in fact robbing Mr. Darlak at the time, . . .\u201d Clearly, these statements could only have been made by the prosecutor in the hope that the jury would infer that appellant, by failing to testify, was admitting his guilt.\n\u201cIn such a case we are unwilling to allow the government to act improperly and then avoid reversal by the unprovable assertion that grievous prejudice probably did not result.\u201d Rodriguez-Sandoval v. United States, 409 F. 2d 529, 531 (1st Cir. 1969).",

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. J ustice Pomeroy :\nI cannot agree that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word \u201cuneontroverfced\u201d in his closing argument to the jury constituted adverse comment upon appellant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights, as interpreted in Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1965).\nFor the remarks of a prosecuting attorney to be impermissible for this reason, it must appear that \u201cthe language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u201d Knowles v. United States, 224 F. 2d 168, 170 (10th Cir. 1955). The question, therefore, is whether the jury would so understand the use of the word \u201cuncontroverted\u201d. The word \u201ccontrovert\u201d means \u201cto dispute or oppose by reasoning; to deny; contradict.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language, 2d Ed. (1942). \u201cUncontroverted\u201d means, obviously, that something is not disputed or opposed by reasoning, or is not denied, or not contradicted. It is the most natural thing in the world for any lawyer in his summation to point out that salient points of his client\u2019s case have not been disputed or denied, or that important testimony has not been contradicted. This is a fact of the case as it then stands; the lawyer is but giving emphasis to what is already known to the fact finder.\nTo hold that this kind of remark, without more, and particularly without any reference to the refusal of the defendant to testify or any indication that only the defendant could do the controverting, is an adverse comment on the defendant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right seems to me to be stretching things unduly. The holding converts the use of a factual, colorless word into a pejorative adverse commentary. To go farther and declare, as does the Court, that the thrice repeated use of \u201cuncontroverted\u201d in a lengthy summation argument \u201cthoroughly exploited\u201d the exercise of the defendant\u2019s right not to testify seems to me to be an insupportable extravagance. If, as the Court\u2019s opinion states, to view the word uncontrovei*ted thus innocently is an \u201cact of sophistry\u201d, so be it.\nContrary to the implication of the majority opinion, the federal courts are far from uanimous in finding error where the prosecutor comments on the uncontroverted nature of the evidence and only the defendant could have contradicted it. The opposite, and in my mind better, view has been expressed at some length by Judge Friendly in United States ex rel. Leak v. Follette, 418 F. 2d 1266, 1268 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1050: \u201cNeither the language, the history, nor the policy of the self-incrimination clause affords support for the surprising proposition that in declaring that no person \u2018shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\u2019 the authors of the Bill of Rights intended to prohibit proper advocacy concerning the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. This is quite different from specific comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand. The remarks of the prosecutor and the judge in Griffin were held to violate the privilege because the California rule permitting them was \u2018in substance a rule of evidence that allows the State the privilege of tendering to the jury for its consideration the failure of the accused to testify.\u2019 380 U.S. at 613, 85 S. Ct. at 1232. The thought was that \u2018when the court solemnizes the silence of the accused into evidence against him,\u2019 id. at 614, 85 S. Ct. at 1233, the state is in practical effect exercising the compulsion the Fifth Amendment forbids. As against this, presumably no one would argue that the self-incrimination clause in any way inhibits the state\u2019s production of evidence, even evidence which no one but the defendant can successfully contradict. If the state is free to do this, it must also be free to engage in normal advocacy so long as it does not point a finger at the accused\u2019s remaining silent in the courtroom. It is one thing to prevent the state from making capital of the defendant\u2019s invocation of the constitutional privilege but quite another to say that an accused who avails himself of it is entitled to impose on the prosecution shackles that would be unavailable to a man who testifies in his own defense. The Fifth Amendment was not aimed at the kind of \u2018compulsion\u2019 generated by the evidence and fair argument about it. Indeed it was a recognition of the plight of the defendant who was unable to take the stand that led to the enactment of statutes by almost every state, beginning with Maine in 1864, and by the United States, Act of March 16, 1878, 20 Stat. 30, now 18 U.S.C. \u00a73481, making him competent to testify on his request; generally, these statutes also provided, in the language of the federal act, that \u2018his failure to make such request shall not create any presumption against him.\u2019 See Reeder, Comment on Failure of Accused to Testify, 31 Mich. L. Rev. 40 (1932).\u201d Accord, United States v. Lipton, 467 F. 2d 1161 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 927; United States v. Cox, 428 F. 2d 683 (7th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 881; Doty v. United States, 416 F. 2d 887 (10th Cir. 1968), vacated sub. nom.; Epps v. United States, 401 U.S. 1006 (1971); Peeples v. United States, 341 F. 2d 60 (5th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 988; Jordan v. United States, 324 F. 2d 178 (5th Cir. 1963); Garcia v. United States, 315 F. 2d 133 (5th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 855. See generally Anno., 14 A.L.E. 3d 723 and cases cited therein.\nInnocent words can, no donbt, be given evil meanings by the way they are said, the gestures and facial expressions that accompany their utterance, and indeed the entire setting surrounding the speaking. It is, I suppose, at least theoretically possible to commit a Griffin violation in such a way, but there would have to be some evidence of the circumstance beyond the innocent spoken word. Here there was none.\nWhile normally my disagreement with the Court\u2019s opinion, as above expressed, would cause this opinion to be labelled as a dissent, there is another issue in this case which causes me to agree that a new trial should be awarded. Appellant challenges the introduction into evidence of a hooded jacket and .32 caliber revolver, both seized at his girlfriend\u2019s apartment pursuant to a search warrant and identified at trial as belonging to the gunman who murdered Chester Darlak. The warrant was issued on the basis of sworn oral and unrecorded testimony presented by the police to the magistrate. For reasons set out at length in my dissenting opinion in Commonwealth v. Milliken, 450 Pa. 310, 318, 300 A. 2d 78 (1973), it is my belief that such a procedure is violative of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. See also my dissenting opinion in Commonwealth v. Bedford & Hughes, 451 Pa. 325, 304 A. 2d 453 (1973). On this ground alone X concur in the Court\u2019s grant of a new trial.\nAs noted in United States ex rel. Leak v. Follette, supra, even courts purporting to follow the rule announced today by the majority have been very resourceful in thinking of persons other than the defendant who could have contradicted the prosecution\u2019s evidence. So in the present case, alibi witnesses could have been called to testify that appellant was elsewhere at the time Chester Darlak was shot and killed in his grocery store. See United States v. McClain, 469 F. 2d 68 (3d Cir. 1972).",
