        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Robebts,\nOn December 20, 1970, Catherine E. Nunnamaker died leaving a will dated July 11, 1947, in which W. Franklin Nunnamaker, her husband and appellee here, was named as executor and sole beneficiary. Several months prior to decedent\u2019s death she and her husband had become estranged. The record shows that decedent and her husband had been owners of several savings accounts and a safe deposit box, all of which were titled in their joint names and held as tenants by the entirety. During October of 1970, the husband withdrew all of the assets from these accounts and the safe deposit box and transferred them to other accounts in his name alone, without the knowledge or consent of his wife.\nIn December, 1970, shortly before his wife\u2019s death, the husband separated from his wife and instituted an action for divorce in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County. To protect her interests during this period, the decedent retained the services of appellant, A. Groh Schneider, as an attorney. Prior to Mrs. Nunnamaker\u2019s death, appellant and Mr. Nunnamaker\u2019s attorneys had been engaged in negotiating a property settlement. However, before any agreement could be reached Mrs. Nunnamaker died.\nDecedent\u2019s will was admitted to probate in the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas on December 28, 1971, and letters testamentary were granted to appellee. He filed the inventory on January 24, 1972, and listed only four items of tangible personal property with a total value of $900.00. On February 17, 1972, appellant, claiming to be a creditor of the wife\u2019s estate for legal services rendered prior to her death, filed objections to the inventory. Appellant claimed that the husband-executor had failed to include in the inventory his wife\u2019s interests in the various savings accounts and other stocks and bonds, held by the entirety, which appellee had removed from the joint accounts and the joint safe deposit box during decedent\u2019s lifetime.\nA hearing was held on these objections before the orphans\u2019 court division and on December 6, 1972, the court entered a decree dismissing appellant\u2019s objections. Appellant then appealed. We now quash the appeal and remand to the orphans\u2019 court division.\nAppellant argues that appellee\u2019s actions converting the entireties assets to his own account without the consent of his co-tenant constituted a \u201cfictional\u201d offer to terminate the tenancy by the entirety. He further contends that decedent\u2019s actions subsequent to the complaint in divorce filed by her husband constituted an acceptance of that \u201cfictional\u201d offer and thereby terminated all aspects of the tenancy by the entirety, entitling each party to half the assets of the tenancy. In these circumstances, argues appellant, the appellee holds one-half of the entireties property as a constructive trustee for the benefit of his spouse\u2019s estate.\nAt this stage of the proceedings we need not resolve appellant\u2019s claim because the dismissal of appellant\u2019s objections to the inventory is not a final decree determining ownership of property, and hence is not appealable. See Donsavage Estate, 420 Pa. 587, 590-94 n.3, 218 A. 2d 112, 116 n.3 (1966); cf. Gramm Estate, 420 Pa. 510, 218 A. 2d 342 (1966); Parmer\u2019s Estate, 237 Pa. 229, 85 Atl. 148 (1912).\nIn Roger\u2019s Estate, 379 Pa. 494, 495-96, 108 A. 2d 924, 924-25 (1954), when presented with a similar situation, this Court said: \u201cIn the settlement of a decedent\u2019s estate disputed title to property should not he determined upon exceptions to an inventory and appraisement which happens not to include the property claimed on behalf of the estate. The function and object of an inventory and appraisement in a decedent\u2019s estate is to fix presumptively the existence of property in the possession of the fiduciary and the value thereof. This is only prima facie evidence of ownership and value. Such listing does not affect the true ownership and value: Stewart\u2019s Estate, 137 Pa. 175, 20 A. 554; Moore\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 211 Pa. 338, 60 A. 987; Hermann\u2019s Estate, 226 Pa. 543, 75 A. 731; Fleming\u2019s Estate, 10 Dist. 259 (Penrose, J.). The question of ownership is of interest to creditors, federal and state taxing authorities, and others. Such title, therefore, should not be finally determined until after an audit, with due statutory notice, and the determination by the orphans\u2019 court whether or not a substantial issue of fact exists.\u201d Accord, Higbee v. Koziol, 383 Pa. 116, 117 A. 2d 707 (1955).\nThe trial court, in its opinion purported to determine the title to the questioned assets. However, our cases hold that it is not appropriate to make that determination on objections to inventory. Since title to the disputed assets is not adjudicated at the inventory juncture of the administration of the decedent\u2019s estate, this appeal is premature. See Act of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, art. II, \u00a7202, 17 P.S. \u00a7211.202 (Supp. 1972).\nAccordingly, the appeal is quashed and the matter remanded to the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County for proceedings consistent with this opinion and the orderly administration of the decedent\u2019s estate.\nEach party to pay own costs.\nThe Court in Donsavage Estate, 420 Pa. 587, 590-91 n.3, 218 A. 2d 112, 116 n.3 (1966), said that \u201c. . . a decree directing the filing of an inventory is not appealable,\u201d basing its decision on Parmer\u2019s Estate, 237 Pa. 229, 85 Atl. 148 (1912). Parmer\u2019s Estate, held only that a \u201cdecree ... directing the executors to file an account is not a final decree from which an appeal lies: . . .\u201d Id. at 231, 85 Atl. at 148. The decree in Parmer\u2019s Estate and the decree here, dismissing appellant\u2019s objections to the inventory, are procedurally analogous and must be treated identically for purposes of appellate review. Compare Williams\u2019 Estate, 338 Pa. 98, 12 A. 2d 103 (1940).\nThe proper t\u00edme for settling the claims of all creditors is at the audit and accounting of the estate. Fiduciaries Act of 1949, Act of April 18, 1949, P. L. 512, Art. VI, \u00a7\u00a7611-623, 20 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7320.611-623, repealed and replaced, Act of June 30, 1972, P. L. 508, 20 Pa.S. \u00a7\u00a73381-93 (Supp. 1972) ; see 2 Hunter, Pennsylvania Orphans\u2019 Court Commonplace Booh 20-21 (1959).",
