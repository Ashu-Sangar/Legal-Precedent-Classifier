        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nAppellant was indicted for the murders of two women in Berks County. His trial began on March 13, 1972, and on March 20,1972, at the end of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, appellant, while represented by counsel, entered guilty pleas to both counts of murder. After a colloquy between appellant and the court, the pleas were accepted. On June 22, 1972, appellant was called for sentencing, at which time appellant stated that he was not guilty of the crimes charged and that he wished to withdraw his guilty plea. After taking testimony from appellant that because of language difficulties and \u201cemotional pressure\u201d caused by so many accusations of guilt against him, appellant\u2019s plea was not knowing and voluntary, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion and sentenced him to two consecutive terms of four to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment and eight to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment respectively. This appeal followed.\nThe sole question raised by this appeal is whether the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw Ms guilty plea.\nIn Commonwealth v. Forbes, 450 Pa. 185, 191, 299 A. 2d 268 (1973), we stated: \u201c... in determining whether to grant a pre-sentence motion for withdrawal of a guilty plea, \u2018the test to be applied by trial courts is fairness and justice.\u2019 [Citing case.] If the trial court finds \u2018any fair and just reason\u2019, withdrawal of the plea before sentence should be freely permitted, unless the prosecution has been \u2018substantially prejudiced.\u2019 \u201d See also Commonwealth v. Santos, 450 Pa. 492, 301 A. 2d 829 (1973).\nAlthough the court based its decision to refuse appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw Ms guilty plea on a finding that appellant\u2019s claim that he did not fully understand the nature and consequences of his plea was not to be believed, this would not in itself be controlling on the issue of whether to permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea before sentencing in the absence of a showing of prejudice. As we said in Santos, supra'. \u201cA trial court, [in prcsentence situations], abuses its discretion by not allowing a guilty plea to be freely withdrawn prior to sentencing when the Commonwealth would not be substantially prejudiced by the plea withdrawal.\u201d At page 496.\nHowever, in the instant case, appellant did not plead guilty until after the Commonwealth had presented its case in chief. Prejudice to the Commonwealth, under such circumstances, although difficult to prove, may be a very real possibility. Appellant would obtain an unfair advantage by being allowed, together with his counsel, a full preview of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence before deciding upon their trial strategy. Similarly, appellant\u2019s actions, if allowed to succeed, might be a means of obtaining an entirely new jury for a defendant anytime he feels that the jury originally selected is not favorably disposed to his cause, even though there were no grounds for a mistrial.\nConsidering the possibility that prejudice might exist under these circumstances, the court committed no abuse of discretion in refusing to permit the appellant to withdraw his plea after holding a full bearing on appellant\u2019s allegation.\nThis case is somewhat similar to the case of United States v. De Cavalcante, 449 F. 2d 139 (3rd Circuit 1971), where the defendant had originally pled not guilty and had gone through various pretrial proceedings. His trial date was set and in the interim he changed his plea to guilty. During the period of time defendant was awaiting sentencing, various other charges against him had been dropped and other convictions were reversed. When he was called for sentencing on the charge he had plead guilty to, he moved to withdraw his plea. This motion was denied by the District Court. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court, stating: \u201c. . . it would be prejudicial and unfair to the prosecution to permit a withdrawal of the guilty plea. This consideration could not have been decisive if the original acceptance of the guilty plea had been improper or improvident. But the district court, after full and careful inquiry, found that the guilty plea was entered voluntarily and knowingly, without any misunderstanding, misrepresentation or improper inducement. Therefore, it was within allowable judicial discretion to view the present unchallenged indication of significant potential prejudice to the prosecution as decisive against allowing a withdrawal of the plea.\u201d At page 141.\nSince the record in the instant case fully supports the court\u2019s finding that appellant originally decided to plead guilty because \u201che felt that the Commonwealth\u2019s testimony proved his guilt\u201d (opinion of the trial court) and that this decision was a knowing and voluntary one, we do not find that the court abused its discretion in refusing to allow the withdrawal of the plea.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Manderino concurs in the result.",

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts :\nI concur in the result and agree that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s plea withdrawal request.\nIn Commonwealth v. Forbes, 450 Pa. 185, 191, 299 A. 2d 268, 271 (1973), we held that \u201c[i]f the trial court finds \u2018any fair and just reason\u2019, withdrawal of the plea before sentence should be freely permitted, unless the prosecution has been \u2018substantially prejudiced.\u2019 \u201d Accord, Commonwealth v. Santos, 450 Pa. 492, 301 A. 2d 829 (1973). Cf. Commonwealth v. Starr, 450 Pa. 485, 301 A. 2d 592 (1973).\nHere\u2014as in Forbes and Santos\u2014appellant\u2019s assertion of innocence is a fair and just reason for permitting presentence withdrawal of the guilty plea. However, unlike Forbes and Santos, the record in this case reveals that the Commonwealth was, in fact, substantially prejudiced by reliance upon appellant\u2019s guilty plea. As the majority correctly states, \u201cappellant\u2019s actions, if allowed to succeed, might be a means of obtaining an entirely new jury for a defendant anytime he feels that the jury originally selected is not favorably disposed to his cause, even though there were no grounds for a mistrial.\u201d\nFor this reason alone, I would hold, on this record, that the Commonwealth was prejudiced by reliance upon appellant\u2019s guilty plea. I am unable to conclude \u2014as does the majority\u2014that the \u201cpossibility\u201d of prejudice is a sufficient ground for denying withdrawal. That appellant \u201cwould obtain an unfair advantage by being allowed, together with his counsel, a full preview of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence\u201d is not prejudice. Moreover, on this record, any conclusion that the Commonwealth was prejudiced by the unavailability of witnesses is mere conjecture.\nMr. Justice Nix joins in this concurring opinion,\nIf, in fact, witnesses become unavailable, tbe Commonwealth is permitted to use their testimony at the subsequent proceeding.
