        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Jones :\nJoseph N. Pew, Jr. (settlor) created several inter vivos trusts on June 1, 1932, one of which he funded with 30,000 shares of Sun Oil Company. He directed the trustees that the fund of this particular trust was to be held intact during the lifetime of his wife; that upon her death the trust was to be divided into four shares, one for each of his children; that 20% of the principal of each child\u2019s share was to be paid to him or her upon reaching age 24, another 30% upon reaching age 28, and the remaining 50% upon reaching age 32\u2014the income from the undistributed principal to be payable to the child in the meantime; and that if any child should die before reaching age 24, 28 or 32, the undistributed principal of his or her share was to pass to his or her children or, in default of children, it should be divided among the other shares.\nThe settlor\u2019s wife is still alive and presently receiving all the income from the trust fund. In 1966 Eleanor Glenn Pew Morris, a daughter of the settlor, died at the age of 48. Her four children survived her and are still living. The Internal Revenue Service included an indefeasibly vested one-fourth remainder interest of the trust in the audit of the federal estate tax return for Mrs. Morris\u2019 estate. One of Mrs. Morris\u2019 four children however, filed a petition for a declaratory judgment seeking a ruling on the nature of Mrs. Morris\u2019 remainder interest in the trust. On May 30, 1972, the lower court ruled that she had an indefeasibly vested one-fourth interest. This appeal by Mrs. Morris\u2019 four children followed.\nIn Benson Estate, 447 Pa. 62, 285 A. 2d 101 (1971), this Court construed the interest of Mary Pew Benson, Mrs. Morris\u2019 sister, and held that the principal of her share was not a contingent remainder but rather an interest that vested indefeasibly in the child upon reaching the age of 32 even though the mother was still living. Today a majority of the Court reaffirms its holding in Benson.\nIn my view, the majority opinion in Benson failed to consider a vital phrase in the deed of trust. Paragraph 3 dealt with the disposition of the trust fund after settlor\u2019s wife\u2019s death and began with the words \u201cUpon the death of my said wife\u201d. Whereas the majority passed over these words without comment, my brother Pomeroy properly recognized their fundamental significance. In his dissenting opinion in Benson, he said: \u201cIt seems incontrovertible to me that paragraph 3 ... is flatly conditioned upon the death of the settlor\u2019s wife, Alberta H. Pew. Until that occurs, there is to be no division into shares for children, including this decedent, and all the language of that paragraph, spelling out what happens to each share for children, is so far inoperative. The instrument nowhere expressly gives this decedent any interest of any Mnd in the trust estate, even a right to any portion of income, until the death of her mother; I cannot see the justification for construing it as if it does. In my view, the reading of the majority effectively extirpates the words (Upon the death of my said wife, Alberta H. Pew\u2019, which introduce the third paragraph and constitute a precondition to all of its provisions.\u201d 447 Pa. at 73-74, 285 A. 2d at 107.\nMore importantly, a determination of whether the settlor\u2019s daughters had a contingent or vested remainder should be controlled by Thompson Trust, 363 Pa. 85, 69 A. 2d 112 (1949). In Thompson, a settlor\u2019s deed of an inter vivos trust provided that the trustee was to collect dividends and pay them to settlor\u2019s granddaughter for her life and from and after her death to pay the dividends to her children (settlor\u2019s great grandchildren). As each child reached the age of 21, the trustee was to transfer to each child a pro rata share of stock and, in default of any such child reaching 21, to transfer said stock to the settlor\u2019s heirs. This Court held that the great granddaughter who predeceased her mother, having attained the age of 21 years and 26 days, had a contingent remainder. Tn Thompson, after examining the trust instrument, this Court reasoned that there were no express words of gift independent of the direction and time for transfer. Since the gift was implied from the direction to transfer, it was inseparable from the direction and necessarily partook of the quality of the direction; that is, the gift was to be made to the great granddaughter only if she survived her mother and attained the age of 21. Similarly, the interests of settlor\u2019s daughters in the present case are unquestionably contingent on their surviving their mother and attaining the designated ages.\nBenson concerned a principal share of a different family line and the present appellants were not parties. That decision\u2014a. three-to-two decision\u2014did not reflect the view of a majority of the Court.\ntook no part in tlie consideration or decision in Benson.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Pomeroy :\nThe lower court was of course obliged to decide this case as it did, the trust instrument being the same instrument and the question of interpretation being the identical question that was before this Court in Benson Estate, 447 Pa. 62, 285 A. 2d 101 (1971). In that case this Court, by the narrow vote of three to two, held that the remainder interest of Mary Pew Benson was a vested interest. I was convinced at that time that this decision was in error, and the able arguments put to us in the present case on behalf of the estate of Mrs. Benson\u2019s sister, Eleanor Pew Morris, have but served to confirm my conviction, viz., that whatever \u201cvested\u201d may mean, the interests of the children of this settlor do not qualify as such. I must therefore again dissent from the Court\u2019s interpretation of the deed of trust here involved.\nIt may be said that with respect to the same trust instruments, there cannot be one rule in the case of Mary Pew Benson and another rule in the case of her sister, Eleanor Pew Morris. But the Court\u2019s prior decision is clearly not res judicata, nor is it the \u201claw of the case\u201d with respect to the separate share of Eleanor. Brown Estate, 408 Pa. 214, 183 A. 2d 307 (1962). Although it may seem anomalous to subject the interest of these siblings to different tax treatment, two wrongs do not make a right. I am convinced that the just and proper action for the court now to take is to avoid duplicating the error of Benson. I therefore would uphold the position of the present appellants, and would reverse the decree below.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMe. Justice Mandeeino :\nI respectfully dissent.\nThe main question in this case is not whether the testatrix had a vested or contingent remainder. The main question is whether the testatrix, while living, received any property from the settlor, her father, which was a part of her gross estate at the time of her death. This depends on what the settlor intended as known by his deed of trust. The answer is elea/r. The trust provided that the trustees divide and pay over after the death of the life beneficiary. Words of divide mid pay after a life interest carry an implication of a condition precedent of survivorship. Simes L., The Law of Future Interests, Yol. II, Chapter 24, \u00a7393-395 (1936). In addition, the settlor specifically stated that any principal or income \u201cshall only become the property of the beneficiary when actually received.\u201d These words are unequivocal. How could the testatrix be said to have owned anything from her father\u2019s estate when he unequivocally smd she had nothing until she received it. The spendthrift clause in this case must be read as it reads and it prohibits the inclusion of any property in testatrix\u2019s gross estate until she actually receives that property.\nA vested estate frequently has value during a person\u2019s lifetime. The interest in question in this case gave absolutely nothing of any value to the testatrix during her lifetime and nothing to transmit at her death. The settlor so provided and we should follow his unequivocal statement of intent.",
