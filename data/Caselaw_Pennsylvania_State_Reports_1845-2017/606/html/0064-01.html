Notably, appellant's <em>Brady </em>and fire science claims were presented unsuccessfully in appellant’s federal <em>habeas </em>petition. Appellant had an evidentiary hearing on his <em>habeas </em>claims March 23 and 24, 2003. The district court rejected guilt phase claims April 20, 2004. Thus, appellant could have, in the exercise of due diligence, readily discovered these facts from his own federal <em>habeas </em>proceedings. As these proceedings occurred more than 60 days before he filed this petition, appellant fails to prove this petition satisfies the statutory exceptions to the PCRA’s timeliness requirements.</p>
