Appellant was operating the truck in the course of his employment with Respiratory and Convalescent Specialties, under a motor vehicle insurance policy with Harleysville Insurance Co. Prior to the collision, both vehicles were preparing to turn left at a busy intersection controlled by a stoplight, with Mr. Piontkowski’s car in front of Appellant’s truck. Appellant avers that when the green turning arrow appeared, he began proceeding forward, but took his eyes off the road for a second. When he looked back to the road, he discovered that Mr. Piontkowski’s car had stopped in front of him. Although he applied his brakes, Appellant nonetheless struck Mr. Piontkowski’s car.</p>

If the unidentified car existed and caused the accident, the so-called “phantom vehicle” could constitute an uninsured motor vehicle, under the definition provided in § 1702 of the MVFRL,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The existence of the phantom vehicle, however, was disputed because, while Appellant testified to its existence, Mr. Piontkowski denied it. Moreover, Appellant apparently did not mention the phantom vehicle in the account he provided to the hospital after the accident, nor when filing his workers’ compensation claim with Harleysville, which was also his employer’s workers’ compensation carrier. Additionally, the original police report did not reference a phantom vehicle. Instead, Appellant asserts that when he received the police report several months after the accident he noticed the omission of the phantom vehicle and, in September 2002, requested that the Hanover Police Department correct the report. The request was denied.</p>
    <p id="b335-4" data-blocks='[["BL_335.7",335,[156,1117,1153,959]]]'>Central to the issues before this Court is a dispute concerning whether Appellant notified Harleysville of the accident, including the existence of the phantom vehicle. Although Appellant filed a workers’ compensation claim with Harleysville twenty days after the accident, he did not file a claim for uninsured motor vehicle benefits with Harleysville until June 14, 2002, over eight months after the October 2001 accident, despite a provision in the insurance contract requiring prompt notice and § 1702 of the MVFRL requiring notice within thirty days of the accident. Appellant, however, asserted that he thought Harleysville had notice of the accident and was aware of the surrounding facts as a result of his workers’ compensation claim, especially given that Harleysville told Appellant it was investigating the accident, and sent him to be examined by Harleysville’s doctor. Appellant also assumed that the police report indicated the existence of the phantom vehicle, although, as noted above, it actually did not contain any such information.</p>

A few days later, Appellant filed a Petition for the Appointment of a Neutral Arbitrator. In May 2004, the trial court held a hearing to determine whether an uninsured motor vehicle was involved in the accident and whether Appellant satisfied the notification requirements of the MVFRL and his policy, as resolution of these issues was necessary before a decision could be rendered on the issue of whether the case should be submitted to arbitration.</p>
    <p id="b336-4" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[278,842,1150,737]]]'>At the hearing, Appellant and Mr. Piontkowski testified regarding their memory of the accident. Additionally, the police officer who investigated the accident testified that neither driver reported the involvement of a phantom vehicle at the scene of the accident, but that Appellant had later requested amendment of the police report. The officer also noted that it is not uncommon for those involved in accidents to report differing versions of the facts and to leave out details in the immediate aftermath of a crash. Finally, a representative of Harleysville testified that the first notice provided by Appellant of the potential uninsured motorist claim was not given until June 2002, and that the representative was unaware of Appellant’s related workers’ compensation petition filed with the same insurance company.</p>

In its opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), the trial court stated that it “had the opportunity to [weigh] the testimony of Mr. Piontkowski as opposed to that of [Appellant] and the other witnesses and views [Appellant’s] testimony as being more credible and believable.” Tr. Ct. Op. at 3. It also concluded that Appellant “took steps to notify both Harleysville and the Police Department by verbally telling representatives of Harleysville about the existence of the phantom vehicle after the collision occurred while processing his work<a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>er’s compensation file and he also verbally notified the investigating police officer.” Tr.

First, however, the Superior Court acknowledged that it could not second guess the fact finding of the trial court on the issue of the existence of a phantom vehicle, given that the trial court clearly stated that it found Appellant’s testimony to be credible on that issue. Additionally, the Superior Court noted that it was bound by the trial court’s determination that Appellant reported the accident to the police as soon as practicable because the trial court found credible Appellant’s testimony that he was unaware that the police report did not reference the phantom vehicle and that he attempted to correct the report as soon as he discovered the discrepancy. Conversely, the Superior Court found that the record did not support the trial court’s finding that Appellant “notified his employer as well as Harleysville Insurance of the facts surrounding the collision, including the phantom vehicle” as soon as practicable. Super. Ct. Slip Op. at 7. Instead, the Superi- or Court observed, “nowhere in the record does [Appellant] testify that he verbally notified Harleysville of the phantom vehicle. Rather, he simply asserts that he thought Harleysville was aware of the facts of his case. Merely assuming that Harleysville knew of the phantom vehicle is not enough.” <em>Id. </em>at 8 (internal citation omitted). The Superior Court concluded that the MVFRL required Appellant to notify Harleysville of an accident involving a phantom vehicle within thirty days or as soon as practicable, and that the earliest evidence that Appellant actually provided notice was during a independent medical examination in February 2002. The court concluded that the notice was not sufficient.</p>

Appellant observes that § 1702 is not a notice provision, but a definition provision. The actual notice provision is set forth in the policy, and the policy, drafted by the insurer, triggers the principals of insurance policy construction discussed in <em>Brakeman.</em>

Brief of Appellee at 11. The company notes that the plain language of the definition does not reference the <em>Brakeman </em>demonstration of prejudice requirement prior to the denial of a claim, but instead incorporates the notice provision into the statutory definition of an uninsured motor vehicle. Moreover, it contends that prejudice is inherent absent notice because an insurer, like the police in <em>Foster, </em>cannot investigate the legitimacy of the claim and decide whether to grant benefits if the evidence is stale. It also asserts that the cost containment purpose of the MVFRL is furthered by the notice requirement, as the Court noted in <em>Foster.</em>

We concluded, “We are reluctant, therefore, to allow an insurance company to refuse to provide that which it was paid for unless a sound reason exists for doing so.” <em>Id. </em>at 197.

The Court acknowledged an insurance company’s legitimate need to investigate potentially fraudulent claims, but held, “Where the insurance company’s interests have not been harmed by a late notice ... the reason behind the notice condition in the policy is lacking, and it follows neither logic nor fairness to relieve the insurance company of its obligations under the policy in such a situation.” <em>Id. </em>We thereby refused to allow the insurance company to use a “technical escape-hatch” in its contract to deny coverage when it was not prejudiced by the absence of notice. <em>Id. </em>We instead held “that where an insurance company seeks to be relieved of its obligations under a liability insurance policy on the ground of late notice, the insurance company will be required to prove that the notice provision was in fact breached and that the breach resulted in prejudice to its position.” <em>Id. </em>at 198.</p>

The requirement was not imposed by a statutory scheme to further a public policy interest, but was drafted by the insurer to protect its own interest in being able to conduct timely investigations of claims. The notice provision in <em>Brakeman </em>required the insured to report the accident to the insurer, whereas § 1702 requires reporting to the police or other proper governmental authority, agents independent from the insurer itself. Based on the differing purposes behind the notification provisions in <em>Brakeman </em>and § 1702, we agree with the Superior Court that <em>Brakeman’s </em>prejudice requirement is inapplicable to the notice provision of § 1702.</blockquote>
