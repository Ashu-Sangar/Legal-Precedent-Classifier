Plan A further vests “executive power of the city” in the mayor. 53 P.S. § 41411. Further, the mayor, with Council’s advice and consent, appoints the heads of city departments and is permitted to remove department heads with notice to Council. <em><a href="/pa/512/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="512 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1800454,1800498" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0001-01,/pa/512/0001-02">Id.,</a> </em>§ 41415(c). Plan A thus establishes the mayor as a governing municipal officer and vests the city’s executive power in him. The mayor is one of the “officers or persons having ultimate control” in a city operating pursuant to the mayor-council Plan A form. Black’s Law Dictionary 715 (8th ed. 2004). As the mayor is part of Harrisburg’s governing body, the mayor is entitled to appoint members of the Board, with the advice and consent of Council.</p>

It is well-settled “[w]here an ordinance conflicts with a statute, the will of the municipality as expressed through an ordinance will be respected unless the conflict between the statute and the ordinance is irreconcilable.” <em>Marcincin, </em>at 1326.

The mayor, as executive, has appointment power. The Council attempted to assume this appointment power without holding a referendum to amend Harrisburg’s mayor-council Plan A form of government. Council may not contravene the Optional Third Class City Charter Law selected by Harrisburg’s electorate and substitute its own definition of “governing body.” Otherwise, there would be few mayoral powers which Council could not usurp by ordinance. As the ordinance is irreconcilable with the Optional Third Class City Charter Law, it is void.</p>
