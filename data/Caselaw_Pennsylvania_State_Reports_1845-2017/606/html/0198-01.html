The informant described Brown as a white male, age 27 to 28, standing 5'9" to 5'11", and weighing 150 to 160 pounds. He also stated Brown would be carrying a gun and driving a mid-1990s Ford Taurus with a specific license plate number. Officer McDonnell went to the intersection at the specified time and observed Brown, who matched the informant’s description, driving the vehicle the informant described. He watched Brown leave the vehicle empty-handed, return several minutes later, place a brown paper bag in the trunk, and drive away.</p>
