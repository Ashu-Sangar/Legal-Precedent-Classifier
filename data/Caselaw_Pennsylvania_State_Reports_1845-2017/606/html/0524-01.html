      <em> </em>In <em>Azinger, </em>a husband and wife were injured when the vehicle in which they were riding was struck by one of the defendant’s freight trains.

On appeal, the husband and wife argued that the trial judge erred in directing the cases to be tried together. In rejecting their argument, this Court discussed the various types of consolidation:</p>
    <blockquote id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[323,1055,1110,418]]]'>The court’s action was not such a consolidation of the two proceedings as to merge the two actions into one, but merely an order directing they be tried together in view of the fact that the cases were of the same nature, arose out of the same transaction, and depended in each case upon substantially the same proofs, and was made in the interest of justice and for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary delay and expense.</blockquote>

The term ‘consolidation’ is used in three different senses: First, where all except one of the several actions are stayed until one is tried, in which case the judgment in the one is conclusive as to the others; second, where several actions are combined into one and lose their separate identity and become a single action in which a single judgment is rendered; and, third, where several actions are ordered to be tried together but each retains its separate character and requires the entry of a separate judgment. Failure in many cases to clearly distinguish between these various uses of the word has caused no little apparent confusion in the decisions. Where a technical consolidation takes place, the result is that one verdict is rendered which is conclusive of <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>the entire subjectmatter of the litigation. Consequently, <em>different actions cannot be consolidated unless between the same parties and involving the same subject-matter, issues, and defenses. </em>But where separate actions in favor of or against two or more persons have arisen out of a single transaction, and the evidence by which they are supported is largely the same, although the rights and liabilities of parties may differ, it is within the discretion of the trial judge to order all to be tried together, though in every other respect the actions remain distinct and require separate verdicts and judgments.</blockquote>

Thus, pursuant to the second option described in <em>Azinger, </em>separate actions cannot be consolidated to the extent the actions lose their separate identities and become a single action what we will refer to as “complete consolidation”— unless the actions involve the same parties, subject matter, issues, and defenses.</p>
    <p id="b591-6" data-blocks='[["BL_591.6",591,[151,1266,1153,680]]]'>Although the language of Rule 213(a) suggests that a court may order actions consolidated when the actions involve a common question of law or fact, or arise from the same transaction or occurrence, we conclude that the second option for consolidation under Rule 213(a), relied on by Kincy, is distinct from the <em>complete consolidation </em>implicated in <em>Azinger. </em>We base this determination on several factors. First, in light of the compulsory joinder rules of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, <em>see, e.g., </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. 1020(d),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> there are few, if any, circumstances, in which separate actions would involve identical parties, subject matter, issues, and defenses, such that complete consolidation by a trial court could be contemplated under Rule 213.</p>

      <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>Furthermore, recognizing that the first option specified in Rule 213(a) allows the trial court to “order a joint hearing or trial of any matter in issue in the actions,” this first option is not all-encompassing; indeed, we can conceive of other reasons besides a joint hearing or trial that a trial court may want to consolidate separate actions. For example, the court may choose to consolidate the discovery process for separate actions which involve similar issues of proof or questions of fact. A trial court may also choose to consolidate the actions for procedural or practical reasons, for example, in order that the separate actions proceed on the same time schedule, or before the same trial judge. The second option of Rule 213(a) permits consolidation for such other purposes, even where the actions do not involve identical parties, subject matter, issues, and defenses.</p>
    <p id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[276,1105,1149,576]]]'>Finally, a conclusion that Rule 213(a) contemplates complete consolidation between actions involving non-identical parties, subject matter, issues and defenses, is simply untenable. In ascertaining the intention of the Supreme Court in the promulgation of a rule, it is presumed that we did not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. 128(a). While it may be reasonable to order separate actions filed by different plaintiffs to be consolidated for trial, or, for example, discovery, it seems patently unfair to require different plaintiffs, by complete consolidation of their actions, to join forces as if they filed suit together.</p>
    <p id="b592-6" data-blocks='[["BL_592.6",592,[273,1706,1153,630]],["BL_593.1",593,[160,301,1150,93]]]'>Thus, where a party or trial court seeks complete consolidation of two separate actions, we reaffirm our holding in <em>Azinger </em>that such consolidation cannot be achieved unless the actions involve the same parties, subject matter, issues, and defenses. As the Kincy and Nixon actions did not involve identical parties, under <em>Azinger, </em>the actions could not have been consolidated such 'that the actions lost their separate identities and the pleadings merged. Moreover, as noted above, the type of consolidation contemplated by the second option of Rule 213(a) is not the complete consolidation allowed for under <em>Azinger; </em>therefore, consolidation of the Kincy and Nixon actions under the second option of Rule 213(a) would <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>not result in merger of the pleadings, or the loss of the separate identities of the actions.</p>

Rather, in arguing that the trial court erred in determining that Judge Glazer’s consolidation order did not consolidate the Kincy and Nixon actions for all purposes, Kincy maintains that, under <em>Keefer v.

Thereafter, an administrative judge issued an order consolidating all of the actions into the original divorce action in the family division. The trial court subsequently dismissed one of the civil actions in its entirety, and dismissed several counts of the second civil action.

In analyzing that issue, the Superior Court contemplated the nature of the administrative judge’s consolidation order.

We disagree with Kincy’s interpretation of <em>Mosside. </em>In <em>Mosside, </em>the Monroeville Municipal Council (“Council”) approved a conditional use application filed by Mosside for the construction of a motel, office building, and parking garage, despite a recommendation by the municipality’s planning commission that the application be denied. Thereafter, the board of the planning commission and two of its members, as individuals, filed appeals with the Zoning Hearing Board of Monroeville (“Zoning Board”), all challenging the interpretation of several ordinance provisions, and the individual members additionally challenging Council’s ultimate decision to approve the application. The Zoning Board consolidated the appeals, and, following several hearings, declared Council’s approval of the application void. On appeal, the court of common pleas reversed. On appeal of that decision to the Commonwealth Court, the board of the planning commission and its individual members argued that Mosside failed to perfect its appeal to the court of common pleas because, despite the fact that the appeals of the board of the planning commission and its individual members remained separate appeals throughout the proceedings before the Zoning Board, Mosside’s notice of appeal indicated that it was challenging the Zoning Board’s decision with regard to only one of the appeals. The Commonwealth Court rejected this argument, noting that an earlier motion had been made and granted by the Zoning Board to “consolidate the two applications,” and that “the clear effect of this motion was to merge the two appeals into one, thus necessitating only one decision by the <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>[Zoning] Board____ The Board apparently issued only one decision and we conclude that Mosside perfected its appeal to the court of common pleas from that decision.” <em>Mosside, </em><a href="/citations/?q=454%20A.2d%20199" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="454 A.2d 199">454 A.2d at 201</a>.</p>

Thus, Kincy’s suggestion that <em>Mosside </em>stands for the proposition that two separate actions involving <em>separate </em>parties may be consolidated, such that the pleadings are merged, is incorrect.
