Dr. Cohn testified that Appellant was not suffering from cocaine-induced psychosis because such disorder is dose-related, and chronic users, such as Appellant, develop a tolerance, requiring a large dose to induce psychosis. Recognizing that trial counsel rigorously cross-examined Dr. Cohn, the Majority rejects Appellant’s claim, finding that “[wjhile Dr. Cohn’s opinions regarding the relationship between dose level and psychosis may have been questionable, it cannot be said that his methodology was contrary to generally accepted scientific principles.” Op. at 155, 995 A.2d at 1159 (citing <em>Grady v.

In response, Justice Saylor opined in his Concurring and Dissenting Opinion that “if the Court is going to interpret <em>Frye </em>so narrowly as to justify the admission of speculative opinions, or opinions falsely couched in scientific literature, I believe the time has come for <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>Pennsylvania to move to the <em>Daubert[</em>

    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[147,424,1153,1124]]]'>My personal view on this particular issue is somewhat nuanced. While I recognize the cogency of Justice Saylor’s position, consistent with my prior pronouncements in this area, I join the Majority in concluding that, in the instant case, as in most cases, it is the role of the jury to determine whether the expert, Dr. Cohn, was credible and reliable. The fact that Dr. Cohn’s opinion may not have been consistent with the majority of scientific authority can be brought to the jury’s attention through cross-examination. However, like Justice Saylor, I can also envision a case in which a conclusion rendered by an expert is so completely unsupportable in the scientific community that the trial court should be provided the discretion to preclude its admission. Thus, while I believe the <em>Frye </em>test should remain the law in Pennsylvania, I await a case in which this Court may consider whether <em>Frye </em>should be extended to apply to unscientific <em>conclusions </em>reached by experts, in addition to the current application of <em>Frye </em>to unscientific <em>methodologies </em>employed by experts in reaching those conclusions. Junk science should be no more admissible through experts’ conclusions than it is through experts’ methodologies.</p>

I don’t think there’s anything wrong. So I think — the answer to your question I think — to say that Dr. [Cohn] is unqualified I think was probably a little harsh. You might say that the basis of some of the things he said was not warranted, or did not meet the status of the literature. But I think he has — he is able to provide the opinion.</blockquote>

    <p id="b249-5" data-blocks='[["BL_249.6",249,[140,959,1154,1115]]]'>In my view, however, such testimony is inconsistent with the prevailing law concerning the admission of scientific evidence. In terms of Dr. Cohn’s opinion that Appellant did not suffer from cocaine-induced psychosis, Dr. Caplan appears to be saying that even a psychiatrist is unqualified to render a forensic diagnosis; therefore, since Appellant’s psychiatrist rendered one, the Commonwealth’s toxicologist was free to do so also. Dr. Caplan also appears to believe that if the science is not sufficiently developed for anyone to express a supported opinion, anyone should be permitted to say whatever he wishes, since “all things are possible.” This Court and others, however, at least previously have squarely rejected such a let-it-all-in-and-let-the-jury-decide proposition. <em>See supra </em>note 4. Moreover, I do not believe it is appropriate for a toxicologist to testify as to the state of the literature in- the field of psychiatry, or to express an opinion concerning what a psychiatrist is qualified to diagnose in the first instance. Dr. Caplan was not qualified as an “expert on experts,” and his views concerning admissibility should carry no weight with this Court, particularly as his testimony reads more like a jumbled series of weak excuses than a credible justification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>

In this regard, I have reservations about the strength of Appellant’s defense resting on a claim of a short-lived, transient psychotic episode, particularly absent any prior history, and where there are indicia that he maintained control of his faculties. While Appellant appears to be correct that the applicable science confirms that cocaine-induced psychosis and clear sensorium are not mutually exclusive, his defense is at the very least counterintuitive in view of the circumstances presented. Thus, I believe that there are reasonable differences to be addressed in the prejudice inquiry.</p>
