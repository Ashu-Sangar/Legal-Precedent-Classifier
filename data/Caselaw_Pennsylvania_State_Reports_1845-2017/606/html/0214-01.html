Appellant’s claim in his brief that his self-help praecipe serves as the appealable order wrongly assumes that his action was justified under the Rule he invokes.

Although appellant cited Rule 301(d), he obviously had no intention of permitting the court or the Commonwealth to address his supposed <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>concern, since he took his “appeal” immediately. Appellant’s maneuvering has succeeded in building-in a year’s delay in the disposition of his serial PCRA petition. We do not condone the tactic.</p>
    <p id="b284-4" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[278,536,1150,367]]]'>This appeal is a nullity. The PCRA court notes that a remand or quashal will bring the matter before it with the “requirement that some decision be made with regard to it.” PCRA Ct. Op. at 3. We agree and hold that quashal is appropriate; the court should decide the serial PCRA petition — styled by appellant as his “Third Protective Petition” and supplements thereto — as expeditiously as possible.</p>

This sort of delay-inducing "ping-ponging” between state and federal courts, unfortunately, is not uncommon in Pennsylvania capital cases; the known local federal practice of holding pending habeas petitions in abeyance while counsel files frivolous, time-barred serial PCRA petitions naturally encourages state capital litigants to pursue serial PCRA petitions, thus ensuring delay in the ultimate resolution of their cases.</p>

Appellant would raise the following substantive issues here: 1) was appellant denied due process of law when the Commonwealth suppressed exculpatory blood evidence; 2) was appellant denied due process of law when the jury was permitted to consider fingerprint evidence which is now known to be scientifically unreliable; 3) are these due process violations material to his convictions and sentences; 4) are these claims waived and/or previously litigated. Appellant's Brief at 1-2. Of course, the controlling preliminary issue is whether appellant can satisfy the PCRA’s limitations on presumptively time-barred serial petitions.</p>
