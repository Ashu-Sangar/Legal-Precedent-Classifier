In this latter regard, the court clarified, first, that no specific challenge to the propriety of the original sealing order was being lodged, and second, that the salient legal question was whether the sealed record was now a “true public record”— i.e., presumptively available for public inspection unless the respondent could demonstrate a continuing need for confidentiality — or whether Appellant instead bore the burden of showing that circumstances had so changed since the sealing that there was no longer a need to protect the family’s privacy. The court also observed that Appellant had not filed a complaint or a praecipe for a writ of summons, and hence, he was apparently attempting to engage in pre-litigation discovery. In an effort at accommodation, the court proposed to inspect the sealed record <em>in camera </em>to see if it could find anything supporting Appellant’s allegations. Appellant refused the offer, suggesting that the court was less familiar with the case than he was, and thus, the court might overlook relevant documents.</p>

In a supporting opinion, the court developed that, although the law gives the public a general right of access to judicial proceedings and court records, in many contexts courts have an inherent power to limit the exercise of that right, and may deny access where appropriate. Thus, the orphans’ court explained that the public may be temporarily or permanently excluded from court proceedings and records if public or private interests require such exclusion.

The sensitivity and personal nature of such proceedings has been recognized by the Pennsylvania Legislature itself, which incorporated in the statute at 20 Pa.C.S. § 5511(a), an authorization for the [c]ourt to close such proceedings if requested by the alleged incapacitated person. Thus, the good cause for sealing the record in this matter is inherent in the nature of the proceeding and is of no less weight today than it was at the time the [c]ourt originally ordered the record to be sealed. Additionally, the [c]ourt has suggested a less intrusive alternative to unsealing the record, namely, to have an in camera review of the entire file by the [c]ourt to determine whether any trust document or evidence of such document existed in the record. Petitioner refused such a request insisting that nothing less than personal inspection of the [c]ourt file by his attorneys would be acceptable. In balancing the competing interests involved, and keeping in mind that Petitioner has yet to even institute any court proceedings to enforce his alleged right as a trust beneficiary, we conclude that the present interests continue to weight [sic] in favor of keeping the record in this matter sealed.</blockquote>

He argues that the Superior Court failed to give sufficient weight to the public’s right of access to such records, which he states derives from common law principles that pre-date the Constitution, and is enshrined in both the state and federal charters. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. I; Pa. Const, art. I, § 11. Under the proper approach, according to Appellant, the trial court should require the party seeking closure (in this case, duPont’s estate) to rebut the general presumption of openness by showing that closure serves an <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>important governmental interest and there is no less restrictive way to advance that interest. Appellant thus takes issue with the orphans’ court’s determination that the continuing need for privacy is inherent in the nature of the case, and with its consequent decision to relieve duPont’s estate of the obligation to come forward with proof that the sensitive and personal nature of the records involved requires their continuing impoundment. He posits that the court’s actions in this regard placed him in an impossible situation, namely, that he can only hope to establish the “good cause” needed to unseal the record if he is able to inspect that record.</p>

In this regard, the estate suggests an analogy to adoption proceedings, the records of which must be “withheld from inspection except on an order of court granted upon cause shown,” 23 Pa.C.S. § 2905(a), and divorce proceedings, which are also afforded significant privacy protections. <em>See generally Katz v.

Here, moreover, it should be recalled that Appellant was not a party to the underlying proceedings to declare duPont an incapacitated person, he had not filed suit against the estate, <em>see supra </em>note 4, and he possessed no evidence that the record contains documentation relevant to the trust that <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>he alleges was created for him. <em>See </em>N.T., Oct. 31, 2007, at 22. Likewise, the principal interpretive issue involved as articulated in Appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal, and as rephrased by this Court in our order granting review, concerns the requirements for modifying an order placing documents under seal. Any such modification would implicate the public’s, and not merely Appellant’s, right of access to those documents.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Thus, the present controversy involves the right of <em>public </em>access to the sealed record of duPont’s incapacity hearings.

The controversy in <em>Cendant, </em>for example, centered on the sealing of bids by various plaintiffs’ lawyers to act as lead counsel in a class action against a securities firm.

We do not view this as an impediment to our review, however, as we are not presently evaluating whether the orphans’ court acted properly in 1996.
