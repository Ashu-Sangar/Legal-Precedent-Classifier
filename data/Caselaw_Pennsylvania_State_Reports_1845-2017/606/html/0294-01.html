The Dissent then goes on to detail the myriad of medical conditions plaguing Appellants, including asbestos-related diseases, and finds that "having an expert say the words ‘sufficient to establish legal causation’ is not enough” to survive summary judgment in these types of asbestos cases. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 997 A.2d at 1173. Respectfully, however, the Dissent arrives at such a conclusion without citation to or mention of the plethora of decisions from this Court that require juries to resolve competing theories of causation. We agree with the Dissent that Appellants' conditions related to years of cigarette smoking may be contributing to their debilitating conditions. What the Dissent ignores, however, is that Dr. Gelfand has opined, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Appellants’ incapacitating conditions have been caused, at least in part, by exposure to asbestos. With that opinion, our jurisprudence requires Appellants to have the opportunity to prove their cases before a jury.</p>

For example, a physician’s pronouncement that the cause of an injury was a particular condition should not be insulated from judicial scrutiny purely because this is the type of things physicians say. Rather, it is a fair inquiry for courts to meaningfully consider whether the physician’s specific <em>methodology for arriving at the conclusion </em>is supported by generally accepted scientific principles, as a prerequisite to admitting the opinion into evidence. For these reasons, I do not support as limited a perspective concerning our common pleas courts’ screening function as the plaintiffs advocate here. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellants at 21, 28-29.

Secondly, each <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>appellant has so many other conditions that finding the asbestos exposure to be a significant contributing factor is difficult even if Dr. Gelfand’s theory were facially plausible.</p>
    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.5",387,[175,487,1149,801]]]'>Judge Klein’s analogy to the bucket of water in the ocean is spot on. <em>See id. </em>Each exposure may contribute, but no single exposure can be substantial — by definition, “substantial” cannot modify every bucket of water in the ocean, and while each bucket counts, no bucket is substantial. Each and every exposure can be no more a <em>significant </em>contributing factor than is each and every cigarette, or each and every meal that led to the obesity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> That is, the medical conclusion offered is, on its face, not credible in terms of the legal notion of “substantial contributing factor.” Each asbestos fiber, each cigarette, each cheeseburger is literally but a drop in the proverbial bucket— a bucket unquestionably full, but to call each drop substantial mocks the legal concept of that word. Common sense tells us the doctor simply overstated the matter. As such, I can find no error in rejecting the proffered opinion on its face.</p>

However, Mr. Summers also suffers from moderately severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as emphysema, asthma, and obesity. <em>Id., </em>at 2. <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>The doctor opines that his 40 pack-year smoking caused the COPD and is a “substantial contributing factor” to the other conditions. <em>Id., </em>at 3.

He opines that smoking was the <em>cause </em>of Mr. Summers’ chronic obstructive lung disease, and a <em>substantial contributing factor </em>to diffusion abnormality and dyspnea.

If there are two significant contributing factors, the majority would be correct in allowing the fact-finder to assign <em>causation. </em>Where there are three legitimate potential causes, the significance of each lessens. Where there are five potential causes, the significance of each is necessarily diluted — it is still easy to call each “significant” but in a strict liability products case, mere speculation about actual causation cannot be overcome by saying every event every day is legally substantial.</p>

Where the basis for the opinion itself is manifestly suspect, that “each and every” exposure is not just a factor but a substantial one, the opiner’s credibility unravels.</p>
