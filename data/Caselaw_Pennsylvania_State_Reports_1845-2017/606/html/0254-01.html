However, as the Commonwealth points out, the facts of the present case are distinguishable from the facts under which <em>Carter </em>and its progeny were decided, in two significant ways. First, here, Appellee was arrested immediately after presenting and offering the drugs for sale. By contrast, in <em>Carter, Payne, </em>and <em>Roebuck, </em>the defendants were arrested many weeks and even months after the undercover drug buy occurred. Therefore, the defense of mistaken identity had some genuine resonance in <em>Carter, Payne, </em>and <em>Roebuck, </em>unlike in the present case where Appellee was arrested immediately at the scene, rendering the mistaken identity defense untenable. Second, in each of the other cases, the defendant actually made a showing that his arrest was based on mistaken identity. As we stated in <em>Payne: </em>

Most relevant for the purposes of the present appeal is the evidence that the Commonwealth presented in those matters. In <em>Miller, </em>a detective testified that the informant’s life would be severely imperiled if his identity were known, because: the informant provided information that led to the arrest of the appellant for robbery and an unrelated shooting, the arrest of appellant’s brother in a separate matter, and the arrest of four other individuals; all of the arrestees lived in close proximity to the informant; and the informant had daily contact with the arrestees’ families. <em>See Miller, </em><a href="/pa/513/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="513 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1802575" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0118-01">513 Pa. at 124-25</a>, <a href="/pa/513/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="513 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1802575" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0118-01">518 A.2d at 1190</a>. Likewise, in <em>Weidenmoyer, </em>a trooper testified that he feared that a motorcycle gang would seek retaliation against the informant if his identity were known, since the appellee was a member, and gang members had already threatened reprisals against one witness. <em>See Weidenmoyer, </em><a href="/pa/518/0002-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="518 Pa. 2" data-case-ids="1811684" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0002-01">518 Pa. at </a>11-12 &amp; n. 5, <a href="/pa/518/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="539 A.2d 1291" data-case-ids="1811590,1811684" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0001-01,/pa/518/0002-01">539 A.2d at </a>1296 &amp; n. 5.</p>
