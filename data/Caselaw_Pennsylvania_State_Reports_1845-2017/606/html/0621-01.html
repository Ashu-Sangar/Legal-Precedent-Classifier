Employer issued a notice of compensation payable acknowledging Claimant’s work-related injury and further acknowledging that the injury caused him temporary total disability. In October 1998, Claimant returned to work in a modified, light-duty position, and his workers’ compensation benefits were accordingly reduced to partial disability. In March 1999, Claimant voluntarily left his light-duty position with Employer to begin work as an industrial electrician at a business called Ronco Machine (“Ronco”) for higher pay and less onerous physical job requirements. Employer then filed a notification of suspension of benefits, asserting that Claimant was no longer suffering a loss of earnings due to his work-related injury.</p>

Employer contested the petition, and the matter was heard by a workers’ compensation judge (“WCJ”). In April 2005, the WCJ issued a decision denying <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>the reinstatement petition, concluding that any loss of earnings suffered by Claimant was caused by his lay-off from Ronco, not by a worsening of the work-related injury. Claimant appealed, and the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board (“WCAB”) remanded the matter to the WCJ to make specific factual findings regarding whether Claimant had left his modified-duty employment with Employer because of his work-related injury or for reasons unrelated to the work injury.</p>

The WCJ also specifically found, based on the credible testimony of Employer’s expert medical witness, that Claimant’s physical condition had not changed or worsened, as Claimant alleged, and that he remained capable of performing the light-duty job that he had formerly held with Employer. Based on these additional factual findings, the WCJ again denied Claimant’s petition for reinstatement, specifically finding that any loss in Claimant’s earning power was attributable solely to the fact that he had been laid off from Ronco, not to the work-related injury. The WCAB affirmed, as did the Commonwealth Court on further appeal.</p>

Our determination rested on the distinction between what the Act required of a claimant seeking reinstatement of “terminated” benefits as opposed to what it required when a claimant sought reinstatement of benefits that had merely been “suspended.” In the case of terminated benefits, the Act placed the burden on the claimant seeking reinstatement to show a causal connection between his or her current condition and the prior work-related injury. However, the Act imposed no equivalent requirement on the claimant seeking reinstatement of suspended benefits because the causal connection between the claimant’s condition and the work-related injury is presumed. Indeed, the issue of suspension of benefits is focused on the question of whether the claimant’s earning power has changed to the degree that benefits, in whole or in part, are no longer necessary. <em><a href="/pa/526/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="526 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="1825940" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0025-01">Id.</a></em>

First, in other proceedings under the Act, including those disposing of claim, modification, and suspension petitions, the burden to show lack of “good faith” or “fault” is placed on the employer. Second, our reasons for placing the burden on the claimant in the reinstatement of suspended benefits context were not evident from our decisional law; that law had consistently placed the burden of showing job availability on the employer as a matter of fundamental fairness. Third, such burden adds an unnecessary layer of complexity to workers’ compensation litigation. <em>Stevens, supra </em>at 377 (Saylor, J. concurring). In fact, Justice Saylor noted that Section 413(a) itself, without explicitly stating so, appears to place the burden on an employer to establish that, during reinstatement of suspended benefits proceedings, the claimant’s loss of earnings did not result from disability arising from the work injury. <em>Id. </em>at 378 n. 1. Justice Saylor would have relegated the concept of <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>“fault,” as articulated in the <em>Pieper </em>standard, to those specific provisions of the Act or holdings from this Court that would prohibit a reinstatement of benefits, such as the preclusion from receiving compensation for self-inflicted injuries or those caused by the claimant’s violation of law. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 431.</p>

The cases are distinguishable from each other, however, in one principal respect. The claimant in <em>Stevens </em>never returned to work with his time-of-injury employer in a light-duty capacity, whereas Claimant in the instant case did so, and then left this light-duty position to take a job with a second employer, while retaining the physical capability to perform the post-injury light-duty job with Employer.</p>
