The Ellwood City Police Wage and Policy Unit (the “Union”) is the exclusive bargaining representative of a unit of police officers employed by Ellwood City Borough (the “Borough”). Prior to June 19, 2006, the Borough permitted its police officers to smoke and use tobacco products in its buildings, vehicles, and equipment. On June 19, 2006 the Borough Council passed a resolution prohibiting the use of all tobacco products on or in Borough-owned buildings, vehicles, and equipment. The next day, the Borough’s Mayor, Donald Clyde, issued a memorandum to all Borough employees, including the police officers at issue in this appeal, mandating them to comply with the resolution. Later, on August 21, 2006, the Borough’s Council adopted Ordinance # 2397 (the “Ordinance”) which was identical to the June 19 resolution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">3</a> The Borough did not bargain <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>with the Union over the tobacco products prohibition before directing police officers to comply with the ban.</p>

Specifically, in an opinion authored by Judge Doris Smith-Ribner, the majority initially considered the issue of whether the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1988, 35 P.S. § 1230.1 et seq., preempted the Ordinance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">4</a> The Commonwealth Court majority rejected an interpretation that all local regulation of indoor tobacco use is preempted under the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1988. <em>Borough of Ellwood City, </em><a href="/a2d/941/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="941 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="8397236" data-case-paths="/a2d/941/0728-01">941 A.2d at 734-35</a>. Having resolved this threshold issue, the majority then addressed whether the Ordinance implicated a mandatory subject of bargaining. First, the court found the enactment of the Ordinance was an exercise of the Borough’s general police power, concluding that the purpose of the legislation was driven by the Borough’s acknowledgment of the dangers of tobacco products to users and to persons affected by second hand tobacco use and the desire to provide a tobacco free environment on and in all municipality owned buildings, vehicles, and equipment to promote the health and welfare of its employees and citizens. <em><a href="/a2d/941/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="941 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="8397236" data-case-paths="/a2d/941/0728-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/941/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="941 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="8397236" data-case-paths="/a2d/941/0728-01">at 735-36</a>.</p>

Therefore, the majority concluded that, in light of the fundamental concern relating to the direction of the municipality, the interest of the Borough overcame the interest of the employees in maintaining the prior practices related to tobacco use, and the new ban on tobacco use was not subject to mandatory collective bargaining. <em><a href="/a2d/941/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="941 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="8397236" data-case-paths="/a2d/941/0728-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/941/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="941 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="8397236" data-case-paths="/a2d/941/0728-01">at 736</a>.

Similarly, Judge Dan Pellegrini in his dissent, opined that, while the Borough, through the Ordinance, could ban smoking in public places, it could not prohibit the use of tobacco in non-public places without first negotiating with the Union. Judge Pellegrini offered that the Ordinance was not enacted pursuant to the Borough’s general police powers, but, rather, through its proprietary power to control conduct that takes place on its property. <em><a href="/a2d/941/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="941 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="8397236" data-case-paths="/a2d/941/0728-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/941/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="941 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="8397236" data-case-paths="/a2d/941/0728-01">at 738</a>. As the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1988 authorized proprietors or the person in charge of public places to ban everyone from smoking, the matter of a public ban was removed from collective bargaining, he concluded. Here, however, the Borough imposed a ban in non-public places, and, thus, it had an obligation to negotiate over whether tobacco products could be used in those non-public areas, as this affects only employees. <em><a href="/a2d/941/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="941 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="8397236" data-case-paths="/a2d/941/0728-01">Id.</a> </em>Judge Pellegrini deemed the tobacco use policy to be a term and condition of employment; accordingly, it was a mandatory subject of bargaining.

The Board offers a number of reasons why the Commonwealth Court’s decision should be overturned. First, the Board contends the Borough violated its duty to collectively bargain by unilaterally implementing its ban on its police officers’ use of all tobacco products in Borough-owned buildings, vehicles, and equipment. The Board offers that, outside of the school setting, the Commonwealth Court decisional law has held a ban on the use of tobacco products is a mandatory subject of bargaining. Additionally, the Board submits that, in coming to its conclusion, the Commonwealth Court utilized an incorrect test in determining whether a topic is a managerial prerogative and not subject to bargaining. Specifically, the Board points out that, under Act 111, a matter is deemed to be bargainable if it bears a “rational relationship” to employee duties. Only a topic in which an employer’s interest substantially outweighs the inter<a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>ests of the employees will be deemed to be a managerial prerogative, and, thus, not subject to mandatory bargaining. According to the Board, the Commonwealth Court merely determined that the interest of the Borough “overcomes” that of the employees in weighing the competing interests.</p>
    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[162,581,1153,1071]]]'>Furthermore, the Board argues that the Commonwealth Court failed to address the issue of whether the ban on police officer tobacco use was overbroad and not narrowly tailored to address the Borough’s interest in protecting the public from the hazards of tobacco smoke. Related thereto, the Board asserts that a municipality may not avoid its bargaining obligation under the guise of passing an ordinance. Finally, while the Board maintains that bargainable items are excluded from mandatory bargaining where other applicable statutory provisions explicitly and definitively prohibit the employer from making an agreement as to that specific term or condition of employment, here, neither the Borough Code nor the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1988 explicitly and definitively prohibited bargaining over the police officers’ use of tobacco products. In fact, the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1988 specifically stated that “nothing in this section or any local law, rule or regulation shall be construed as to impair or diminish or otherwise affect any contractual agreement, collective bargaining agreement, collective bargaining rights or collective bargaining procedures.” 35 P.S. § 1230.1(g).</p>

Moreover, the Union reasons that a municipality may not escape its bargaining obligations merely by declaring them to be an exercise of general police powers to provide for the public good and offers that the General Assembly created collective bargaining obligations through the Commonwealth’s police power to provide for public health and safety. The Union emphasizes that there is nothing concerning the tobacco ban that is essential to the efficient functioning of the police department, and, thus, the topic is not a management prerogative that would not be subject to collective bargaining.</p>

In the preamble to the Ordinance, the Borough acknowledged the danger of tobacco products to users and the dangers from secondhand smoke. According to the Borough, the Ordinance does not ban police officers from smoking while on duty; it <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>merely regulates smoking in central public places.

Thus, at issue in this appeal is only the Union’s contention that the Borough failed to bargain over the aspects of its ban not covered by the Clean Indoor Air Act of 2008, i.e., the use of smokeless tobacco in police officers’ work areas, and Borough vehicles and equipment, and smoking in vehicles that are not used for mass transit and equipment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Therefore, as limited to these discrete areas, we find that the appeal is not moot, but note our opinion today is limited to these specific areas of controversy.</p>

Whether a topic constitutes a mandatory subject of bargaining, which includes working conditions, is an important threshold determination. Once it has been determined that a particular subject involves a working condition, an employer’s unilateral change of such working condition violates its statutory duty to bargain and, thus, constitutes an unfair labor practice.

The Borough asserts, and the Commonwealth Court majority found, Section 1202(6) of the Borough Code permits a borough to make “such regulations as may be necessary for the health, safety, morals, general welfare and cleanliness and the beauty, convenience, comfort and safety of the borough.” 53 P.S. § 46202(6).

First, while the Borough Code may represent the policy of the Commonwealth to permit municipal entities the ability to protect the health and welfare of its citizenry, the policy of the Commonwealth is also plainly reflected in the passing of the PLRA and Act 111. Act 111, passed two years after the Borough Code, clearly establishes the rights of police and fire personnel to engage in meaningful collective bargaining. Its provisions apply to every political subdivision in the Commonwealth. 43 P.S. § 217.9. As detailed above, this exercise of the Commonwealth’s police power through the passage of Act 111 was prompted by the desire to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the Commonwealth and its citizens. Furthermore, this specific exercise of the Commonwealth’s police power through the granting of collective bargaining rights is not subservient to ordinances created through general police power. To sharpen the point, the Borough Code also endows a municipality with the authority to create a police department, to fix weekly hours of police officers, to remove or suspend police officers, and to fix their compensation. 53 P.S. §§ 46121, 46125. Yet, it cannot be seriously suggested that this authority precludes mandatory collective bargaining over wages, hours of work, and conditions of employment. Indeed, if this were the case, a borough could eviscerate the very essence of statutorily-mandated collective bargaining by legislating in areas which are traditionally subject to mutual agree<a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>ment through collective bargaining under its power to regulate the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. This would invite the very unrest in the public sector that Act 111 was enacted to alleviate. We cannot conclude that this is the intent of the General Assembly.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[279,596,1152,850]]]'>Resolving the tensions between a municipality’s passage of an ordinance under its police powers and its impact upon collective bargaining obligations pursuant to Act 111 is a case-specific inquiry. Therefore, turning to the legislation at issue, the Ordinance before us is in some respects narrow and in others broad. In one instance, the Ordinance is circumscribed in that the Borough does not attempt to regulate tobacco usage in general to protect the health and welfare of its citizens, but only does so in certain limited areas. Yet, in other respects the Borough’s actions are broad in that the Ordinance goes beyond protecting the public as it applies to both public and non-public areas of Borough property. Moreover, the Borough not only bans smoking, which certainly implicates the public health, it also prohibits the use of smokeless tobacco products which, at least on this record, does not appear to implicate the health of the public.</p>

We also conclude, however, that the Ordinance, which unilaterally bans all use of all tobacco in certain non-public areas — such as smokeless tobacco use in police officer’s nonpublic work areas and Borough vehicles and equipment, and smoking in Borough vehicles not used for mass transit and equipment — impermissibly denied Borough police officers their statutorily-guaranteed collective bargaining rights under the PLRA and Act 111 to negotiate over working conditions. We find the Borough’s enactment of the Ordinance with respect to non-public areas is in conflict with the principle that a municipality may not avoid its collective bargaining obligations through the passing of an ordinance. <em>See Borough of </em>

In doing so, we conclude that, while local legislation which promotes clean air and warns of the risks of tobacco use may be laudatory, it may not serve as a barrier to negotiations over this topic when it constitutes a working condition subject to mandatory bargaining under Act 111. <em>See Lebanon County Detectives Ass’n. v.

Further, I express my opinion that this Court’s insertion into Act 111 of a “managerial prerogatives” component that invites judicial review regarding the limits of an Act 111 interest arbitration panel’s consideration of disputes involving undisputed “terms and conditions of employment,” effectively rewrites Act 111, does violence to Sections 1 and 7 of that act, and is contrary to Act Ill’s purposes as repeatedly observed by this Court’s previous case law.</p>

The engine that drove that decision, however, was the unique characteristics of the school district as a public education institution. The court recognized the import of educational employees serving as role models to students. We believe that the nature of public schools and their vital mission of educating our youth significantly differs from that of municipal governance. We simply do not find sufficiently similar characteristics of the two enterprises to embrace the rationale espoused in <em>Chambersburg Area School District </em>for purposes of the appeal <em>sub judice. </em>It is on this basis that we find the decision in <em>Chambersburg Area School District </em>to be clearly distinguishable.</p>

In the context of Act 111, the Commonwealth Court has at times employed a weighing paradigm in which, if a managerial policy "substantially outweighs” the impact the issue will have on employees, it will not be subject to collective bargaining. <em>See Schuylkill Haven Borough, </em><a href="/a2d/914/0936-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="914 A.2d 936" data-case-ids="8336656" data-case-paths="/a2d/914/0936-01">914 A.2d at 941</a>.

Furthermore, under PERA, our Court has offered that "where an item of dispute is a matter of fundamental concern to the employes’ interest in wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, it is not removed as a matter subject to good faith bargaining under section 701 simply because it may touch upon basic policy.” <em>State College Area Sch.

We emphasize the Union seeks only the right to collectively bargain over the Borough’s ban of the use of smokeless tobacco in police officer work areas, Borough vehicles and equipment, and smoking in vehicles that are not used for mass transit, and equipment. As a practical matter, and in light of our increasingly smoke-free society, a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit represented by the Union may very well endorse a ban on tobacco use in these areas. Furthermore, even if there is not majority support for a total ban on tobacco use, negotiations may involve the accommodation of non-tobacco users. Again, the Union is seeking only to guarantee the statutorily-based rights of its police officers to engage in collective bargaining over this topic.</p>

That sentence reads: "Public employers are in many respects more constrained in what they may do vis-a-vis their employees, and those limitations must be maintained.” <em>City of Washington, supra </em>at 442. I believe it is a serious misinterpretation of <em>City of Washington </em>to conclude that this sentence is somehow recognition of managerial power. Reading <em>City of Washington </em>in its proper context, I believe that the above sentence simply expresses the reality that public employers may be constrained by relevant legislation and may not be forced by arbitration awards to commit illegal acts. Accordingly, we recognized that arbitrators do not have the authority to impose an award that would require, for example, a local municipality to violate a statute of the General Assembly. Indeed, <em>City of Washington </em>recognized "that the scope of the submission to the” arbitration panels involved the "legitimate terms and conditions of employment” and that an arbitration award may "mandate” the public employer to take whatever action is necessary, within the employer’s power, to implement that award. <em>Id.

I understand both that the present case is on appeal from a decision of the PLRB based on the Union’s filing of a charge of unfair labor practices, and that decisions of the PLRB are not subject to the Act 111 "no appeal” mandate. However, there can be no doubt that the majority’s interpretation of Act 111 will be applied to the endless stream of future appeals from "non-appealable” Act 111 arbitration awards. Thus, I believe this case is illustrative of the ridiculous extent to which the concept of "managerial prerogatives,” imported into the sphere of Act 111, has rendered virtually meaningless an essential component of Act 111, its "no appeal” mandate. Now, on appeal, courts are endlessly determining whether a subject in contention falls on one or the other side of the imaginary, judicially-created line that separates "managerial prerogatives” from "bargainable” terms and conditions of employment. Once again, I submit that this Court is required to interpret Act 111 in a manner that applies, and makes meaningful, its actual provisions.</p>
