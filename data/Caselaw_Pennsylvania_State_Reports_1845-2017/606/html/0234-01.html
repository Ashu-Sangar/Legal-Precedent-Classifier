Herein, the accused was originally charged with two counts of robbery, but those charges were dismissed at the preliminary hearing stage, and the Commonwealth failed to pursue an available appeal of that dismissal. Both courts below held that the robbery charges could not be added under these circumstances. The trial court so held on grounds that it lacked authority under the coordinate jurisdiction rule to approve a charging maneuver that sought to overrule the determination of the preliminary hearing judge; and the Superior Court panel majority held largely on grounds that robbery and retail theft are not cognate offenses <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>for purposes of Rule 560(B)(5).

Appellee opened the box, removed a monitor cord and the software bundle, and then moved to another part of the store, where he opened the software bundle, took some of the items from it, and put them in his pocket along with the cord. Appellee then left the store,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> followed by the officer and an assistant manager who had been called to be a witness and assist the officer. The officer identified himself to appellee and tried to bring appellee back into the store, but appellee elbowed the officer and a brief struggle ensued. The officer grasped appellee by the right arm and was behind appellee when appellee produced a gun in his left hand and pointed the gun at the assistant manager, who screamed to let the loss prevention officer know that appellee had a gun. The officer let go of appellee’s arm, after which appellee pointed the gun around, including at the officer, and fled on foot towards the Franklin Mills shopping mall. The officer called 911 and appellee was apprehended shortly thereafter at the mall. A pat-down search revealed a handgun in appellee’s left front pants pocket. The stolen items were found in the mail’s parking lot area.</p>

A preliminary hearing was conducted on December 6, 2005, before Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge Robert S. Blasi. The parties stipulated that appellee had a valid license to carry his firearm and the Commonwealth withdrew the VUFA charges. At the conclusion of the evidence, appellee moved to dismiss the robbery charges, without specifying why, and asked that the remaining charges be remanded. N.T., 12/6/05, at 18. The Commonwealth argued that all charges should be bound over, noting that in the course of the theft, appellee had used force and pointed the gun at both victims before fleeing. <em>Id. </em>Counsel for appellee responded, appearing to argue that at the time when appellee produced the gun and pointed it at the complainants, “he’s actually outside the store. He’s away from the store.” <em>Id. </em>at 19. Judge Blasi answered, “I know.

A rearrest preliminary hearing was held on June 8, 2006, in the Court of Common Pleas, before the Honorable Joan A. Brown, sitting as the Motions Court judge. The Commonwealth again withdrew the VUFA charges, then presented its case on the remaining charges. At the conclusion of the evidence, the parties presented no argument, and Judge Brown announced that she found a <em>prima facie </em>case established as to retail theft, aggravated assault, simple assault, REAP, and PIC, all of which were held for trial. N.T., 6/8/06, at 31. Respecting the robbery charges, Judge Brown announced no findings in open court.

Appellee renewed his argument that the robbery informations were improperly filed because those same charges had been dismissed. The Commonwealth responded that “nothing in the case law doesn’t allow us from putting through bills of information on a cognate offense.” The Commonwealth added that, in its view, the notes from the preliminary hearing established the robbery charges: “When he left the scene after steeling [sic] various parts from the computer, he put a gun in the manager’s face and then waived [sic] a gun at the crowd. Clearly, that’s a robbery, so there is no issue that we made out the <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>charges.” The Commonwealth cited <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

The panel majority characterized this argument as circular, since it turned upon the Commonwealth’s belief that it had proved a <em>prima facie </em>case of robbery at the preliminary hearing, when in fact the robbery charges were not bound over, and the Commonwealth’s failure to appeal made that determination final. “Furthermore,” the majority noted, “if we accept the Commonwealth’s argument we would render the preliminary hearing meaningless as the Commonwealth would have free reign to ignore the issuing authority’s determination as to a <em>prima facie </em>case and simply re-file the original charges by way of the criminal information.” <a href="/a2d/949/0899-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="949 A.2d 899" data-case-ids="8240888" data-case-paths="/a2d/949/0899-01">949 A.2d at 903</a>.</p>

The question posed by the Commonwealth focuses solely on whether robbery and retail theft are cognate offenses; the Commonwealth’s assumption is that the answer is yes and that Rule 560(B)(5) authorizes it to re-charge appellee with robbery via criminal information. However, there is a necessary procedural and supervisory aspect of this matter beyond the Commonwealth’s interest in the definitional or philosophical question of what makes offenses cognate: whether and when the Commonwealth may invoke Rule 560(B)(5) as a self-help remedy in the face of a specific, adverse ruling by a judicial officer at a rearrest preliminary hearing, which the Commonwealth elected not to appeal. This procedural circumstance, and not the philosophical/definitional issue of interest to the Commonwealth, was the specific basis for Judge Dembe’s ruling, and the question of the propriety of adding cognate offenses under Rule 560(B)(5) cannot properly be answered without accounting for that circumstance.

The Commonwealth quotes <em>Slingerland’s </em>dictionary definition of “cognate” as “related, akin or similar esp. in having the same or common or similar nature, elements, qualities or origin.” In the Commonwealth’s estimation, one offense is cognate to another if it contains substantially similar elements and arises from the same set of circumstances, even if it has a higher grade or a more severe penalty. The Commonwealth posits that since the elements of retail theft are not merely <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>related to those of robbery, but are wholly subsumed in them, the two are cognate.</p>

Commonwealth’s Brief at 11 (citing Joel Prentiss Bishop, Commentaries on the Criminal Law 645 (1877), Edward Hyde East, Pleas of the Crown 707 (1803), and William Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 95 (1716-1721)). According to the Commonwealth, the purpose of the robbery statute is to protect both persons and property: “It cannot be that compound crimes such as robbery have no cognate offenses merely because they are designed to protect against multiple harms. If anything, the opposite is true: robbery is cognate to both theft offenses and assaultive offenses.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 11-12.</p>

Appellee concedes that robbery and retail theft share the requirement of proof of theft, but he submits that, other than that “lone commonality,” they are principally directed at different concerns: robbery statutes aim to protect the person while theft statutes aim to protect property. Appellee contends that <em>Sims </em>is inapposite because it was solely concerned with lesser-included offenses, specifically whether a defendant can be convicted at trial of an inchoate attempt crime after being charged only with the corresponding substantive offense. Appellee adds that under <em>Sims, </em>consideration of when a lesser-included offense may be cognate to a greater offense is limited to: (1) when a defendant is convicted of a crime that was not charged; (2) when the issue is whether two crimes merge for sentencing purposes; and (3) the double jeopardy context. None of those circumstances is present here, appellee contends, so the mere fact that retail theft is a lesser-included offense of robbery does not make the two offenses cognate and therefore there is no tension with <em>Sims.</em>

Appellee dismisses the Commonwealth’s assertion that the purpose of the cognate offense restriction is merely to ensure adequate notice. If that were so, appellee notes, the Commonwealth could add any charge to an information after the preliminary hearing so long as it is done with sufficient notice. Appellee contends that the issue is not adequate notice, but the very legitimacy of the robbery charge because Rule 560(B)(5)’s true purpose is to protect defendants against having to answer charges different from and unrelated to those that survive the preliminary hearing phase of prosecution.</p>

Appellee recognizes that to adopt this rule, this Court would have to address Tanner’s statement that “when a prosecuting officer is satisfied from his investigations that a higher grade of offense, cognate to the one returned by the committing magistrate, is properly chargeable against a defendant, he may draw the bill accordingly.” Nevertheless, appellee contends, his approach would bring Pennsylvania in line with the proper definition of a cognate offense as set forth in <em>Black’s Law Dictionary, </em>which defines a “cognate offense” as: “A lesser offense that is related to the greater offense because it shares several of the elements of the greater offense and is of the same class or category.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1111 (8th ed. 2004).

The Commonwealth further argues that <em>Black’s Law Dictionary </em>does not define legal terms in Pennsylvania and that appellee’s reading of Rule 560(B)(5) overlooks the presence of the disjunctive “or” in the phrase: “the offense substantially the same as or cognate to the offense alleged in the complaint.” The Commonwealth posits that “[cjonsidered in the light of the ordinary disjunctive meaning of the word ‘or,’ the phrase ‘substantially the same as’ does not define the term ‘cognate’; rather, it sets forth an alternative class of additional offenses that, like cognate offenses, may be included in a bill of information.” Commonwealth’s Reply Brief at 3. The Commonwealth adds that even if appellee’s argument that Rule 560(B)(5) protects defendants from having to answer charges unrelated to those that survive the preliminary hearing stage is valid, the addition of robbery to the information here met that standard. Finally, the Commonwealth argues that appellee’s proposed construction limiting cognate offenses to lesser-included offenses would force the Commonwealth to rearrest defendants after greater offenses are dismissed, the result of which would be yet more inefficiency and backlog.</p>

The Association warns that if the Commonwealth is permitted to charge robbery in an information even if only retail theft is held over after a preliminary hearing, the lesser theft offense would become the “tail that wags the dog.” The Association suggests that such laxity would invite prosecutorial gamesmanship and manipulation to escalate charges that would not survive a preliminary hearing and would allow prosecutors to effectively override judicial determinations. The Association submits that, “[i]f the Commonwealth is unable to shoulder the relatively light burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case, the accused should not be put to the ordeal of defending against it at trial.” <em>Amicus </em>Brief at 5-7.</p>

The case <em>sub judice </em>does not present a circumstance where the offense alleged to be cognate was never charged, which can occur through oversight, the relatively compressed time-frame in which complaints are drafted, or because further investigation or developments revealed a related charge that was not included in the original complaint. Instead, here, the robberies alleged to be “cognate” were actually charged not once, but twice.

Judge Dembe obviously appreciated the fact that the Commonwealth’s action amounted to a collateral attack upon the determination of a judge of equal jurisdiction; thus, she invoked the coordinate jurisdiction rule. Furthermore, the Commonwealth itself was candid at the hearing before Judge Dembe: it believed that the preliminary hearing officers were simply mistaken in their legal assessment of the Commonwealth’s case for robbery. <em>See </em>N.T., 12/19/06, at 5 (“Clearly, that’s a robbery, so there is no issue that we made out the charges.”).

Indeed, <em>Tanner </em>involved not a preliminary hearing, but a coroner’s inquest into the shooting death of the victim. The coroner recommended that the defendant be held for the grand jury upon a charge of manslaughter. When preparing the information, however, the district attorney charged the defendant with both murder and manslaughter. The grand jury then indicted the defendant on both charges and the defendant was ultimately convicted of first-degree murder.

Black’s Law Dictionary 808 (8th ed. 2004).

However, we granted allocatur on a discrete issue, namely “whether the Superior Court erred in holding that robbery and retail theft are not cognate offenses, and that, consequently, where only retail theft and assault have been alleged, the Commonwealth cannot add a robbery charge?” <em>Commonwealth v. Weigle, </em><a href="/pa/600/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="600 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="4192985,4193110" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0100-01,/pa/600/0100-02">600 Pa. 100</a>, <a href="/pa/600/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="963 A.2d 903" data-case-ids="4192985,4193110,4194097,8171577,8171648,8171720" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0100-01,/pa/600/0100-02,/pa/600/0099-01,/a2d/963/0903-01,/a2d/963/0903-02,/a2d/963/0903-03">963 A.2d 903</a>, 904 (2008). The majority does not answer this question, but instead holds a count dismissed by a judicial officer cannot be reincarnated by means of Rule 560. The majority leaves the issue on which we granted review to the Rules Committee. <em>See </em>Majority Op., at 249, 997 A.2d at 315, 316.</p>
    <p id="b313-6" data-blocks='[["BL_313.7",313,[152,1048,1154,605]]]'>I cannot agree with this result for two reasons. First, the issue deemed dispositive was never raised by a party; the Superior Court consequently does not mention it, and this issue is resurrected <em>sua sponte </em>by the majority. Though Judge Dembe relied on the coordinate jurisdiction rule, the original ruling dealt with cognate offenses, and the appeal taken reflected only the cognate offense issue. Errors in procedural matters, such as how something came to be charged, must be raised by the party affected, not by an appellate court. If the party fails to raise the issue, it is waived. In the present case, this issue has not been heretofore raised.</p>
    <p id="b313-7" data-blocks='[["BL_313.8",313,[151,1683,1154,668]],["BL_314.1",314,[277,299,1150,315]]]'>Secondly, this court has heard no advocacy on the point deemed dispositive — if we are to make a pronouncement on the point, we should do so only after contemplating all sides of it, which sides were understandably not presented to us by either party. For example, we should consider: (1) whether this case is distinct because Philadelphia Municipal Court rules are distinct from non-Philadelphia Magisterial District Court procedures; (2) whether the conclusion that the district attorney cannot add a count if it has been charged and dismissed, but <em>can </em>add a charge if it was never filed in the first place comports with the goal and plain language of Rule 560(B)(5), which clearly states the Commonwealth may add a cognate offense; (3) whether well-settled waiver rules trump <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>our consideration of an issue for which we did not grant allocatur, and which was never raised by a party. Also murky is the question whether a ruling on the robbery in the second filing ever took place — no ruling was apparently made in court, though the record was subsequently found to contain a marking of “dismissed” on the docket.</p>
    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[276,643,1153,420]]]'>Again, we granted allocatur to address whether robbery and retail theft are cognate offenses. Distinct and unchallenged procedural concerns that have not been fully and comprehensively presented to us are only addressed at this point with the understanding that errors may be made for want of consideration of points we have not contemplated. Thus, while I do not necessarily disagree with what my esteemed colleagues write, I cannot offer my joinder to it at this time.</p>
