Appellant also challenges the legality of his sentence for ten counts of recklessly endangering another person, which arose from the same criminal episode. We affirm Appellant’s judgment of sentence of death, but vacate his sentence for the counts of recklessly endangering another person, and remand for resentencing on those counts.</p>
    <p id="b456-8" data-blocks='[["BL_456.9",456,[276,1310,1150,528]]]'>The relevant facts of this case are as follows. On September 29, 2005, Appellant and his then-girlfriend, Patricia Kairis, had an argument at his grandmother’s home, to which police responded following a 911 call. Both Appellant and Ms. Kairis had been drinking alcohol, and their argument stemmed at least partially from their recent loss of custody of their young daughter. Prior to the arrival of police, Appellant got into his vehicle and drove away with Ms. Kairis in the passenger seat. As Appellant was driving, he repeatedly struck Ms. Kairis, who unsuccessfully attempted to escape from the vehicle.</p>

Officer Brian Gregg, of the Newtown Borough Police Department, arrived on the scene to assist Trooper Carcaci shortly after the vehicle stop. The officers arrested Appellant, handcuffed him, placed him in the back of a patrol car, and drove him to the police station. By this time, Officer James Joseph Warunek, also of the Newtown Borough <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>Police Department, had arrived at the station to assist Officer Gregg.</p>

Appellant was calm and cooperative, conversing with the officers and with the emergency room personnel. Officer Warunek then accompanied Appellant to a lavatory in the emergency room in order to obtain his urine sample. After Appellant gave Officer Warunek the urine sample, the officer started to re-handcuff Appellant, at which time Appellant suddenly grabbed the officer’s gun out of its holster and immediately shot Officer Warunek in the chest at close range. When Officer Gregg ran to assist, Appellant shot him in the abdomen. Appellant also shot Joseph Epp, an emergency medical technician on duty at the medical center. At some point during this initial gunfire, one of the bullets also struck Appellant’s own hand. Appellant then walked to the spot where Officer Gregg was lying wounded on the floor, and fired the gun twice at close range into the officer’s head. Finally, Appellant returned to Officer Warunek, who was also lying on the floor, pointed the gun at the officer and pulled the trigger; however, by this time there were no more bullets in the gun.</p>

With regard to these prior assaults, Appellant specifically sought to exclude five items of evidence: (1) Appellant’s verbal threats against Mr. Dooley, made immediately prior to and shortly after the assault; (2) Appellant’s assault of his then-girlfriend Rhonda Bealer, which brought police to Appellant’s home just prior to his assault of the officers; (3) Appellant’s assault of Officer Neal Harkins with a baseball bat, which was not charged; (4) Appellant’s attempt to take Officer McKenna’s gun, which was not charged; and (5) Appellant’s verbal threats against police officers made immediately after he was taken into custody for assaulting the officers.

Contrary to Appellant’s assertions, none of the witnesses’s testimony suggested that Appellant had been charged with or convicted of misdemeanor or additional felony offenses, other than the aforementioned aggravated assaults against Mr. Dooley and the three police officers. The jury was properly informed that Appellant had verbally threatened the lives of Mr. Dooley and the officers, as such threats provide insight into the gravity of Appellant’s aggravated assaults, his intent, and his character.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The jury <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>was properly informed that Ms. Bealer had facial injuries and was very upset when police responded to the report of a domestic dispute involving her and Appellant at his residence. The domestic dispute was the reason for the police officers’ appearance at Appellant’s residence, and the officers’ immediate intervention was guided by what they observed on the scene. Without knowing the context provided by these facts, the jury could not fully understand the assaults on the officers that soon followed. In addition, the jury was properly informed that Appellant had struck Officer Harkins with a baseball bat, even though Appellant was not charged with assault against Officer Harkins. Appellant’s actions on the scene with a baseball bat — a potentially deadly weapon— constituted a relevant aspect of the sequence of events that transpired during the aggravated assaults on the responding officers, and further supported the violent nature of the encounter. Finally, the jury was properly informed that Appellant had attempted to grab Officer McKenna’s firearm, even though Appellant was not charged with attempting to disarm the officer in that incident. Appellant’s attempt to grab Officer McKenna’s firearm not only suggests the extremely serious and violent nature of Appellant’s prior aggravated assaults against the officers, but it also has a relevant similarity to Appellant’s actions just before he murdered Officer Gregg.</p>

In the opinion of the three defense experts, on the day of Officer Gregg’s murder, Appellant was acting under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance and was substantially unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, due to some combination of mental illness, intoxication and long-term substance abuse, and recent stressful experiences.

Dr. Mack further opined that Appellant’s brain damage had resulted in the loss of an “internal brake” in his brain, which normally functions to inhibit inappropriate responses or inappropriate behavior due to anticipation of negative consequences. N.T., 11/13/06, at 167-68; N.T., 11/14/06, at 18-19.

He’s missing his brain, to a large extent, regardless of whether he’s on mood altering substance, or sedating substances or not.” N.T., 11/13/06, at 167-68. In addition, Dr. Mack opined that it was “very likely [that Appellant was] in major depressive disorder at the time of the incident in question, as triggered by the removal of his daughter by Children and Youth Services, a few weeks prior, and severe fighting, dysfunction with his daughter’s mother.” N.T., 11/14/06, at 20.</p>

Specifically, he testified as follows: “[w]ell, [Appellant], when he is sober and somewhat stable, he has real modest ability to solve problems.

There’s also the underlying brain damage so that influences how he interacts and reacts in general and that is going to be aggravated with, if not stress, specifically when he’s under the influence of alcohol or drugs.”). With regard to Appellant’s emotional functioning, Dr. Tepper opined that Appellant’s “cumulative history of developmental interferences [from his childhood] ... really disabled him from later developing a strong kind of sense of himself and ability and confidence.” <em>Id. </em>at 29. Finally, Dr. Tepper testified that Appellant had difficulty with “impulse control,” which rendered him at times unable to control himself. <em>Id. </em>at 37-41.

Appellant also asserts that the threats against Mr. Dooley and the officers did nothing to aid the jury’s understanding of the assaults — and thus should not have been admitted — because the threats were not made contemporaneously with the assaults. We cannot agree. Appellant's threats against Mr. Dooley before and shortly after the assault provide further insight into Appellant's intent to cause Mr. Dooley serious bodily harm — if not to kill him. Appellant's threats against the officers took place shortly after he was taken into custody, and they reveal a hostile and threatening attitude toward police officers that not only reinforces the gravity of the prior assaults, but also has similarities to Appellant’s demeanor toward police officers after Officer’s Gregg’s murder. Appellant's assertion that his threats against Mr. Dooley and the officers would not aid the jury’s understanding of his aggravated assault convictions is factually mistaken and legally unsupportable. In addition, Appellant contends that the evidence of his threats against Mr. Dooley was cumulative because it had already been the subject of testimony by two witnesses. Appellant has ignored the fact that the testimony of the prior two witnesses referred to threats made at different times. Mr. Dooley testified to the threats Appellant made against him prior to assaulting him. <em>See </em>N.T., 11/9/06, at 161. In contrast, the other witness, Mr. Forko, testified that shortly after the assault, Appellant stated that he had just stabbed Mr. Dooley, that he should have killed Mr. Dooley, and that he wanted to finish the job. N.T., 11/10/06, at 105-06. Contrary to Appellant's assertions, the testimony of Mr. Dooley and Mr. Forko was not cumulative.</p>

Archambault, </em><a href="/pa/448/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="448 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1944724" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0090-01">448 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%2072" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="290 A.2d 72">290 A.2d 72</a> (1972). The rationale behind this principle is that the judge's expression of opinion leaves an indelible imprint on the minds of the jury and thereby invades the province of the jury to return a verdict. <em>Whitfield, <a href="/pa/474/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="474 Pa. 27" data-case-ids="1732156" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0027-01">supra </a></em><a href="/pa/474/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="474 Pa. 27" data-case-ids="1732156" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0027-01">at 621</a>; <em>Archambault, supra </em>at 73-75. In the instant case, the judge did not state his opinion until after the jury had rendered its verdict and after the judge had imposed sentence, so the concerns expressed in <em>Whitfield </em>and <em>Archambault </em>are not present.</p>
