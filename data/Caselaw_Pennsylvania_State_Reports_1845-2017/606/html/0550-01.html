As Appellees develop, Section 5462(c)(1) does allow for life-preserving medical treatment to be refused in such instances, but only by a health care agent (or the principal should he or she regain the capacity to make health care decisions). Moreover, since a health care agent can only be designated by a competent principal, <em>see <a href="/pa/605/0484-02" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="992 A.2d 75" data-case-ids="3698272,7286771" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0484-02,/a2d/992/0075-01">id.</a> </em>§ 5452(a) (“An individual of sound mind may make a health care power of attorney ... ”), we also agree with Appellees and the orphans’ court that such refusal is unavailable in the case of one who has never been competent to delegate the act of personal medical decision-making in the first instance.</p>

Section 5521(d) and (f) of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, by their own terms, do not provide the exclusive list of unauthorized acts for guardians. Rather, the proscription expressly subsumes acts forbidden of guardians under other statutes, such as Section 5462(c)(1). <em>See <a href="/pa/605/0484-02" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="992 A.2d 75" data-case-ids="3698272,7286771" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0484-02,/a2d/992/0075-01">id.</a> </em>§ 5521(f).</p>

While the Act clearly reflects the express policy of empowering competent adults to effectuate advance health care directives, the provision for health care representation even in the absence of such directives, <em>see <a href="/pa/605/0484-02" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="992 A.2d 75" data-case-ids="3698272,7286771" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0484-02,/a2d/992/0075-01">id.</a> </em>§ 5461, clearly conveys that the statute advances other purposes as well.

    <p id="b625-5" data-blocks='[["BL_625.5",625,[151,865,1155,1004]]]'>With regard to Appellants’ argument that the accountability provision of the Act demonstrates a legislative intent to afford guardians powers at least coextensive with the health care agent, since that section subordinates a health care agent’s decision-making authority to that of a guardian, <em>see <a href="/pa/605/0484-02" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="992 A.2d 75" data-case-ids="3698272,7286771" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0484-02,/a2d/992/0075-01">id.</a> </em>§ 5460(a), we disagree. Section 5460(a) can readily be construed as providing an additional layer of protection to incompetent persons, as a health care agent may be deprived of the power to make life-ending decisions by a guardian. Moreover, although the statute expressly affords a guardian the ability to “revoke” or “amend” the appointment of a health care agent, <em>see <a href="/pa/605/0484-02" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="992 A.2d 75" data-case-ids="3698272,7286771" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0484-02,/a2d/992/0075-01">id.,</a> </em>it does not confer the power to appoint such an agent in the first instance. This dovetails with the plain-meaning interpretation of the overall enactment reflected in Appellees’ arguments and the orphans’ court’s decision — the Act simply does not allow for the refusal of life-preserving care to one who has never had the ability to appoint a health care agent and does not suffer from an end-stage condition or permanent unconsciousness.</p>
