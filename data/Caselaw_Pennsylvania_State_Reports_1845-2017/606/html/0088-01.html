The City’s Director of Finance administered the Plan and had authority to designate a third party to handle routine management. From 1984 to 1992, the Public Employees Benefit Services Corporation (PEBSCO) contracted with the City to serve as the Plan’s third party administrator.</p>

In 1989, the contract was modified to include a surrender fee, equal to 5% of the Plan’s assets, payable to PEBSCO if the City terminated or failed to renew the contract without cause. In 1992, the City wanted to terminate its contract with PEBSCO without having to pay the surrender fee. Without the Director of Finance’s approval, the City used Plan funds to hire outside counsel to accomplish this. The City terminated the contract “for cause,” and sued PEBSCO in federal court for <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>breach of contract;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> PEBSCO counterclaimed.

When Constitution’s bond rating was downgraded, Constitution returned these funds to the City. For eight days, the City held these funds in a non-interest bearing account, later reinvesting them in an account paying 3.85%.

Further, Appellants asserted that as a result of the City’s “gross negligence and/or recklessness as aforesaid,” the Plan and its participants suffered damages in an amount in excess of $50,000.00. <em><a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.2d%20615" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="155 A.2d 615">Id.</a> </em>Appellants also demanded “punitive damages, attorney’s fees, interest, cost and such further relief as the Court deems appropriate.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.2d%20615" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="155 A.2d 615">Id.</a> </em>Appellants attached the Plan to their complaint.</p>

The assertion of a breach of contract claim added nothing to Appellants’ theory of how the injuries occurred; the same conduct by the City served as the basis for either a tort claim or a contract claim. It was the City’s conduct in administering the Plan that constituted the cause of action. Indeed, the complaint set forth all of the facts in thirty-three paragraphs, and then set forth the claim for “gross negligence” in three conclusory paragraphs. Appellants have never deviated from their material assertions that their economic injuries were caused by the City’s administration of the Plan. Accordingly, the cause of action leading to Appellants’ injuries, <em>ie., </em>the City’s grossly negligent administration of the Plan, was stated in the original complaint. <em><a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20914" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="319 A.2d 914">Id.</a></em>

Mrs. Gray obtained a jury verdict, including damages for pain and suffering and delay damages, against the City. The issue on appeal in was whether the City’s waiver of immunity by a city ordinance, which precluded the City from pleading governmental immunity in civil actions arising from bodily injury or death caused by negligent or unlawful conduct by a police officer, was invalid pursuant to the Tort Claims Act. This Court concluded that it was, finding that the City had improperly attempted to waive tort immunity for personal injury beyond the enumerated exceptions granted by the legislature. <em>See also In re Upset Sale of Properties, </em><a href="/pa/522/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="522 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1818920" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0230-01">560 A.2d at 1389</a> (concluding that tort immunity is an absolute, non-waivable jurisdictional defense).</p>

Under the lease agreement between the City and the YWCA, the City agreed to provide security for the detainees and to indemnify the YWCA from all liability for damage to a third party’s property or person occurring on the City’s leased space. Ms. Rodriguez’s family asserted negligence claims against the City, contending that the City had contractually waived its governmental immunity through its lease agreement with the YWCA. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the City, finding that the City could not waive tort immunity by contract. On appeal, the <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>Commonwealth Court agreed, finding that the appellant’s tort action did not fall within any of the enumerated exceptions of the Tort Claims Act, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8542. <em>See also Sims v.

    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[140,709,1153,580]]]'>In both cases, and in <em>Sims, </em>the court rejected an award of tort damages against a political subdivision outside of the enumerated exceptions to tort immunity. Each case concerned the City’s potential liability for tort damages. Neither concerned the City’s liability for contract damages resulting from a breach of an explicit contract. Because the trial court here permitted Appellants, on the basis of the complaint, to proceed in assumpsit, in a nonjury proceeding and only awarded contract damages, I do not find these cases concerning the City’s inability to waive tort immunity and subject the City to tort damages applicable.</p>
    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.6",171,[137,1332,1152,472]]]'>Accordingly, I believe that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found that Appellants’ complaint supported a claim for assumpsit, the City was not prejudiced by the trial court’s decision to permit Appellants to proceed on contract where the facts in the complaint supported a breach of contract, and that the Commonwealth Court erred in reversing the discretionary holding of the trial court in this regard. I further believe that the Tort Claims Act does not bar contract actions. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>

The difficulty is that if the trial court would have granted the City's preliminary objection, resulting in dismissal of Appellants’ case, Appellants would have had the right to replead, and could have more specifically pled their intention to state a claim in assumpsit.

Second, the trial court found that the City was grossly negligent when it agreed to the surrender fee in 1989 and charged the consultant and law firm fees to the Plan without Appellants' knowledge.
