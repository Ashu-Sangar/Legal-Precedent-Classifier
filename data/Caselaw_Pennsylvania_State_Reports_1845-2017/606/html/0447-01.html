After negotiations to replace the agreement reached an impasse, the Union sought binding interest arbitration under Act 111.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a> A three-person arbitration board as required by the Act was convened and sixteen days of hearings followed, during which testimony and exhibits were received. Much of the evidence centered on the City’s five-year financial plan adopted pursuant to the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority Act, and whether the City could financially afford increased benefits for employees of the Philadelphia Fire Department (the “Department”). Relevant to the present appeal, the parties disagreed on both the measures that should be taken to address the safety and health impact of the City’s decision to decommission several fire companies and on <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>the attrition rate that was occurring among fire service paramedics.</p>

The Award, under Paragraph 12, obligated the City to meet and discuss its intentions with the Union before the closing of a fire company. If the parties failed to agree on the “effects” of the closure,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a> the City was compelled to commission an independent impact study to address the expected financial savings and effects upon services, bargaining unit members, and safety. In the event the Union disagreed with the study’s findings, the parties were to negotiate in good faith to resolve disputes surrounding firefighter safety. If those negotiations failed, the Union was permitted to submit the dispute to grievance arbitration. The arbitrator of the grievance, however, would not be able to alter the City’s decision to reduce or eliminate fire companies, but could “order any necessary modifications to the plan which would maintain compliance with relevant safety standards.” Award at 22-23, ¶ 12.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a>

Paragraph 9(A) stemmed from a Union proposal and obligated the Department to create a new two-year “ALS-Engine Pilot Program.” Under the Program, the Department would assign firefighters who had previously worked as paramedics to newly formed ALS Engine companies, and could cross-train paramedics who were on the Firefighter eligible list and assign them to an ALS Engine company every fourth tour of duty. Paragraph 9(B), which neither party proposed, altered the established procedure for transferring from paramedic to firefighter status, giving paramedics with five or more years of service additional points in the testing process and prohibiting the City from refusing to appoint any paramedic whose name reached the Fire Fighter eligible list.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">6</a>

The arbitrator noted, moreover, that since the close of testimony, the City’s position that it was only obligated to bargain concerning the impacts of fire company closure after such decommissioning had occurred, was buttressed by the Commonwealth Court’s issuance of an opinion in another case involving the parties. <em>See Philadelphia Fire Fighters’ Union, Local 22 v. </em>

In response, the Union filed a counterclaim, seeking the Award’s confirmation. On September 6, 2006, the common pleas court denied the City’s petition, granted the Union’s counterclaim, and confirmed the Award.

The court concluded that Paragraph 9(A) directly infringed upon the City’s ability to manage its resources, direct its personnel, and provide its citizens the services it deemed best. The court further concluded that since “these managerial interests [of the City] have been judicially recognized as managerial prerogatives that substantially outweigh any impact on employees, the matter [in <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>Paragraph 9(A) ] was not subject to bargaining.” <em>Id. </em>at 12.

The ability to formulate policies in these areas is essential for the proper and efficient functioning” of the department.

The court noted that its decisional law “establishes that an employer is not required to engage in pre-implementation bargaining with respect to changes in the size of its fire and police departments or plans to close stations. Rather, such policy decisions are a matter of inherent managerial prerogative not subject to arbitration or arbitral review.” <em>Id. </em>at 14.

There, the arbitrator’s decision stemmed, in part, [from] an interpretation of the management’s rights clause [of the CBA] and fact-finding regarding [the] safety of the Plan.

That being the case, the Union asserts that this Court must defer to such finding and uphold the award under narrow certiorari review. The City responds that because a requirement of pre-implementation bargaining interferes significantly with its managerial decision-making, it is non-bargainable under Act 111. In this regard, the City emphasizes that the Commonwealth Court has consistently upheld the principle that fire station closure implicates the level of services that a municipality is willing and able to afford its citizens and, as such, must fall outside the ambit of issues properly subject to arbitration. The City also argues that the underlying purpose of the mandated pre-closure bargaining is to permit the Union to influence and ultimately alter the City’s decision concerning which fire companies to close.

The reasons are self-evident: fire company closures may mean a greater average travel time and distance to a given fire, resulting in a higher probability of accidents en route, as well as a more dangerous situation upon arrival. Thus, it is clear and undisputed that Paragraph 12, in addressing the safety issues that firefighters may confront when firehouses are eliminated, rationally relates to the terms and conditions of employment. At the same time, however, the parties agree that final decisions concerning the size of a municipality’s fire department, the creation, continuance, and closure of companies, and the redistribution of resources and a workforce are recognized as classic examples of managerial <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>prerogatives that a public employer decides on its own. <em>See generally City of Scranton, </em><a href="/citations/?q=429%20A.2d%20779" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="429 A.2d 779">429 A.2d at </a>780-81 &amp; n. 3.</p>

As to decisions regarding fire company closures, in Paragraph 12, the Award takes from the City the complete control it had over of its own decision-making process as to a subject that indisputably lies within its sole discretion under Act 111. That is, Paragraph 12 modifies the decision-making process the City has heretofore followed in decommissioning fire companies and imposes a further procedure upon the City that it must undertake, before a fire company can be closed. Under this provision, decisions of closure cannot be made upon the City’s analysis alone, but only after what the Union considers a proper evaluation, and eventual arbitration, of the impacts of the closures. In addition, by the terms of Paragraph 12, the City is not permitted to put its closure plan into place until after it has completed the specified multi-step process. Even if no change is made to the City’s initial closure plans because of those requirements, the fact remains that the City is precluded from moving forward with its plan in the timeframe that City officials believe would implement closure in an economical and efficient manner and best serve its citizens. This is no small matter in times of public fiscal economic scarcity, such as the City unquestionably faces now. Further, because Paragraph 12 inserts the Union as a participant into the City’s decision-<a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>making process and requires that the City bargain with the Union over a proposed closure’s effects prior to implementation, the provision has the capacity to assert a profound influence over the City’s closure decisions, and ultimately, the City’s policy judgments as to spending, budgeting, levels of fire protection and emergency medical services it should provide, and the prioritization and allocation of competing essential services.</p>

      <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>The City answers that the arbitration board apparently thought that the City should provide more ALS units than it does at present, and that such care should be offered not only through medic units, but also through fire engines specially equipped with sophisticated medical equipment that the engines do not currently incorporate. The City states that this implies it must create a new type of vehicle to offer this higher level of care, but without any ability to transport critically ill individuals, since fire engines do not transport patients. Particularly as the greatest need, in the City’s view, is for additional BLS services rather than services at the more sophisticated ALS level, the City urges that this portion of the award interferes with its managerial functions to decide the level and types of services it should provide to city residents, and to direct its personnel. The City argues that the level of services its fire department should provide — whether through the first responder engines, medic units, or something that does not currently exist such as ALS engines — as well as the type of personnel best suited to perform those services in each instance, are the province of policymakers accountable to the voters.</p>
    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[277,1407,1150,614]]]'>The Union asserts that Paragraph 9(A) is aimed at ameliorating the workload and stressful working environment that paramedics face, and it is obvious that Paragraph 9(A) is rationally related to employee duties and working conditions. But, as the City points out, Paragraph 9(A) just as obviously implicates its managerial interests in determining the level of services that it can afford to make available to its citizens, the staffing that is needed, and the manner by which its workforce should be selected and deployed. Thus, here too, the disputed issue is whether Paragraph 9(A), though rationally related to terms and conditions of employment, unduly infringes upon the City’s managerial responsibilities.</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.6",538,[278,2044,1148,305]],["BL_539.1",539,[156,305,1153,1033]]]'>We certainly do not discount the seriousness of the problem of stres jful working conditions and attrition among the City’s paramedic corps. But, the difficulty with Paragraph 9(A) is that it usurps the City’s essential managerial responsibilities to determine the types and levels of medical emergency protection it deems necessary to provide and to select and <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>direct its financially-strapped resources and personnel. Again, the issue involves far more than simply working conditions. As the City indicates, under Paragraph 9(A), it must now secure ALS-equipped engines that it does not have; it must alter the way that it assigns firefighters and paramedics who will be providing medical services; and it must abandon its plan to meet an increased need for BLS services among its residents. Notably, even the Union itself touts the ALS Engine Pilot Program as a more efficient way of delivering services and managing a work force, demonstrating its implicit recognition that the program implicates managerial prerogatives. We find that Paragraph 9(A), while certainly aimed at working conditions, unduly infringes upon the City’s managerial responsibilities to make workforce assignments and decide upon the levels of emergency medical services that the City can afford to provide and the manner by which such services will be delivered. Accordingly, we conclude that Paragraph 9(A) falls outside of the scope of collective bargaining in Act 111, and thus, we hold that the arbitration board acted in excess of its powers in the Award in question.</p>

The City advances several reasons to affirm the invalidation of this provision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_26" id="ref_footnote_1_26">25</a> Among the reason asserted is the contention that the arbitration board exceeded its authority in awarding Paragraph 9(B) because the provision is unrelated to any topic that was certified by the parties as being in dispute before the board. In this regard, the Union counters that, although the specific requirements memorialized in Paragraph 9(B) were not placed in dispute as such, a board’s ability to act within the scope of the issues actually certified is “expansive,” and Paragraph 9(B) is sufficiently related to the proposals <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>submitted by the Union aimed at improving the safety and working conditions of its paramedics because these proposals raised issues relating to compensation, health and safety, paramedic scheduling, and paramedic staffing. The Union indicates, moreover, that throughout the hearings it addressed its concerns regarding paramedic burnout. Because all past attempts by Act 111 arbitrators to address this difficulty had been unsuccessful, according to the Union, it was reasonable for the present panel to consider the required hiring as a firefighter of any paramedic certified from the eligible list to be related to the issues actually submitted.</p>
    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[281,892,1151,1240]]]'>We agree with the City that Paragraph 9(B) is insufficiently related to any issue that was placed in dispute. Here, the record shows that other than the ALS Engine Pilot Program, the Union submitted four specific proposals pertaining to paramedic schedules and compensation. These included provisions to: (1) provide paramedics with a one-hour lunch break during each work shift; (2) enhance compensation for paramedics designated to serve as preceptors for paramedic trainees; (3) make the percentage wage differential between paramedic lieutenants and paramedics fourteen percent (so as to align it with the existing wage differential between fire lieutenants and firefighters); and (4) develop and use a paramedic performance evaluation form, rather than using the firefighter evaluation form. None of these proposals is related to the concept of facilitating paramedics to leave their jobs entirely by giving them hiring preference when they apply for a different job. The Union’s argument reduces to the position that Paragraph 9(B) is subsumed within these proposals because it, like the proposals, is addressed to the topic of paramedic stress and burnout. This simply is not a sufficiently direct connection to render the paramedic transfer provision an issue in dispute before the board. Therefore, we hold that the arbitration board exceeded its powers in awarding Paragraph 9(B).</p>

The statutory construction analysis of Section 1 that Mr. Justice McCaffery sets forth in his Concurring and Dissenting Opinion ("CO/ DO”) differs significantly from our own. The CO/DO takes the position that the words in Section 1 are not ambiguous, <em>i.e., </em>they express explicitly which specific decisions made by a public employer, from among the many decisions it makes, are subject to collective bargaining. Yet, the CO/DO does not address the line that Section 1 draws between bargainable and non-bargainable matters. Instead, the CO/DO posits that under Section 1, any employer decision that touches upon the employment relationship, even if only tangentially, constitutes a term and condition of employment that must be bargained collectively.

I am not convinced, however, that making dispute resolution concerning the safety effects of the plan a prerequisite to company closure automatically converts Paragraph 12’s mandates into an undue infringement upon the City’s managerial prerogatives. Rather, that aspect of the Award was evidently devised to assure that the bargaining unit members’ interests in workplace safety — a matter of particular concern given the dangers inherent to their work — would be protected, while still allowing the City to implement its reduction plan within a reasonable time frame.</p>

The City proffers that allowing the Union to interfere with its organizational plan in this way would render its “right” to implement fire company closures meaningless. While I do not consider this to be a trivial concern, I would interpret the substance of Paragraph 12 as allowing the closures the City deems necessary to proceed, albeit with any settled-upon modifications to <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>the conditions of employment so that the legitimate safety needs of the bargaining unit members are more likely to be met.

I base my conclusion on the indisputable facts that the awards contained in Paragraphs 12 and 9A plainly address “terms and <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>conditions of employment” as defined by Section 1 of Act 111, 43 P.S. § 217.1, and would not force the City, as employer, to commit an illegal act.

Second, it uses its conclusion to expand improperly, in my view, the “authority prong” of our narrow <em>certiorari </em>scope of review. Because Act 111 explicitly prohibits any judicial review of Act 111 arbitration awards (43 P.S. § 217.7), limited permissible judicial review under our established case law must remain extremely circumscribed; otherwise, we “undercut the legislature’s intent of preventing protracted litigation in this arena.” <em>Pennsylvania State Police v.

Health and safety issues are not an occasional concern or a remote abstraction to firefighters and police. They are a daily fact of work life. They loom large every time these unique public employees report for duty, and they often take center stage in interest arbitration negotiations.
