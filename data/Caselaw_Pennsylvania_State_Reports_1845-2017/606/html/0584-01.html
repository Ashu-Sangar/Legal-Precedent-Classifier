The NAACP and NSCIA sought to hold the firearms industry liable for injury, death, and other damages to association members through the negligent creation of a public nuisance by virtue of the industry’s failure to distribute firearms reasonably and safely. In May of 2001, the NAACP added Insured as a defendant. In its complaint, the NAACP and NSCIA explicitly alleged that the defendants had caused bodily injury to their members. In its prayer for relief, the NAACP sought injunctive relief and monetary damages to establish a fund for the education, supervision and regulation of gun dealers. It did not seek damages to compensate individual members injured by the defendants’ actions.</p>

Royal retained the New York City law firm of Leahey &amp; Johnson to represent Insured in the NAACP action; choosing this firm because of its expertise and past representation of gun industry defendants in a similar action brought by the NAACP. Royal believed that Insured would fair <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>better with independent counsel than in a group defense assembled by other defendants.</p>

Royal further advised that it was providing Insured with a defense under a full reservation of rights, including the right “to seek reimbursement for any and all defense costs ultimately determined not to be covered.” R.R. 2703a. Insured expressed concern that if Royal ultimately determined there was no coverage available to Insured, then it might be less costly for Insured to join a defense group with other defendants rather than proceed with Leahey &amp; Johnson. Royal responded that Insured had the right to retain its own counsel to represent its uninsured interests or to continue to permit Leahey &amp; Johnson to represent their mutual interests. Insured did not obtain independent counsel.</p>

Royal pledged that during its investigation, it would participate in advancing reasonable and necessary defense costs in the NAACP action with the express reservation that Royal “may seek reimbursement of some or all of these costs in a future declaratory judgment action____” R.R. 2706a. On July 18, 2001, Royal yet again informed Insured that it would continue to pay for Insured’s defense until it made its final coverage determination, but that it reserved the right to seek reimbursement for “any and all of the defense costs it incurs in the defense of this matter.” R.R. 2718a.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> By letter dated August 3, 2001, Royal once more indicated that it would fund the defense until it determined the coverage issue.

    <p id="b652-4" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[278,468,1152,1046]]]'>On September 7, 2001, Royal issued a final coverage determination letter informing Insured that pursuant to their insurance contract, Royal “may be under no duty to defend or indemnify [Insured].” R.R. 2724a. Royal further advised that it was contemplating filing a declaratory judgment action to seek a declaration that it was under no duty to defend, and that it may seek reimbursement for some or all of the defense costs incurred after the filing of the declaratory judgment action. Shortly thereafter, on September 12, 2001, Royal followed through and filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Insured for the claims asserted in the NAACP action because the action did not allege or involve “bodily injury” as defined in the policy. In due course, on July 16, 2002, Royal moved for summary judgment and requested reimbursement for “fees and costs paid to or on behalf of [Insured] in connection with the defense of the NAACP action incurred and/or paid after the date of the filling of this declaratory judgment action, <em>i.e., </em>September 12, 2001.” R.R. 164-65a.</p>

To determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend the NAACP claim against Insured, the trial court first ascertained the scope of the insurance coverage granted by the policy. <em>See Wagner v. Erie Ins. Co., </em><a href="/a2d/801/1226-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="801 A.2d 1226" data-case-ids="9412606" data-case-paths="/a2d/801/1226-01">801 A.2d 1226</a>,1234 (Pa.Super.2002) (“The insurer’s duty to defend the insured is dependent upon the coverage afforded by the insured’s policy.”). Reviewing the policy, the trial court determined that the bodily injury portion was designed to compensate a claimant for damages that result from injury to one’s physical condition. Next, the trial court looked to the allegations set forth in the NAACP complaint to determine if they set forth an injury that was actually or potentially within the scope of the policy. <em>See <a href="/a2d/801/1226-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="801 A.2d 1226" data-case-ids="9412606" data-case-paths="/a2d/801/1226-01">id.</a> </em>It concluded that the remedy sought in the NAACP action was not the award of damages <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>for bodily injury, but, rather, contributions to a fund for the purpose of the education, supervision, and regulation of gun dealers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, the court found that it was clear that the relief sought in the complaint did not fall under the protections of the policy and Royal was not required to defend Insured.

A panel of the Superior Court agreed with Insured and reversed the trial court. <em>American and Foreign Ins. et al. v.

Essentially, Royal believes that it is inconsequential that its representatives may have thought the claims alleged against Insured were potentially covered when Insured initially requested defense and indemnification. All that matters now, according to Royal, is that the trial court held in the declaratory judgment action that the claims were not covered and Royal had no duty to defend; a holding affirmed by the Superior Court on appeal.

Royal had not only the duty to defend, but the right to defend under the insurance contract. This arrangement benefited both parties. The duty to defend benefited Insured to protect it from the cost of defense, while the right to defend allowed Royal to control the defense to protect itself against potential indemnity exposure. Although Royal argues that it did not control the defense, it is apparent that Royal selected the firm to represent Insured, and pragmatically made it very difficult for Insured to retain independent counsel. Specifically, in the letter of June 15, 2001, Royal conveyed that Insured could retain its own counsel to represent its uninsured interests, or to join with Leahey &amp; Johnson to represent their mutual interests. At this point, where the claim was potentially covered, Insured would have been at risk of breaching the insurance contract if it had rejected Royal’s defense and it was later determined that the claim was covered. Moreover, upon Royal’s activation of its right to defend, Insured was obliged to cooperate with Royal in defending the action. R.R. 993a. Insured had no reasonable alternative except to proceed with Royal’s chosen counsel. As the Superior Court noted, Royal’s selection of counsel allowed it to monitor and review defense fees, compare them to Royal’s preferred billing guidelines, and refer the invoices to a third-party auditor for scrutiny.</p>

We further observe that by defending Insured, Royal was protecting itself from the potential of a bad faith claim. In order to ensure that insurance companies assume the defense whenever there is the potential for coverage, bad faith damages are imposed where the insurer, with no good cause, refuses to provide a defense. 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371; <em>Frog, Switch &amp; Mfg., </em><a href="/f3d/193/0742-01" class="citation" data-index="160" data-cite="193 F.3d 742" data-case-ids="11563792" data-case-paths="/f3d/193/0742-01">193 F.3d 742</a>. Royal may have been subject to a bad faith action if it did not defend and a court ultimately found coverage. Accordingly, if the insurer could recover defense costs from its insured, then the insured would be paying for the insurer to protect itself. <em>Terra Nova, </em><a href="/f2d/887/1213-01" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="887 F.2d 1213" data-case-ids="10536623" data-case-paths="/f2d/887/1213-01">887 F.2d at 1219</a>. By providing a defense to Insured, therefore, Royal acted as much in its own interest as it did in the Insured’s. It would be unjust to require Insured to reimburse Royal for the cost of the defense where Royal invoked its right to defend in part to protect its own interest.</p>

For example, an insurer could demand the right to reimbursement of all costs expended from the time it received notice of the underlying complaint until the court’s declaratory judgment action, or it could claim the right for the period extending from its final determination until the court’s declaratory judgment decision. This is, in fact, what occurred here. Royal initially claimed a right of reimbursement of all defense costs ultimately determined not to be covered, R.R. 2703a (letter of June 15, 2001), then modified this claimed right to reimbursement by stating that it would not seek reimbursement of costs incurred before it made its final coverage determination or a court concludes it was under no duty to defend, whichever occurred first, R.R. 2720a, and, finally, informing Insured that it may seek reimbursement for defense costs incurred after the filing of the declaratory judgment action, R.R. 2724a. A right of reimbursement outside of the four corners of the insurance con<a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>tract would open the door to this kind of maneuvering by-insurance companies at their policyholders’ expense.</p>

The Complex Insurance Claims Litigation Association (CICLA) also filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of Royal, echoing the sentiments expressed by AIA and NAMIC.</p>

In particular, I am not fully in accord with the majority’s depiction of litigation risk assessments by insurers. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 608-12, 2 A.3d at 541-43. Additionally, I question the majority’s supposition that it would be unjust to provide a party restitution where it acts “in part to protect its own interest^].” <em>Id. </em>at 30.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> I also believe there is a better case to be made for the application of traditional contract-law principles to govern rights reservations (as contrasted with the bright-line rule implemented by the majority) than is developed by Appellants in their brief.</p>

      <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>For instance, some courts have construed a reservation-of-rights letter as an implied-in-fact contract,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> whereby a new agreement is created on the insurer’s proposed terms if an insured fails to object to a reservation-of-rights notice and accepts the insurer’s defense. <em>See, e.g., United Nat’l Ins.

Moreover, at least one commentator has advocated for treating a reservation-of-rights letter as an interim settlement of an unliquidated claim, <em>i.e., </em>a claim subject to a good faith dispute, which would allow an insurer to obtain reimbursement of defense costs if, among other things, the insured acquiesces in, and accepts the benefits of, the insurer’s performance after receiving a reservation-of-rights notice. The rationale is that, under legal principles governing offer and acceptance, an insured cannot accept the insurer’s performance, while simultaneously rejecting a condition the insurer attached to it. <em>See, e.g., </em>Jerry, <em>supra </em>note 1, at 62, 69, 71-72. Furthermore, it reasons, at least to me, that a reservation-of-rights notice could be viewed as an accord and satisfaction,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> particularly where, as here, there appears to be a good-faith dispute as to policy coverage and the insured fails to reject the conditions set forth in the reservation-of-rights letter. <em>See </em>16 Summ. Pa.

In this regard, the insurer is obviously in the most superior position to anticipate the possibility of a future reservation and to account for it at the time of policy issuance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> In addition, having already selected an insurer, the insured faced with a reservation-of-rights letter after the commencement of third-party litigation is at a disadvantage.

Denying restitution whenever a purpose of a party’s actions is to benefit the party’s own interests emasculates restitution in all contractual contexts, given that some element of self-benefit always exists whenever a party undertakes to perform contract duties.”).</p>
