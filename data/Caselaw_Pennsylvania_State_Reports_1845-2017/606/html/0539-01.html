Appellants rely on the original title of the enactment — the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act — as encapsulating its focus; the statute’s foundational concern with “injury to a person or property,” as distinguished from disappointed contract-based expectations; and the numerous expressions of Pennsylvania courts reflecting this limited scope.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> According to Appellants, the Commonwealth Court’s holding is ground-breaking and “havoc wreaking,” Brief for Appellants at 13, in light of the many statutory schemes providing for monetary redress against governmental entities. <em>See, e.g., </em>62 Pa.C.S. § 3935 (providing for damages, penalties and attorney’s fees in connection with the implementation of the Government Procurement Code). Contrary to the Commonwealth Court’s decision, Appellants <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>assert that it matters — and, indeed, remains crucial — to the appropriate application of immunity whether a claim sounds in contract or tort.</p>
    <p id="b604-4" data-blocks='[["BL_604.5",604,[274,470,1154,1642]]]'>According to the College, although the legislative conferral of immunity arose under the former Political Subdivisions Tort Claims Act, upon recodification, it took on the broader title: “Governmental immunity generally.” <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8541. Thus, the College regards the tort rubric associated with the statute as outdated and as merely reflecting a misnomer. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 6 (contending that the “commonly used ‘Tort Claims Act’ moniker erroneously used by the parties is simply a remnant from prior legislation which has long been repealed”). The College argues that there is no attempt, within the Tort Claims Act, as codified in the Judicial Code, to limit the immunity afforded to tort actions. With regard to the series of statutes referenced by Appellants embodying statutory damages remedies against governmental entities, the College acknowledges that targeted enactments control over the more general provision for governmental immunity. It maintains, nonetheless, that, in the absence of such specific provision for monetary relief against the government, immunity applies. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 7-8 (“To suggest that the legislature enacted laws specific to government entities only to preclude any action against a government entity based on that law pursuant to governmental immunity is absurd.”). Addressing the specific language of Sections 8541 and 8542, the College asserts that the claims against it “fall within the legislative definition of ‘damages on account of any injury to a person or property,’ ” <em>id. </em>at 8, albeit without further elaboration of this position. Finally, the College envisions that the recognition of a tort-versus-contract distinction, for immunity purposes, will yield efforts on the part of litigants to subvert the statute’s purposes via advancement of “pseudo-contract” actions.</p>

We also agree with Appellants that nothing about the recodification of the immunity statute within the Judicial Code altered this substantive intent.

As previously noted, however, the College has raised and preserved the threshold issue of whether the legislature intended for the government to be subject to private actions under the UTPCPL in the first instance, since governmental entities are not expressly included in the statutory definition of "persons” subject to such liability. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 19-21 (citing 73 P.S. § 201-2(2) (definition of "person”), 201-9.2 (providing for private actions based on prohibited conduct or omissions by "any person”)). In support of its position, the College references the reasoning contained in a line of Commonwealth Court opinions holding that the Legislature did not intend to include governmental entities within a listing of persons and entities which might technically encompass them, where it did not include the governmental expressly. <em>See, e.g., Huffman v.

Among other things, the Commonwealth Court refused to utilize the traditional analysis because the UTPCPL proscribes a wide range of conduct without differentiating between “tort-like” and “contract-like” violations. <em>Meyer, </em><a href="/a2d/965/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="965 A.2d 406" data-case-ids="8159266" data-case-paths="/a2d/965/0406-01">965 A.2d at </a>414 (citing <em>Johnson v.

The Court also found that consumer protection claims warrant disparate treatment because the UTPCPL enables plaintiffs to recover treble damages and attorneys’ fees. <em><a href="/a2d/698/0631-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="698 A.2d 631" data-case-ids="12010047" data-case-paths="/a2d/698/0631-01">Id.</a> </em>Thus, although it conceded that a common law breach of warranty claim might be actionable under the UTPCPL, the Commonwealth Court concluded that a party cannot assert a consumer protection claim against a local agency unless it falls within an exception listed in section 8542(b).</p>

The UTPCPL is a remedial statute that prohibits service providers and other merchants from engaging in unfair business tactics; enacted in an effort to combat fraud, the statute is to be liberally construed to achieve its objective. <em>See Commonwealth ex rel. Creamer v. Monumental Properties, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/459/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="459 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="481001" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0450-01">459 Pa. 450</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="459 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="481001" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0450-01">329 A.2d 812</a>, 817 (1974); <em>see also Commonwealth v.

Consistent with its stated purpose, the law is broad in scope and applies to the “sale or distribution of any services ... directly or indirectly affecting the people of this Commonwealth.” 73 P.S. § 201-2(3). Furthermore, as the Commonwealth Court acknowledged in <em>Meyer, supra </em>at 414, the UTPCPL forbids certain acts that would <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>enable the aggrieved party to sue for breach of contract in appropriate circumstances. <em>See, e.g., </em>73 P.S. § 201 — 2(4)(v)— (vii) (relating to representations by sellers concerning nonconforming goods or services).</p>
    <p id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.5",609,[154,525,1154,1103]]]'>The Commonwealth Court downplayed these considerations and emphasized minor distinctions between the UTPCPL and common law causes of action. In my view, the legislature’s failure to classify prohibited acts as contractual or tort-based violations should not prevent an individual from suing a government agency under the UTPCPL when the action relates to a contract dispute. The Commonwealth Court’s narrow construction hinders the application of a law that was clearly intended to govern all types of service agreements. Moreover, I am not persuaded that the Tort Claims Act precludes contract-based UTPCPL claims simply because the statute gives courts discretionary authority to award treble damages and attorneys’ fees. <em>See </em>73 P.S. § 201-9.2(a). Appellants are not sure to recover treble damages in this case, and I would not deprive them of the opportunity to seek attorneys’ fees under a statute that embodies a legislative effort to place consumers and sellers on equal footing. <em>See Trizechahn Gateway LLC v. Titus, </em><a href="/pa/601/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="601 Pa. 637" data-case-ids="4196216" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0637-01">601 Pa. 637</a>, <a href="/pa/601/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="976 A.2d 474" data-case-ids="4196216,7294924" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0637-01,/a2d/976/0474-01">976 A.2d 474</a>, 482 (2009) (as a rule, litigants in this Commonwealth can recover counsel fees from an adverse party if there is express statutory authorization).</p>

I would direct the Commonwealth Court to examine the pleadings on remand to determine whether Appellants’ claims satisfy the UTPCPL. If sufficient facts have been pled, the Commonwealth Court should then ascertain whether the claims sound in tort or in contract and dispose of the matter accordingly.</p>
