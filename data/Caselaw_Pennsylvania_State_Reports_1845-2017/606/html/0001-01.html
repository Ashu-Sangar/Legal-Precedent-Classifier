The Superior Court held that appellee’s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor’s commentary concerning appellee having consulted with an attorney prearrest, finding in the process that the prosecutor’s commentary violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the trial record, on its own, proved that counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to object. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand to that court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>

He was in bed in his room, which was below Ms. Feehan’s room, <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>when he heard Ms. Feehan return at about 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. and go upstairs to her bedroom. Mr. Raz testified that after some time passed, “I heard a very loud noise which sounding [sic] like something very heavy hitting the floor. After I heard that noise, I heard a male’s voice saying [‘]oh, shit, Nicole, Nicole, I’m sorry.[’] In a kind of nervous laughter.” Mr. Raz believed this to be appellee’s voice and thought at first that something must have fallen over and broken upstairs in Ms. Feehan’s room and that appellee was apologizing for having knocked it over. At around 8:00 a.m., Mr. Raz arose and went to his medical school classes. He did not return until about 8:00 p.m. that night, at which time he encountered Selina Osborne, Ms. Feehan’s visiting friend from Australia, who was trying to find Ms. Feehan. When Mr. Raz entered the apartment and proceeded upstairs to Ms. Feehan’s room, her door was open and he saw that she was prone on her bed. Mr. Raz “instantly knew something was wrong,” felt her arm, which was “cold and stiff,” and called 911. Ms. Feehan was later pronounced dead from a single gunshot wound to the mouth.</p>

They had alcoholic drinks and used recreational drugs until the clubs closed, then went to Mr. DaSilva’s apartment nearby to have more alcohol. Ms. Osborne decided to stay the night at Mr. DaSilva’s after Ms. Feehan told her that she and appellee were going back to Ms. Feehan’s apartment together and that Ms. Osborne would have to sleep on the couch if she came back with them. The next afternoon, when Ms. Osborne went to meet Ms. Feehan to go shopping, Ms. Feehan did not answer the door or her phone. Trying to track down Ms. Feehan, Ms. Osborne obtained appellee’s cell phone number from Mr. DaSilva, but appellee did not answer her call. Ms. Osborne spent the rest of the day waiting for Ms. Feehan until Mr. Raz returned to the apartment that evening when they discovered Ms. Feehan’s body.</p>

He noted that appellee carried a handgun with him every day. About two weeks prior to Ms. Feehan’s death, Mr. DaSilva testified that the same individuals were together one night or early morning when appellee pulled out his concealed gun and showed it to them and that Ms. Feehan was “kind of startled.” In Mr. DaSilva’s opinion, it was an “uncomfortable situation” and no one was laughing. Mr. DaSilva corroborated that on the night of the shooting, he, appellee, Ms. Feehan, Ms. Osborne, and some others had consumed alcohol and used illegal drugs at some clubs, then went back to his apartment until the early hours of the morning. The next day, Mr. DaSilva tried to contact appellee numerous times on behalf of Ms. Osborne, but he never saw or heard from appellee again until the day of trial. He learned of Ms. Feehan’s death later that night when he stopped at the bar where she had worked. Mr. DaSilva testified that he had been present once or twice when Ms. Feehan and appellee had argued with one another.</p>

Ms. Fagulha had been present approximately two weeks earlier when appellee revealed his handgun at Mr. DaSilva’s apartment, which Ms. Fagulha believed “surprised” Ms. Feehan. Ms. Fagulha related that Ms. Feehan and appellee seemed to argue quite often, which she learned from speaking with each of them independently.</p>

He did not believe that the gunshot wound was self-inflicted because of the way blood <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>presented on Ms. Feehan’s right hand.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a> The Commonwealth’s weapons expert concluded that the sole projectile recovered from the scene was consistent with the size of a bullet for a .45 caliber semi-automatic handgun. Edwin Lieberman, an assistant medical examiner who participated in Ms. Feehan’s autopsy, testified that the blood on Ms. Feehan’s right hand was inconsistent with her having held the gun in her own mouth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a> Dr. Lieberman also testified that Ms. Feehan’s toxicology results indicated the presence of alcohol, cocaine, and Ecstasy, a controlled substance, in her bodily systems at the time of death.</p>

She did not speak to appellee again before receiving a visit from her cousin, Roy Minieri, who stopped by the family’s house in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, on either Saturday or Sunday and told her and appellee’s father that some sort of problem had arisen with appellee and that they should get a lawyer for him. On Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Colavita met appellee at the office of two lawyers in northern <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>New Jersey. Her understanding was that Mr. Minieri had set up the meeting. The next day, the Colavitas’ home was searched by a Philadelphia homicide detective accompanied by a member of the New Jersey State Police. Subsequently, Mrs. Colavita spoke with appellee several times, during which he told her that the lawyers had instructed him not to discuss what had happened, but said that he was not involved.</p>

Appellee testified that he always carried his .45 caliber Smith and Wesson handgun for personal protection and that he would place it under the bed whenever he stayed over at Ms. Feehan’s apartment. Appellee testified that he liked Ms. Feehan a lot, but that the relationship was not serious. He could not recall any major disagreements. Appellee admitted to previously showing Ms. Feehan the gun when they were in bed. Appellee also admitted that he would “kid around with her with the gun” when they were both intoxicated. Appellee also admitted that approximately two weeks before the shooting, he had taken his gun out of his waistband, grabbed Ms. Feehan, and told her to “freeze.” Appellee recalled that Ms. Feehan was a bit surprised, but testified that she was not upset or angry because she knew that he was joking around.</p>

Appellee claimed that he put his gun under the bed and that they began getting intimate when Ms. Feehan reached over him, grabbed the gun, pointed it at him, and told him to take off his clothes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a> Appellee testified that he took the gun from Ms. <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>Feehan, took the bullets out of the clip, put the clip back in the gun, and started to place the gun back under the bed when Ms. Feehan picked it up again. Next, according to appellee, Ms. Feehan told him, “[t]his is how I want to suck your cock,” put the gun in her mouth, and the gun fired. Appellee recalled standing there in shock, maybe saying “[o]h, my God, oh, my God, Nicole, oh, my God,” and that it was possible he said “Nicole, Nicole, I’m sorry,” as Mr. Raz had recalled hearing. Appellee said he remembered nothing else but standing in disbelief and perhaps blacking out. He acknowledged that he left shortly thereafter, without calling the police or seeking help, because he was fearful and wondered how he would explain what had happened. He remembered taking the gun with him. Appellee testified that he felt horrible about Ms. Feehan’s death and was responsible for what happened.</p>
    <p id="b71-5" data-blocks='[["BL_71.5",71,[139,1165,1152,580]]]'>After the shooting, appellee claimed that he wanted to get as far away as possible and thus went to stay with his grandmother in New York. On the way there, he threw the gun over a bridge, from his car window. Appellee testified that he passed out at his grandmother’s and that when he woke up, his head was clearer. Appellee said that he had wanted to explain what had happened, but didn’t know who to call; he then decided to retain a lawyer. He was not arrested until almost two years later, in September 2001. Appellee denied that he placed the gun in Ms. Feehan’s mouth and denied pulling the trigger.</p>

Appellee also admitted that he never called anyone in Philadelphia to check on Ms. Feehan or to tell anyone what had happened. Appellee claimed that he never “racked” the gun so that a bullet would be in the firing chamber rather than only in the clip, but admitted that Ms. Feehan obviously could not have shot herself accidentally, as he contended, unless the gun had been racked and a bullet was in the chamber at the time. Appellee said he did not know how the bullet got into the chamber, that <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>he believed the gun’s safety had been on, and that once he took the clip with the bullets out, the gun would be inoperable. Appellee recalled no major disagreements with Ms. Feehan, but said he believed she wanted to get more serious in the relationship, but that it was not his intention at that time. Appellee admitted taking the gun with him after the shooting and throwing it over a bridge, but denied that those actions had been calculated; he explained that it was more of a frightened reaction to the events. Appellee said he did not recall taking the shell casing with him or whether the gun was in Ms. Feehan’s hand or had fallen from her hand when he took it. Appellee claimed that even though he had not fired the gun, he was too high, intoxicated, and panicked at the time to realize that if he called the police, they would have discovered that she had shot herself accidentally.</p>
    <p id="b72-5" data-blocks='[["BL_72.5",72,[283,1105,1152,677]]]'>Jonathan Arden, M.D., a medical examiner, testified on behalf of the defense. Dr. Arden opined that it is “extraordinarily rare” that an intraoral gunshot would be homicidal (as opposed to self-inflicted) and even more unusual without signs of a struggle or altercation. Dr. Arden also opined that the extent of alcohol and drugs in Ms. Feehan’s system at the time probably lessened her inhibitions and made her more likely to do something careless or dangerous. Based on observation of the autopsy materials, Dr. Arden believed that the gunshot that killed Ms. Feehan was self-inflicted. On cross-examination, Dr. Arden conceded that the evidence would not be inconsistent with the gun being used as part of a mutual sex play scenario.</p>

The Commonwealth notes that, although appellee’s PCRA petition assailed counsel for failing to object to the prosecutor’s comments, neither the petition nor any of the cases appellee cited to the PCRA court articulated the theory that Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process prohibits prosecution commentary on pre-arrest consultation with counsel, just as the Sixth Amendment separately prohibits negative commentary on post-arrest consultation.</p>

Moreover, the Commonwealth notes, <em>Bruno </em>was “doctrinally ambiguous” in that, while it adverted to due process, the due process violation appeared to consist of improper commentary on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The Commonwealth adds that the Ninth Circuit itself has since repeatedly confirmed the Sixth Amendment basis for the decision. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

Thus, appellee’s citation of <em>Bruno </em>cannot convert his Sixth Amendment theory into a substantive due process theory. In any event, the Commonwealth asserts that appellee’s actual theory of objection to the prosecutor’s comments all along sounded in its alleged burdening of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and not in its violation of substantive due process. Thus, the Commonwealth concludes that the underlying theory upon which the panel found trial counsel’s performance deficient was neither available to, nor actually before, the panel, and that basis for relief should not have been introduced by the panel <em>sua sponte </em>and then employed to upset the judgment of the PCRA court, which had confined itself to the theory appellee actually pursued.</p>

First, and contrary to the Superior Court’s construction, <em>Bruno </em>does not purport to recognize a due process right to counsel pre-arrest (and indeed, the Ninth Circuit construes the case as premised upon the Sixth Amendment right). <em>See, e.g., Santiago, </em><a href="/f3d/46/0885-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="46 F.3d 885" data-case-ids="7412674" data-case-paths="/f3d/46/0885-01">46 F.3d at 892</a>.

Moreover, we decline to hold that such a generic allegation invites or obliges the Commonwealth and the PCRA court to ■ identify distinct theories of objection not actually identified by appellee with any specificity or coherence. We conclude that appellee simply did not premise his claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness upon a theory that counsel had available to him at the time of trial, and should have forwarded, an objection that the substantive due process guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment expand upon the enumerated right to counsel and confer a pre-arrest right to consult counsel, such that the government in a criminal prosecution is precluded from arguing negative inferences from a pre-arrest legal consultation.

Given our finding above that the panel erred in finding counsel ineffective on this waived theory of objection, we will not pass upon this contingent argument. Second, the Commonwealth argues that the Superior Court compounded its error by finding counsel’s failure to object <em>per se </em>unreasonable based simply on the trial record, and in the absence of any proffer concerning counsel’s thought process or strategy or the state of the law at the time of trial.</p>

Counsel are not constitutionally required to forward any and all possible objections at trial, and the decision of when to interrupt oftentimes is a function of overall defense strategy being brought to bear upon issues which arise unexpectedly at trial and require split-second decision-making by counsel.
