Immediately thereafter, the trial court proceeded to conduct a certification hearing, at which Child testified that over the past few years she had noticed a change in her emotional stability, and that she has had a hard time dealing with men because of this and other incidents that have happened to her throughout her life.

Further, it found no current deviancy or pathology based upon the psychological evaluation and other evidence.

Juvenile’s probation officer, he emphasizes, based his recommendation to deny certification on a number of factors including: his lack of arrests or involvement with the juvenile system; stable family life; high school graduation and enrollment in college; good grades and attendance in school; volunteer work at a church camp for four summers; and, significantly, a psychological evaluation indicating that Juvenile did not suffer from any psychological disorders and, thus, was not in need of any type of treatment or supervision. The trial court acted within its discretion in denying certification, Juvenile asserts, because he had committed the delinquent acts while he was a youngster, six years before ever being charged, and had, in the intervening years, fulfilled the goals of the Juvenile Act by becoming a responsible and productive member of the community. Otherwise, Juvenile argues, if tried as an adult and ultimately convicted, Juvenile could face incarceration in a state penitentiary and adherence to Megan’s Law II<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> registration requirements for offenses he committed when he was a child.</p>

Based on the proximity of his twenty-first birthday, the Superior Court concluded that there were no dispositional alternatives available to him in the juvenile system, and, thus, he was not amenable to treatment as a juvenile. Juvenile points out <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>that whether a juvenile is amenable to treatment does not depend upon the time available for rehabilitation, especially where the record indisputably demonstrates that he has already been rehabilitated in the several years since the delinquent act was committed. The Superior Court’s determination, he suggests, creates an impossible situation wherein a child who does not need treatment is automatically deemed to be not amenable to treatment under the Juvenile Act. Under the Superior Court’s holding, Juvenile argues, where the juvenile has already achieved the laudatory societal goal of the Juvenile Act by becoming a productive member of the community, he must nevertheless be prosecuted as an adult. This result, Juvenile maintains, is untenable, and turns the Juvenile Act on its head.

According to the Commonwealth, Juvenile must be tried in adult criminal court, as that is the only court that has jurisdiction. It relies on Section 6302 of the Juvenile Act, which defines “child” as an individual “under the age of 21 years who committed an act of delinquency before reaching the age of 18 years.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Because Juvenile is no longer under the age of twenty-one, the Commonwealth <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>submits, the instant appeal is moot, and should not be considered by this Court because it poses narrow and fact-intensive claims that would impact only Juvenile’s case.</p>

The statutory factors overwhelmingly favored the transfer of this case to adult criminal court, the Commonwealth maintains, because the certification hearing was held one week before Juvenile’s twenty-first birthday, at which point the trial court would have lost jurisdiction over the matter. Consequently, it argues, there was insufficient time for the juvenile system to provide adequate dispositional alternatives, which rendered Juvenile unamenable to treatment, rehabilitation, or supervision in the juvenile system. Moreover, the Commonwealth argues, the offenses were extremely serious ones that caused devastating psychological consequences to the victim, and, by their nature, undermined the public’s sense of security. It emphasizes that Juvenile was fully culpable for his offenses, and continued them for an extraordinary amount of time without appreciating the wrongfulness of his actions. The Commonwealth further contends that Juvenile’s attempt to invoke principles of equity is misguided as the requisites governing certification have been enacted by the Legislature, and are contained in the Juvenile Act. Thus, equity cannot provide Juvenile relief where the statutory requirements are not satisfied. The Commonwealth additionally asserts that Juvenile has no right to invoke equity because he comes before the court with unclean hands, as his criminal conduct is at the heart of this case.</p>

Jackson, </em><a href="/a2d/722/1030-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="722 A.2d 1030" data-case-ids="11781857,1701976" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/1030-01,/pa/555/0037-01">722 A.2d at 1032</a>. As Juvenile points out, there was ample evidence to support the trial court’s conclusion that the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden of proving “that the public interest is served by the transfer of the case to criminal court and that a child is not amenable to treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation as a juvenile.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6355(g). As Juvenile cogently notes, the Commonwealth failed to satisfy its burden in this regard, as the only evidence it presented was the testimony of Child, which established that Juvenile committed the delinquent acts, and that such acts caused grave harm to Child. Although he bore no burden of proof, Juvenile presented evidence establishing that the offenses occurred when he was twelve to fourteen years of age, and that he has never had any other charges filed against him in the more than six years between the last incident and his arrest on the charges underlying this case. Additionally, Juvenile demonstrated that he has completed high school, attends college, and volunteered at a church program on a regular <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>basis. Most importantly, Juvenile established that he does not suffer from any psychological impairment, and has no need for any treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation. The Commonwealth did not, in any meaningful way, challenge this evidence, which was vital to the certification determination. As such, the Commonwealth is limited on appeal to the record it created at trial. Thus, based on the record before us, we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in denying certification.</p>
    <p id="b145-5" data-blocks='[["BL_145.5",145,[141,840,1154,1504]],["BL_146.1",146,[280,295,1145,94]]]'>We further reject the Superior Court’s determination that Juvenile should be prosecuted for sexual offenses as an adult because his near-majority age at the time of the certification hearing precludes him from being amenable to treatment under the Juvenile Act. To the contrary, the record indisputably establishes that Juvenile is not currently in need of treatment at all, and, as noted, has somehow, whether through the passage of time, the influence of adults in his life, self-examination, or the like, managed to fulfill the goals required by the Juvenile Act without intervention by the juvenile court system. In sum, this case is unique as it involves serious charges of repeated delinquent acts committed by a child who has rehabilitated himself before he attained the age of twenty-one. It is not for this Court, or for any appellate court, to second guess the evidence of rehabilitation presented to and accepted by the trial court. It is further not the role of an appellate court to reweigh the statutory factors to conclude that the seriousness of the offense and the deleterious effects suffered by the victim warrant certification. While the Superior Court may have disagreed with the trial court’s ultimate conclusion, where there was no misapplication of the law and the trial court’s judgment was reasonable, supported by the record, and unbiased, it should have been left undisturbed. <em>See generally In re Adoption of Atencio, </em><a href="/pa/539/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="539 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="474250" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0161-01">539 Pa. 161</a>, <a href="/a2d/650/1064-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="650 A.2d 1064" data-case-ids="11337967,474250" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/1064-01,/pa/539/0161-01">650 A.2d 1064</a>, 1066 (1994) (holding that the Superior Court applied an incorrect standard of review when it reversed the trial court’s denial of a petition to involuntarily terminate parental rights because the evidence, while suffi<a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>cient to support a denial of the petition, also supported a contrary conclusion).</p>
    <p id="b146-4" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[277,413,1151,1148]]]'>This holding is supported by our previous decision in <em>Jackson, supra. </em>There, following a certification hearing, the trial court ordered the sixteen-year-old defendant to be tried as an adult. A jury subsequently convicted him of robbery and related offenses. On appeal, the defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion by transferring his charges to adult criminal court. The Superior Court agreed, reversed the defendant’s judgment of sentence, and remanded for adjudication in the juvenile court. Specifically, it concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in granting certification without explaining why it chose to disregard the probation officer’s recommendation. This Court reversed, emphasizing that the Juvenile Act places no greater or lesser weight on a probation officer’s report than any other of the statutory factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1038. Our decision rested on the premise that “[t]he ultimate decision of whether to certify a minor to stand trial as an adult is within the sole discretion of a juvenile court.” <em>Id. </em>at 1034. Because the trial court did not misapply the law, exercise unreasonable judgment, or base its decision on ill will, bias, or prejudice, we concluded that the Superior Court erred in finding an abuse of discretion in <em>Jackson. </em>The same is true in the instant case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
