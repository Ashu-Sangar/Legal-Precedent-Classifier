Petitioner was convicted under the Unauthorized Transfer of Sounds on Recording Devices, 18 Pa.C.S.A. 4116(b)(1), and under the Trademark Counterfeiting Statute, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4119(a). This Court subsequently found the Trademark Counterfeiting Statute to be unconstitutional. See Commonwealth v. Omar, 602 Pa. 595, 981 A.2d 179,188 (2009) (holding the Trademark Counterfeiting Statute unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution). Petitioner\u2019s judgment of sentence is therefore VACATED, and this case is REMANDED to the trial court for resentencing on Petitioner\u2019s undisturbed conviction under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4116(b)(1). See Commonwealth v. Goldhammer, 512 Pa. 587, 517 A.2d 1280, 1283 (1986) (remanding for resentencing where the disposition by an appellate court has altered the sentencing scheme of the trial court).",
