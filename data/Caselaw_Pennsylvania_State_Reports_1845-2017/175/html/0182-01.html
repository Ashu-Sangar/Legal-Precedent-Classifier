    <p id="b203-8" data-blocks='[["BL_203.12",203,[164,1611,1174,658]]]'>This suit is an ejectment for less than three perches of land. It appears that the ancestor of both parties, one George Kisner, being the owner of about one hundred and twenty acres, undertook to divide it equally among his five children; two of them, Ann Catharine Kisner and Sarah Ann Weaver, accepted two of the adjoining purparts, each containing about twenty-six acres, and for these parts, on the 20th of December, 1871, their father executed to them deeds describing each tract by courses and distances. Ann C. afterwards conveyed her purpart to Otis C. Fuller, this plaintiff. The purpart conveyed to Ann had upon it the improvements known as the Homestead; that taken by Sarah was in timber, which she afterwards partly cleared off, and erected a dwelling house and other buildings.</p>

The dividing line in the deed to defendant is : “ Beginning at a post, thence south seventy-three degrees east one hundred and twenty-five rods to a stone.”</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[276,584,1164,294]]]'>There was no dispute between the parties as to the starting point of this line; the post is known as the “ Montague ” corner, and both are agreed as to its location. The termination of the line and its exact course are in dispute,- if both are as plaintiff claims, then defendants are in possession of a small triangle, six rods wide at the base, of his land.</p>
    <p id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[279,889,1165,495]]]'>The learned judge of the court below, to whom the case was submitted under the act of 1874, found for the plaintiff. He says: “ The description in the deeds, the survey and marks upon the ground, all aided by extrinsic evidence and explanar tion, proves to our satisfaction, that the true line intended to be fixed and established, and which was practically established, was a straight one from the Montague corner on the west to the iron pin on the east.” This finding fixes the termination of the line at an iron pin six rods further south than defendants claim is the stone called for in the deed.</p>

If this had been a parol partition, one made under the directions of the father, and the children had then, without a written grant, taken possession of their respective purparts, it is probable the great weight given to parol testimony, or as it is termed “ extrinsic evidence,” by the court below would have been warranted. But, if the intention has been expressed by the grantor in the written description of a deed, that must control in the absence of fraud or plain mistake. Neither fraud nor plain mistake in the conveyance is alleged. The learned judge of the court below comes to the conclusion that it was the intention of the grantor tQ describe a straight line from the Montague corner to the iron pin as the boundary of defendants’ land; that may be correct; if the testimony of Bacon, the surveyor who made the partition, be adopted as the very truth, it is cor<a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>rect. But, are we to ascertain the intention of old Mr. Kisner by what a witness says now was his intention, or by what Kisner himself said twenty years ago in the carefully drawn description in his deed ? These words, indicative of his intention, have not been obliterated in a single syllable by the lapse of time. To ascertain the intention, we must go first, then, to Kisner’s deed; for in a long line of cases, from Collam v. Hoclcer, <a href="/rawle/1/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="1 Rawle 108" data-case-ids="1819246" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0108-01">1 Rawle, 108</a>, down to Warfel v.

In the last case cited, it was held proper, where there was ambiguity in the deed, to go back to the written expression in the articles for conveyance, but the rule was not shaken that the written expression of intention, if existing, must determine the fact.</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[218,1193,1168,547]]]'>The deed does not call for an iron pin; it calls for a <em>stone; </em>neither monument would be deemed very durable by a surveyor; not because either would be appreciably affected by time or the elements, but because the location of either could be readily changed by malice or interest. They have but little more permanence as to location, than the usual call for “ post,” which another surveyor rarely finds. But the trees marked as witnesses to the corner, and those marked as line and sight trees leading up to it, are, in surveys no older than this one, found, and when counting to the date of survey are indubitable evidence of the line.</p>

Following that line, on that course, at thirteen and twenty-five hundredths rods we found a hickory line tree blazed upon the east and west sides, a very light mark, for a line tree.” And he then goes on to say that in one hundred and ten rods out of the whole distance of the line, one hundred and twenty-five rods, <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>he found ten marked living trees, some of them actually, all apparently, counting to the date of survey; running this line as all these monuments indicate, by the general course in the deed, allowing for variation.of compass, brings the termination of the division line between the parties six rods south- of the iron pin claimed by plaintiff. In thus running the line, the description in the deed is followed by living impossible to be moved monuments on the ground. To the same effect, is the testimony of George W. West, another surveyor. There is no material contradiction of their testimony; the existence of the line upon the ground, as shown by the marked trees, is not denied. Bacon undertakes, now, to say that these many trees must have been marked on the ground by his axman without his authority, on a line which was experimental; that the true line was a straight one not marked, between the iron pin and the Montague corner; he gives no explanation for his omission to call the corner an iron pin instead of a stone, nor for the neglect to mark trees on the alleged straight line between the pin and the Montague corner; admits he was the scrivener who drew the deed for Sarah Ann Weaver from her father, but states he does not know that the well marked line on the ground corresponds with that in the deed. Not one of the surveyors who ran the lines of the deed by the monuments along the line on the ground alleges the termination could be other than at a point about six rods south of the.iron pin. Notice the testimony of Mr. Lloyd, an experienced surveyor called by plaintiff:</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[231,1696,1171,452]]]'>“Q. Commence and describe that deed of Sarah Ann Weaver’s tract. A. ‘Beginning at a post, thence south seventy-three degrees east, one hundred and twenty-five rods to a stone.’ Q. Does the deed call for that? A. Yes, sir. Q. Does not that course (with the variation) follow the line marked on the ground by the monuments ? A. I did not follow that line; I made a straight line between the two points, the post on the' west and the iron pin on the east. Q. But in running that line you did not follow the course in the deed? A. No, sir.”</p>

That it ever was a monument, or that it continued for nineteen years in the place fixed, rests wholly on parol testimony, and that testimony is flatly contradicted by other parol testimony.</p>

We base our judgment on the failure of the court to find the intention of the grantor from his plainly expressed intention in his deed, and instead, finding it from uncertain parol testimonydehors the deed, to which resort was wholly unnecessary.</p>
