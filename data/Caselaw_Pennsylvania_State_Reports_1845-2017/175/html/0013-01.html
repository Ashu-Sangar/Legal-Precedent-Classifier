Annexed to the deed of trust was a schedule enumerating shares of stock, bonds and cash, but not including an annuity charged on certain real estate in Maryland. About three years after the execution of the first deed of trust, a Maryland court on an application to construe the will of L.’s father as to the Maryland property, decreed “ that the interest of each annuitant in said property, and the right of each to receive his or her annuity from the same as above decreed, do and shall constitute a lien and charge upon the said property and upon the income thereof, which right, lien and charge upon said property is hereby decreed to be the absolute property of each annuitant descendable to his or her heirs at law as real estate.” Thirteen years after the execution of the first deed, L. executed a second deed of trust of all his interest in the Maryland property to the same trustee. Held, that the share of the proceeds of the sale of the Maryland property applicable to L.’s annuity passed under the second deed of trust.</p>
