In his last will, probated a few days after his decease, the testator made the following disposition of his estate : “ All my estate, real, personal and mixed, .wheresoever situated, I give and bequeath to my beloved wife Annie B.

Upon due consideration of the premises, the learned court held, in substance, that appellant took only a life estate in the realty of which her husband died seized, and accordingly entered a decree to that effect, and also awarded the fund in question to the guardian, “ subject to the widow’s right to the income thereof.” This appeal was taken and each branch of the decree is assigned as error.</p>

So far as testator’s real estate is concerned, the devise thereof to appellant is manifestly limited to a life estate by the concluding words, “ for and during her natural life.” Without practically ignoring the plain and universally accepted meaning of these words, it is impossible to otherwise construe the devising clause above quoted; and, as to that branch of the decree, the court should be sustained. But, as to so much of the decree as awards the fund to the guardian, we think the court erred, and that branch of the decree must be vacated. The fund in question, less costs, and expenses if any, should be awarded to a trustee, to be appointed by the orphans’ court to receive and securely invest the same, collect the interest accruing therefrom and pay the same to the appellant semiannually during the term of her natural life, and, at her decease, to pay the corpus of the fund to such person or persons as may then be found entitled thereto. <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>There, appears to be nothing in the case, as presented, that requires discussion.
