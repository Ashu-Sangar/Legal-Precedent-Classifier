      <em>Contract </em>— Foreign <em>attachment </em>— Corporation—Equity—Insolvency. Certain parties, called for convenience the subscribers, advanced money to a land company on condition that the money should be expended by the company in payment for and improvement of a tract of land already purchased for the company, and that the entire proceeds of sale of lots should be paid over to a certain trust company to repay the subscribers, and in the meantime, to secure the latter, the entire capital stock of the Land Company was to be deposited with the trust company. The contract was carried out, and the proceeds of the sale of parts of the land was paid to the trust company for the subscribers; but before actual distribution to the latter, the money was attached by the plaintiff as the money of the Land Company. Apart from the plaintiff’s judgment there was nothing to show that the Land Company was insolvent. It was not shown that the subscribers were the promoters, officers or stockholders of the Land Company. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the effect of the payment to the trust company as agent for the subscribers was the same as if the money had been paid to the subscribers themselves; (2) that even if the Land Company were insolvent and the parties had so acted as to make the agreements fraudulent as to creditors, the remedy was by bill in equity, and not by the collateral proceeding of attachment; (3) that the plaintiff had no standing in the attachment proceedings to claim the money.</p>

Certain parties, called for convenience the subscribers, advanced money to the Ken<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>sington Land Company on specified conditions, the principal of which were that the money was to be expended by the company in payment and improvement of a tract of land in Georgia already purchased for it, and the entire proceeds of sale of lots should be paid over to the Solicitors’ Loan and Trust Company to repay the subscribers, and in the meantime to secure the latter the entire capital stock of the Land Company was to be deposited with the Solicitors’ Company. This is putting the matter in the most favorable light for the appellant, by treating it as a direct contract between the subscribers and the Land Company. In fact it was done by contract of each party separately with the Solicitors’ Company, but as the latter was admittedly merely an agent and trustee the legal effect was the same as if the contract had been made directly between the parties actually interested.</p>
    <p id="b120-3" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[286,1153,1168,1067]]]'>The money was paid over by the Solicitors’ Company to the Land Company, and so far as appears used by the latter in payment for the land. Sales of parts of the land were then made and the proceeds, according to agreement, paid to the Solicitors’ Company for the subscribers, but before actual distribution to the latter the money was attached by the appellant as the money of the Land Company. This was the issue in the court below, and on the undisputed facts the learned judge could not have done otherwise than enter a nonsuit. The money was clearly no longer the money of the Land Company. As between that company and the subscribers at least the agreements were valid, the Land Company was a debtor, and when it paid the money to the Solicitors’ Company as trustee or agent for the subscribers the effect was the same as if it had paid directly to the subscribers themselves. This is an effort by a creditor of the Land Company to overturn the whole transaction and get into its own hands a payment made by its debtor to another creditor. It cannot be done in this way. Even if the Land Company is insolvent, and if the parties have so acted as to make the agreements fraudulent and void as to its creditors, the remedy is by bill in equity and not by a collateral issue in the present form.</p>
