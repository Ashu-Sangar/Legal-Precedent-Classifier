Judgment was obtained against the defendant for $6,868.40, and interrogatories served on the garnishee,, who by his answer admitted that prior to July 8, 1892, he had sundry transactions with the defendant under which moneys became due and payable to the defendant for the mileage earnings of railroad cars, but that on July 25, 1893, the defendant transferred to the Railroad Equipment Company all its right to-these mileage earnings. The garnishee therefore averred that he had no moneys in Ms hands due to the defendant on account of mileage earnings. The notice of the assignment was served upon the garmshee on July 28,1893. A copy of the assignment was attached to the answers filed showing the consideration for the transfer to be the sum of $10.00, for which the Iron Car Equipment Company assigned to the Railroad Equipment Company all moneys then due or hereafter to become due from mileage earnings of cars leased by the defendants to the garnishees. The garnishee filed a plea of nulla bona and the case came to&gt; trial. At the trial it appeared that the garnishee owed the defendant $441.33 on material account not covered by the as<a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>signment.

For that purpose, it gave in •evidence the answers of the garnishee company’s receiver, in which he admitted that, prior to July 23, 1893, nearly six months before the writ of foreign attachment was issued, he had sundry transactions with said defendant wherein certain <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>sums of money became due and payable to it for mileage earnings of railroad cars; but, in tbe same connection, he averred that on said day it transferred to the Railroad'Equipment Company all its right to said earnings, and in consequence of said transfer or assignment, a copy of which is attached to his answer and made part thereof, he had no money in his hands, due to said defendant on account of said mileage earnings.</p>

That branch of the plaintiff’s claim having been properly excluded from the consideration of the jury, the only remaining item was $441.83 for material account, not covered by the assignment above referred to.
