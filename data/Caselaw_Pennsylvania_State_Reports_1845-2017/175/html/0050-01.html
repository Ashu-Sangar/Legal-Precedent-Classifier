The issue came on for trial, and the learned judge who presided thereat directed the jury to find for the defendant. The subjects of complaint are, (1) refusal of the court to continue the case on application of the plaintiff; (2) refusal “ to grant the plaintiff a new trial,” and (3) that the court erred in directing the jury to find for the defendant.

The first and second specifications are therefore dismissed. As to the binding instruction complained of in the third specification, we think the learned trial judge committed no error. There is nothing in either of the specifications that requires discussion.</p>
