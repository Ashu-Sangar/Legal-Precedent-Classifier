To get for their share one sixth of an uncertain selling price was <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>not to give them that certainty which it is the primary object ■of the guaranty of a minimum to secure ; and having secured the fixed guaranty in the first clause, it is inexplicable that •they should immediately thereafter abandon it for an uncertain guaranty which must probably produce a less sum than the fixed guaranty. Of course the guaranty of one third might, as it actually would in the present case, produce more than one quarter of the cost, but the very expression of fifty per cent on cost indicates the desire of the parties that this should be the least.

All their differences were said to be about “ the meaning of a contract,” and the function of the arbitration was “ the proper interpretation of the <em>rights </em>of each of the contracting parties.” In order to perform this duty the referee is bound by the legal rules of construction, which declare that a plain and unequivocal writing must be interpreted by its terms alone, whereas, when there is an ambiguity or doubt as to the meaning of the terms, the contemporaneous construction of the parties must be ascertained if possible.</p>

In his opinion it means no more than if the agreement had declared it the referee’s duty “ to pass only upon the proper interpretation of the rights of each of -the contracting parties ” under “the contract and its renewals.” Etymological niceties are not favored by the law to the detriment of any man’s right, and they are particularly inappropriate in the interpretation of papers drawn by laymen. In this very contract the first sentence contains the inaccurate statement that the question has arisen concerning a contract “ dated the thirtieth day of September, 1878,” without any reference in the sentence to the fact that the main difficulty arose under a contract dated July 24, 1884. And when the subject struck the draughtsman in the next sentence he roughly spoke of “ the contract and its renewals,” forgetting that in so far as a dispute had arisen concerning the contract of July 24, 1884, it was not a “renewal ” but a new contract. These inaccuracies do not impair in the least the clearness or the validity of the agreement of reference, but they serve to illustrate the point that judicial tribunals may not permit merely learned theories to interfere with the administration of justice.</p>
