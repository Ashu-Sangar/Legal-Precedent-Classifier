    <p id="b179-14" data-blocks='[["BL_179.16",179,[160,1746,1164,91]]]'>The act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 212, relating to the Superier Court, etc., in the seventh section thereof declares:</p>
    <p id="b179-15" data-blocks='[["BL_179.17",179,[156,1849,1168,451]]]'>“ Section 7. The said court shall have no original jurisdiction except that it may issue writs of habeas corpus, but it shall have exclusive and final appellate jurisdiction of all appeals which are now allowed to the Supreme Court in the following classes of cases the second of which is class <em>l, </em>relating to cases in. the court of oyer and terminer and providing thus, “ (5) All proceedings of any kind in the court of oyer and terminer and general jail delivery, except cases of felonious homicide, which shall be appealed directly to the Supreme Court.’!</p>
