They attributed the omission to accident, since, as they say, “ the rule is of great antiquity, and . . . imperatively required now by considerations of convenience almost amounting to necessity.” After stating that it is contained in the Justinian code and the English statute of distributions, and that it exists in most, if not all, of the laws of the Union, the commissioners added further: “ The doctrine of representation, <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>or that rule by virtue of which the descendants of a deceased relation to the remotest degree, are permitted to stand in the place of their ancestor and to receive his share of an estate, if there be no others of the same degree of such deceased relation living, may be admitted without great inconvenience in the case of lineal descendants; but when it is applied to collateral kindred it is productive of serious evils. Thus, if one die leaving children, and grandchildren, the issue of a deceased child, those grandchildren, by the rule of representation, are allowed to stand in the place of their deceased parent, and to take the share of such parent; and the same principle admits great-grandchildren, and even more remote descendants, to personate their deceased ancestors, without, as already stated, any inconvenience. When, however, one dies having no lineal descendants, but collateral Mildred, as brothers and sisters and their descendants, or uncles and aunts and their descendants, it is obvious that the doctrine of representation, by raising remote descendants to the level of any one of the brothers and sisters, or uncles or aunts, who happened to be living, and consequently by requiring search to be made for such descendants, who are often scattered over a large part of our country, produces great delay and often great hardships. The extension of the rule beyond the boundaries provided in the codes of foreign countries and of our own Union, has been lamented by our most eminent judges and professional persons. Considering that the present system leads to a great increase and delay of litigation, the restoration of the old rule is submitted to the legislature as a measure of wisdom and prudence.”</p>

It certainly is not attempted by the act of May 25,1887. That act contains no words of repeal. Its title is (P. L. 261), “ An act relating to estates of intestates, providing that children and descendants of deceased grandparents shall represent such deceased grandparents whenever grandparents are entitled as next of kin to intestates.” The enacting clause makes no attempt to go beyond the purpose expressed by the title, as, of course, it could not do without conflicting with the constitutional restriction. It provides that “ whenever by the provisions of the intestate laws of this commonwealth, it is directed that the real 'and personal estate shall descend to and be distributed among the next of kin to such intestate and such next of Idn shall be one or more than one grandparent of such intestate, and there shall be living at the time of the death of such intestate, children or other descendants of any decease^ grandparent, then the children or other descendants of any such deceased grandparent shall represent the grandparent so deceased, and shall take the share of the real or personal estate to which such deceased grandparent would be entitled to if living.” All that follows in the act simply provides for the manner in which the children and descendants of “ such deceased grandparent ” shall share the estate with the living grandparent; the manifest intention of the act being to meet the case of McDowell v. Addams, <a href="/pa/45/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="45 Pa. 430" data-case-ids="9503396" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0430-01">45 Pa. 430</a>, where a living grandparent was held to take to the exclusion of descendants of a dead one.</p>
