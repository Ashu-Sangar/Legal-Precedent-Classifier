Plaintiff is informed that the subsequent vicissitudes of the property have been as follows: The Elk Coal &amp; Coke Co., subsequently known as the Fisher Coke Co., went out of business for lack of funds, and has no visible assets, as far as plaintiff knows, and is insolvent. The Union Trust Co. leased the property which it had purchased to one William M. Harrison, who was not able to pay the rent, and he sublet to the Standard Coal &amp; Coke Co. This was an irresponsible company, promoted by said William M. Harrison for the purpose of becoming such lessee in conjunction with persons interested in the said Fisher Coke Co. The Standard Coal &amp; Coke Co. was also unable to pay the rental or to pay its own obligations, and fell into the hands of a receiver, since which time said William M. Harrison and one Duncan and others are said at intervals to have been conducting from time to time alleged negotiations with the Union Trust Co., with a net result of nothing except further incidental complications, including a sale by a receiver of the Standard Coal &amp; Coke Co. Plaintiff never recognized any of these transactions, and always refused defendant’s request to take part therein.</p>

Except the bonds owned by the plaintiff and some others owned by said Union Trust Co., all of said bonds belonged to the stockholders in the Caledonia Coal Co., which had leased part of its property to said Elk Coal &amp; Coke Co., afterwards Fisher Coke Co., which had no means to develop the property or to pay royalties except in so far as it obtained money by selling to plaintiff and others its bonds under said mortgage of $40,000 to the Union Trust Co., defendant herein. As before mentioned, however, plaintiff declined to be a party to any of these schemes. The plaintiff was not interested in thé Caledonia Coal Co. The net results of these various arrangements would have been to have paid the Union Trust Co. first, and the plaintiff’s interest, if he had consented to the same, would have been left thereafter to an adverse substituted trustee. Notwithstanding the refusal of plaintiff to take part in this scheme-or to consent thereto, he avers that defendant, as owner of some of the bonds of the Elk Coal &amp; Coke Co., has entered into said agreement with all the other bondholders, except the plaintiff, and that the mortgaged property is now held by the defendant as a voluntary trustee, first for itself as a preferred beneficiary for the amount it paid for the bonds of the Elk Coal &amp; Coke Co. owned by it, and in the further trust that on defendant, being thus paid it will turn over the trust to the nominee ■ of a majority of the remaining bond owners, all of whom, as before mentioned, are stockholders in the Caledonia Coal Co., and their interests are adverse to plaintiff’s.

After the discovery by the plaintiff that the lien of the mortgage had been discharged by the sale under the prior lien, upwards of a year passed in the various efforts made by the defendant to secure a surrender of plaintiff’s bonds upon the new trust hereinbefore set forth. For some time thereafter nothing was done, and later on plaintiff consulted counsel, who communicated from time to time with the defendant, with a view of having defendant repay plaintiff said $4,000, in which way another year passed, when, being unable to induce the defendant to pay him back the purchase money for said bonds, the plaintiff gave notice, both to the defendant and to the Fisher Coke Co., that he had elected to rescind the said purchase, and he thereupon, on January 25,1895, tendered the said bonds to the defendant, which declined to pay him for the same, and plaintiff still retains said bonds for the defendant’s account. Plaintiff avers that the defendant has in no way been injured by the plaintiff’s delay in electing to rescind the purchase of said bonds, and the plaintiff never in any way waived his legal rights against defendant, or induced the defendant to suppose that he would do so, and that no act or omission of plaintiff has in any way prejudiced the defendant in the premises.

The defendant is the mere trustee of the mortgage given by the Elk Coal &amp; Coke Company for the protection of the bonds issued by that company. None of the money derived from the sales of the bonds was received by the defendant, and <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>no engagement to pay any of the bonds was made by it. It is claimed for the appellant that the certificate signed by the trustee, and printed on the bond, created a liability to pay the money due on the bond by the Elk Coal &amp; Coke Company, because it contained an assertion that the mortgage was a first lien on the lands described therein and that this assertion was false. It is difficult to understand how this defendant would be liable even if the certificate contained such an assertion, but as it does not, there is not the least vestige of liability arising from it. The certificate is in these words, “ This bond is one of a series of bonds within mentioned and is secured by mortgage as therein déscribed duly recorded in Elk county.” The description referred to is that which is contained in the bond. Recurring to the bond we find it contains a recital that-each bond is one of a series of bonds comprising eighty in all, of $500 each, amounting to $40,000 in the aggregate. It recites further that the payment of the bonds is secured by a mortgage of even date upon the real estate, plant, improvements, leasehold interest and corporate franchises of the Elk Coal &amp; Coke Company particularly described in the mortgage to the Union Trust Company as trustee, in trust to secure the full payment of the bonds as they fall due, “ to which mortgage reference is hereby made for a full description of the property mortgaged to secure the payment of the said bonds and interest and for the remedies afforded to enforce the collection of the same.”</p>

But the plaintiff’s case is worse than this. Not even the mortgage itself contains any covenant or guaranty that it is, or was intended to be, a first lien, and hence it would not be possible to imply an undertaking or assertion of that character from the reference to it made in the bond. The only matter contained in the mortgage on this subject is a recital of a resolution, passed at a meeting of stockholders of the Elk Coal &amp; Coke Company, that the mortgage was to be a first lien, but as in point of fact it was not a first lien it simply follows that the board of direct<a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>ors, of which the plaintiff was one, did not perforin their duty in that respect. While the plaintiff might well be considered responsible for this failure of duty on his part, it is quite out of the question to hold the defendant responsible for the dereliction of the plaintiff, or of the whole board, in this regard. The case is entirely without merit in any point of view and the learned court below was right in sustaining the demurrer.</p>
