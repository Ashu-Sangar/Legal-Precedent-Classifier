Held, (1) that it was proper to leave to the jury to determine whether the giving of time was under an agreement by which the customer had an absolute right to take away all his goods, and not to pay for them until the expiration of a specified time, or whether the giving of the time simply related to the bills for those goods which the dyer chose to deliver without enforcing his specific lien, and in reliance upon the general lien given him on the balance of the goods in his hands for the entire amount due him; (2) that it was not error for the court to charge that the dyer did not lose his lien by occasionally or frequently or habitually allowing C. &amp; Co. to take away goods and pay for them after thirty or sixty days, if the course of business was that there was a constant shifting, new goods coming in to take the place of those which were taken away.</p>

At the time of their failure a large amount of their goods in course of finishing were in possession of the defendants at their works in Philadelphia, known as the Providence Dye Works. The firm of Crenshaw &amp; Co. assigned to the plaintiffs all their right in these goods. The plaintiffs tendered to the defendants the amount due for the finishing; of the goods in question and de<a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>manded their delivery. This was refused, and the plaintiffs then took possession of the goods by replevin, the defendants claiming the right to the goods under the general lien for the balance of their general account, as well as under a specific lien for the work done on the goods in question. The dyeing orders sent by Crenshaw &amp; Company’s customers on blanks furnished by the dyers contained the following notice:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b67-5" data-blocks='[["BL_67.6",67,[171,1017,1168,1167]]]'>[There is another question which, with the view I take of the case, I feel bound to present to you. I have already said in substance that if the course of dealing between these parties was exhibited, as is claimed by the defendants, by numerous papers, detailing in a clear and distinct form a notice which the defendants relied upon, if you believe there was such a practice, you might infer that the defendants were right in their claim, that part of the case standing hy itself. Yet it appears that the case is to be modified somewhat, if you believe there was a distinct arrangement between the defendants and Crenshaw &amp; Co. whereby their dealings were transacted on a different basis, and as I look at the case now, it seems to me, if the arrangement under which the defendant firm undertook to dye the finished goods for Crenshaw &amp; Co. was an arrangement of credit, whereby they undertook to give them a specific credit and deliver their goods to them, and allow them thirty or sixiy days or any other time, then they gave up their right of lien under ordinary circumstances. That is, if they agreed to do this work and deliver the articles on which they had done it to Crenshaw &amp; Co., under an arrangement that they would wait thirty or sixty days or any other given time before they were paid, they gave up the right of possession, and having given up that right, they gave up the right of lien.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b68-4" data-blocks='[["BL_68.4",68,[294,717,1163,646]]]'>I do not consider that the defendants lost any right of lien which they had by simply accommodating the firm of Crenshaw &amp; Co.; they did not lose their right of lien by occasionally or frequently or habitually allowing Crenshaw &amp; Co. to take away goods and pay for them after thirty or sixty or ninety days if the course of business was, as it seems to me to be the’ case, that there was a constant shifting, new goods coming in to take the place of those which were taken away. It is only on the basis of your seeing in the evidence that which leads you to believe that the defendants entered into a definite agreement with the firm of Crenshaw &amp; Co. that they would do the work for them on credit, and that that continued down to the time when the firm of Crenshaw &amp; Co. failed.</p>
