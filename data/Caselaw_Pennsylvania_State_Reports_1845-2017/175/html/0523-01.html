The reason why such property, so used, is exempt from taxation as real estate, is that it is not real estate but is a part of the corporate franchise. If any part of the ground in question was used for other purposes than as the bed of a railroad, that portion would <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>be liable to taxation. Bnt as the affidavit of defense alleges that the whole of the lot is so used it is not the subject of taxation or assessment if that averment is sustained. The defendant is therefore entitled to be heard as to the facts alleged in the affidavit and the case must go to a jury. Appeal dismissed without prejudice.</p>
