The space to be paved is one block in length. The ordinance empowered the committee on streets of the city council to advertise for bids for the required paving and to enter into a contract with the lowest responsible bidder. The ordinance also directed the committee on streets to enter into contracts on behalf of the city with the owners of abutting property to furnish the paving-brick necessary for the improvement and for furnishing and setting the necessary curbing. The street had formerly been paved with block stone. These had become so worn and broken that repair of the street was deemed advisable. All of the owners of abutting property except one entered into an agreement in writing with the city for the payment into the city treasurer’s hands of their proportionate shares of the cost of the paving brick and curbing. The property owner who did not sign the <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>agreement to contribute to tbe cost owns twenty-three feet and five inches of front on that part of the street to be paved. The ordinance referred to appropriated $350 to pay the cost of the work to be done in laying the pavement. Pursuant to the notice for proposals for furnishing the materials and laying the pavement referred to, bids were presented by M. R. Rouse and W. H. McDonald. The bids were not for the whole job at a lump sum, but for different parts of the work at prices stated in the bids. At a meeting of councils held July 15, 1895, the bids were opened, read and referred to the committee on streets with power to enter into contract with the lowest responsible bidder. This committee afterwards awarded the contract to M. R. Rouse and entered into a contract with him for the work proposed. Titusville is a city of the third class. The complainants are citi zens, property owners and taxpayers of said city. Three grounds of complaint are set forth in the bill. First, that if the proposed paving is an original improvement the whole thereof ought to be paid by the owners of abutting property, and that the ordinance was not passed pursuant to a petition of such owners of abutting property, as provided for by the act of May 23, 1889; that if the proposed paving be not an original improvement no part thereof should be paid by the owners of abutting property. Second, that the said M. R. Rouse was not the lowest responsible bidder for the proposed undertaking but that the said W. H. McDonald was the lowest responsible bidder, and that the committee on streets awarded said contract to said Rouse arbitrarily and through favoritism and without legal cause. Third, that the indebtedness of said city is at present in excess of two per cent of the assessed valuation of property in said city; that no vote was taken to authorize an increase of the debt, and that the contract above recited increases the debt of the city contrary to law.</p>

It is conceded by the complainants that the bid of McDonald is in fact $104.94 less than that of Rouse. The evidence does not make it clear that the bid of McDonald is lower than that of Rouse for the same work. The testimony of the two accountants, Hallgreen and Beardsley; was introduced to show that from their computation of the material to be furnished and the work to be done, as ascertained from the plans and bids, the bid of McDonald was $104.94 less than that of Rouse. It does not appear, however, that either of these accountants is familiar with the work contemplated, or able to determine from an inspection of the plans what amount of work will be necessary in order to complete the improvement. According to the testimony of the city civil engineer, whose experience entitles his testimony to consideration, the work according to Rouse’s bid would amount to $1,579.50, and that of McDonald to $1,550. The witness explains, however, that there are doubtful points in the bid of McDonald which leave it uncertain whether his bid would be lower than that of Rouse. For instance, the bid of McDonald proposes that in case more than two inches of sand are required in laying the pavement to furnish the extra filling required, gravel and sand, at 60 cents per cubic yard; while the bid of Rouse proposes to furnish sand at 70 cents per cubic yard and gravel at 35 cents per cubic yard. The condition of the street after the old pavement is removed must determine, as shown by the testimony of the civil engineer, whether a larger proportion of gravel or sand will be necessary to bring the bed up to the necessary grade for laying the brick. [The street committee with the assistance of the city clerk made a calculation from the bids and plans and reached the conclusion that Rouse’s bid was the lower, and thereupon awarded to him the contract. There is no evidence to show that the committee was influenced by prejudice or favor or by any other consideration than the public interest in awarding the contract.] [16] It was proved Rouse had a large experience in laying street pavements; that McDonald had never laid a street pavement with brick, and <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>none with stone except a portion of Spring street in Titusville, including the part now to be repaired. Difficulty arose between him and the city at that time on account of the character of the work done or material furnished which resulted in a suit against the city by McDonald and a judgment in his .favor. Rouse had had a large experience in laying stone and brick sidewalks in the city of Titusville, and is a man of integrity and industrious habits. [The street committee took into consideration in awarding the contract the experience of Rouse and the inexperience of McDonald in the construction of street pavements.] [17]</p>

[Money from that balance is available to apply on the liability created by the contract under consideration.

When the corporation has power to do particular work it may authorize its agents to enter into contracts, and such contracts will be binding upon' the corporation. In Hitchcock v. Galveston, <a href="/us/96/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="96 U.S. 341" data-case-ids="3379783" data-case-paths="/us/96/0341-01">96 U. S. 341</a>, it was held that the city of Galveston was bound by the terms of a contract made on behalf of the city by the mayor and chairman of the committee on streets and alleys who had been authorized and directed by ordinance to “ enter into and make contract or contracts with proper and responsible parties to fill up, grade, curb and pave the said sidewalks; ” and Mr. Justice Strong in delivering the opinion of the Court said: “ If the city council had lawful authority to construct sidewalks, involved in it is the right to direct the mayor and the chairman of the committee on streets and alleys to make a contract on behalf of the city for the work.

    <p class="summary" id="b541-3" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[203,688,1181,1736]]]'>Under the evidence in this case it cannot be said that the contract entered into by the city was the incurring of indebtedness within the meaning of the constitutional provision limiting the power of municipal corporations to contract debts. The actual liability created is very small. [It is not asserted that the contracts of the owners of abutting property for the payment of their proportionate shares of the cost of material are not available to the city.] [21] Through these contracts the city secures a very large proportion of the cost of the improvement, the whole of which will probably not exceed $1,600. The current revenues of the city are largely in excess of the requirements of this contract. The testimony is not contradicted that there are several thousand dollars in the city treasury not needed for fixed liabilities but available for any lawful undertakings of the city. The city has undoubted authority to improve the portion of the streets to be paved and pay therefor out of the general revenues of the city, if such revenues be sufficient. In the Appeal of the City of Erie, <a href="/citations/?q=91%20Pa.%20898" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="91 Pa. 898">91 Pa. 898</a>, the court quotes with approbation Dill, on Mun. Corp. sec. 88, to the effect that when a contract made by a municipal corporation pertains to its ordinary expenses and is together with other like expenses within the limit of its current revenues and such special taxes as it may legally and in good faith intend to levy therefor, such contract does not constitute an increasing of indebtedness within the meaning of the constitutional provision limiting the power of municipal corporations to contract debts, and adds, “ This, we hesitate not to say, is a sound constitutional interpretation, and in a similar case might well be adopted in the construction of our own constitution. If the contracts and obligations of a municipal corporation do not overreach their current revenues, no legal objection can be made to them, no matter how great the indebtedness of such municipality may be; for in such case their engagements do not extend beyond their present means of payment, and so no debt is created.” N</p>
