    <p class="summary" id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.11",429,[231,774,748,43]]]'>Gordon, J., filed the following opinion:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b429-6" data-blocks='[["BL_429.12",429,[185,824,1167,1579]]]'>This is a rule on part of N. L. Hoover, one of the defendants, to open a judgment entered May 19, 1876, for want of an affidavit of defense, because the "writ of summons was not served upon him, but instead, service thereof was accepted by the firm of McEnally &amp; McCurdy for defendants without his knowledge or authority. The evidence, however, shows that the petitioner had knowledge of the fact that service had thus been accepted, and appearance entered for defendants, and that judgment by default had been entered, within “several months after the judgment had been obtained,” and that he acquiesced therein, and made no move to have the judgment opened till August 19, 1887, which was eleven years after entry of judgment, and more than ten years after he had knowledge of it, during which time the plaintiff therein died, and proceedings were had to revive and collect the judgment. This was certainly gross laches on the part of petitioner, and amounted to a confirmation of the act of the attorneys hr appearing and accepting service for him and his codefendant. His unfortunate financial condition at the time may have been, as he claims, the cause of this laches, and a hardship may result to him in consequence, but in the eye of the law it is no excuse for it, and does not relieve the delay of the consequences which flow from it. Mere lapse of time intervening after an appearance and acceptance of service by any attorne3r raises a presumption of authority so to act, or at least of the knowledge and acquiescence of the party therein, and while this presumption may be rebutted, it requires clear proof to do so, which must extend not merely to the lack of authority, but to the lack of knowledge and acquiescence as well, to which extent the proof in this case, as before stated, does not go.
