At the place of the accident there were four tracks, the two innermost being used for freight, and the outside ones for passenger trains. The deceased and a man named Kerr approached the crossing when a freight train consisting of about sixty freight cars was coming from the north on the third track. They cleared the third track, and when the deceased was upon the fourth track he was struck by a light engine coming from the north, and instantly killed. The track for a mile to the north of the crossing was almost straight. The speed of the freight train seems to have been about fifteen miles an hour, and that of the light engine from forty to sixty miles. There was conflicting evidence as to the distance of the freight train from the crossing at the time the deceased and his companion started to cross the track, the distance varying in the evidence from one hundred feet to two hundred yards. The evidence was also conflicting as to whether or not the light engine upon the fourth track had sounded its whistle or rung its bell. The evidence for the plaintiff tended to show that the deceased stopped, looked and listened at a place a few feet from the first track. The deceased was forty <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>years of age, and a file cutter by trade. The accident occurred about 2:30 p. M.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[283,468,915,42]]]'>Defendant’s points were among others as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b592-6" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[238,518,1170,1421]]]'>1. The evidence shows that the deceased attempted to cross the railroad in front of a long train of cars whose approach on track No. 3 was plainly visible, and which train, although moving slowly, was nearing the crossing when the deceased started to go over. It was the duty of the deceased, under such circumstances, to wait until the train on No. 3 track passed by. Its approach necessarily hid a portion of track No. 4, and the noise made by it was calculated to drown the noise of any locomotive or train approaching on said track No. 4 and to prevent signals of such train from being heard. To cross the tracks under such circumstances was negligence on the part of the deceased. <em>Answer : </em>The facts as arrayed here are for the consideration of the jury. They are very forcibly arrayed, and they ought to have great weight in your minds, but nevertheless I will not say to you as a matter of law under the circumstances of this case that the decedent was bound to wait until the train on No. 3 track, which has been called the freight train, had passed by. Nor will I say to you as a positive matter of law that crossing the track by the decedent under the circumstances was negligent, but I say to you that, bearing in mind the circumstances stated in the point, and giving them all the effect possible, it is for you to determine whether under those circumstances an ordinarily prudent man ought to have gone across. If he ought not to have gone across on consideration of these circumstances narrated in this point, and the circumstances in the case generally, then your verdict must be for the defendant. If you think, however, that an ordinarily prudent man ought to have gone across, then your verdict may be for the plaintiff. [2]</p>

If the jury believe that the deceased, by waiting until the train on No. 3 track had got over the crossing, could have commanded a better view of track No. 4, and could have had a better opportunity of hearing the approach of a locomotive or train on the track last mentioned than he could have commanded or had while the train on track No. 3 was drawing near, then they must find for the defendant; because it is the duty of a person who is about to cross a railroad when an uninterrupted view of the track is wholly or partially prevented by the existence of an <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>obstruction which is being removed, to wait until that obstruction is removed and the view thus becomes uninterrupted; and if the facts are found as stated in the first portion of this point, then the deceased did not perform his duty, and he was guilty of such contributory negligence as will preclude a recovery by the plaintiff. <em>Answer: </em>I again say to you that these considerations of fact, if you should find them so, are all of the very greatest importance in determining the responsibility of the decedent at that time and place, but I will not charge you as a matter of law that the thing is concluded. It is for you to determine under all the facts whether, by admitting the facts as narrated in the point, the decedent was justified at that time and place and under those circumstances, as an ordinarily prudent man, in going across. If he was, the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict. If he was not, the defendant is entitled to a verdict. [3]</p>
