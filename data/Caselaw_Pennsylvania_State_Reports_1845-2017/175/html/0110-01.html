The cestui que trust, who was a woman, subsequently made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. It appeared that the income of the trust estate was paid to the cestui que trust with the interest money charged against her; that of this and of the nonpayment of interest by the assignee she had full knowledge; that she was not ignorant of business matters and had had large experience as to banking and commercial transactions; that she scrutinized the accounts of her trustee and knew every item charged against her, and that she acquiesced in the interest being charged against her in the trustee’s account. Held, that the trustee could not claim any interest on the mortgage out of the cestui que trust’s assigned estate.</p>

These facts appeared in the testimony of Mr. Wright and Mr. Patterson before the auditor. It further appeared from their testimony and the account books of claimants that Amanda M. Clemens had collected some $700 of the estate due the. assignee and had retained the same. She also occupied a dwelling house in Bristol, Bucks county, Pennsylvania, belonging to the assigned estate, on which she paid the taxes and interest on mortgage thereon, but failed to pay any rent. That house was worth in rent about $100 per year more than the sums she paid on and for it.</p>

Prior to her assignment in 1886 the interest on the $7,500 mortgage had been debited in her account as if received and credited as if paid her, the credit entry each six months being stated as follows : “Credit to adjust interest, per contra, $187.50.” No money actually passed. After the assignment and until the property was sold in 1898, the same course of debit and credit was pursued, and the books of the Trust Company do not show any interest due them on this mortgage. The income was paid Mrs. Clemens with this interest money charged against her. Of this and of the nonpayment of interest by the assignee Mrs. Clemens had full knowledge, and by her silence and passiveness she ratified and approved the acts of her trustee.</p>

She opposed the foreclosure of the mortgage;, because she knew the real estate market was not good, and desired the property to be held by the assignee subject to the mortgage, so that at a future time a larger price could be obtained, and in pursuance of such course never demanded the interest from the assignee, and acquiesced in being charged by her trustee with it. Of course, she had a right so to do. The money obtained by the assignee out of the property helped to pay the debts due by her to her creditors, and so relieved her from debts by her created.</p>

It can only claim the payment once to it, and having received that from Mrs. Clemens, cannot legally demand its payment from any other party. When the property was sold it gave a certificate that nothing was due for interest on it, and it did not do so accidentally. No fraud or mistake induced that action. It did so voluntarily, having been paid what was due to it for interest. It freely certified to that fact. The auditor, therefore, is unable to see from the evidence in this case that any interest is due by the assignee on the $7,600 mortgage. On the contrary, the evidence shows that the Fidelity Company, as trustee, has no claim whatever. The interest money was paid it voluntarily by Mrs. Clemens, who had good legal, moral and equitable reasons for so doing; its books show full payment of it to it. For these reasons the claim is disallowed.</p>
