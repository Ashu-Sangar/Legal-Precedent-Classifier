    <p class="summary" id="b263-8" data-blocks='[["BL_263.9",263,[187,1475,1178,956]]]'>This question has a very serious aspect., The proposition to procure a charter was not made until the meeting in October, 1890, when it was adopted. And the charter itself con•tains important innovations which were never proposed at any meeting. Was that an infringement of article XVIII? In •others words, does that charter amount to an alteration or amendment of the constitution ? If it does, then certainly it is not binding upon the defendants, and the plaintiff has no standing in this case. Now the answer to this question seems to me very plain. The transition from an unincorporated association without a fixed place for the transaction of business, and without a board of directors, to a corporation with a fixed place and a board of five directors, was unquestionably an alteration of the constitution. It is argued that the designation of place and •of hoard might be invalid without invalidating the entire charter or defeating the right of the plaintiff corporation to maintain this suit. But without such designation no charter would have been granted. The designation of some place for the transaction of business and of some board of directors was a</p>

And even if this were otherwise, there still remains the fact of incorporation, which of itself certainly is a material alteration. Before it can be binding, the-proposition to incorporate and the matters requisite to procure-a charter should be introduced at one meeting and put to vote at another meeting, as prescribed in the constitution. This plaintiff is a distinct entity in law from the unincorporated association to which defendants owed allegiance. Its corporate existence has never received their assent, nor was it brought about in a-manner to be binding without their assent. By necessary inference this plaintiff has no legal standing to maintain this bill. I am therefore of opinion, and so report, that the same be dismissed at the cost of the plaintiff. [1]</p>
