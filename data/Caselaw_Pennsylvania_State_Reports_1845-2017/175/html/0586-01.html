Its correctness-has not been shaken or questioned. I quote from the opinion t “ The distinction between a sale which transfers the ownership- and an agreement to sell and deliver at a day certain, which gives but an action for the breach of it, is a broad one distinctly understood and practically observed in the current transactions of business. . . . Every agreement for a subsequent delivery is essentially executory. . . . The parties dealt expressly with reference to the price which the leather would fetch when fit for the market; and having treated in reference to a future condition of the article, a future price and a future delivery, the contract was necessarily executory as every sale of an unfinished article must be when not sold and delivered as such. Unquestionably, the property is an article made to order, passes but by the delivery of it, because, at the time of the order, which is the date of the contract, there was no property in anything to pass ;■ and it will scarcely be pretended that the accidental existence of a part of the work at the time, would give the customer a specific right to the whole.”</p>

Then they were to be “ put afloat (by Kent) in the spring in time for the first spring drives,” and when all the logs were put afloat the plaintiffs were to give Kent their note at 4 months for $1.65 per M., making the sum of $4.65 per M. the whole contract price.</p>

If the plaintiffs could seize the logs when on the bank and oust the defendants of their possession, why could they not have seized them when on the skidds in the woods or at any time when it pleased them to do so? Such a construction would place the vendor entirely at the mercy of the vendee. The vendee might discover that the timber and the placing it upon the skidds were worth much more than the $1.50 per M., which he agreed to pay at the time, and the banking and putting afloat were worth much less than he had agreed to pay, and so end the contract on the skidds by taking pos<a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>session of the logs at that stage, and turn the vendor over to a possible remedy by an action for damages, which might be fruitless.</p>

We cannot concur with the counsel in this construction, The contract is silent as to where or when the logs are to be scaled.</p>

M. R.) and in conclusion of this contract it is agreed that the party of the second part are to furnish a competent scaler to scale the logs and to pay him for his services and the parly of the first part are to board him while scaling the same.” The custom of lumbermen is to scale the logs either upon the skiddways or on the bank and to place upon the logs a mark that is registered by the boom company at Williamsport. The measuring and marking must be done before the logs are placed in the stream as it cannot be done after-wards, and an unmarked log in a floating stream is a lost log. In view of these facts, why are we to conclude that the possession of logs becomes vested in the owner of the mark as soon as applied? The plaintiffs are lumbermen at Williamsport, where the logs were to be taken out of the stream for sawing. Their mark is their means of identifying their logs at that point. It was expected, of course, when the logs were stamped that they would subsequently be delivered to the plaintiffs in the stream as the contract required, but, if for any reason they were not, as between the vendor and vendee, the vendee acquires no new or additional interest in the property not given him by his contract. The evidence seems to show that the first scaling and marking commenced in December, 1892, and ended in March, 1893. It was undoubtedly done from time to time during the winter as the cutting and skidding and banking progressed.</p>
