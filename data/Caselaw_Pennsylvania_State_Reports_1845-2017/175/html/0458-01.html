To cap the series of misfortunes it now appears that there is no bill of exceptions. The stenographer’s notes are filed, but even these though they make mention of objections do not show any exceptions allowed by the <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>judge, and no bill of exceptions has been signed by Mm.
