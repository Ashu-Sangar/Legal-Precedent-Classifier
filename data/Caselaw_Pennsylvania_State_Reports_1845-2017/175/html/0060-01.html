Taylor, for and during the term of her natural life, or to allow her to occupy the same as a home, with power to your petitioners to sell the same, the proceeds of such sale, however, to be held upon the same trusts ; in addition to this devise, the decedent bequeathed to your petitioners the sum of #10,000 in trust, to invest the same for the benefit of his widow, and to pay the income of the same to her during her life. This gift of #10,000 and that of the house were expressed by the said testator to be in lieu of his widow’s dower in his estate.

Walker, and the other four fifths he directed to fall back into the residue of his estate, the residue of which estate he divided into four equal parts, one of which he gave to his nephew, John T.

What is to be gained by retaining them, when the creditors are entitled to whatever they may realize ? The act of assembly directs explicitly that the mansion house, or the most profitable part of the estate, shall be reserved to the last. The house occupied by the widow may be termed and considered the mansion house. Following the act of assembly, therefore, this cannot be sold until the other real estate be converted by the executors, and the consequence is <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>that the remaining real estate must be sold or mortgaged. And, as the premises first mentioned are now incumbered, no more can reasonably be expected to be attained by a further loan or mortgage. It still remains, however, that the mansion house cannot be disposed of until the last. The inevitable result, therefore, seems to be that the real estate No. 16 and No. 18 West Walnut Lane must be sold, and the remaining property No. 12 and No. 14 West Walnut Lane mortgaged, if this is possible, to an amount sufficient to pay the balance of decedent’s debts. But out of the mortgage money must first be paid the balance due upon the mortgage now upon the property executed by testator. This is |1,827, with interest, and the property is assessed at $6,700, but is supposed to be worth $8,000.</p>

Moreover that this is also the intention of testator is clear from his <em>will; </em>for he expressly directs an abatement of all his bequests in favor of his wife. We see no other course for the executors to adopt than that pointed out by the act of assembly, to sell the two properties mentioned at public sale for payment of testator’s debts, and, if they can obtain a loan sufficient to pay the unpaid balance thereof, to execute a mortgage therefor upon the premises No. 12 and No. 14 West Walnut Lane, the same to be in the usual form. But if such loan cannot be obtained, then the only resource will be to sell said premises at public sale. It need hardly be stated that the creditors are entitled to payment of their claims in preference to legatees, however unfortunate it may appear to be. And no sufficient reasons being shown for the further postponement of payment, we must overrule the demurrer and grant the prayer of the petition. The proper decree will hereafter be made when presented by counsel for the petition, the same to be made, however, without prejudice to the right of the adopted daughter, if any, should she hereafter claim reimbursement out of the real estate devised in trust for the widow.</p>
