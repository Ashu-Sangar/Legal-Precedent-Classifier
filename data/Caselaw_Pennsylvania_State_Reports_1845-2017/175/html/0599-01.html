The defendants, however, contend that the circumstances attending the transaction between James Logue and Ann Miller were such that a sole and separate use trust was not legally created, and the papers in the case on their face establishing such a trust, the burden is on them to avoid it, and we will now refer to the reasons assigned and authorities relied on by them.</p>

It was a sole and separate use trust, subject to her right to demand a deed to herself or any other person in fee simple, as we understand it, and until such deed had been obtained, she could not convey, and her rights to the money due from Logue, as administrator of Corbin Amos, remained unaffected in the meantime —in other words, she had no estate or interest in the land until the declaration of trust was executed and delivered, and then she only acquired an equitable interest, without power of alienation, except as provided therein, and so far as anything appears on the face of the papers, her rights in the money in the hands of the administrator remained intact. She could have elected to take this money, or take the land in fee simple, or for her sole and separate use as set forth in the declaration of trust, and as she did take it. She was not bound to accept the terms in the deed and it may be that equity would have reformed it for her, or that, had she elected to do so, she could have compelled Logue to convey to her a title in fee simple without terms.

Campbell, as the guardian of Mrs. McCormick, had in his hands money for her, and she and her husband executed a trust deed to him to secure the same “ to the sole and separate use and benefit of said Elizabeth and her legal representatives,” the deed providing that the principal or any portion thereof should be paid over to her or upon her order or that of her legal representatives for her sole and separate use, at any time, upon six months’ notice. One year afterwards, Campbell invested the money in real estate, the deed reciting that the purchase money was paid with money held by Campbell as trustee for the sole and separate use of Elizabeth McCormick, and that the land was to be held for her sole and separate use. Elizabeth McCormick authorized this investment by a paper signed by herself and not by her husband. Four years afterwards, Mrs. McCormick and her husband conveyed the land to Noble McCormick by deed reciting the former deeds and the terms of the trust, the title passed through several hands and after the death of Elizabeth McCormick and her husband, in an action of ejectment in which one of the parties • claimed under this deed, it was held that the deed was void and without effect. Justice Stbong, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court in this case, said: “ For all the purposes of this case it is useless to inquire whether Dr. Campbell had any right to apply the money which he held for the sole and separate use of Mrs. McCormick to the purchase of the land in controversy. He made the purchase, and on tbe 17th day of April, 1844, took a deed for it to himself in trust for her sole and separate use during her natural life, and then for her lawful heirs, their heirs and assigns. . . . What matters it in this controversy by whom the consideration for the deed to Dr. Campbell was paid ? Let it be that he had no power to apply in payment the money which he had under -another and prior trust. Let it be that he could not convert Mrs. McCormick’s interest under the first trust into land, and could not, even on her order, settle any part of it to different uses from those which were at first declared. <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>What then ? Nothing more than that the purchase which he made of the land was made with his own money.

In support of the first part of this proposition, defendants’ counsel rely mainly on the case of Johnson v. Fritz, <a href="/pa/44/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="44 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="484257" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0449-01">44 Pa. 449</a>. In that case, Maria Fritz was entitled to certain moneys under her mother’s will which contained the following: “ It is my will that all I have bequeathed to my daughters shall he for the whole sole exclusive use and benefit of my aforesaid daughters, and not for the use of their husbands, and each of their receipts shall be a sufficient discharge to my executor.” The executor invested the money of Mrs. Fritz in land, and it was stipulated in the deed “ that this land should be held by her for her sole and separate use and benefit, free and discharged from any tenancy by the curtesy,” etc. Mrs. Fritz conveyed the land to her son in the lifetime of her husband who did not join in the deed; after her death he brought ejectment to enforce his rights as tenant by the curtesy, and it was held that her conveyance, without his joining in the deed, was void at law as against him as he was entitled to his curtes3r on her death, notwithstanding it was her sole and separate estate. Justice Lowrie, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court says : “ It was originally money that was bequeathed to her, and when she converted it into land she <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>could impose no terms upon her title to the land different from those attached to the money. That was merely for her separate use, and all other limitations of her title contained in the deed are without authority.” Doubtless referring to the “limitation ” depriving him of his rights as tenant by the curtesy, a right created by law and of which she could not deprive him. The fact that the money bequeathed by her mother was for her sole and separate use did not deprive him of this right as tenant by the curtesy in land purchased with it, and when it was invested in land, not only to be held “ for her sole and separate use and benefit ” but also “ free and discharged from any tenancy by the curtesy,” clearly terms were imposed not only different from those attached to the money but which attempted to exclude the husband from rights guaranteed him by the law, and provided for no order of succession in lieu of that fixed by law. The conveyance was declared void in the court below, because no order of succession in lieu of that fixed by law was established, and doubtless Justice Lowbie had this fact in mind when he said in the opinion “ when she converted it into land she could impose no terms upon her title to the land different from those attached to the money.”</p>

In the original declaration of trust there was a power reserved by which Mrs. Miller could demand a conveyance to any person she might designate. She was therefore subject to the importunities of her husband, as fully as if the legal title <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>had been in her. If she had intended to take the property into her own control free from an}*- trust, the simple way to have done so would have been to demand a deed in the ordinary form. She did not do so but required it to be made to her to hold for her sole and separate use. She must be presumed to know the effect of such conveyance, and so far from there being anything to show that she did not know and did not intend the legal effects of the words used, it is reasonable to presume that she required the conveyance to be made as it was, in order to take away the power to dispose of the property and thus make it a separate use trust pure and simple, and thus avoid all temptation to dispose of it on her own motion or by reason of importunities of her husband or others.</p>
