The will is thus undisturbed by the codicil except as it affects the grandchild, whose action reduced <em>it; </em>the legatee will be paid at the time that the superseded beneficiary would have received her share (which is ample for the purpose) had she not incurred the displeasure of the testator, and effect is given to the assertion in the codicil that the legacy is “ in place and stead of ” the original gift.
