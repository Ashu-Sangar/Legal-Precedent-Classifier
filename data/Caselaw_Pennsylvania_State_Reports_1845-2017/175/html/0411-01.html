The first item amounting to $147.09 was received by him as shown by the final account of John G. Uzzle, guardian of Mary M. Mulholland, confirmed April 24, 1889, on May 1, 1885, and he is therefore charged with interest from that date until the filing of his account. The other item of $780.54 is made up of three items as shown by Mr. Uzzle’s account as follows: One item of $374.94 which the account shows was paid Mr. Fisher March 25,1886, one item of $116.77 which shows payment to Mr. Fisher April 24, 1886, one item of $117.10 which shows payment to Mr. Fisher April 24,1886, and another item of $173.29 which shows payment to Mr. Fisher some time in 1887. On these various items the ward is entitled to credit for interest from the dates of the payment to Mr. Fisher to the filing of his account. As to the last item of $173.29, your auditor has charged Mr. Fisher with interest from the 1st of July, 1887 — there being no month given he has calculated from the middle of the year, as the amount was received on account of the sale of timber rafts, and it is presumed to have been paid by that time, as the other items in previous years derived from the same source were paid not later than April.</p>

There might be a question as to the allowance of any commission, but considering the fact that the auditor has charged him with interest on moneys, from date of receiving them, it would be rather hard not to allow him a reasonable compensation, which we think is fully covered by a fee of five per cent on the amount collected in addition to the amounts claimed credit for in the account for expenses, although in a great many instances these are vague, no vouchers having been filed.</p>

They plainly show that he failed to exercise the care demanded in the- management of a trust estate. He not only did not invest the moneys he received in approved real estate mortgages, or other securities which the law recognizes; but he did not even seek an investment of any such kind. The only loans made were a small one to a man named Brown, and another to this the account<a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>ant’s son to put into western land, both of which ended disastrously. He also used over $2,000 to buy land for himself, and deposited the rest in the bank in his own name, a small portion in the First National Bank at Clearfield which failed, and the remainder with the private banking firm of Cochran, Payne &amp; McCormick of Williamsport. While these deposits strictly speaking were not mingled with his own money, yet they were made in Ms individual name, and stood in consequence at the risk of Ms personal credit. It cannot bé considered, therefore, that they were really kept distinct and separate from his own private funds as the law requires. The truth is that while the accountant, in his own mind, may have individuated the estate of Ms own ward, according to all outward observance he used and disposed of it pretty much as Ms own. Under the circumstances he is properly held not only for the bad investment, if investment it can be called — of that part of it which has been lost, but also for interest upon the whole of it, the same as though he had derived a direct benefit from its use. •He practically has had the use of it, and must account accordingly.] [4] The case is substantially within the ruling in Copenheffer’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Pennyp.%20243" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Pennyp. 243">8 Penny. 243</a>, and other kindred cases.

The accountant on June 21, 1894, made payment to his ward of $7,000, and was entitled to have the running of interest stopped on that amount from that date. TMs has only been partially done. On items aggregating about $3,600 the interest has been calculated only to that date, but upon about $5,000 of items it has been carried forward to July 27, the date of filing the account. Without going through the process, I may state that this involves an excess of interest of $21.46, which should come out of that charged.</p>
