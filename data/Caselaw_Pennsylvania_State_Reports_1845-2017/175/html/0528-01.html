But it is contended that tbe liability to pay being, by tbe admission and declaration of Witmer, limited to tbe “current annual revenues ” of tbe city, no indebtedness witbin tbe meaning of tbe constitution is incurred.</p>

If tbe answer is yes, it is witbin tbe power of the council to enter into if it-is, “together with other like expenses witbin the limits of its (tbe city’s) current revenues,” although tbe appropriation and provision for the payment of tbe aggregate payments and ■deposits are not made in advance, a liberal and strict constructipn of tbe language of tbe constitution would class the liability as a debt. There is, unquestionably, an-obligation under the contract for a term of years to supply any articles necessary for tbe government of tbe city, tbe cost of which is an ordinary expense, to pay tbe aggregate amount contracted for during tbe entire term, which under any definition I have seen must be termed a debt; and if tbe aggregate amount increases tbe indebtedness of tbe city beyond tbe constitutional limit, under a strict construction of tbe constitution, such a contract cannot be sustained.</p>

The ordinary expenses, at least many of the ordinary expenses, must be incurred and paid, or the city cannot exist. It cannot be supposed that the framers of the constitution intended to prevent municipalities from deriving the benefit that may accrue from favorable contracts for a term of years for supplying what must certainly be had, and must be otherwise provided for annually, at perhaps additional expense and inconvenience. And any expense that recurs with regularity and certainty, and is necessary for the existence of the municipaliiy or for the health, comfort and perhaps convenience of the inhabitants, may well be called an ordinary expense.</p>

Is the consideration for the city’s engagement “ received at once instead of being yielded in the future or at intervals ? ” If it is, unless the agreement that the installment shall be paid only from the current revenues modifies the liability, it creates a debt within the constitutional prohibition.</p>

The carefully worded specifications as to the material to be used, and the work to be done, the character and capacity of the machinery, and building to be supplied and erected, the provision for the operating the works by the city and at its expense, the delivery of possession to the city, are all inconsistent with any other purpose than that of purchase and ownership of the water works by the city, even if the engagement to pay could be only a liability to pay for tbe supply of water. That engagement is, however, plainly an agreement to pay the several installments, as purchase money for the plant, and not for the annual supply of water. The cost of erecting such a plant is a most extraordinary, and not in any sense an ordinary expense.</p>
