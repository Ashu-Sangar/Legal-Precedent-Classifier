    <p class="summary" id="b61-5" data-blocks='[["BL_61.6",61,[180,1266,1171,341]]]'>In Long’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/23/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="23 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="973975" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0297-01">23 Pa. 297</a>, it was held that, as between several writs of foreign attachment served upon the same day, there was no priority of payment, and the decision is based upon the principle that in judicial and other public proceedings there are no fractions of a day, and that all transactions of the same day are in general regarded as occurring at the same instant of time.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b61-6" data-blocks='[["BL_61.7",61,[180,1626,1173,807]]]'>In Baldwin’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/86/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="86 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1056649" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0483-01">86 Pa. 483</a>, it was held that the same rule applies to writs of attachment execution. In that case it was considered that the process of attachment execution had an approximate relationship to that under a writ of foreign attachment, and was to be distinguished from a writ of fieri facias, which the act of June 16,1836, provides shall be a lien from the time of its receipt by the officer executing it. We are urged to apply the rule of Long’s Appeal and Baldwin’s Appeal to the facts of the present case. The process under the act of 1869 differs materially, however, from foreign attachment and attachment execution in one important respect, and in this respect is much more like the writ of fieri facias. The writ of foreign attachment under the act of June 13, 1836, section 50, and attachment execution under the act of June 16, 1837, section 37, are only liens from the time of service, while the attachment under the act of 1869, at least as between sue-</p>

Section 5 of the act of 1869, P. L. 8, provides: “In case two or more attachments are issued against the same party defendant, the one first in the hands of the proper officer for service shall have the prior lien, and so on as to other writs issued in pursuance of this act, in the order of time in which they are issued to said officer.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b62-4" data-blocks='[["BL_62.4",62,[252,808,1168,595]]]'>While the language of this section, if looked at narrowly, is limited to “ writs issued in pursuance of this act,” nevertheless its purpose appears to be to fix the time at which the lien of a writ issued under the act shall commence. The first writ is to have a “ prior lien.” How can it have a prior lien unless its lien becomes fixed at the time the writ comes into the hands of the proper officer? The words imply that there is one lien which is earlier in time and another lien which is later. In case there are several writs under the act, they have priority “ in the order of time in which they are issued to the said officer.” That can only be the case upon the theory that each writ becomes a lien at the time the officer receives it.</p>
