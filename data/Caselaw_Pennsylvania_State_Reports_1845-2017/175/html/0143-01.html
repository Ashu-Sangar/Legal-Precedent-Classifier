An increase of capital by the issue of new stock to persons paying for it its par value, implies the very reverse of profits earned. The fact that the privilege of, subscribing for it is given to <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>existing stockholders, and that it may be sold by them at a premium is far from proving that the premium is to be regarded as income, the payment or withdrawal of which leaves the original capital unimpaired. The property of a corporation, after payment of liabilities, belongs to the existing stockholders, who therefore are entitled to any and all enhancements of its original value ; and such enhancement belongs not to a tenant for life, but to the remainder man: Schofield v. Redfern, 32 L. J. Ch. 627; Hubley’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Phila.%20327" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="16 Phila. 327">16 Phila. 327</a>; Middleton’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/103/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="103 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="449128" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0092-01">103 Pa. 92</a>. When new stock is issued at par the actual increase of capital is precisely the amount thus received by the company, and if the new stock has, at the time, an intrinsic value beyond what was paid for it, tins presumptively can only be because the holders of the new stock have been put on a footing of equality with holders of old stock, and thus become entitled to share with them in a distribution of assets, should the company be dissolved. The gain of the new stockholders is the precise measure of loss of intrinsic value of the capital of the old stockholders. Tins is very clear. The capital of the Frankford and Southwark Company was originally$750,000, divided into 15,000 shares. In 1884 the value of this capital, as indicated by the price at which the stock was selling, was $3,300,000, or $200 per share. The issue of 5,000 shares of new stock in 1889, at $50.00 per share, added $250,000 to the capital, which thus became $3,550,000, divisible among 20,000 shares, being $177.50 per share instead of $200 — a direct loss to the original stockholders of $42.50 per share. Market values are no criterion. It is for tills reason, no doubt, that the opportunity to subscribe is first offered to existing stockholders.</p>

In Cook on the Law of Stock and Stockholders, section 559, it is stated, as the result of the numerous authorities there referred to, “The right to subscribe for new shares at par upon an increase of the capital stock, which is an incident of the ownership of the stock, does <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>not belong, as a privilege, to the life tenant, but such an increment must be treated as capital, and be added to the trust fund for the benefit of the remainder man. This is equally the rule whether the trustee subscribes for the new stock for the benefit of the trust or sells the right to subscribe for a valuable consideration ; in either event the increase goes to the corpus. The subsequent income, however, of such interest belongs, as of course, during the continuance of the life tenancy to the life tenant as income proper, the new shares are part of the corpus, and the life tenant being entitled to the income from the corpus, takes the income from the accretions thereto.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[268,960,1172,1323]]]'>The distribution of shares of the Electric Traction Company among the stockholders of the Frankford and Southwark Company falls within the principle of Vinton’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/99/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="99 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="446063" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0434-01">99 Pa. 434</a>. The shares distributed were received in payment for shares of the Lehigh Avenue Railway Company and of the Omnibus Generale Company, forming part of the assets of the Frankford and Southwark Company. These assets, upon dissolution of the latter company, would have been distributable among the stockholders as part of their capital. Whether they were purchased by it with moneys derived from increase of capital by issue of new stock, or with profits previously earned, is not very material; it was not shown that any of the profits used for the purpose, if any were so used, were earned during the life tenancy. If the stock originally held were capital, as between tenant for life and remainder man, the rights of the parties were not affected by a change of securities. In point of fact, and as appears by the statement of facts agreed upon by counsel, the shares of stock of the Omnibus Generale Company were part of the assets of the Lombard and South Streets Company, purchased as above by the Frankford and Southwark Company, and thus added to its capital. The Lehigh Avenue Passenger Railway stock was purchased by the Frankford and Southwark Company in 1892, when $252,500 were paid, presumably with moneys received from the increase of capital in 1891. A farther payment of $50,500 in 1893 brought the total investment up to $303,000.</p>
