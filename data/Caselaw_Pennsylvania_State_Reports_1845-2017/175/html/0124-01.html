A grantee of land acquires no title in a plotted street until it is opened. The mere plotting of a street does not divest any man of his title, or add anything to any man’s title. It operates, to be sure, as a notice to all owners upon the line of the contemplated street, not to place any buildings or erections in its path, and that if they do they will be allowed no damages for -them when the street is opened. But until the street is opened, the title to the soil over which it is laid out remains precisely as it was before, and no new rights are acquired in consequence of it, except, indeed, as to a grantor who will be estopped by a grant of land, bounded by a plotted street, from depriving the grantee of the use of the street. <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>When the street is actually opened, then by the well settled law the title of an owner fronting upon it goes to the middle of it — to the filum vise, but the ownership thus acquired is subject to the general right of passage over it, which is vested in the public at large at the very instant of the opening. So that the moment the bordering owner acquires his title to the soil, the public acquire their title to the user. As no part of the plaintiffs’ ground was taken for the street when it was opened, but another person’s ground, it is not a little difficult to see how they were injured by the opening, for it was only by the opening that they acquired their title to the soil to the middle of the street. Had it not been opened, they would have acquired nothing in the soil, which would in that event have continued in the grantor. Nevertheless, as it seems to have been held in Lehigh Street, <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%2085" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="81* Pa. 85">81* Pa. 85</a> — a somewhat apocryphal volume— that a party may technically claim damages for such an opening, the jury being left to be the judges of the extent of his damages, that case was accordingly strictly followed in the trial of this case, it being left to the jury to say what damages the plaintiffs had sustained. They naturally found that they had sustained no damages whatever, their land being worth as much after the opening as before, and we see no reason to disturb such a sensible verdict. Rule refused.</p>
