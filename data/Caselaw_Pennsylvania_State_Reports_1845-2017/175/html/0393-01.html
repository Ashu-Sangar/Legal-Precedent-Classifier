After Miss Engard and Mr. Fitzpatrick had agreed on the terms, Mr. Fitzpatrick comated out $100, which was paid to Miss Engard, and a receipt therefor was written by Parker at the direction of Miss Engard.

Parker, as agent for the purpose of obtaining a buyer, is answered not only by the evidence, but by the admission in the printed argument of the defendants, that Parker had a sign on the house and was offering it for sale in common with other agents. It was not found that he had the property exclusively of all other agents. This, however, is an unimportant matter.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b421-4" data-blocks='[["BL_421.5",421,[165,819,1165,301]]]'>That Parker signed the receipt by Miss Engard’s direction and in her presence is proved by his testimony. Parker, who had no interest in the transaction, testified that he wrote the receipt at Miss Engard’s direction and read it to her at the time the contract was made with Fitzpatrick and the money paid by him to Miss Engard.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b421-5" data-blocks='[["BL_421.6",421,[166,1126,1166,556]]]'>The evidence clearly shows that two days after the sale to Fitzpatrick, Miss Engard sold the property to Washington and directed her agent, Parker, to execute an agreement of sale to him. Washington was allowed thirty days to settle, and, not complying within that time another week was given him, when still defaulting with his contract, the bargain with him was declared off. Parker, the agent, testified, “We declared the bargain off,” and then he gave the deeds to Fitzpatrick to carry out the sale to him. Miss Engard did not object then, although she may have done so afterwards, but this is only another proof of her vacillating mind.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b421-6" data-blocks='[["BL_421.7",421,[165,1689,1167,557]]]'>[Miss Engard went to Fitzpatrick after the sale to Washington to get a release from the contract with him. He agreed to release her on the return of the $100 he had paid to her and $200 for the loss of his bargain, which Miss Engard agreed to pay, but never did pay. Had she paid it this suit would not have been commenced. After Washington had failed to comply with his contract, Miss Engard made a third agreement of sale, this time to Woodward, and she again went to Fitzpatrick to get a release, which he agreed to give for $800 if paid at once. As she did not pay at once or at any time, she never was released.] [8]</p>

He was one of the original parties to the bill. He dealt with the sellers as a party when 'they broke their contract with Fitzpatrick. The deed was made to Gordon as his secret trustee. Woodward used his position as an attorney to compel Parker to pay Fitzpatrick’s money, $100, to him under threat of an arrest. Woodward kept the money and has it yet. He first claimed it as a set-off to the damages which he asserts were caused by making him a party to the bill, and afterwards he shifted Ms position by claiming it in payment for fees due to Mm by Miss Engard and Mrs. Hetzel; that is, he keeps one person’s money to pay another’s debt. The statement of this fact shows his liability as a party.] [10]</p>
