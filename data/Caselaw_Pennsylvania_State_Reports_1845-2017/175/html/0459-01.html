The results of such an arrangement show now, ■gentlemen, that it was a very bad policy. There is no more wise provision in the act of congress providing for the organization and regulation of national banks than that which prohibits a national bank from lending to any one of its customers more than a small percentage of its capital stock. In this case, Mr. White, as I have told you, under an arrangement between him and the bank, was permitted to overdraw his account to an unlimited amount; and you have the legitimate results in the trials here to-day of such an arrangement. There is some testimony, I believe, to the effect that Mr. White had the same sort of an arrangement with another bank in Irwin; I don’t know whether it is in evidence that that bank also failed.

Some of them had other names upon the notes as security; and this, it is claimed by the Pools, tends to show, and it does tend to show, that the notes were not given to cover notes already in existence; because they had not only notes for this amount of $46,000, but some of them with other names upon them than Mr. White’s, and the Pools would not do such a foolish thing as to surrender notes with security upon them for the individual notes of Mr. White.] [2] It is claimed too, and the testimony shows, that some of the notes in existence, part of these $46,000 notes, were not yet due, and that it would be a strange proceeding for Mr. White to give other notes in addition to these that the Pools already held, which were not yet due. These circumstances have been brought out in the testimony as tending to show that the theory of Mr. White, that he gave these notes in payment of all of his indebtedness, is not the correct theory. The Pools claim, and Mr. White says in so many words, that Mr. Pool showed him at the time of this settlement that his overdraft was $50,000, or upwards, and the Pools claim that it was for this amount the notes were given.</p>

The Pools say that Mr. White was to pay interest compounded every sixty days, and at the rate of eight per cent. I have to say to you, gentlemen of the jury, that the bank would not be allowed to charge a greater rate of interest than six per cent; and the expert, in computing the amount of overcharge of interest claimed to have been made by the Pools against Mr. White, calculated the interest, as he says, at six per cent, and he finds the amount of overcharge of interest on the overdrafts and overdue notes to be upwards of $4,000 or $5,000. That was covered in two periods. The amount which he gave you as overcharge during the period between November 18,1879, about the time of the commencement, and June 1, 1883, was $953.22, and compounding the interest on that every sixty days, which Mr. White will be allowed to do, if there has been an excessive charge of interest against him, in order to make him even, he should be allowed a credit of interest also compounded every sixty days on the overcharge. As I was going on to say, the first period covered by the expert was from November 18, 1879, to June 1, 1883; the amount of the overdraft was $953.22; the interest compounded, $545.32; the account of both, $1,498.54. And between June 1, 1883, and November 21, 1891, to which period these calculations are all made, the amount of excessive charges of interest on the overdraft and overdue notes was $4,552.60 ; and compounding the interest on that every sixty days makes $1,302.95, which, added to the other, would be $5,855.55. And the expert also figures an overcharge of interest or discount in the discounting of the notes — which overcharge I presume he means anything over six per cent — of $623.63. Compounding the interest on that every sixty days makes $405.34, and the aggregate of this overcharge, according to the statement of the expert, is $1,037.77(?). Those are items which added together make an overcharge, resulting from this excessive charge of interest by the bank against White, of upwards of $8,000, according to the statement and calculation of this expert.</p>

Those items, as calculated by the expert, reach the surprising sum, as I have said, of upwards of $30,000, and calculating the interest on this upon the same basis, and compounding it every sixty days, there would be added to that upwards of $19,000. The amount of the principal of these items and interest thereon would reach the sum of upwards of $50,000; which added to the item of overcharge of interest to which I have referred, makes the total claim of set-off by the defendant rrpwards of $60,000.</p>

They must necessarily rely upon their books and papers in making their statements upon the witness stand; In this' trial we have had striking illustrations of the unreliability of human recollection, and the mere fact that items have been found by the defendant, White, which seem to be unexplained, does not entitle him to their credit merely because the Pools cannot explain them from their recollection'. Let me say, however, the plaintiffs do claim that they have explained all, or nearly all these items; but, as I say, the mere fact of the defendant, White, finding items which the Pools could not explain from recollection would not entitle him to the credit of those items.

It is true, if they were not used they should have been destroyed; especially if they were made out by members of the bank it would be expected that they would be destroyed. But if, on the other hand, the parties in the bank making out the slips pocketed the cash or securities represented on them, it is natural to assume that the first thing they would do would be to destroy the de<a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>posit slips; otherwise they would turn up hereafter to detect them.

Mr. White claims that he only got $62.00 upon that check and that he should not be charged with $82.00; in other words, that he is now entitled to a credit of $20.00, with interest on that item compounded every sixty days down to 1891.

    <p class="summary" id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[277,1096,1164,908]]]'>The next is the Ullman draft for $1,768.28. That has been so thoroughly discussed and during the course of the trial you have heard my views upon it, that I only refer to it now briefly. There w.as originally a check left by Mr. White at the bank for $8,766.21, for which he received credit in the bank, and that check was subsequently protested. There is, as I recollect from the testimony, no evidence that it was ever paid, except the sum $2,000, which was some time afterwards paid on account. Mr. White subsequently taking the balance $1,766.22, and the cost of the protest, $2.06, making $1,768.28, drew a draft on Ullman for the purpose of paying the balance of this check; and that draft came back unpaid, according to the testimony. Now, of course, gentlemen of the jury, if that is correct, it would be improper to charge the bank with the draft. Mr. White had already got credit for the amount of the draft in getting credit for the original check of $8,766.22, and it would be wrong to give him credit for the amount of the draft. I needn’t refer to that further; I think you understand it.</p>

Mr. White claims he only got $255.07. They produce the original deposit slip, showing that he only got credit for a part of the Schamberg check, $255.07. Mr. White claims he should- have credit for the whole, the difference being $45.50. The Pools say that he got that in cash, and that the deposit slip itself shows that. He is only credited on the books with a part of that Schamberg check. And so they explain a great many of these similar items <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>which are now claimed by the defendant as credits on this account. They say that Mr. White got those items in cash; that at the times he would bring in checks he would get portions of those checks in cash, and sometimes he would get the whole of little checks in cash. Mr. White denies that, and says he never got cash from the bank except upon his own check. The Pools say that he not only got cash on his own checks, a large number of which have been offered in evidence; but that he got cash on other checks, foreign checks, as they are called, which were brought by him to the bank. If you are not satisfied that he did not get the cash in the way claimed by the Pools, it will be your duty to disallow those items in making up your verdicts in these cases. Or otherwise to follow the rule that I have already laid down to you, that it would be Mr. White’s duly to satisfy you from the weight of the testimony that he is entitled to those items of credit.</p>

There is an item of credit claimed for a draft which was drawn for $1,840.16. Mr. White claims credit because they found a stub on a draft book which was marked “no good,” “ not sent,” “ canceled,” or words to that effect. The Pools explain that by saying that that draft, the stub of which appears on the book, was drawn originally upon the Farmers’ Deposit Bank of Pittsburg, and that upon referring to their account with that bank they didn’t have sufficient funds there to meet it, and they canceled that draft and drew another one on the Penn Bank. The evidence of the drawing of that you have had before you. The person who has charge of the Penn Bank books was here and testified, and you have the Penn Bank book itself, showing there was a draft drawn by the Pools for this amount upon that day. If that is the case, then Mr. White is not now entitled to another credit for this draft; he having already received one in his account.</p>

They were drawn on the evening of the 14th, and, he says, subsequently on taking them home he discovered they were for <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>incorrect amounts, and he took them back the next morning, the 15th, and obtained other drafts for different amounts, and amounts larger than the amount of those two, and that he gave another check for the aggregate amount of the two new drafts, and that the check given on the 14th should have been canceled and he not charged with it at all. The plaintiffs answer that by saying and claiming to you that the books show, or tend to show, that he got those first two drafts not on the evening of the 14th, but on the morning of the 14th; and that after obtaining them did not take them from the bank; that they were canceled, or the names torn off subsequently, and that instead of the drafts they gave Mr. White at the time the amount in currency, or cash, $5,430.89. [Of course, if he got the cash, he is not entitled to a credit for that amount now. The defendant claims that Mr. White never carried any considerable amount of cash; he didn’t pay his bills in cash, and that he never received such an amount as that in currency, or cash. The Pools answer that by stating — all of them, I believe — that he frequently got currency from the bank to pay his bills; that he not only got it himself and carried it away, but that he sent it by messenger to the stock yards to pay his bills. In support of that they produce the messenger, who says the same thing; he says he did carry cash for Mr. White, and the Pools too, and delivered it to the agent at the stock yards for payment of bills to the dealers there; and he says that not only the Pools gave him packages for that purpose, stating they were cash, and to be used for that purpose, but that Mr. White himself gave him packages, which he said contained money to be used in the same way.] [5]</p>

The cases which you are sworn to try, with one exception, are upon judgments which were entered against the defendant, and afterwards opened by the court. As the execution of these judgment notes has not been disputed the burden is upon the defendant to prove that in equity he is not liable to pay them, or some of them, and as the testimony of plaintiffs and defendant is contradictory, the defendant must furnish other evidence in his favor, which, together with his own, shall be of a clear, satisfactory and convincing character in order to be relieved from liability. In other words, the notes upon which 'suit has <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>been brought must stand, unless the defendant has shown by evidence that in equity and good conscience he ought not to pay the indebtedness which they appear to represent. <em>Answer: </em>This point is refused, with the explanation which I will make after reading the third and fourth points, and which explanation will apply to all three of these points.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b491-3" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[146,652,1164,555]]]'>3. As the equitable principle just adverted to runs throughout this entire case, we instruct you wherever you find an undisputed signature of James White to a note, check or draft, and the attempt is made by him to escape the liability it imposes, if that attempt is unsupported by any other testimony, and his version of the transaction is contradicted by the plaintiffs, you will entirely disregard his testimony and disallow his claim. Under such circumstances the version of the plaintiffs, corroborated, as it is, by the written instrument, must prevail. <em>Answer : </em>This point is refused, with the explanation, as I told you, I will presently make.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b491-4" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[144,1216,1167,1166]],["BL_492.1",492,[280,339,1165,704]]]'>4. The same principle applies to any other item of credit claimed by the defendant White which rests on his unsupported testimony, which is denied by the plaintiffs. Having given these notes he cannot be permitted to escape from the payment of any portion of them on his own oath, except it might be by showing direct payment and satisfaction afterwards, which is not pretended in this case. <em>Ansioer: </em>This point is refused. I am constrained, gentlemen, to refuse those three points. They seem to eliminate from your consideration both the corroborating circumstances and the matter of the credibility of the witnesses, but in refusing them I desire to make this explanation, as I have already said to you, that the burden of proof is on the defendant. He must satisfy you by the preponderance of evidence, by the weight of the testimony, that he is entitled to the items of credit claimed by him. If the evidence for and against an item is evenly balanced — no preponderance upon the part of the defendant — his evidence as to that fails, and the item must be disallowed. So if an item of the defendant depends solely upon the testimony of defendant, uncorroborated and unsupported, and is denied or contradicted by the plaintiffs, all other things being equal, there being no difference in the credibility of the witnesses, that item of defense must fall. You are, however, the judges of the credibility of witnesses. You will, in de<a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>termining this, take into consideration all of the testimony, and if the defendant has satisfied you by the weight of the testimony that, he is entitled to credit for any items, you will allow them in your reduction of the plaintiffs’ claim ; but if not so satisfied you will not allow the items of defense. The claims of the plaintiffs in these cases are evidenced by notes of the defendant in writing, and the burden of proof is upon the defendant to show by clear and positive testimony that the collection of these notes is not to be enforced. When parties give obligations in writing the burden of proof is upon them to satisfy you that those written obligations are not to be enforced. You must satisfy yourselves according to these principles, and if the defendant has failed to produce such evidence, the plaintiffs’ claim must stand. [6]</p>

    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.11",493,[197,1057,1165,493]]]'>When this case was first here the appeal was quashed because it nowhere appeared that any exception had been taken in the court below, or that the charge had been approved by the judge or filed by his order: <a href="/pa/171/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="171 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="985608" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0500-01">171 Pa. 500</a>. Subsequently the learned judge who tried the case, with the consent of counsel of both parties, approved the charge and directed it to be filed of record. This though not so expressed in terms, must be considered as a filing nunc pro tunc, and the case is therefore regularly before us, as if the exceptions and the charge had been taken and filed at the trial.</p>
    <p id="b493-6" data-blocks='[["BL_493.12",493,[199,1568,1166,544]]]'>Notwithstanding the bulk of the record there is very little in the case but a question of fact. The issue was upon a judgment opened to determine whether the previous notes in the hands of the plaintiffs in October, 1891, at the time the defendant gave the ten judgment notes in snit, were included in that settlement. These prior notes being admitted to be due, the court required them to be paid, and then permitted such payment to be set off in the actions on the later judgment notes. These notes were entered up separately, birt the opened judgments were tried together and we shall treat them as a single case.</p>

This <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>consideration does away with the force of the principal assignments of error. The fourth which is the most important in the amount involved by it, relates to the deposit slips. These under the circumstances of the case were evidence of deposits which should be credited to the defendant in making up the account, but they were not conclusive, and had to go to the jury with the explanation of the plaintiff that they were accidentally misdated, and were duly credited in the account at their proper dates. The court submitted them in this way, and there was no error in so doing.</p>
    <p id="b494-4" data-blocks='[["BL_494.4",494,[236,856,1164,350]]]'>The sixth assignment relates to the refusal of the plaintiff’s points followed by a substantial affirmance. They were refused because of the form of expression, which as the learned judge said seemed <em>“ </em>to eliminate from consideration both the corroborating circumstances, and the matter of the credibility of the witnesses,” but in substance they were correct statements of the burden of proof, and there was no'error in so affirming them.</p>
    <p id="b494-5" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[233,1213,1165,592]]]'>The remaining specifications of error are to the expressions of opinion by the judge on parts of the evidence. The case was one which justified the judge in commenting on the evidence with more than usual- particularity. It was out of the ordinary juror’s experience, involving very loose and irregular banking transactions extending over a number of years and running into large figures in which a jury might easily get bewildered. The judge assisted them by pointing out clearly the bearing of the various items of evidence, and if he sometimes allowed his own opinion to be seen, we do not find that he trespassed at any point on the jury’s province to decide the facts for themselves.</p>

But it is the custom in banks and some other kinds of business where calculations of interest are required frequently, to compute it for the sake of convenience at thirty days to the month and twelve months to the year. The result when calculated for a year is of course the same, the exact six per cent on the sum involved, and the difference in amount for fractions of a year is usually so small as to be unimportant.
