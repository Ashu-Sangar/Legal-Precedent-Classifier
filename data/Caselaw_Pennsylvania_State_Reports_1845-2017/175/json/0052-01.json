    "head_matter": "Horatio P. Connell, late High Sheriff of the County of Philadelphia, Appellant, v. Charles J. Webb, Harry E. Lincoln and William B. Toland, trading as Charles J. Webb & Company.\nSheriff's sales \u2014 Failure to comply with purchase \u2014 Affidavit of- defense.\nIn an action by a sheriff against a purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale to recover the difference in price between a first and second sale, an affidavit of defense is sufficient which avers that the defendants were the purchasers at the first sale; that without any notice or demand upon them to eomply with the terms of the first sale, the sheriff returned the writ of the firs'\nsale and issued an alias writ; that at the second sale the property was bid in for two mechanics\u2019 lien claimants who failed to comply with the terms of sale; that the sheriff accepted the defendants\u2019 second bid at said second sale, and finally settled with the defendants; that the suit is brought at the request and for the sole use of said two claimants whose liens would not have been reached by the original sale; that defendants themselves would have been entitled to all the money of the first sale in excess of the amount of the second sale.\nArgued March 27, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 42, Jan. T., 1896, by-plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 4, Phila. Co., Sept. T., 1894, No. 800, discharging rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum:, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit to recover the difference between defendants\u2019 bids at a first and second sheriff\u2019s sale. Before Arnold, J.\nDefendants filed the following affidavit of defense.\nIt is true, as set forth in the statement of plaintiff\u2019s demand filed in this cause, that upon April 3,1893, my firm did bid the sum of $110,000 for the premises mentioned in the said statement through our attorney, and did pay down the sum of $107) deposit on same; and it is true that subsequently the said sheriff did make return to the court having jurisdiction of the writ under which the sale had taken place, that the sale had not been complied with; and it is true that subsequently under another writ in the same cause the property was again exposed for sale by said sheriff on December 4, 1893; but it is not true that said property was then and there sold to John F. Smiley for $91,000; nor is it true that the defendants refused to comply with the first purchase as aforesaid by them, or in any way agreed to be, or did render themselves, liable to the plaintiff as such sheriff for the sums as set forth in said statement, or for any other sums in this or in any other connection.\nThe true facts of this transaction are as follows:\nThe property described in the statement was exposed for sale by the plaintiff as sheriff as aforesaid, upon April 3, 1893, having been taken in execution as the property of Hubert S. Spencer under a judgment for $88,383.48 obtained upon a first mortgage upon said property held by The Fidelity Insurance Trust & Safe Deposit Company, trustee, etc., and which mortgage and the said judgment thereon were the first liens upon this property. The next lien of record against the property was a judgment held by your affiant\u2019s firm to No. 1122 of December term, 1892, for $60,273.82; the next a judgment in favor of Joseph M. Adams for $14,812.41 to No. 1123 of December term, 1892, C. P. No. 1, which was and is owned by affiant\u2019s firm, both of which judgments were obtained on February 7, 1893.\nThere next appeared of record against said property four mechanics\u2019 liens, all alleged to have been filed for work and labor done about the erection and construction of certain new buildings upon the lot of ground before mentioned within six months, etc.\nThese hens were as follows, and filed on the following dates:\n1. March 16, 1898, by Glassey & Fowler for $316 to No. 58, March T., 1893, O. P. No. 4, M. L. D.\n2. March IT, 1893, by Thomas D. Trott for $4,234.20 to No. 62, March T., 1893, C. P. No. 4, M. L. D.\n3. March 17,1893, by Thomas W. Wright & Son for $4,895.05, to No. 63, March T., 1893, C. P. No. 4, M. L. D.\n4. April 6,1893, by Rath & Parker for $213.62 to No. 67, of March T., 1893, G. P. No. 1, M. L. D.\nAt the said sheriff\u2019s sale on April 3, 1893, affiant\u2019s attorney did bid the sum of $110,000 for said property, and made for them the deposit of $100, which covered the costs of said sale.\nAffiant\u2019s firm, however, did not complete said purchase and take the said property at the sum mentioned for the reason that without any demand having been made upon them by the said sheriff or by any one for him, or by the plaintiff in the execution writ, or by any of the said mechanics\u2019 lien claimants, or by the defendant, Robert S. Spencer, to comply with the said sale, or without any notice having been given to them by any of the said parties that if they did not comply with the said sale they would be held responsible for any deficiency of price on second sale, the said sheriff returned the said writ of levari facias as set forth in said statement of claim, and an alias writ under the same judgment was duly issued as set forth in this statement, and the property again exposed for sale on December 4,1893, by said plaintiff. At that sale the highest sum bid was $98,000, and at that sum the property was struck down to Benjamin O. Satterwaite, Esq., as attorney, who signed the sheriff\u2019s sale book as such, giving his check for $100 as deposit, and who your affiant believes and avers and expects to be able to prove at the trial of the cause was acting as attorney for the two lien claimants before mentioned, Thomas D. Trott and Thomas W. Wright- & Son. Under an order of court made in the cause, the sheriff also accepted the attorney for affiants who had bid the sum of $91,070 for affiants, as a second bidder, in case the first bidder did not comply with the terms of sale. The first bidder did not comply with the terms of sale, and in due course your affiants made settlement with the sheriff, paid all of his costs, including those mentioned in the statement, and took title in the name of one John F. Smiley, who was acting therein as agent for affiant\u2019s firm.\nApril 6, 1896\nAffiant believes and avers and expects to be able to prove at the trial of the cause, not only all of the foregoing facts, but also that the present suit has been brought by the sheriff at the request of, and for the sole use of, the said two lien claimants, Thomas D. Trott and Thomas W. Wright & Son; and that the Hens which they filed against the property not only are not for the erection and construction of any buildings thereon, but are for the alteration and repair of certain old buildings thereon, and therefore subsequent in Hen to the judgments of deponent\u2019s firm; that, even if they were for erection and construction, they cover but about one twentieth of the property sold, and would be entitled to but one twentieth of the fund, and that said Hen claimants gave receipts in fuU and were settled with by the former owner, Robert S. Spencer.\nThe court discharged the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nError assigned was above order.\nJoseph Savidge, William Grrew and A. S. L. Shields with him, for appellant. \u2014\nDefendants\u2019 purchase and refusal rendered them immediately liable for the difference on resale to be collected in the name of the sheriff for the use of the defendant in execution and his Hen creditors: Forster v. Hayman, 26 Pa. 268; Gaskill v. Morris, 7 W. & S. 32; Tindle\u2019s App., 77 Pa. 203; Smith v. Wilson, 152 Pa. 552; Wright\u2019s App., 25 Pa. 374; Freeman v. Husband, 77 Pa. 389.\nJoseph De F. Junkin, for appellees. \u2014\nDefendants were entitled to notice: Girard Life Ins. Co. v. Young, 8 Phila. 16; Gaskill v. Morris, 7 W. & S. 32."
