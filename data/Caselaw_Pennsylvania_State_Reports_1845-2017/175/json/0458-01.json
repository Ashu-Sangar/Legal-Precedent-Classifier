To cap the series of misfortunes it now appears that there is no bill of exceptions. The stenographer\u2019s notes are filed, but even these though they make mention of objections do not show any exceptions allowed by the judge, and no bill of exceptions has been signed by Mm. Without tMs there is nothing on which tMs court can base a review of the rulings or the charge.\nWe have gone over this subject so frequently of late that it is only necessary to refer to Com. v. Arnold, 161 Pa. 327, and Pool v. White, 171 Pa. 500.\nAppeal quashed at the costs of the appellant.",
