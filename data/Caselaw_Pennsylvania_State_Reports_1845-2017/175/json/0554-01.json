        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nThis case came into the court below on plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the award of viewers assessing his damages for land taken by the Catawissa Railroad Company, one of the defendants, for the purpose of constructing additional tracks and sidings.\nThe strip of land, for the taking of which said damages were assessed, is the same land for which the plaintiff had previously (October, 1892) brought an action of ejectment against the defendant companies above named. That case, having been put at issue, was set down for trial at the next ensuing May term of court. On the eve of trial, May 1, 1893, said Catawissa Railroad Co. presented its petition, in due form, setting forth, among other things, \u201cthat it has located and determined a route for the construction of additional tracks, and sidings, necessary for the business and traffic of said railroad company, in pursuance of its act of incorporation,\u201d etc., to which was attached a draft of the said plaintiff's land, so to be taken, etc., and further averring, in substance, that it had tendered him a bond with sureties in $1,000, conditioned, etc., in due form, which he refused to accept, and praying that the same be approved and filed in court for the benefit of said Abraham Fischer, etc. On same day, the court noted on the record of the action of ejectment, \u201cnot to be brought forward without leave of court; \u201d and thereupon the bond was approved, filed and viewers were appointed as prayed for. On the coming in of the viewers\u2019 report, Fischer appealed therefrom; and, in framing the issue, the court directed \u201c that the plaintiff (Fischer) shall file a statement of his claim for damages sustained by reason of the taking by the defendant of the land described in the petition, and the defendant shall enter a plea of not guilty,\u201d all of which was accordingly done.\nW e have thus recited, at considerable length, the salient facts and circumstances leading up to the issue in plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the award of the viewers in the condemnation proceedings, for the purpose of more clearly presenting the legal status of the parties to the action of ejectment, and the subsequent proceeding by which the same land was taken under the right of eminent domain.\nWhen the Catawissa Railroad Co.\u2019s bond for the benefit of Abraham Fischer was approved and filed, and viewers were appointed to assess his damages for the land taken and appropriated to railroad purposes, Fischer\u2019s title to the land was divested and his only remedy was upon the bond, in connection with the statutory remedy for assessment and collection of damages: Fries v. Railroad etc., 85 Pa. 73; Hoffman\u2019s Appeal, 118 Pa. 512; Williamsport Railroad Co. v. P. & R. R. Co., 141 Pa. 407. As was said in Hoffman\u2019s Appeal, supra, \u201c When a sufficient bond with sureties approved by the court has been given, the company acquires as clear and perfect right to the easement as if it had paid therefor in cash. The landowner\u2019s remedy is upon the bond, in connection with the statffi tory provisions for assessment and collection of damages.\u201d These- are, as it were, substituted for the land, and to them alone the owner must look for his constitutional compensation.\nThe issue in the condemnation proceedings appears to have been twice tried. On the last trial, after plaintiff had closed his case, the defendants offered to show that they had entered upon the land in question and constructed their tracks with the consent of prior owners, predecessors of the plaintiff in title, etc. The learned judge, who specially presided at the trial, excluded the offer on the ground that defendants were estopped by averments in the petition for approval of the bond and appointment of viewers, and their subsequent conduct, but he permitted them to withdraw the petition and bond, and to discontinue all proceedings upon payment of costs and filing an affidavit that the bond and petition were filed under a misapprehension of. the facts, and in ignorance of their rights in the premises. This action appears to have been taken without any hearing or proof establishing the truth of the allegations contained in the affidavit, and without affording plaintiff any opportunity of showing that they were unfounded in fact.\nBut, aside from the lack of proof to sustain the averments contained in defendant\u2019s affidavit, etc., we think the learned trial judge erred in making the order complained of. It was unwarranted by any act of assembly or by any of our rulings in the class of cases to which this belongs. As shown by the cases above cited, the effect of the proceedings deliberately instituted by one of the defendants, including the approval and filing of the bond, appointment of viewers, etc., was to divest plaintiff\u2019s right to the possession of the land taken, and remit him to his claim for compensation, under the constitution, secured by the bond, etc. Not only had a divestiture of plaintiff\u2019s right of possession been effected, but, after the approval and filing of the bond defendants were in the actual and rightful possession of the land in question. Under all our decisions it was then too late to discontinue the proceedings: Wood v. State Hospital, 164 Pa. 159; Williamsport, etc. R. Co. v. P. & E. R. Co., 141 Pa. 407, and cases there cited. It follows from what has been said that the order complained of was erroneously made, and should therefore.be reversed and wholly set aside.\nIt is accordingly adjudged and decreed that the order or decree of the court below permitting the withdrawal of the petition and bond and authorizing the discontinuance of the proceedings for assessment of plaintiff\u2019s damages, etc., be and the same is hereby reversed and set aside, and that the said proceedings be fully reinstated with a procedendo; and, it is further ordered that all the costs including the costs of this appeal be paid by tbe defendants.",

    "head_matter": "Abraham Fischer, Appellant, v. The Catawissa Railroad Company and The Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company.\nEailroads \u2014 Eminent domain \u2014 Effect of filing bond.\nWhen a sufficient bond with sureties approved by the court has been given by a railroad company to alandowner for land taken and appropriated to railroad purposes, the owner\u2019s title to the land is divested, and his only remedy is upon the bond in connection with the statutory remedy for assessment and collection of damages.\nAfter a landowner had begun an action of ejectment against a railroad company for land taken for sidings and additional tracks, the railroad company petitioned for the appointment of viewers and filed a bond which was approved by the court. On an appeal from the report of viewers, the railroad company offered to show that they had entered upon the land with the consent of prior owners, predecessors of the plaintiff in title. The trial judge excluded the offer on the ground that the railroad company was estopped by averments in the petition for approval of the bond and appointment of viewers, and its subsequent conduct, but he permitted the company to withdraw the petition and bond, and to discontinue all proceedings upon payment of costs and filing an affidavit that the bondi and petition were filed under a misapprehension of the facts, and in ignorance of the company\u2019s rights in the premises. The order was made without any further hearing to establish the proof of the allegations contained in the affidavit. Held, (1) that the order was erroneously made; (2) that plaintiff\u2019s right of possession had been divested upon the filing of the-bond, and it was then too late to discontinue the proceedings.\nArgued March 16, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 345, Jan. T., 1895,. by plaintiff, from order of C. P. Lycoming Co., June T., 1893, No. 390, permitting condemnation proceedings to be discontinued.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nReversed.\nPetition to discontinue condemnation proceedings. Before Wickham, P. J., of the 36th judicial district, specially presiding.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nError assigned was order permitting the railroad company to discontinue the proceedings.\nHenry O. Parsons, Ames Hammond with him, for appellant.\n\u2014When the defendant filed the bond the title of the plaintiff was divested, and the plaintiff\u2019s only remedy was on the bond: Fries v. R. R. & Mining Co., 85 Pa. 73; Hoffman\u2019s App., 118 Pa. 512 ; Williamsport R. R. v. Philadelphia & Reading R. R., 141 Pa. 407; Richards v. R. R., 137 Pa. 524.\nThe defendant was estopped from withdrawing its petition and bond in this case by the allegations contained in its petition,, and subsequent conduct: Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 27; Eldred v. Hazelett\u2019s Admr., 33 Pa. 307; Treffeison\u2019s Assignment, 3 Kulp, 308.\nA party is justified in acting on the clear, positive representation of another, though he had the means of knowing the truth of the matter: 6 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 15; Webster v. Bailey, 31 Michigan 36; David v. Park, 103 Mass. 501; Mead v. Bunn, 32 N. Y. 275.\nThere is another reason why this decree must be set aside, because it was made on an ex-parte affidavit. The decree of January 22,1895, was a final decree, for if affirmed by this court it ends this case: Parsons\u2019s Practice in the Supreme Court, section 28; Troubat & Haley\u2019s Practice, sec. 824; Pittsburg\u2019s App., 79 Pa. 817.\nMay 25, 1896:\nThe issue having been framed for the assessment of the damages, the case attached, a jury sworn, that ends the authority of the trial judge to grant discontinuance, and is governed by well settled legal principles: Pusey\u2019s App., 83 Pa. 67; Pollock v. Hall, 4 Dallas, 222; McCredy v. Fey, 7 Watts, 496; R. R. v. Harris, 124 Pa. 215; Wood v. Hospital, 164 Pa. 159.\nJohn G. Reading, Jr., for appellees. \u2014\nThe bond is filed in court and it becomes available for the owner only after he shows that he has an interest in the property: Davis v. Ry., 114 Pa. 308 ; Lawrence\u2019s App., 78 Pa. 365 ; Warrell v. R. R., 130 Pa. 600 ; Schuylkill etc. Nav. Co. v. Decker, 2 W. 343; McFadden v. Johnson, 72 Pa. 335.\nThe owner\u2019s right to damages for the trespass is a vested right of which he cannot be deprived, but as to that use which is yet to come, the legal remedy for appropriation and compensation may be exercised by either party: McClinton v. Ry., 66 Pa. 404; Graham v. R. R., 145 Pa. 504.\nThe action of ejectment is still pending. If plaintiff recover a verdict therein, he will still have a full and complete remedy at law for any and all damages he may have sustained, as well as for compensation for the future occupation of his land. All that the order of the court has done is to decide that the plaintiff cannot recover in this particular action, because said action was commenced by mistake and under a misapprehension.\nThe court had power to direct the discontinuance of the proceedings in the case at bar: Huckestine v. Allegheny City, 165 Pa. 367 ; Lewis on Eminent Domain, sec. 355; Brisbine v. St. Paul & Sioux City R. R., 23 Minn. 114; Wilcox v. St. Paul & North Pacific R. R., 35 Minn. 439; Allyn v. Providence & R. R., 4 R. I. 457; Loss v. Obry, 22 N. J. Eq. 52; Hurd v. Hall, 12 Wis. 112; High on Injunctions, sec. 42; Strong\u2019s Eq. sec. 885."
