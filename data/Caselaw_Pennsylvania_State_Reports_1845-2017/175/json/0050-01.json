        "text": "Per Curiam,\nAccording to the record, as amended prior to the trial, this was a feigned issue betweer Johanna Frederika De Grote, as plaintiff, and Mary Jane De Grote, as defendant, to determine which of the parties was entitled to the money paid into court by \u201cthe Grand Lodge of the Jurisdiction of Pennsylvania Ancient Order of United Workmen,\u201d the original defendant in the suit. The issue came on for trial, and the learned judge who presided thereat directed the jury to find for the defendant. The subjects of complaint are, (1) refusal of the court to continue the case on application of the plaintiff; (2) refusal \u201c to grant the plaintiff a new trial,\u201d and (3) that the court erred in directing the jury to find for the defendant. This last specification was filed at bar, by leave of court.\nWe have considered the record with special reference to each of these specifications of error, and are all of opinion that neither of them should be sustained. Except in clear cases of abuse of discretion, refusal of the court to continue a cause or to grant a -new trial is not assignable for error ; and there is nothing in this case to make either an exception to the general rule. The first and second specifications are therefore dismissed. As to the binding instruction complained of in the third specification, we think the learned trial judge committed no error. There is nothing in either of the specifications that requires discussion.\nJudgment affirmed.",

G. \u2014 Gontinua/nce of case \u2014 Refusal of new trial.\nExcept in clear cases of abuse of discretion the refusal of the court to continue a cause or to grant a new trial is not assignable for error.\nBeneficial associations \u2014 Husband and wife \u2014 Beneficiary.\nAlbert De Grote became a member of a beneficial association and had the beneficiary\u2019s certificate made payable to \u201c Mary Jane De Grote, bearing relationship to myself of wife.\u201d At the time he joined the association the choice of members was unlimited as to whom they could name as beneficiary. At the time of De Grote\u2019s death an applicant was restricted in choice to one or more members of his family, or some one related to him by blood, or who should be dependent upon him. De Grote had been married to Mary Jane De Grote by a clergyman and had lived with her for several year's as her husband, though he had two wives living at the time of his marriage to her. Subsequently he obtained divorces from his former wives, and remarried Mary Jane. Held, that Mary Jane was entitled to the beneficial fund even if she were not De Grote\u2019s lawful wife.\nArgued March 27, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 54, Jan. T., 1896, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Phila. Co., June T., 1898, No. 155, on verdict for defendant.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nInterpleader to determine the ownership of a beneficial fund. Before Sultzberger, J.\nOn June 29, 1882, Albert De Grote became a member of the\nYardley Lodge of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, and designated as beneficiary \u201c Mary Jane De Grote bearing relationship to myself of wife.\u201d De Grote never changed this designation. At the time he became a member, the applicant was unlimited in his choice of beneficiary. At the time of his death the following by-law was in force:\n\u201c Each member shall designate the person or persons to whom the beneficiary fund due at his death shall be paid, who shall, in every instance, be one or more members of his family, or some one related to him by blood, or who shall be dependent upon him.\u201d\nSuit was originally brought by Johanna F. De Grote, mother and heir of the deceased, against The Grand Lodge of the Jurisdiction of Pennsylvania, Ancient Order of United Workmen.\nApril 6, 1896:\nMary Jane De Grote notified the company that she was the wife of the deceased and was entitled to the money, whereupon the company was permitted to pay the money into court and a feigned issue was awarded between the two claimants to the fund.\nAt the trial there was evidence tending to show that on December 29,1868, Albert De Grote was married to Mary Jane De Grote by a regularly ordained minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, that thereafter they lived together as man and wife until 1891, when Mary Jane discovered that De Grote had been previously married to two other women who were then living. During the year 1891, De Grote obtained divorces from his prior wives, and on April 4, 1892, De Grote and Mary Jane were again married by a regularly ordained clergyman in Camden, New Jersey, and thereafter continued to live together as man and wife until the death of De Grote in March, 1893. Plaintiff asked for the continuance of the case on account of the illness of her counsel, Edward Brady, Esq. The record showed that C. Davis was also counsel for her. The court refused to grant a continuance and subsequently directed a verdict for defendant. Judgment was entered on the verdict.\nThe plaintiff moved for a new trial on the ground of after-discovered evidence. The court refused to grant a new trial.\nErrors assigned were, (1) refusal to grant a continuance; (2) refusal to grant a new trial; (3) binding instructions for defendant.\nCharles Davis, Edward Brady with him, for appellant.\nAlfred Frank Custis, William C. Shipman with him, for appellee."
