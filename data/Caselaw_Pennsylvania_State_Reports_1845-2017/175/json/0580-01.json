        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Stebbett,\nIt is undoubtedly true, as a general proposition, that \u201c a mere statement of the defendant\u2019s conclusion \u201d \u201c from facts not disclosed\u201d is unavailable as part of his affidavit of defense ; but, in determining whether any particular averment is of that character or not, due regard must be had to all the averments contained in the affidavit, and to the further consideration that such affidavits are not required to be framed with the technical accuracy of formal pleadings, and should not, therefore, be subjected to the same severe scrutiny. All that is required in an affidavit of defense is that it shall set forth, with reasonable precision, such matters of fact as will constitute a substantial answer to the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. It is not necessary to 'disclose how or by whom the facts relied on, as a defense, are to be proved. In view of these and other considerations, we are not satisfied that the principle above stated was rightly applied by the learned president of the common pleas to the defendant\u2019s averment, \u201c that the drafts and bills of exchange on which suit is brought in this case are renewals of other drafts and bills of exchange, of like amounts, payment of all of which was secured to said plaintiff by a certain mortgage,\u201d etc.\nAfter referring to plaintiff\u2019s agreement of June 6,1894, in relation to said mortgage, etc., the defendant company in its affidavit says, \u201cthe amount of said mortgage and judgment thereon is sufficient to fully cover the entire amount of all notes, acceptances and indebtedness held by said bank against the Warren Refining Company, Limited, including the obligations on which this suit is brought,\u201d etc., and then concludes with the averment, \u201c that the said plaintiff has in the manner aforesaid received payment in full of the notes, drafts and bills of exchange upon which this action is founded, referred to in plaintiff\u2019s statement, from the Warren Refining Company, Limited. All of which deponent is informed and believes to be true, and said defendant expects to be able to prove the same upon the trial of this cause.\u201d\nAssuming as we must, in this class of cases, that the averments of fact contained in the affidavits of defense are true, and giving to them the legal effect to which they are fairly entitled, we think they are sufficient to prevent a summary judgment, and thus carry the case to a jury. It is neither necessary nor desirable to consider the questions that may arise on the trial. They are sufficiently indicated in the affidavits of defense; and we are of opinion that the defendant company is entitled to an opportunity of developing the defense on which it appears to rely.\nJudgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.",

P. \u2014 Affidavit of defense.\nA mere statement of the defendant\u2019s conclusion from, facts not disclosed is unavailable as part of his affidavit of defense; but, in determining whether any particular averment is of that character or not, due regard must be had to all the averments contained in the affidavit, and to the further consideration that such affidavits are not required to be framed with the technical accuracy of formal pleadings.and should not, therefore, be subjected to the same severe scrutiny.\nAll that is required is that an affidavit of defense shall set forth, with reasonable precision, such matters of facts as will constitute a substantial answer to the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. It is not necessary that it. disclose how or by whom the facts relied on as a defense are to be proved.\nIn an action by a bank upon a promissory note and acceptances of drafts made by W., a refining company, it appeared that the defendant was the drawee of the acceptances and the payee and indorser of the note. W. had executed to the bank a mortgage which recited as follows: \u201c Whereas the bank has agreed to advance from time to time to W. upon and in payment of its notes, acceptances and its other indebtedness of like nature, sums of money not to exceed in the aggregate $15,000 to be paid to W. with interest at such times and in such amounts as may be hereafter agreed upon.\u201d It appeared by an agreement in writing that the bank had agreed that the defendant should have the same rights under the mortgage as W. The defendant in its affidavit of defense averred that \u201c the amount of said mortgage and judgment thereon is sufficient to fully cover the entire amount of all notes, acceptances and indebtedness held by said bank against W., including the obligations on which this suit is brought,\u201d etc., and then concluded with the averment, \u201c that the said plaintiff has in the manner aforesaid received payment in full of the notes, drafts and bills of exchange upon which this action is founded, referred to in plaintiff\u2019s statement, from W. All of which deponent is informed and believes to be true, and said defendant expects to be able to prove the same upon the trial of this cause.\u201d Held, that the affidavit of defense was sufficient to prevent judgment.\nArgued May 4, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 136, Juty T., 1895, by defendant, from order of C.
