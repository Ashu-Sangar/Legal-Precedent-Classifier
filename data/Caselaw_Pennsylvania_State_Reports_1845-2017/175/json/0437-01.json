If the entire record were before ns, it is not clear that there would not be force in these positions; but, waiving any discussion of either, and assuming, for the purposes of this case, that in the circumstances he has a right to be heard on the questions involved, we are satisfied from an examination of the record that there is no merit in his appeal. There appears to be no substantial error in the conclusions reached by the learned judge of the 6th judicial district who presided at the final hearing. On his opinion, the decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellants\u2019 costs.",

Separate and independent claimants upon a fund cannot prosecute a joint appeal from a \u25a0decree distributing the same.\nSupreme Gourt \u2014 Jurisdiction\u2014Amount in controversy.\nThe Supreme Court has jurisdiction over an appeal from a decree distributing a fund raised by a sheriff\u2019s sale where the entire fund for distribution amounted to $1,123.74 without any deduction for costs or expenses, and the whole of the fund is claimed by a receiver.\nGorporation \u2014 Insolvency\u2014Distribution of proceeds of sheriff's sale of corporate property. (!\nThe proceeds of the judicial sale of the property of a private corporation is governed by the same rules of distribution that apply to such a-, sale of the property of an individual.\nAssignor and assignee of proceeds of judgment \u2014 Nonsuit by assignor.\nPlaintiff assigned the proceeds of his judgment against an insolvent corporation to a bank, and the judgment was subsequently opened on petition of creditors to determine whether it was fraudulent as to them,, when plaintiff took a nonsuit. It was held that the bank, not being a party to the issue, could not be prejudiced in its rights by the acts of the-plaintiff, but is entitled to the proceeds of the judgment.\nArgued May 5, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 297, Jan. T., 1896, by Leon G. Ball et al., from order of C. P. Warren Co., June T., 1893, No. 307, distributing proceeds raised by sheriff\u2019s sale.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to report of auditor distributing fund raised by a sheriff\u2019s sale of the property of the Reynolds Lumber Company.\nFrom the record it appeared that the case was referred to* J. W. Wiggins, Esq., as auditor. Upon exceptions to the auditor\u2019s first report Morrison, J., of the 48th judicial district specially presiding, decided that the fund should be distributed pro rata among the creditors without any preference being, given to judgment creditors. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court, the case was referred back to the auditor. All the material facts will be found in Reynolds v. Reynolds Lumber Co.,. 169 Pa. 626.\nUpon exceptions to the auditor\u2019s second report, Gunnison, P. J., of the 6th judicial district, specially presiding, filed\u2019 the following opinion:\nThis is the second report of the auditor, distributing the same-fund.\nUpon exception to the first report, Judge Morrison, of tke48th district, specially presiding, in an exceedingly able and' exhaustive opinion, set aside the distribution made by the auditor, who had awarded the money, after paying certain preferred claims not disputed, to the Warren Savings Bank, asassignee of the plaintiff in this writ, and directed that a decree-be drawn \u201cmaking distribution to all tbe creditors, pro rata,\u201d to be submitted to him for consideration and signature upon notice to the counsel of creditors. The learned judge directed this decree upon the ground that no priority was acquired by the levy upon the execution of the plaintiff, or by the foreign attachment issued by the Warren Savings Bank on another claim held by it, upon the property of the defendant, which was an insolvent corporation.\nOther matters were discussed and decided by him, not necessary to refer to in this proceeding, except that the sheriff having paid a portion of the fund to the bank, upon its assignment, he was ordered to pay that amount into court, to be distributed with the balance in accordance with the principles expressed in the opinion.\nThe sheriff appealed from this order, and the Supreme Court reversed the order made upon him: Roy\u2019s App., 169 Pa. 626.\nNo order was made by the Supreme Court as to the direction of the learned judge below that a decree be drawn \u201c making distribution to all the creditors, pro rata,\u201d the decree never having been in fact drawn. Until it had been drawn and signed, there was nothing in that respect to appeal from. But the opinion of the Supreme Court is equally applicable to the distribution of the fund so directed to be distributed, and indicates with no uncertainty the rule to be observed in its distribution.\nThe learned auditor deeming it heyond his power to make distribution contrary to the opinion of Judge Mo re\u00eds on until it had been reversed or the interlocutory order had been revoked, reported a distribution in accordance with it, accompanying his report with an alternative schedule of distribution in accordance with the opinion of the Supreme Court, and witli that of the learned president judge of this district in another case, which was adopted by the Supreme Court in East Side Bank v. Columhus Tanning Co., 170 Pa. 1, thus avoiding the necessity of recommitting the matter to him, if this court approved a distribution upon that plan.\nBoth the Warren Savings Bank and the general creditors filed exceptions to this report, and it is upon these exceptions that the case is now before us.\nNo final decree having been made, it is clearly within the power of this court to correct the distribution made by the auditor in. accordance with the opinion filed by Judge Morrison. To hold otherwise would render it necessary to now confirm a distribution winch is clearly at variance with the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in Roy\u2019s App., and East Side Bank v. Columbus Tanning Company, supra, and would result in another appeal, the decision in which would, without doubt, be a reaffirmance of the doctrine so clearly announced in the cases above cited. No authority has been produced which requires so unnecessary a course, with the delay and expense incident thereto, and I know of none.\nSince the payment by the sheriff of a portion of the money to the Warren Savings Bank, the original judgment upon which this execution was issued has been opened, and upon the trial of the issue granted to determine whether it was fraudulent as to the creditors of the defendant corporation, T. J. Reynolds, the plaintiff took, voluntarily, a nonsuit. That, unquestionably avoided the judgment so far as it existed for the purpose of future collection. But the bank was not a party to that issue, and the act of the plaintiff, who had assigned the money already made to it, in abandoning his claim to recover the balance of his judgment, cannot prejudice the bank, his assignee of this fund, it not having in any manner, either expressly or by implication surrendered its claim, and there having been no proceeding instituted to invalidate it.\nIn view of the conclusions at which we have arrived, it would not affect the result if the matter was referred back to the auditor to take proof that the bank has received payment of its claim in the foreign attachment. It is entitled to the money now in court for distribution, after payment of costs, upon its assignment from T. J. Reynolds, whether it has received satisfaction of its claim in the foreign attachment or not, and the motion of the counsel for creditors to refer it back to allow proof of the fact alleged is therefore refused.\nThe motion to allow exceptions to be filed nunc pro tunc is also refused. It is accompanied by no allegation of fact justifying its allowance, does not state the nature of the exceptions desired to be filed, and is contrary to the rule of court and the established practice in such cases.\nIt was suggested upon the argument that, as a matter of etiquette, these exceptions should be heard by Judge MorriSON, he having heard and passed upon the exceptions to the first report. I can discover no breach of etiquette in my hearing and disposing of them. The learned judge of this district 'has certified them to me. Perhaps he was prompted by a feeling of delicacy in not calling upon the- learned judge, who had so ably and exhaustively given his reasons for a pro rata distribution, to now make a distribution at variance with his opinion, which would have been inevitably necessary if he had been now called upon again. In any event, he will be assured that in performing the duty enjoined upon me by statute, I do it in no spirit of discourtesy or want of respect towards him. I recognize his eminent worth and ability too much to be guilty of any such feeling for him.\nThe exceptions on the part of the bank to the payment of the entire costs of the audit from the fund cannot be sustained excepting as to one item. In Larimer\u2019s App., 22 Pa. 41, where the costs of the audit were imposed upon the contesting creditors, the court says : \u201cWe put the decision upon the general rule that in a contest the losing party ought to pay the costs unless he can show clearly that there were special circumstances to create probable cause for disputing his adversary\u2019s claim.\u201d\nIn Sansenbacher v. Sehickendantz, 141 Pa. 418, where the court held that there was probable cause, the costs were paid from the fund.\nHere the fact that the learned judge, who heard the exceptions to the first report, sustained the contention of the contesting creditors, and that other able judges have expressed the same opinion upon similar facts, shows probable cause, which justifies the payment of the costs of the first audit. The costs of this, in part at least, were necessarily incurred irrespective of any contest. The entire costs of the second audit are not large, and the amount that would in any event be imposed upon the contesting creditors would be so small as not to justify recommitting the report to the auditor to ascertain it.\nThe one item of $7.75, awarded to Leon Ball on depositions, is, however, so apparent, it can be disallowed without a recommitment, and the exception to its allowance is sustained.\nAnd now February 12, 1896, the 1st exception in behalf of \u201cPortland Lumber Co., and other creditors\u201d is sustained, and the 2d and 3d exceptions are dismissed.\nThe 1st, 2d, 3d and 4th exceptions filed by the Warren Savings Bank are sustained, and the 5th and 6th exceptions are dismissed.\nAnd it is ordered that the distribution reported in the alternative schedule filed by the auditor excepting the item of $7.75 awarded therein tp Leon Ball on depositions, which amount is added to the amount therein awarded to the Warren Savings Bank, making the amount distributed to it $816.94, is confirmed, and distribution is directed to be made in accordance herewith.\nLeon G. Ball, receiver of the Reynolds Lumber Company, and J. B. Offerle and other general creditors of the corporation, took a joint appeal. Upon motion of the appellee the appellants were ruled to elect which of them should prosecute the appeal. Their counsel thereupon elected to stand upon the appeal of the receiver and to suffer a non pros as to all the other joint appellants ; and this was accordingly done.\nError assigned among others was in decreeing that the Warren Savings Bank was entitled to any part of the fund.\nSamuel T.
