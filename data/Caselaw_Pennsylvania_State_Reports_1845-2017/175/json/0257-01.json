        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Stebbett,\nOn February 8,1895, appellant\u2019s husband, Sheldon Reynolds, died testate, leaving to survive him his said wife and a minor son, then about seventeen years of age, whose guardian is Benjamin Reynolds. In his last will, probated a few days after his decease, the testator made the following disposition of his estate : \u201c All my estate, real, personal and mixed, .wheresoever situated, I give and bequeath to my beloved wife Annie B. D. Reynolds, for and during her natural life: \u201d and, without making any other disposition of the same, he appointed his wife and Andrew H. McClintock executors of his will \u201cwithout bonds.\u201d\nThe fund in court for distribution, $1,562.50, is the proceeds of a private orphans\u201d court sale of part of testator\u2019s real estate, and is of course distributable as realty.\nFor the purpose of determining whether, under her husband\u2019s will, appellant took a fee in his real estate or not, the guardian of the minor and all parties interested were brought into court and heard. Upon due consideration of the premises, the learned court held, in substance, that appellant took only a life estate in the realty of which her husband died seized, and accordingly entered a decree to that effect, and also awarded the fund in question to the guardian, \u201c subject to the widow\u2019s right to the income thereof.\u201d This appeal was taken and each branch of the decree is assigned as error.\nAs to the first, we are of opinion that the court was clearly right in construing the will. So far as testator\u2019s real estate is concerned, the devise thereof to appellant is manifestly limited to a life estate by the concluding words, \u201c for and during her natural life.\u201d Without practically ignoring the plain and universally accepted meaning of these words, it is impossible to otherwise construe the devising clause above quoted; and, as to that branch of the decree, the court should be sustained. But, as to so much of the decree as awards the fund to the guardian, we think the court erred, and that branch of the decree must be vacated. The fund in question, less costs, and expenses if any, should be awarded to a trustee, to be appointed by the orphans\u2019 court to receive and securely invest the same, collect the interest accruing therefrom and pay the same to the appellant semiannually during the term of her natural life, and, at her decease, to pay the corpus of the fund to such person or persons as may then be found entitled thereto. There, appears to be nothing in the case, as presented, that requires discussion. With the single exception of awarding the fund to the guardian instead of to a specially appointed trustee, we find no error in the record.\nThe decree \u2014 except so much thereof as awards the fund in court to the guardian of the minor son, and is hereby vacated\u2014 is therefore affirmed, and the record is remitted to the court below with instructions to award the fund to a trustee to be appointed to receive and mvest the same, etc., in the manner and for the purpose above specified, etc; and it is further ordered that the appeal be dismissed, and that the costs \u2014 including the costs of this appeal \u2014 be paid out of the fund.",

By his will he directed as follows: \u201cAll my estate, real, personal and mixed, wheresoever situated, I gave and bequeath to my beloved wife Annie B. D. Reynolds, for and during her natural life: \u201d and, without making any other disposition of the same, he appointed his wife and Andrew H.

J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nDecree modified.\nRule to show cause why the fund arising from the sale of real estate of Sheldon Reynolds, deceased, and now in court, should not be paid to Annie B. D. Reynolds, Ms widow.\nTestator\u2019s will was as follows :\n\u201c I, Sheldon Reynolds, of the city of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, do make and publish this my last will and testament.\n\u201c All my estate real, personal and mixed wherever situated,\nI give and bequeath unto my beloved wife, Annie B. D. Reynolds, for and during her natural life.\n\u201cAnd I appoint my wife Annie B. D. Reynolds and Andrew H. McClintock my executors, without bonds, of this my last will.\u201d\nThe orphans\u2019 court in an opimon by Darte, P. J., held that the widow took \u00e1 life estate in decedent\u2019s real estate, and awarded the fund to Benjamin Reynolds, guardian of testator\u2019s minor son, Dorrance Reynolds, \u201c subject to the said widow\u2019s right to the income thereof.\u201d\nError assigned was above decree.\nAndrew H. Mo Glintock, Arthur Hillman with Mm, for appellant. \u2014\nThe widow took an estate in fee: Shinn v. Holmes, 25 Pa, 142; Schriver v. Meyer, 19 Pa. 87; Geyer v. Wentzel, 68 Pa. 86; Grove\u2019s Est., 58 Pa. 429; Williams v. Leech, 28 Pa. 89; Snyder v. Baer, 144 Pa. 280; Kiefel v. Keppler, 173 Pa. 181; Rewalt v. Ulrich, 23 Pa. 388; Merkel\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 235 ; Willard\u2019s App., 68 Pa. 327.\nHenry A. Fuller, for appellee. \u2014\nAt common law, prior to act of 1833, it is certain and conceded tliis would have been a life estate and nothing more, notwithstanding (a) the general presumption against intestacy, (6) the comprehensive description \u201call my estate,\u201d (6\u2018).the contrary rule applicable to gifts of personalty: Kiefel v. Keppler, 173 Pa. 181.\nIt is equally certain that the act of 1833 cannot enlarge this estate to a fee, because it plainly appears \u201c by words of limitation, in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate,\u201d namely, the words \u201c for and during her natural life: \u201d Rap. & Lawrence Law Dictionary.\nIn Schriver v. Meyer, 19 Pa. 87; Wood v. Hills, 19 Pa. 135, and Shinn v. Holmes, 25 Pa. 142, there were no words of limitation whatever.\nIn Grove\u2019s Estate, 58 Pa. 429, there was absolute power of sale-.\nIn Geyer v. Wentzel, 68 Pa. 84, the testator dying without issue, willed all his property to his wife expressly excluding all other relatives, and the court held that the words \u201c so long as she lives \u201d could not restrict subsequent words sufficient to pass a fee.\nIn Williams v. Leech, 28 Pa. 89, there was first an absolute devise which was subsequently restricted by contingent remainders in favor of the first taker\u2019s children, and the question of fee or life estate under the will was immaterial.\nIn Second Reformed Church v. Disbrow, 52 Pa. 219, there was absolute power of disposition, followed by precatory words which strengthened rather than weakened the conclusion of testator\u2019s intent to vest the whole estate in his wife.\nIn Boyle v. Boyle, 152 Pa. 108, the language of the will plainly imported unlimited power of disposition, which could not be controlled by subsequent precatory words.\nIn McIntyre v. McIntyre, 123 Pa. 329, there was an absolute devise, accompanied by a void restraint upon alienation and precatory words.\nIn Coles v. Ayres, 156 Pa. 197, there was an absolute devise, and the condition subsequent failed to show clearly that the testator intended to give less than a fee.\nIn Snyder v. Baer, 144 Pa. 280, it was held that after giving a fee it cannot be cut down to a life estate by the unnecessary provision that the devisee should have the control of it during her life.\nIn Kiefel v. Keppler, 173 Pa. 181, the limitation of the words \u201c while he lives \u201d is followed by an unlimited power of sale, with no restriction on the appropriation of the proceeds.\nApril 27, 1896:"
