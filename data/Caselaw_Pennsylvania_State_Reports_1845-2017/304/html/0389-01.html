The bill sets forth that there are approximately 16,000 members of the order. It is recited that to aid more effectually in the financial assistance to be rendered to the members each individual member of each lodge upon his entrance therein becomes a member of the Beaver Beneficial Association, a Pennsylvania corporation, which receives the sum of twenty cents from each member monthly, to become part of a fund out of which, upon the death of any member, the sum of $200 is paid to the lodge to which he belonged as trustee for his beneficiaries. In addition there is the opportunity open to members who pay thirty-five cents per month to increase the death benefit to $300. It is set forth in the bill that the individual defendants were officers of the association, having been elected September 7, 1928, that under the by-laws <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>of the association its officers must be members in good standing in the association through membership in a lodge of Fraternal Order of Beavers and that the individual defendants have not been members in good standing in any such lodge since January 18, 1929, and have see'eded from the lodge of which they were members. It was averred that a number of lodges in accordance with ■the by-laws had petitioned the board of directors of the association to call a meeting for the purpose of reorganizing it, and that the officers and directors had refused to call the meeting, and that the defendants as officers and directors have continued to operate the business of the association contrary to its by-laws in that they have made a demand upon all members to increase the monthly dues from twenty cents to twenty-five cents and the special dues from thirty-five cents to seventy-five cents per month and moreover have refused to accept applicants for benefits who are over forty-five years of age, in violation of the by-laws. . It is charged in the bill that the defendants are illegally occupying the offices which they hold in the association and thereby have caused uncertainty among the members as to the status of the defendants and as to the payments to be made by the members for the purpose of obtaining benefits. The prayers of the bill are that the defendants be restrained by injunction from enforcing the collection of more than twenty cents per month from the individual members of the lodges of Fraternal Order of Beavers and more than thirty-five cents per month for the special insurance and compelling the defendants to accept these sums from all lodge members not more than fifty years of age in accordance -with the by-laws of the association; that a receiver be appointed to accept all money payable to the association and to make necessary disbursements until new officers of the association are chosen; that the defendants be ordered to vacate the offices which they hold in the association; and that a special meeting of the <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>members of the lodges be held for the purpose of electing officers.</p>
