Rainear died September 10, 1929, leaving a will dated September 10, 1913, and codicil dated February 1,1928. After minor provisions, the will, by paragraph third, directed the executors to transfer the business conducted by testator under the name of C. J. Rain-ear &amp; Co. to his two sons upon condition that they “(B) Agree in writing with my wife, Charlotte A. Rainear, to pay to her the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) per week from the date of my decease until her death or her remarriage, whichever shall first occur, and further agree with her to pay the sum of Thirty Dollars ($30.00) per month to the Building and Loan Associations in which she may be the owner of such stock. Such payments to such Building and Loan Associations shall continue until such stock matures or my wife re-marries, whichever shall first occur. My said sons shall further agree that all payments so made and all such stock in <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>such Building and Loan Associations shall upon maturity thereof belong absolutely to my wife; and (C) Deliver to my wife securities or assurances satisfactory to her that the conditions herein contained and the agreements relative thereto will be fully and faithfully carried out.”</p>

Bainear, of the sum of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) per week from the date of my decease for a period so long as she shall live or remarry, whichever shall first occur.”</p>

It is a sound rule of construction that ‘A codicil should not be held to interfere with any of the specific provisions of a will, unless its language naturally and obviously produce such result, or the terms of the codicil expressly recognize the alteration’ ”: Baugh’s Est., <a href="/pa/288/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="288 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="1100836" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0308-01">288 Pa. 308</a>, 311, and cases there cited. Following the first-stated principle, we must hold to the construction of the codicil consistent with the main thought expressed in the original will — that the money and securities mentioned in the codicil were intended to be given the widow only as collateral security for the payments directed to be made to her, not as an absolute gift.</p>

Further, the court below found that, if this provision were to be construed according to appellant’s contention, the sons, had they accepted the business under all attendant conditions, would labor under commitments which would leave “little or nothing” out of the estate for themselves; and, if the business were taken over by the executors, practically the entire assets of the estate must necessarily be set aside to secure payments to the widow. On the other hand, the auditing judge found the fund realized from the cash and securities in question, inventoried at approximately $268,000, properly invested would yield an annual income of approximately $10,000, a sum somewhat more than sufficient to pay the annuity to the widow and the building and loan dues, amounting altogether to $8,020 yearly, and that “It would not seem unreasonable to set aside securities yielding about $10,000 to insure yearly payments of about $8,000, especially where $5,000 would continue for life or [until] remarriage, and the balance for possibly 12 or more years, until some or all of the stock matured.” This <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>latter circumstance particularly lends weight to the court’s conclusion that this fund was intended to replace the necessity for personal security from the sons, or, if the sons did not assume the responsibility, to provide a definite fund not dependent on the business, the other chief asset of the estate.</p>
    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[148,681,1151,534]]]'>We need not discuss other indications in the will and codicil that support the adjudication. While it is apparent from the codicil that, fifteen years after making his original will, testator desired to make larger provisions for his wife, there is no justification for concluding that, although he expressed himself ambiguously, testator meant to give his wife almost his entire estate, contrary to the provisions of the will itself, virtually disinheriting his sons, who had been associated with him in business for some twenty years.</p>
