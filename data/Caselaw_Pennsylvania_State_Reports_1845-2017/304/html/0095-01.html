    <p id="b118-14" data-blocks='[["BL_118.20",118,[259,1745,1146,198]]]'>Plaintiff appeals from the refusal of the court below to take off a nonsuit entered in his action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained when struck by defendant’s automobile.</p>

The non-suit was based on plaintiff’s contributory negligence in failing to observe the moving car coming from Vine Street and practically on him at the time he stepped from the sidewalk. Plaintiff’s own uncontradicted testimony establishes the fact that had he looked before stepping from a place of safety into the roadway he must have seen the approaching automobile. This he failed to do. We find no abuse of discretion in the refusal of the court below to take off the nonsuit.</p>
    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[275,908,814,34]]]'>The order of the court below is affirmed.</p>
