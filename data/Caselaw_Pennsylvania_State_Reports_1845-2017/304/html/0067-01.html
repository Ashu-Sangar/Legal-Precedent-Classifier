Gibbs Construction Company, for the erection of a senior high school. This included the construction of walks, curbs, gutters, etc., which Gibbs sublet to the use-plaintiff, Peter F. Miller. The latter was to furnish all material and do all the labor for an agreed consideration. For the protection of those furnishing material and labor for this subcontract Gibbs gave the school district a bond of $4,000, with the Continental Casualty Company, defendant, as surety, reciting, inter alia, that: “Whereas T. M. Gibbs Construction Company has entered into a contract with Easton School District for all paving, walks, curbs and gutters, in connection with the construction of senior high school, situated at Northampton, Twelfth and Spring Garden Streets, in the City of Easton, Pennsylvania, and whereas the said Easton School District has required the said principal to give a bond of indemnity in the amount of four thousand dollars ($4,000), conditioned that said principal shall and will promptly pay or cause to be paid to any person, all sums of money which may be due for labor performed or materials supplied and furnished in and about the performance of the work covered by the said contract”; and also providing: “Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if the said principal shall and will promptly pay or cause to be paid to any person or persons, copartnership or copartnerships, corporation or corporations, or any other artificial body of persons, all sums of money which may be due for labor performed or materials supplied and furnished in and about the performance of the work covered by the above mentioned contract, then this obligation shall be null and void; otherwise to remain in <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>full force and effect.” There was another bond for $1,000, of like import, by the same parties and for the same purpose.</p>
    <p id="b93-3" data-blocks='[["BL_93.4",93,[244,517,1149,1028]]]'>Miller performed the contract on his part and Gibbs made him various payments and finally, on December 1, 1926, gave him a sixty-day promissory note for $3,000, that being the approximate balance. To recover this balance, Miller brought the instant suit against Gibbs and the casualty company. Judgment was taken against Gibbs by default, but the casualty company filed an affidavit of defense setting up legal questions, one of which Avas that in his statement of claim, verified by his affidavit, plaintiff had averred, inter alia, and in effect, that the $3,000 note was taken as part payment of the balance due him. This, the surety urged, operated to release it from liability. The trial court suggested an amendment of the statement, which was made, averring that the note was taken as collateral security. Thereupon judgment for the defendant was refused and at the trial the court directed a verdict for plaintiff, upon which judgment was entered and this appeal by the casualty company followed.</p>

To establish that this was the fact, defendant at the trial offered plaintiff’s original statement of claim, and its rejection by the trial judge was error. A note, however, does not operate as payment of a prior indebtedness in the absence of an understanding to that effect, as to which the burden of proof is upon him who asserts it; here, upon the defendant: United States v. Hegeman, <a href="/pa/204/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="204 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="927534" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0438-01">204 Pa. 438</a>; Buck v.

Superior Ct. 84</a>; see also 50 C. J. 103. If, as the amended statement avers, the note was given merely as collateral, it did not operate as an extension of time to the principal for payment of the original claim, nor release the surety, for a creditor is not required to delay the collection of a debt, be<a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>cause collateral given as security therefor may not be presently payable: Buck v.

While capable of explanation, it was sufficient to make the question of whether the note was received in payment of the debt one for the jury. That the statements in a superseded pleading may be used as evidence against the party by whom they were made is undoubted. We expressly so hold in Hess v. Vinton Colliery Co., <a href="/pa/255/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="255 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1027666" data-case-paths="/pa/255/0078-01">255 Pa. 78</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=99%20A.%20218" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="99 A. 218">99 Atl. 218</a>; while in 22 C. J., page 337, the rule is stated that, “Although a pleading which has been withdrawn or stricken out or superseded by amendment is out of the case in its capacity as pleading, and the pleader is no longer concluded by it, statements therein may still be competent as admissions, when they are relevant to the issues in connection with which it is sought to introduce them.” See also 2 Wigmore on Evidence (2d edition), section 1067; Morrett v.
