On the 12th day of August, 1926, the defendant, Ebensburg Trust Company, purchased all the assets of the Cambria Title, Savings and Trust Company for the consideration of one dollar a share. On August 20, 1920, the plaintiff, together with Leo C. Kimball, I. E. Lewis and one John Denny, purchased from Eleanor G-. Park and Lewis Anderson Park the premises described in the plaintiff’s bill, known as “The Park Property.” Subsequently, John Denny conveyed his undivided one-fourth interest therein to T. Stanton Davis, the plaintiff in this case, who thereupon became the owner of an undivided one-half interest.</p>

Plaintiff further alleged in a petition (hereinafter referred to) to amend the bill that in 1925 the plaintiff procured a purchaser for another right of way through the described property for $14,000, and that subsequently, under date of May 19, 1927, Prindible made, executed and delivered a deed for the right of way to the grantee therein, and received the entire consideration for the same, and for this no account has been made to the plaintiff; that the defendants have refused to account to the plaintiff for the proceeds, amounting to $5,000, derived from a certain sale of another right of way over property owned by the plaintiff; that in September, 1930, the plaintiff received a statement from the defendant companies purporting to show his indebtedness to them but the statement is incorrect and plaintiff is unable to get from the-defendant companies any accurate account, of his indebtedness to either of them, as well as a list of his collateral.</p>

There is no allegation of mutual mistake or complicated accounts.......

There is no allegation that any money <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>was received by the Ebensburg Trust Company except tbe sum of $6,000, and this would not even cover the expenditures that the trust company has made in the interest of plaintiff’s property....... The bill not only does not set up any effort or willingness to reimburse the defendants, but, when the matter comes up at argument, the plaintiff, through his counsel, positively states that he has no such intention and will not make such an offer, and this in the face of an offer by counsel for the defendants that a reconveyance would be promptly made if they were made whole....... In our judgment there is nothing in the entire bill, originally and as amended, that gives this court any jurisdiction, or the plaintiff any right to the relief he seeks.”</p>
    <p id="b289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[168,1101,1154,963]]]'>We hold that the plaintiff made out a prima facie case entitling him to an accounting by the Ebensburg Trust Company for all moneys received from the sale of portions of plaintiff’s property described in the bill, including commissions payable to the plaintiff. The court below emphasized the failure of the plaintiff to pay any indebtedness that might be due from him to the Ebensburg Trust Company and his failure to offer to reimburse the trustee for the payment of moneys in acquiring the first mortgage, as well as the payment of the money at the sheriff’s sale. The plaintiff, if he was not able to ascertain what his indebtedness to the defendant company was, could make no such tender as the court below declared he should have made. The plaintiff’s course of dealing with the Cambria Title, Savings and Trust Company and the Ebensburg Trust Company covered a long period and included a large number of transactions.</p>

He avers that he obtained a purchaser for part of the Park property and that this purchaser paid to the Ebensburg Trust Company the sum of $6,000 for the property, and that he succeeded in getting a tenant for the hotel property which is a part of the Park property in order that the property might amount to a further asset to the Ebensburg Trust Company and the plaintiff’s indebtedness to the trust company be thereby further reduced.</p>

Judge Story has accurately stated the received doctrine on this subject: 1 Eq. Jur., section 506: ‘Liens also give rise to matters of account....... As no suit is maintainable at law for the property of the owner, until the lien is discharged, and as the nature and amount of the lien often are involved in great uncertainty, a resort to a court of equity to ascertain and adjust the account <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>seems, in many cases, absolutely indispensable for the purposes of justice....... Cases of pledges present a similar illustration, whenever they involve indefinite and unascertained charges and accounts.’ It is clear that without an account, as well of the items of charge as-of the dividends received in money and stock, the pledgor could not know what amount to tender, and this is an indispensable condition to his right to maintain any action at law. There are many precedents in the equity reports of bills to redeem the pledge and for an account under similar circumstances.”</p>

Jenkins et al., <a href="/pa/187/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="187 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="900317" data-case-paths="/pa/187/0440-01">187 Pa. 440</a>, at 444 et seq., the court said: “The bill clearly presented a case for the intervention of a court of equity for the preservation and protection of the rights of the parties, and a tender of the amount expended by Jenkins in the purchase of the property was not, under the circumstances, necessary to the maintenance of it....... The money intended to be used in payment of the arrears was invested by Jenkins in the purchase of the property, and although he claims to have an absolute title it is obvious that the plaintiff is entitled to a conveyance on reimbursing him for his expenditures, the amount of which is not made clear by his answers. In fact there is a material disagreement between the plaintiff and the defendants as to the amount due on her debt to the building and loan association, as to the amount advanced by Jenkins, and as to the amount furnished by her to him. A tender under such conditions is not required, or practicable....... In view of the aver-' ments and answers the learned court below, instead of dismissing the bill, should have investigated the accounts to determine the proper credits to be allowed for payment to the building and loan association, if any, and the amounts properly expended by Jenkins, and a decree should thereafter have been entered for the conveyance of the property to the plaintiff, conditioned <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>upon the payment by her of the amount found to be due to him, within a reasonable time fixed by the decree.”</p>
    <p id="b292-4" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[275,461,1149,970]]]'>The plaintiff in his bill made out no prima facie case of fraud against the defendant and pleaded no facts which would entitle him to any of the relief he prayed for except for that asked for in prayer (c), which was for an accounting of all moneys received from the sale of the portion of the plaintiff’s property, including commissions payable to the plaintiff. We would, however, reverse the decree dismissing the bill were it not for the fact that by supplemental record filed in this case it appears that on February 10,1931, the secretary of banking of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by virtue of the authority vested in him by act of assembly No. 316, approved June 15, 1923, has taken possession of the business and property of the Ebensburg Trust Company, defendant in this case, and has appointed an agent to assist the department of banking in continuing or liquidating the property and business of the Ebensburg Trust Company.</p>
