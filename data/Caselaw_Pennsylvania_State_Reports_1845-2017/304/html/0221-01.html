Eimmer was driving his Ford car west in Haverford Street, Philadelphia, it came in contact with the Buick car of the defendant, Edna F. Berger, headed north in Thirty-eighth Street. It is a right-angle intersection and as a result of the impact the course of the Eimmer car was deflected northerly against the north curb of Haverford Street, a short distance west of the west curb of Thirty-eighth Street, where it upset upon the sidewalk, striking and injuring Mary Hegarty, the wife plaintiff, and her four-year-old daughter, who at the moment were walking thereon. The evidence was conflicting as to the cause of the accident, but in support of the verdicts and judgments for the plaintiffs, from which defendant has appealed, we must assume the truth of that in their behalf and all inferences properly deducible therefrom: Mountain v. American W. G. Co., <a href="/pa/263/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="263 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1047493" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0181-01">263 Pa. 181</a>; Scalet v. Bell Telephone Co. of Pa., <a href="/pa/291/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="291 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1107235" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0451-01">291 Pa. 451</a>. So doing, it appears that Eimmer was driving his car carefully and at moderate speed along the northerly half of the thirty-four-foot cartway in Haverford Street, near the north rail of the single track street railway, located in the center thereof, as the defendant’s car, approaching from the south, stopped with its front near the south rail of the street car track. Then Eimmer, who had stopped his car near the east line of <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>Thirty-eighth Street, started forward in low gear and as he came opposite the Buick, it suddenly started forward, its bumper colliding with the side of his car, so that it (the bumper) was torn off by the impact, causing the accident. This recital is supported by the testimony of Rimmer and of his mother, Mrs. Robinson, who was with him, and also by that of an officer, to the effect that the defendant there stated she was nervous and started her car forward too soon. In addition, on a former trial, defendant had testified that she started forward after the front of the Ford had passed. For the defense there was evidence that the Buick car was standing at the time of the impact and that the Ford coming onto the intersection at high speed veered sharply to the left and forcibly collided with the bumper of the standing Buick, thereby causing the accident. This evidence as to high speed finds some support from the fact that the Ford ran forty or fifty feet after the collision and then tipped over on the sidewalk. On the other hand, it is not probable that Rimmer would deliberately turn his car so as to collide with the standing Buick, or that, if he did, the bumper of the latter would strike the center and not the left front corner of the Ford. The case, taken as a whole, was one for the jury, and binding instructions for the defendant could not have been given.</p>

See Robinson v. Berger, <a href="/pa/295/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="295 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="1115110" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0095-01">295 Pa. 95</a>. That being by other plaintiffs was not res judicata here. In addition, those verdicts may have rested on the ground of contributory negligence which is absent in the instant case. It may well be that negligence of the drivers of both cars joined in the accident, in which case, while one could not recover from the other, plaintiffs here, as innocent parties, could sue both or either: Hughes et ux. v.

    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.6",248,[310,798,1150,958]]]'>Defendant’s contention that the case became one of law because plaintiffs’ two main witnesses had testified differently on the trial of the other cases is untenable. The prior inconsistent statements or testimony of a witness may be shown to affect his credibility in the nature of impeachment, but it is still for the jury to say which is the truth. True, it has been held that the burden of proof is not met by the testimony of a witness so contradictory as to render any conclusion drawn therefrom a mere guess; but that rule applies only to testimony given on the present trial and not to statements made elsewhere even if under oath. Furthermore, the alleged conflicting statements in the instant case refer to the speed of the Ford and as to whether it stopped before crossing Thirty-eighth Street, matters of no controlling weight here, where the question is as to defendant’s negligence, on which their testimony was the' same at both trials.</p>
