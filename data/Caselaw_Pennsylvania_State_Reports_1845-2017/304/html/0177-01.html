The plaintiffs are residents of Prospect Park, Delaware County. The defendant is a corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing wire and metal products in a factory opposite the residences of the plaintiffs on Thirteenth Street. In this factory the defendant maintains furnaces in which oil and other fuels are burned. There are also hammers, cranes and other machinery and appliances. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant so operates these furnaces that there is discharged in the air, outside of said factory, smoke, offensive odors and a smudge which the plaintiffs and others are compelled to inhale, and this smudge enters the dwellings of the plaintiffs and soils and otherwise injures the furniture <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>and household goods, and the paint on houses, and destroys plants, shrubbery and other vegetation. The plaintiffs also claim that the cranes, machinery and appliances are so carelessly operated that there are loud noises and vibrations produced consisting of pots and other appliances knocking against each other. Plaintiffs aver that on account of these noises they are unable to enjoy the usual comforts of their dwellings, are unable to sleep, and are in various ways annoyed and injured.</p>

Plaintiffs claim that the Borough of Prospect Park is a residential section and was so recognized as such before the defendant’s factory was erected. It was shown at the trial that the four-track line of the Pennsylvania Railroad is within 150 yards of the plaintiffs’ homes and about 122 heavy freight and passenger trains pass through that section daily. Some of these trains are electrically operated and some are propelled by steam. These latter trains emit smoke and cause noise and vibration as they pass. There are also some other industrial plants, such as a coal and lumber yard and a mixing house of a paving company, in the vicinity of plaintiffs’ homes.</p>

It has been said that a “fair test as to whether a business lawful in itself, or a particular use of property, constitutes a nuisance, is the reasonableness or unreasonableness of conducting the business or making the use of the property complained of in the particular locality and in the <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>manner and under the circumstances of the case”: 46 C. J. 655. It has also been said: “Whether the use is reasonable generally depends upon many and varied facts. No hard and fast rule controls the subject. A use that would be reasonable under one set of facts might be unreasonable under another. What is reasonable is sometimes a question of law, and at other times, a question of fact. No one particular fact is conclusive, but the inference is to be drawn from all the facts proved whether the controlling fact exists that the use is unreasonable” : 46 C. J. 656. No word is used more frequently in discussing cases of this kind than the word “reasonable,” and no word is less susceptible of exact definition. What is reasonable under one set of circumstances is unreasonable under another. Custom itself has much to do with determining what is reasonable. Noises which in the preindustrial era would have been considered intolerably unreasonable are now tolerated as reasonable. The noise and smoke of railroad trains frequently passing human habitations is not now considered unreasonable, although an equal amount of 'noise and smoke would doubtless at an earlier time have been considered so. That a certain amount of smoke, fumes, gases and noises will necessarily be produced and emitted by manufacturing plants is inevitable, but that persons who dwell near such plants, like persons who dwell near railroads or on busy city streets, must put up with a certain amount of resulting annoyance and discomfort is self-evident. The prosperity of an industrial community depends on its industrial activities and it would be inconsistent with sound public policy to prohibit these activities at the behest of a comparatively few who are annoyed thereby. Every form of industrial activity has its disagreeable factors. Industries, like individuals, have “the defects of their qualities.” In mining and manufacturing communities people must expect that their homes will be more difficult to keep clean than if they lived in an agri<a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>cultural community. A certain amount of noise also is inseparable from industrial activity. Tbe burdens of prosperity must be taken with its benefits.</p>

Its aid is not of right but of grace, and it must be sure that the exercise of this kingly power is just, wise and proper, before it takes from a citizen his means of livelihood, and destroys the value of his property for legitimate uses. And more than this, it must look at the customs of the people, the characteristics of their business, the common uses of property and the peculiar circumstances of the place wherein it is called upon to exercise the power. In no other way can its justice, wisdom and propriety be exhibited in adjudicating upon the rights, interests and employment of the people subjected to its power. ...... The properties of the plaintiff and defendant lie adjoining each other, on the hillside overlooking the city [Pittsburgh], whose every-day cloud of smoke from thousands of chimneys and stacks hangs like a pall over it, obscuring it from sight. This single word describes the characteristics of this city, its kind of fuel, its business, the habits of its people and the industries which give it prosperity and wealth. The people who live in such a city or within its sphere of influence do so of choice, and they voluntarily subject themselves to its peculiarities and its discomforts, for the greater benefit they think they derive from their residence or their business there.”</p>

In a manufacturing district of this city the appellee has established its furnaces and is engaged in an important and lawful business. The appellants, in a residential portion of the same city, close by this manufacturing district, own houses in which their tenants live. So situated, they must expect a measure of annoyance and discomfort, arising from the dust and smoke, which cannot be avoided in their manufacturing metropolis, and are borne to the homes of the city and fill the air that is breathed. To this general annoyance and discomfort appellants submitted for years without complaint, and they were bound to do so, for .they chose to erect their houses not only in sight of great manufacturing plants, ¡but within certain reach of the smoke and dust, without which the fires of the furnaces and factories could not burn.”</p>

There was no prayer in the bill for the restraint imposed upon defendant in these paragraphs. The language of Justice Brown of this court in Spangler Brewing Co. v. McHenry, <a href="/pa/242/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="242 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="998928" data-case-paths="/pa/242/0522-01">242 Pa. 522</a>, at 528, may be pertinently quoted in respect to these paragraphs of the decree; “In an<a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>swer to what prayer was it made? Proceedings in equity may be elastic, but there is a limit to their elasticity. They are not to be stretched to give relief from a specific wrong not averred in a bill of complaint or to make a decree not in conformity to its prayers.” If the plaintiffs had prayed for the enjoining of the operations of the defendant’s manufacturing plant betwee'n the hours of 9 p. m. and 6 a. m. and on Sundays, these paragraphs of the decree could be sustained as reasonable. A due regard for the rights of the plaintiffs and others in the neighborhood might well prompt the defendant to discontinue the operation of its plant at night and on Sundays. Smoke and noises to which one must accustom himself during the daytime and on week days may become so intolerable at nighttime and on Sundays as to be adjudged nuisances. As was said in Gilbough v. West Side Amusement Co., <a href="/nj-eq/64/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="64 N.J. Eq. 27" data-case-ids="193626" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/64/0027-01">64 N. J.

It is obvious that smoke, odors, gases, smudge and noises injuriously affect a person’s reasonable enjoyment and comfort of a home within an area subjected to these annoyances. However, every per<a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>son dwelling in an industrial community, and particularly near industrial plants, must to some extent bear the annoyance and injury of smoke, odors, gases, smudge and noises. If defendant must so operate and conduct its business that these things will not issue from its plant and buildings at any time to injuriously affect the plaintiffs in their health and comfort, the defendant cannot operate its plant at all, for it would be a physical impossibility to operate the plant and at the same time comply with the court’s decree. The utmost protection the plaintiffs are entitled to from smoke, odors, gases, smudge and noises from the defendant’s plant is from these things in amounts that are unnecessary and unreasonable under the circumstances. If the defendant’s plant is emitting more of these annoying things than other plants in the same business and of equal output are emitting, there is something wrong with the equipment and management of the defendant’s plant and the smoke, odors, gases, smudge and noises are unnecessary and unreasonable. If devices or more efficient management which would reduce the smoke, odors, gases, smudge and noises and vibrations issuing from its plant are available to the defendant at a reasonable expense, it is the duty of the defendant to secure such devices or management, and if it fails to do so, the smoke, noises, etc., emitting from its plant may be regarded as unnecessary and unreasonable.</p>
    <p id="b209-3" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[174,1817,1151,532]]]'>Paragraph (d) of the decree enjoins the defendant from “working and operating said furnaces, tools, machinery and appliances of a noisy character at any time unless inside the buildings all windows and doors on the Thirteenth Avenue side, including the ventilator on the same side, are securely closed.” This part of the decree appears to be reasonably warranted by the facts of the case. The defendant company ought to be able to ventilate its plant without opening the windows and doors on the side fronting the residences of the plaintiffs.</p>

In a case like the present where the annoyance arises from the conduct of a business which is not a nuisance per se, a strong effort should be made to conserve the rights of all the properties; and an important question is, Can the noise by any reasonable means be so moderated as to accord with the degree of quietness the plaintiff has a right to enjoy; and, if it can, by what means? ...... The testimony suggests and is sufficient to sustain the further finding that the disturbance of the standard of comfort normally prevailing in the neighborhood of the plaintiff’s residence, and the consequent annoyance to the plaintiff, are caused by the defendant’s permitting the use of tools and apparatus of a noisy character on its premises outside of its buildings; by their use inside of certain of its buildings with the windows and doors open; and at times by the use of such tools and apparatus until late in the evenings. On this finding, a definite decree can be entered enjoining the defendant from operating tools, machines or apparatus of a noisy character between certain hours, and requiring it to carry on all such operations on the inside of buildings with windows securely closed and with the doors shut. This decree will probably afford the relief required. At least such a measure of relief should be first tried before the entry of a decree that may mean the closing of the defendant’s works, the ruin of a prosperous business, and the loss of employment to many men.” In that case the decree entered by the court below was modified and the defend<a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>ant and its employees were restrained “from working its plant in such a manner as to create the nuisance complained of, and to that end they are enjoined from operating drills, power hammers, power chippers, riveting machines or other tools, machines or apparatus of a noisy character between the hours of 7 p. m. and 7 a. m.; and from operating such tools, machines and apparatus of a noisy character at any time unless on the inside of buildings with all windows securely closed with double sash, and with the doors shut.”</p>
    <p id="b211-3" data-blocks='[["BL_211.4",211,[199,885,1149,648]]]'>In the second case cited (Quinn v. Am. Steel Spring &amp; Mfg. Co.), this court held that a defendant engaged in manufacturing iron and steel springs should be required, within such reasonable time as the court below shall direct, to so relocate and install their heavy machinery, as to cause a minimum of injury to plaintiff and his property, consistent with the reasonable operation of the plant; that, if they did not do so within the time specified, they should be enjoined from operating the machinery until they did. For the proper determination of these matters, leave was given to produce further evidence, if desired by the court or either party.</p>
    <p id="b211-4" data-blocks='[["BL_211.5",211,[197,1543,1149,744]]]'>The present case presents a situation that ought to be worked out by all the parties in interest by each party making mutual concessions. Defendant’s manufacturing plant should not be so restricted in its operation by the court’s decree that it cannot operate at all. On the other hand, the executive officers of the defendant company ought to avail themselves of every known device that can be secured at a reasonable expense, and. of the utmost thoughtfulness, care and effort to reduce to a minimum the offensive emanations from .this plant. If the defendant does not do this, if it shows a callous disregard for the comfort and well-being of the people dwelling in that vicinity, it will invite a drastic injunctive decree.</p>

This is a question that can be determined only by consideration of all the attendant facts. Defendant is entitled to operate its plant, as the near-by railroad is entitled to operate its trains, but the plaintiffs are entitled to have that plant so operated as to cause them the minimum of discomfort and annoyance obtainable by the employment of such effective devices and efficient management as are fairly available.</p>
