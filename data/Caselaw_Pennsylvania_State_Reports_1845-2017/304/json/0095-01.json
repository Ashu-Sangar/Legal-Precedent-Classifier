The non-suit was based on plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence in failing to observe the moving car coming from Vine Street and practically on him at the time he stepped from the sidewalk. Plaintiff\u2019s own uncontradicted testimony establishes the fact that had he looked before stepping from a place of safety into the roadway he must have seen the approaching automobile. This he failed to do. We find no abuse of discretion in the refusal of the court below to take off the nonsuit.\nThe order of the court below is affirmed.",
