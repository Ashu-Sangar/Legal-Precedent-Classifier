        "text": "Per Curiam,\nAnna Byer, a widow, died October 7, 1926, intestate, without issue. Letters of administration were granted to Ida Goldstein. At the audit of her account, Samuel Archess, appellant, objected to distribution of decedent\u2019s estate to her nieces and nephews, the persons entitled under the intestate laws, and claimed ownership of the entire assets of the estate as listed in the account, under an alleged gift causa mortis.\nThe circumstances under which the alleged gift was made are as follows: Two days before her death in the Lankenau Hospital, Philadelphia, Mrs. Byer was seized with a heart attack on the street and brought by neighbors into appellant\u2019s house near by, where she boarded. Physicians advised the patient\u2019s removal to a hospital. She consented to be taken to Lankenau Hospital, insisting, however, on first visiting her room, where she secured an envelope which she handed appellant, stating that, if she did not come back, it would be his, that he should take care of her, and assuring the doctor that appellant would pay Ms bill. A number of witnesses testified to these facts; we find no evidence, however, as to the contents of the envelope, except that it contained \u201cpapers.\u201d The orphans\u2019 court, upon petition of decedent\u2019s administratrix, ordered appellant to deliver to petitioner specified securities and other personal property. Appellant contends the securities and property so obtained by the administratrix were in the envelope given him by decedent at the time she left his house for the hospital. The court found there was no proof that the properties claimed by appellant and now included in the inventory and appraisement were in the envelope handed appellant; the record discloses evidence to sustain the finding. The court below was correct in holding this to be a vital bar to appellant\u2019s title to the securities and other property he now claims as a gift causa mortis. Appellant\u2019s claim must be rejected for lack of sufficient evidence to support it. Discussion of the other questions raised on this appeal becomes unnecessary.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed; costs to be paid out of the estate.",
