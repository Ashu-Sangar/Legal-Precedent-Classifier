        "text": "CASTILLE, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI agree with the majority that the Department of Transportation (PennDot) is liable in this matter and I concur in the per curiam Order affirming the Commonwealth Court on that issue. However, I believe that the City of Philadelphia (\u201cCity\u201d) also bears liability in this matter under the relevant immunity provision. Consequently, I dissent from the majority\u2019s per curiam Order insofar as it affirms the Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that the City is not liable in this matter.\nAppellee, Connie Slough, initiated the instant action against the City of Philadelphia and PennDot, alleging that on October 11, 1991, she fell on a defective concrete median island on Bustleton Avenue, which is located within the City limits. Appellee contended that the City and/or PennDot bore responsibility for maintaining the median. Compulsory arbitration resulted in an award of $ 18,000 in favor of appellee and against PennDot only. PennDot appealed that decision whereupon, by stipulation of the parties, a bench trial was held. The trial court found in favor of appellee, and against both PennDot and the City. Specifically, the trial court found PennDot liable for $16,000 and the City liable for $2,000. In a published opinion, the Commonwealth Court affirmed that part of the trial court\u2019s order finding PennDot liable, but reversed that part of the trial court\u2019s order finding the City liable.\nIn determining that the City was not liable, the Commonwealth Court looked to the Governmental Immunity Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8541 et seq. The Act provides that the City is liable for a dangerous condition of, inter alia, \u201ctraffic signs, lights or other traffic controls.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(4)(emphasis added). At issue here is whether the median may properly be deemed a \u201ctraffic control\u201d under the Act. For the following reasons, I believe that the median may properly be deemed a \u201ctraffic control\u201d and that the Commonwealth Court erred by concluding otherwise.\nThe phrase \u201ctraffic control\u201d is not defined in the Act; therefore, the phrase must be construed in accordance with its plain meaning. See Southco., Inc. v. Concord Twshp., 552 Pa. 66, 713 A.2d 607, 609 (1998); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 542 Pa. 568, 578, 669 A.2d 315, 321 (1995). \u201cControl\u201d is defined as the \u201cpower to direct or regulate;\u201d and \u201cthe condition of being directed or restrained.\u201d Webster\u2019s Second New World Dictionary (1986). \u201cTraffic\u201d is defined as \u201cthe movement ... of automobiles along a street.\u201d Id. Thus, a \u201ctraffic control\u201d is something which directs, regulates or restrains the movement of automobiles along a street. By separating the lanes of opposing traffic on a divided highway, a median regulates and restrains the movement of automobiles along that highway. Therefore, a median is manifestly a \u201ctraffic control.\u201d\nFurthermore, although the Act itself does not define the phrase \u201ctraffic control,\u201d the phrase \u201cofficial traffic control devices\u201d is defined as follows in section 102 of the Vehicle Code \u201csignals, markings and devices ... for the purpose of regulating, warning or guiding traffic.\u201d Although \u201cdevice\u201d is not defined with further specificity, the word is commonly understood to mean \u201ca thing devised [worked out or created]; a plan or scheme.\u201d Webster\u2019s Second New World Dictionary (1986). Since a median is a thing which is \u201cdevised\u201d (or \u201ccreated\u201d) for the purpose of regulating and guiding traffic, the foregoing definition of \u201cofficial traffic control devices\u201d lends further support to the conclusion that a median is a \u201ctraffic control\u201d for purposes of the Governmental Immunity Act. See Eastern Investment Co. v. Bd. of Finance and Revenue, 531 Pa. 510, 513, 614 A.2d 223, 225 (1992) (in interpreting the phrase at issue, this Court looked to definitions contained in other code provisions when the relevant Act did not provide the definition).\nThe Commonwealth Court, in applying the axiom that exceptions to governmental immunity shall be narrowly construed, determined that \u201ca median or island is a \u2018traffic control\u2019 in only the broadest sense of the term, acting merely as a means of keeping one lane of travel from running into another.\u201d Slough v. City of Phila., 686 A.2d 62, 65 (Pa.Commw.1996). I agree that exceptions to governmental immunity must be narrowly construed. Kilgore v. City of Phila., 553 Pa. 22, 717 A.2d 514 (1998) (Castille, J., dissenting); Mickle v. City of Phila., 550 Pa. 539, 707 A.2d 1124, 1127 (Pa.1998) (Castille, J., dissenting); Jones v. Chieffo, 549 Pa. 46, 54, 700 A.2d 417, 421 (1997) (Castille, J., dissenting). However, I am puzzled by the Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that a median is a traffic control only in the \u201cbroadest\u201d sense of the term. This seems to imply that there is a narrower understanding of the phrase \u201ctraffic control\u201d under which a median would be excluded. However, the Commonwealth Court does not explain what this narrower sense of the phrase might be. Given the foregoing definitions, I fail to see how a median could ever be anything but a \u201ctraffic control,\u201d even under the most narrow possible construction of \u201ctraffic control.\u201d Consequently, I am constrained to disagree with the conclusion reached by the Commonwealth Court that the City of Philadelphia is not liable in this matter, and to dissent from this Court\u2019s per curiam affirmance of the Commonwealth Court on that issue.",
