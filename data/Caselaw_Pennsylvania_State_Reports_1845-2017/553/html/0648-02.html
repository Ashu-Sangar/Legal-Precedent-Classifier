On the morning of September 29, 1994, Gibson sought to obtain an automobile, as his car had recently broken down. He asked a friend, Sean Hess, for $200 so that he could purchase a new vehicle. When <a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>Hess refused, Gibson spoke of “making a move,” meaning that he would commit a robbery.</p>
    <p id="b835-4" data-blocks='[["BL_835.4",835,[183,412,1154,634]]]'>At approximately noon on that same day, Gibson went to an automobile dealership in Bristol Township to look for a replacement vehicle. Although he expressed an interest in purchasing a vehicle that was shown to him by salesman Glen Kashdan, he did not have the necessary funds. He told Kashdan, however, that his mother maintained sufficient funds in a bank account in Bristol Borough to pay for the vehicle. After Kashdan drove Gibson to the bank in a fruitless effort to withdraw the non-existent funds, he dropped Gibson off at a shopping center in Bristol Township, about one mile from the eventual scene of the crime. Gibson was wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and jeans.</p>
    <p id="b835-5" data-blocks='[["BL_835.5",835,[185,1071,1154,305]]]'>Melissa Paolini, who worked at the bank where Kashdan had taken Gibson, observed the two men enter the bank at approximately 1:15 p.m. Gibson’s picture was taken by the bank’s monitor camera and was later identified by Paolini at trial. The picture clearly depicted Gibson wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt.</p>
    <p id="b835-6" data-blocks='[["BL_835.6",835,[186,1408,1153,366]]]'>Shortly before 2:00 p.m., Gibson met Paulinda Moore, a long-time acquaintance, in the shopping center. Gibson showed Moore a handgun that was tucked into the waistband of his pants and stated that he needed money and was going to rob somebody. He added that if his prospective victim saw his face, he would shoot him. Gibson and Moore then parted company and Gibson continued on foot to Bristol Borough.</p>

At 2:20 p.m., Gibson entered a jewelry store. Leonard Wilson, the store’s proprietor, became suspicious of Gibson when he noticed that Gibson appeared to be observing the store itself, rather than looking <a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>at jewelry. After a brief conversation with Wilson, Gibson left the store.</p>

The last time that Rankins observed Gibson that day, he was wearing a dark blue sweatshirt and was approximately twenty-five feet away from the entrance of Ascher Health, walking towards it.</p>
    <p id="b836-6" data-blocks='[["BL_836.5",836,[254,810,1162,797]]]'>Shortly before 3:00 p.m., Michael Segal, a shopkeeper at a store directly across the street from Ascher Health, heard a gunshot from inside Ascher Health. Segal looked across the street and saw Robert Berger, the proprietor of Ascher Health, struggling with an assailant behind the store counter. When Segal observed that the assailant had a gun, he dialed “911.” While on the telephone, he heard two more gunshots. He looked across the street and saw Berger lying on the floor while the assailant rifled through the cash register drawers. Segal then observed the assailant leave the store, stuffing items into his pants, and walk up Mill Street towards an apartment building. Segal was unable to see the assailant’s face, but he did observe that the man was wearing a dark blue hooded sweatshirt. Segal later testified at trial that the man’s size, build and complexion matched those of Gibson.</p>

He saw Gibson, whom he positively identified at trial, leaving Ascher Health and walking toward him while stuffing an object that appeared to be a handgun into his pants. Upon seeing Colon, Gibson crossed Mill Street and headed in a different direction.</p>
    <p id="b836-8" data-blocks='[["BL_836.7",836,[251,2027,1162,311]],["BL_837.1",837,[195,315,1155,367]]]'>At 2:58 p.m., the police responded to Segal’s call. They entered Ascher Health and found Berger lying dead on the floor from gunshot wounds. A cash drawer was open and there was an empty gun holster on the floor. Berger was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital at approximately 3:45 p.m. An autopsy revealed that he had suffered three <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>gunshot wounds: a fatal wound to the left chest, a wound to the upper right chest, and a wound to the upper left arm. Two .32 caliber projectiles were removed from the body. It was later determined that approximately $1,400 in cash had been stolen during the robbery, along with a .38 caliber handgun belonging to Berger. There was no evidence that Berger’s gun had been fired during the robbery.</p>
    <p id="b837-4" data-blocks='[["BL_837.4",837,[197,708,1155,530]]]'>Shortly after 3:00 p.m. on the day of the shooting, Gibson arrived at the home of his cousin, Pamela Harrison. When Harrison responded to Gibson’s knock on her door, she observed that he was wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and was sweating. Harrison also heard police sirens. Gibson asked to come into the house and Harrison admitted him, noticing that he was carrying a handgun. After hiding his sweatshirt in Harrison’s basement, Gibson left the house. He returned later that evening and retrieved the sweatshirt without Harrison’s permission.</p>
    <p id="b837-5" data-blocks='[["BL_837.5",837,[197,1265,1154,257]]]'>After leaving Harrison’s house, Gibson met his friend, Sean Hess, in the shopping center where Gibson had been earlier that day. Gibson told Hess that he had shot a man three times and taken his money. Gibson also stated that the victim had a gun, but that he had used his own gun.</p>
    <p id="b837-6" data-blocks='[["BL_837.6",837,[196,1549,1154,574]]]'>The following day, while at a bar, Gibson admitted to Bernard McClean that he had shot the old man in Bristol three times, explaining that he had been broke and needed the man’s money. He later told his friends, Herman Carroll and Eddie Jones, that he had robbed and killed the victim. He also told Edward Gilbert, another friend, that he had killed the victim to obtain money with which to purchase a vehicle. He gave Gilbert the .32 caliber handgun, along with Berger’s .38 caliber handgun, to keep for him. Berger’s gun was later recovered at a motel in Bristol Township, but Gibson’s gun was never located.</p>

Shortly thereafter, Gibson and some other individuals came out of the apartment. Gibson approached the detectives and asked them if they wished to speak with him. In response to Gibson’s inquiry, the detectives told him that they wished to talk to him about a murder that had occurred on Mill Street on September 29, 1994. Gibson asked if he was under arrest and the officers replied that he was not. They suggested, however, that Gibson speak with them at the Bristol Borough Police Station, since there were other people nearby. The detectives made it clear that Gibson could proceed to the station by his own transportation, that he would be free to leave the station at any time, and that he could terminate the conversation whenever he wished. Gibson acquiesced and followed them to the police station in his own vehicle, which he had purchased the day after the shooting.</p>
    <p id="b838-5" data-blocks='[["BL_838.4",838,[253,1177,1164,896]]]'>Upon arriving at the police station, the detectives led Gibson to an interview room, where another detective and a Bristol Borough police officer joined them. Gibson was again advised that he was not under arrest and could leave the station at any time. When the detectives told Gibson that they wanted to discuss the robbery and murder of Berger, he indicated that he wanted to clear the matter up and would speak with them. The interview lasted for a little over two hours, during which Gibson not only denied any culpability for the shooting, but also denied having been in Bristol Borough at any time after August 2, 1994. Following the interview, Gibson agreed to a search of his vehicle and signed a consent form. During the search, Gibson initiated a conversation with one of the detectives, asking him a hypothetical question regarding what would happen if someone were attacked by a man with a gun and shot and killed his attacker. Gibson then left the police station in his vehicle.</p>

Bail was denied, and while Gibson was incarcerated pending trial, he admitted to inmates Glenn Pollard, Kenneth Johnson and Kevin Jones that he had com<a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>mitted the crimes. Prior to trial, Gibson moved to suppress his statements to the police during the October 2, 1994 interview, as well as the statement that he made to the detective during the search of his car. The motion was denied following a hearing, and the case proceeded to trial.</p>
    <p id="b839-5" data-blocks='[["BL_839.4",839,[199,633,1154,538]]]'>During the guilt phase of trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of the numerous witnesses who had seen or spoken with Gibson either immediately before or after the shooting, including the testimony of those witnesses to whom Gibson had inculpated himself. Additionally, several detectives and police officers testified for the Commonwealth concerning their observations of the crime scene, the collection of evidence, and the statements that Gibson made during the course of his interview, as well as his hypothetical question concerning the shooting.</p>
    <p id="b839-6" data-blocks='[["BL_839.5",839,[198,1213,1153,481]]]'>Gibson presented five witnesses whose testimony supported his alibi defense and contradicted the testimony of certain inmates who had testified concerning his inculpatory statements. Gibson also took the stand and testified that he was not on Mill Street on the afternoon of the murder, but did admit that he had been with Kashdan, the car salesman, at the bank in Bristol Borough earlier that day. Gibson further admitted that he had lied to the police concerning his whereabouts on the day of the murder.</p>

The trial proceeded to the penalty phase, during which the Commonwealth introduced evidence in support of two aggravating circumstances: perpetration of the homicide during the commission of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), and a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9). The Commonwealth moved to incorporate the trial record to establish the fact that the homieide was committed during the perpetration of a felony, and the trial court granted the motion.</p>

      <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>In support of the second aggravating circumstance, the Commonwealth introduced evidence of two prior robbery convictions, three prior burglary convictions, and a prior aggravated assault conviction. All of the burglary convictions involved residences.</p>
    <p id="b840-5" data-blocks='[["BL_840.4",840,[257,613,1160,581]]]'>Gibson presented four witnesses who testified concerning mitigating factors. Gibson’s father, John Gibson, testified that Gibson had been neglected as a child and that Gibson’s mother had been an alcoholic. Dr. Allan Tepper, a forensic psychologist, also testified concerning Gibson’s childhood and stated that, in his opinion, Gibson suffered from mental and emotional retardation and had problems with impulse control. Charlene Walker, a neighbor of Gibson’s, testified that Gibson had always treated her respectfully. LaSondra Williams, a former paramour of Gibson’s, testified that aside from a few arguments, Gibson had treated her well.</p>

The jury found one mitigating circumstance: the evidence of Gibson’s character and record and the circumstances of his offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). Finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstance, the ■ jury returned a verdict that Gibson be sentenced to death.</p>

Moreover, prior to the shooting, Gibson told a friend that he was going to rob “a guy that had money” and kill him if necessary, and after the shooting he admitted to several friends and fellow inmates that he had shot the victim. Thus, the evidence in this case is clearly sufficient to support the conviction of first-degree murder, and we now turn to the issues raised by Gibson in this appeal.</p>
