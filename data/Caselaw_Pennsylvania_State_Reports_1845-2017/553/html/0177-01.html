He was promoted to system load dispatcher in March of 1985 and continued in that position until December 1990. As a system load dispatcher, Werner oversaw the operation of Met-Ed’s electrical system, including the scheduling of generation and loading of transmission and distribution lines and substations.</p>
    <p id="b359-12" data-blocks='[["BL_359.12",359,[194,1657,1156,472]]]'>Werner’s work schedule throughout his employment history typically consisted of rotating shifts. The shifts consisted of three time periods: 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., and 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. (the midnight shift). As a system load dispatcher, he worked rotating shifts set on a six-week rotation pattern. A shift differential in pay was built into Werner’s salary, so that he received a base rate of pay plus an additional amount per hour for the second shift, the midnight shift and Sundays.</p>

Werner began to experience sleeping problems, diarrhea and headaches in September of 1988. He found that the headaches were more severe during and after the midnight shift, although there was less activity required for the job during that shift.</p>

Werner encouraged his fellow dispatchers to request that the schedule be changed. Met-Ed conducted a shift-work survey and held several meetings among the dispatchers to determine whether the- dispatchers themselves could decide on an alternative to rotating shifts. In June of 1990, the dispatchers decided that the existing rotating shift schedule was the most effective and best way to operate the schedule, and Met-Ed maintained the schedule as before.</p>
    <p id="b360-5" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[248,1156,1163,744]]]'>After that consensus was reached by the dispatchers, Werner voluntarily quit his position as a system load dispatcher on December 10, 1990 and took a day shift janitorial position with Met-Ed at a lesser rate of pay. Two weeks later, he bid into another job as a utility man second class, which paid $12.73 per hour. Werner later filed a claim petition seeking benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 1 et seq., alleging that the cumulative physical stress of performing rotating shift work for 21 years resulted in diarrhea, headaches and digestive problems which prevented him from performing his prior occupation of system load supervisor. He sought partial disability benefits from December 10, 1990, based upon the reduction in his rate of pay after quitting his job as a system load dispatcher.</p>

Werner testified that his probléms had not interfered with his ability to perform his job, and that he had not missed any time from work between <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>September 1988 and December 9, 1990 because of his problems.

Dr. Richardson stated that research suggests there are “no real night people,” merely a variation among individuals’ abilities to adapt. He considered the age of an individual to be a relevant factor, with the prevalence of shift work maladaptation syndrome increasing with age. Dr. Richardson observed, however, that no data was available to predict who would be able to adapt to working at night and who would be unable to adapt.</p>

The current definition expanded the concept of injury which existed prior to the 1972 amendment of the Act. Prior to the amendment, benefits were provided only for injury or death resulting from an “accident” in the course of employment; the term “injury” was defined “to mean only violence to the physical structure of the body, and such disease or infection as naturally resulted] therefrom.” 77 P.S. §§ 1, 411 (1915) (amended 1972).</p>

This direction does no more than state that an injury is an injury. Although the 1972 amendment effectively categorizes the circumstances under which an injury is compensable, the word “injury” itself is given no express statutory meaning, as it had prior to the 1972 revision. Thus, just as under the original 1915 Act the courts had to give meaning to the undefined term “accident,” ... so must the courts now define the meaning of the term “injury” in section 301(c)(1).

On appeal to this Court, the employer argued that the claimant’s right to receive worker’s compensation for the aggravation of his asthmatic condition by irritants in the work environment required proof that the incidence of aggravation was substantially greater in his occupation than in the general population.

In its inception, a compensable injury under the Act required proof of an accident, of violence to the physical structure of the body, or disease or infection that naturally <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>resulted therefrom. The concept was later expanded so as to include injuries that were outside the scope of the pre-1972 version of the Act, such as injuries sustained because of exposure to hazardous or toxic conditions of the workplace, aggravation of pre-existing conditions resulting in physical injuries and work-related psychic injuries. The current version of the statute, however, does not define injury to include physical ailments that arise from normal working conditions such as eight-hour shifts.</p>
    <p id="b367-4" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[203,824,1156,799]]]'>Normal working conditions, in the nature of scheduling an employee to work a night shift, are not injuries for purposes of the Act merely because an employee undergoes physical or psychic reactions to those conditions. Although it is undisputed that Werner suffered from headaches, diarrhea and sleep loss, triggered by exposure to sunlight after working the midnight shift, the inquiry must focus upon whether the cause or stimulus of the physical complaints is an injury. Otherwise, all physical complaints would be considered injuries—an approach that has been rejected in psychic injury cases where the claimant suffered from physical ailments, as well as psychic problems in response to normal working conditions. Because Werner failed to establish that he sustained an injury under the Act, he may not recover partial disability benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
