Crawford and remanding the case for a new trial. Crawford was convicted by a jury of second degree murder arising from the death of Pearl Altman in October of 1971. The Superior Court determined that the trial judge had erred in excluding expert testimony of a psychiatrist regarding repressed memory sought to be introduced by defense coun<a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>sel.

An autopsy performed by the Allegheny County Coroner’s Office indicated that the cause of Altman’s death was drowning and that Altman had sustained head injuries, multiple contusions and abrasions. No arrest was made in connection with the death until John Reed contacted the police more than twenty years later to report that he had witnessed the events leading to the drowning. Reed identified Franklin Crawford as the individual who was responsible for Altman’s death. Crawford was subsequently arrested and charged with multiple offenses in connection with the homicide.</p>

He also claims to remember seeing the whites of Ms. Altman’s eyes as she rested in the arms of Mr. Crawford just before he cast her into the river. He assumed she was either dying or dead at that moment. The trigger to this “flashback” is alleged by Mr. Reed to have occurred near an IGA market in Leech-burg, Pennsylvania, when he saw a woman who [sic] appearance was exactly the same as Pearl May Altman’s. ... [M]y history, which was taken in great detail, estimates this <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>delay began between 1989 and 1991 or between 3 and 5 years previously. During this time Mr. Reed describes a number of dream-like phenomena that reaffirmed to him the truth of his experience of seeing Ms. Altman in the process of being murdered in October 1971. For the most part, these phenomena consisted of hallucinatory visions or voices where Pearl May urged Mr. Reed that he must tell the truth and reveal his long suppressed knowledge and thereby obtain justice for her murder by Frank Crawford. Mr. Reed told me during and after his flashbacks and his visualizations of Pearl May he became quite emotionally upset, each time asserting that he was certain Frank Crawford had done what he had come to remember these past 1 1/2 to 5 years.</blockquote>

It cannot be emphasized enough that, not only is Mr. Reed likely to be wrong but his memory inaccurate and his hallucination of Pearl May decidedly pathological. Moreover, the large majority of repressed memories occurring more than 10 years from a single, acute event are usually wrong. It is my opinion to a high degree of medical certainty that Mr. Reed’s return of the repressed should not be used as evidence of murder, because there is more than reasonable doubt this it [sic] is wrong.</blockquote>

In a pretrial conference with the trial judge, defense counsel asked that Dr. Himmelhoch’s report be treated as an offer of proof as to what the psychiatrist would testify to if called as a witness. The Commonwealth objected to the expert testimony, asserting that it would invade the province of the jury to determine the credibility of a witness. Defense counsel conceded that Dr. Himmelhoch’s opinion as to Reed’s credibility was inadmissible, but argued that portions of his report ad<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>dressed matters that were not within the common knowledge of the jury.

Officer Carley testified that he had seen Altman outside of a local bar between 11:00 p.m. and midnight on Friday, October 21, 1971, while he was patrolling in a police car. He testified that Altman was with Crawford at that time.</p>

The bridge was located on Market Street, the same street on which Officer Carley had seen the two of them. Reed knew Altman because he used to live across the street from her; he also knew Crawford through his association with Crawford’s brother.</p>

He testified that Altman said that she was afraid of Crawford, and that he reassured her that she did not have to fear Crawford, whose family he knew. Reed testified that she calmed down, but then Crawford jumped up and told him, “If she don’t give me what I want, I’m going to kill the bitch.” Reed thought the threat was not genuine.</p>

Reed followed them to borrow another cigarette. The next time Reed saw them, Altman was seated with her back against a concrete wall with her legs sticking straight out. He noticed that her eyes were “real big.” Crawford, who was sitting or squatting by Altman, jumped up when Reed approached. Reed testified that he ran from the park, but turned to look back. When he looked back, Reed saw Crawford throw Altman into the water.</p>

He testified that he kept saying to himself that nobody was going to believe him and that they were going to blame him for it because he was always in trouble downtown.</p>
    <p id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.4",382,[228,631,1158,467]]]'>Reed did not talk to anyone about that evening until twenty years later. He claimed never to have thought about what happened, stating, “I didn’t even know it existed,” and “I just thought it never happened.” Reed further testified that in 1990 or 1991, he and his wife were at a grocery store when he noticed a girl in the parking lot whom he told his wife he knew. Reed told her the girl was “a Cravener girl,” meaning Pearl. His wife informed him that she knew the girl and that she was someone else.</p>
    <p id="b382-6" data-blocks='[["BL_382.5",382,[229,1130,1158,367]]]'>Reed also testified that he remembered waking up one night and seeing what appeared to be a mist.

Mrs. Crawford testified that they were married in 1967 and were divorced in 1973. At the time of the incident, the Crawfords lived on a street which ran parallel to North Water Street. Mrs. Crawford stated that, on the Friday evening when Altman drowned, her husband had come home late, changed his clothes, put them in the washer, and told her that if anybody came looking for him that she did not see him. Her husband did not stay long, but returned later that night. She commented that it was not typical for Crawford to wash his clothes.</p>

We concluded that these matters went to the credibility of the child who was the victim of sexual abuse, and that permitting expert testimony to bolster the child’s credibility would improperly interfere with the jury’s function. We found that there was no clear need for an expert to explain why children fail to provide a detailed description of the abuse when such understanding was well within the common knowledge of jurors.</p>

Dr. Himmelhoch’s adamant assertion, that Reed’s memories of the events leading to Altman’s death could not be considered accurate to any degree which would obviate reasonable doubt, was inadmissible as an assessment of Reed’s credibility. The jurors were eminently capable of assessing the credibility of the witness, a matter not within the domain of expert witnesses.</p>
