Ms. Jacqueline Brown testified that on the evening in question, she was standing on the sidewalk outside her home at 1301 South 53rd Street in Philadelphia at 11:30 p.m. Ms. Brown was with <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>her cousins, Kenneth Rankine and Neville Bobby Hill, and her boyfriend Paul Green. While this group was assembled, three individuals approached them simultaneously.

This was a private conversation between appellant and Mr. Hill and did not involve the other persons present.

When the unknown man acknowledged Ms. Brown’s compliment by modeling his boots, he turned his body and Ms. Brown observed that he possessed a gun. Ms. Brown advised her boyfriend, Paul Green, of the gun. Mr. Green directed Ms. Brown to go into her house. Ms. Brown retreated to the enclosed porch of her house from where she continued to observe the persons on the street. Mr. Rankine came onto the porch and Ms. Brown advised him that one of the men was carrying a gun. Mr. Rankine walked through Ms. Brown’s house out the back door to the street, then retraced his steps and returned to the group on the sidewalk.</p>

At that same time, the two unknown men began shooting at Mr. Rankine. Mr. Rankine fell to the ground. Mr. Hill ran away from appellant and the two unknown men shot at Mr. Hill as he was running.

When Mr. Rankine came back to the group Mr. Hill overheard Mr. Rankine and the two unknown men exchange bitter words. Mr. Rankine and the two unknown men were standing behind Mr. Hill and appellant. Mr. Hill heard sounds indicative of wrestling. Mr. Hill turned and observed one of the unknown men pointing a gun at Mr. Rankine. At that point appellant grabbed Mr. Hill and held a gun to his head, forcing him across the street towards Mr. Hill’s car. Mr. Hill did not see the gun but he felt the muzzle against his head. Mr. Hill heard a click, which he believed was the gun firing. Mr. Hill realized the gun had not fired at the same time he heard the gunfire behind him from the direction of Mr. Rankine and the two unknown men.

Although appellant and the two unknown men approached Mr. Hill and Mr. Rankine from different directions, the fact that they all arrived simultaneously leads to the logical inference that their joint appearance was planned. While appellant engaged Mr. Hill in conversation the two unknown men did not interact with any of the other persons present. Ms. Brown testified that she attempted a conversation with one of the men by commenting on his boots, but the two men made no attempt at further conversation. In fact, Ms. Brown walked away from the group on the sidewalk when the gun one of the men was carrying aroused her suspicions. The sequence of events leads to the logical inference that appellant engaged Mr. Hill in a meaningless conversation to distract him from the intentions of the two unidentified men. When the two unidentified men began shooting at Mr. Rankine, appellant forcibly removed Mr. Hill from the center of the melee. Appellant held a gun to Mr. Hill’s head. Appellant attempted to use that gun on Mr. Hill, however, the gun malfunctioned and Mr. Hill was able to escape, even though his flight was followed with a hail of bullets from the two unknown men. Appellant was observed fleeing the scene of the shooting in the same direction as the two unidentified men. The record presents sufficient information from which the jury could reasonably infer that <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>appellant was a co-conspirator of the two unidentified men who actually inflicted the fatal wounds on Mr. Rankine.

    <p id="b807-4" data-blocks='[["BL_807.4",807,[201,515,1155,1127]]]'>The majority of appellant’s remaining claims are raised in the alternative as direct error and/or as ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Appellate counsel is distinct from trial counsel and was appointed after imposition of sentence. Trial counsel did not file post-trial motions, nor did appellate counsel file a statement of matters complained of on appeal. Almost all of the issues presented in this appeal were raised for the first time in appellant’s brief to this court. In direct appeals from the imposition of a sentence of death this court generally applies a rule of relaxed waiver to permit review of all claims of error in such cases, given the finality of the verdict. <em>Commonwealth v.

The relaxed waiver doctrine was developed by this court as a failsafe mechanism to ensure full appellate review of all claims presented in death penalty cases. Relaxed waiver permits review of claims not properly preserved. However, where new counsel represents a capital defendant in this court and presents a claim of ineffective assistance, it is inappropriate to consider the underlying issue under the guise of relaxed waiver.</p>

If the general rule of co-conspirator liability applied to eliminate the need to establish the existence of specific intent, then an accused conspirator could be culpable for first degree murder without proof that the accused shared the <em>specific intent to kill, </em>the element which distinguishes first degree murder from all other forms of homicide. Such a result was clearly not contemplated by the legislature when it delineated the elements distinguishing the various <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>degrees of homicide. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. §§ 2502(a) and (b). Nor would such a result be consistent with the legal principles outlined in <em>Bachert </em>and <em>Huffman. </em>To be guilty of first degree murder, each co-conspirator must individually be found to possess the mental state necessary to establish first degree <em>murder—the specific intent to kill. </em>It is the unique harboring of malice with willful premeditation that causes first degree murder to be distinctly villainous. It is precisely because of the deliberate nature of first degree murder that this crime carries the most severe penalty the law can impose—death.

The defense objected, not as to the determination of availability, but rather to the issue of whether a “full opportunity” to cross-examine the witness had been provided at the preliminary hearing. This objection stemmed from the failure of the Commonwealth to provide to the defense, at or before the preliminary hearing, information in the Commonwealth’s possession at the time of the preliminary hearing, that the witness had made a prior inconsistent statement to the police; he had a criminal record; and that he was facing probable indictment on charges of homicide and conspiracy related to the same incident for which Bazemore was charged. This information was clearly relevant to an inquiry of the witness’ veracity and bias; the fact that the defense was unable to explore this pertinent area on cross examination led directly to the holding that Bazemore was denied a “full opportunity” to cross examine the witness at the preliminary hearing.

Prior to the start of trial the court heard appellant’s request for a continuance on the basis that more time was needed for pre-trial preparation, as he and counsel had four days earlier completed another trial. Before denying the motion the court questioned appellant and counsel as to any specific needs that were not addressed due to the back to back trials. Appellant posited a general request for more time and failed to specify any missing discovery or witnesses. T.T., May 23, 1995 pp. 70-73. Also, at penalty phase counsel made clear on the record his attempts to secure witnesses for appellant, to the extent that counsel personally offered to pay the plane fare and arrange free lodgings for appellant’s mother to come in <em>from </em>Florida and testify. Appellant’s mother declined counsel’s offer. T.T., May 26, 1995 pp. 3-5.</p>

Thus, appellant’s claim of counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to call a witness is without merit. <em>Morris.</em>

Appellant’s argument borders the absurd.

    <p id="b827-5" data-blocks='[["BL_827.5",827,[209,371,1155,783]]]'>While I join the Majority’s opinion, I write separately to note that I would have also addressed, pursuant to the relaxed waiver rule applicable to direct appeals in capital cases, Appellant’s distinct claim that the trial court erred in charging the jury regarding conspiracy liability as it relates to first degree murder. <em>See Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, </em><a href="/pa/500/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="500 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1781169" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0016-01">500 Pa. 16</a>, 50 n. 19, <a href="/pa/500/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="500 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1781169" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0016-01">454 A.2d 937</a>, 955 n. 19 (1982) (under this Court’s practice of relaxing waiver rules in death penalty cases, “significant issues perceived <em>sua sponte </em>by this Court, or raised by the parties, will be addressed and, if possible from the record, resolved”). Appellant raises this claim of underlying error by the trial court in addition to his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the charge given by the trial court on conspiracy liability. The Majority addressed only the ineffectiveness claim.</p>
    <p id="b827-6" data-blocks='[["BL_827.6",827,[211,1186,1155,739]]]'>When reviewing Appellant’s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the charge on conspiracy liability, the Majority agreed with Appellant that the instruction was erroneous but found that it had not prejudiced Appellant. I agree with this analysis. However, for purposes of reviewing Appellant’s underlying claim of trial court error, I would also find that such error was harmless, given the circumstances of this case, the trial court’s charge to the jury when read as a whole, and most significantly, the jury’s conviction of Appellant for conspiring to kill Mr. Rankine. Thus, in addition to the Majority’s conclusion that Appellant’s ineffectiveness claim fails, I would also find that Appellant is not entitled to relief on the basis of the trial court’s improper instruction on co-conspirator liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Likewise, Appellant raises several other underlying claims of trial court error and prosecutorial misconduct and in the alternative, claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to these alleged errors committed by the trial court or by the prosecutor. While the Majority addresses the merits of some of the underlying claims of error while examining others only as ineffectiveness claims, I would have independently addressed all of Appellant’s distinct claims of trial court error in light of this Court's relaxed waiver rule. However, since I agree with the Majority that these claims are without merit, Appellant <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>would not be entitled to relief on the basis of these claims under either analysis.</p>
