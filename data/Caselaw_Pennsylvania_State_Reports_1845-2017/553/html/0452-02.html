The carrier argued that Section 1720 was repealed while the declaratory judgment action was pending and it has subrogation rights under the amended statute.

One of the provisions of Act 44 was a partial repealer of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1720,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> a provision of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law. Section 1720 was repealed insofar as it stated that where a workers’ compensation claimant was receiving benefits due to injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident, the employer or workers’ compensation carrier responsible for paying the benefits to the claimant had no subrogation claim against the third-party tortfeasor who had injured the claimant. By removing the limitation contained within § 1720, the provisions of 77 P.S. § 671<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a>, which allow subrogation claims to be filed against the monies recovered from the third-party tortfeasor who injured the workers’ compensation claimant, could operate where the injury to the employee was caused by a motor vehicle accident.

In <em>Wolfe, </em>this court analyzed the subrogation rights of a workers’ compensation carrier against the recovery obtained by the claimant against the third-party tortfeasor. Specifically, the <em>Wolfe </em>court had to determine whether it was the subrogation claim of the workers’ compensation carrier or the contingent fee of claimant’s attorney which was to be paid first out of the recovery obtained from the third-party tortfeasor. We commenced our analysis by stating that “this case must be resolved on subrogation principles.... ” <em>Wolfe, </em><a href="/pa/534/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="534 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1839632" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0068-01">534 Pa. at 74</a>, <a href="/pa/534/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="534 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1839632" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0068-01">626 A.2d at 525</a>.

After stating that the workers’ compensation carrier’s rights did not vest until after the claimant had received his recovery, the <em>Wolfe </em>court went on to say that the claimant (and, via subrogation, the workers’ compensation carrier) had no rights in the recovery until after the attorney had been reimbursed his expenses and paid his fee. <em><a href="/pa/534/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="534 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1839632" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0068-01">Id.</a> </em>The court concluded by noting that such a result was consistent with the principles of equity as it gave first priority in the fund to the creator of the fund. <em><a href="/pa/534/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="534 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1839632" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0068-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/534/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="534 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1839632" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0068-01">at 75</a>, <a href="/pa/534/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="534 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1839632" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0068-01">626 A.2d at 525</a>.

I note that although the opinion in <em>Wolfe </em>is captioned an "Opinion Announcing the Judgment of Court,” since only three members of a seven member court joined in all aspects of that opinion, the portion of the court’s analysis concerning subrogation principles is indeed precedential, The fourth and fifth votes for the subrogation analysis are obtained from the dissenting opinion authored by Mr. Justice (now Mr. Chief Justice) Flaherty, which was joined by Mr. Chief Justice Nix. <em>Wolfe, </em><a href="/pa/534/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="534 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1839632" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0068-01">534 Pa. at 78</a>, <a href="/pa/534/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="534 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1839632" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0068-01">626 A.2d at 527</a>. Although Mr. Justice Flaherty's opinion weis a dissent, he made it clear that he disagreed with the majority’s result on a point distinct from the subrogation issue; in fact, Mr. Justice Flaherty cleEirly stated that he was in agreement with the majority on the subrogation issue. <em><a href="/pa/534/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="534 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1839632" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0068-01">Id.</a> </em>Instead, his dissent was based on an issue which was not even addressed by the majority opinion. Mr. Justice Flaherty believed that the majority erred in granting the attorney priority in the recovery fund because the attorney had a conflict of interest as he had represented both the injured claimant as well as the workers’ compensation carrier. <em><a href="/pa/534/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="534 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1839632" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0068-01">Id.</a> </em>Essentially, Mr. Justice Flaherty dissented because he believed that the attorney should not be allowed to profit by his unethical behavior. <em><a href="/pa/534/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="534 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1839632" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0068-01">Id.</a> </em>Thus, since there were five votes <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>in <em>Wolfe </em>in favor of the subrogation analysis, then that portion of the opinion is precedential.</p>
