While we find that the plain language of the MVFRL requires an individual purchasing an original insurance policy after July 1, 1990 to receive such premium information, we nevertheless affirm the order of the Superior Court because the MVFRL fails to provide a remedy to an individual who does not receive this information.</p>

The notice each appellant received did not contain any premium or cost comparison between the limited tort option and the full tort option. After receiving these notices, each of these appellants elected the limited tort option offered by each insurance company. The purchase of the “limited tort” option allowed appellants to reduce their insurance premium. In return for this reduced premium, appellants were generally precluded from recovering for a non-economic loss<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> unless they sustained a “serious injury”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> from an accident. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d).</p>

Instead, each of these three appellants received their original insurance after July 1, 1990 through Pennsylvania’s Assigned Risk Plan.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> When deciding whether to select the limited tort option or the full tort option, each of these three appellants received and signed Form PA-1000. This Form PA-1000 was issued by the assigned risk plan and contained virtually the same information contained in the notice required by 75 Pa.C.S. § 1791.1. Thus, the appellants participating in the assigned risk plan did not receive a premium or cost comparison between the limited tort option and the full tort option.</p>

As a result of their accidents, appellants instituted a lawsuit against the respective appellee in each case on this appeal. Appellants filed motions <em>in limine </em>prior to trial seeking to preclude appellees from raising the limited tort waiver defense. In essence, appellants sought to invalidate their limited tort selections on the grounds that their insurance companies had failed to provide the proper notice before the purchase of insurance that is required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 1705. The notice required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 1705(a)(1) must contain the annual premium which an insured would incur if he purchased the limited tort option or the full tort option.</p>

The trial court, after reviewing the above-referenced statutory provisions and the purpose behind the enactment of the MVFRL, concluded that appellants’ insurance companies were <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>required by law to issue a notice pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 1705 containing the premium cost associated with choosing the limited tort option and the full tort option. The trial court based this conclusion on the trial court’s public policy perception that consumer protection required notice of the cost comparison involved in choosing a particular option. Since the trial court determined that the insureds had not made valid and knowing elections of tort coverage, the trial court held that the full tort election applied and granted the motions <em>in limine.

On March 6, the Superior Court granted permission to appeal. On October 29, 1996, an <em>en banc </em>Superior Court in a seven-to-three decision reversed the trial court. The Superior Court majority decision enforced appellants’ limited tort selections because it found that the legislative design and administrative scheme formulated by the Insurance Department only required the cost comparison to be offered to insureds renewing their policy for the first time after July 1, 1990. Since appellants did not purchase their original insurance policy until after July 1, 1990, no premium comparison was required for appellants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> This Court granted allocatur in order to decide whether the MVFRL required appellants, who applied for an original insurance policy to be issued after July 1, 1990, to have been provided with a specific notice that contains premium information for both the full and limited tort options.</p>

As part of this plan, the General Assembly gave each individual the ability to choose full tort or limited tort coverage. As previously described, the limited tort option gave an individual lower premiums in return for relinquishing the right to seek recovery for non-monetary damages while an individual choosing the full tort option did not receive as great of a premium reduction since he still had the ability to recover non-monetary damages. As part of the 1990 amendments to the MVFRL, an individual selecting the limited tort option was to receive a twenty-two percent (22%) reduction in his total premium for the same coverage prior to the amendments while a person choosing the full tort option was to receive a ten percent (10%) premium reduction. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1799.7(b)(1) &amp; (2).</p>

However, the interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the Court to resolve and when the Court is convinced that the interpretive regulation adopted by the administrative agency is clearly erroneous or is violative of legislative intent, the Court disregards the administrative agency’s regulation. <em>Philadelphia Suburban Corp. v. Bd. of Finance and Revenue, </em><a href="/pa/535/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="535 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1841576" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0298-01">535 Pa. 298</a>, 301-02, <a href="/pa/535/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="635 A.2d 116" data-case-ids="1841576,7358591" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0298-01,/a2d/635/0116-01">635 A.2d 116</a>, 118 (1993). As described above, the Insurance Commissioner’s interpretation of the relevant statute in the case <em>sub judice </em>disregards the clear and plain meaning of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(a)(4). Thus, this Court finds that the Insurance Commissioner’s interpretative regulation is erroneous and must be disregarded. It is for the legislature, not the courts or administrative agencies, to alter the construction of who must be afforded notice under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(a)(4). Therefore, this Court holds that the Superior Court erred in finding that appellants did not have to receive the premium differential notice that is contained in 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(a)(1).</p>

This Court agreed with the resident relatives and held that since Sections 1731, 1791 and 1791.1 of the MVFRL must be read in pari materia, an insurer was required by Section 1791.1 to provide notice on renewal forms informing the named insured of his options at the time of renewal concerning the purchase of uninsured/underinsured coverage. However, even though this Court recognized that the insurer should have provided a Section 1791.1 notice at the time of renewal, the resident relatives were not entitled to such coverage because the MVFRL specifically failed to provide a remedy for an insurer’s failure to comply with the Section 1791.1 notice requirement.</p>

Here, appellants were purchasing original coverage, not renewing existing policies. Also, appellants, based on a notice which accurately described the tort alternatives available in all regards except for the absence of a cost comparison, freely chose the limited tort option and paid premiums in accordance with that choice, i.e., a premium lower than if they had chosen the full tort option. Based on these clear differences between appellants’ situations and that contemplated by Section 1705(a)(3), this Court finds that Section 1705(a)(3) of the MVFRL does not provide a remedy to appellants. Moreover, this Court, like it did in <em>Salazar, </em>finds no remedy in any other provision of the MVFRL which would provide appellants who obtained coverage through the voluntary market with a remedy for their failure to receive a Section 1705(a)(1) notice with cost differentials from their insurers.</p>

Here, appellants, based on a notice form which provided accurate information on the difference between the tort alternatives, freely chose the limited tort option. In making this free choice, appellants received a greater reduction in their premiums than if they had chosen the full tort option. Appellants were content with this lower premium and their choice until they unfortunately were involved in automobile accidents with appellees. Now, appellants seek to escape from what they freely chose and paid for in order that they may obtain a full tort recovery. If this Court were to fashion a remedy not expressly provided for in the MVFRL, this Court would essentially contravene the cost containment policy behind the MVFRL because allowing appellants the full tort coverage they seek would result in giving appellants something for which no individual has paid, which in turn, would result in insurance companies passing on this extra costs to all other insureds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

However, when the insurer renewed her policy, it neglected to send her a disclosure of premium charges and tort options form as required by Section <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>1791.1. While Mrs. Brown’s daughter Rita Salazar was driving her mother’s car, accompanied by Celitia Salazar, a hit- and-run driver struck them. The Salazars brought an action against the insurance company seeking uninsured motorist benefits pursuant to Mrs. Brown’s policy. They argued that because the insurer did not provide Mrs. Brown with the notice required by Section 1791.1, that they were entitled to such benefits. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the insurer, and the Superior Court affirmed. This Court recognized that the insurer breached its statutory duty to provide the appropriate renewal notice to the insured party, but held that the lack of an enforcement mechanism for this requirement in the MVFRL meant that the Salazars did not have a remedy.</p>

The majority in <em>Salazar </em>held that the presence of a statutorily created remedy in Section 1731 implied that the lack of such a remedy in Section 1791 indicated that the appellants were not entitled to relief. I disagreed, noting that noncompliance with Section 1791 is as contrary to the MVFRL’s goal of advising insured individuals of the benefits and limits under the Law as is noncompliance with Section 1731. In the instant matter, Section 1705(a)(3) provides that if an individual who is renewing a policy does not respond to two notices informing him or her of the tort options, “the named insured and those he is empowered by this section to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort option alternative.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(a)(3). Consistent with the position I expressed in <em>Salazar, </em>I believe that the failure to provide a first-time purchaser of insurance with a cost comparison of the limited and full tort options is inimical to the aims of the MVFRL.</p>
