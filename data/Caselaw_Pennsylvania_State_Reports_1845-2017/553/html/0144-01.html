Stated briefly, using a ball peen hammer and a kitchen knife, Taylor bludgeoned and stabbed to death his mother-in-law, her infant son, and two of his own three minor children. Eleven hours later, Taylor’s wife arrived at home, and Taylor killed her in the same manner. Taylor then attempted to commit suicide. He subsequently confessed to the killings on multiple occasions, <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>including in a detailed letter that he wrote to the district attorney.</p>

On January 10, 1992, the trial court conducted a degree of guilt hearing, at the outset of which the court conducted a second colloquy concerning Taylor’s decision not to present defenses. After the presentation of evidence by the Commonwealth, Taylor was found guilty as to each of five counts of first degree murder. In the penalty phase that followed, the trial court engaged in a third colloquy with Taylor concerning his decision not to present any evidence of mitigating circumstances or to otherwise oppose the imposition of a sentence of death. On January 23, 1992, Taylor was sentenced to death for each of four of the counts of first degree murder, and to life imprisonment for the remaining count. An automatic direct appeal followed, in which Taylor presented no claim of error. This Court reviewed the sufficiency of the evidence and satisfied its statutory obligations attendant to the review of a sentence of death, and, on December 9, 1993, affirmed the judgment of sentence. <em><a href="/pa/535/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="535 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1841541" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0266-01">Id.</a></em>

Taylor alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his trial counsel was ineffective for having failed to override Taylor’s decisions as to trial strategy in the penalty phase, including the decision not to present mitigating evidence. The PCRA court conducted a hearing on June 24, 1997, at which Taylor' and trial counsel testified, and at the conclusion of which the court denied the petition from the bench. The court found that trial counsel had properly advised Taylor concerning all aspects of the criminal proceedings and, in particular, that a death sentence would likely be imposed should Taylor pursue his chosen strategy of inaction. With specific reference to the penalty phase, the court found that trial counsel had discussed with Taylor the desirability of presenting mitigating evidence, and <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>that Taylor rejected such advice and, in fact, made telephone calls to witnesses to advise them not to be present at trial. The court also found that Taylor failed to present any evidence that would support a finding that he was at any time incapable of making knowing and intelligent decisions. In this regard, the PCRA court noted that the trial court had required psychological and psychiatric evaluations prior to the entry of Taylor’s guilty plea, which established that Taylor was able to make rational decisions throughout and was otherwise competent to stand trial.</p>

In addition to Taylor’s having had the benefit of the advice of trial counsel, the trial court in various colloquies also advised him of his rights and probed whether his decisions were rational and properly informed. Like trial counsel, the trial court specifically advised Taylor of his right to defend against imposition of the death penalty, including the right to present mitigating circumstances, and that the likely result of the failure to do so would be the imposition of a sentence of death. Under these circumstances, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to override Taylor’s decision not to present such evidence. <em>See Morales, </em><a href="/pa/549/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="549 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="17254" data-case-paths="/pa/549/0400-01">549 Pa. at 420-23</a>, <a href="/a2d/701/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="701 A.2d 516" data-case-ids="11898471,17254" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0516-01,/pa/549/0400-01">701 A.2d at 526-27</a>; <em>Beasley, </em><a href="/pa/544/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="544 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="463559" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0554-01">544 Pa. at 565</a>, <a href="/a2d/678/0773-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="678 A.2d 773" data-case-ids="11740422,463559" data-case-paths="/a2d/678/0773-01,/pa/544/0554-01">678 A.2d at 778</a>; <em>Sam, </em><a href="/pa/535/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="535 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="1841565" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0350-01">535 Pa. at 368</a>, <a href="/pa/535/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="635 A.2d 603" data-case-ids="1841565,7368570" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0350-01,/a2d/635/0603-01">635 A.2d at 611-12</a>.</p>

It is, however, the burden of a person asserting mental incompetency to establish such incompetency by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Appel, </em><a href="/pa/547/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="547 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="468718" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0171-01">547 Pa. 171</a>, 189, <a href="/a2d/689/0891-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="689 A.2d 891" data-case-ids="11926485,468718" data-case-paths="/a2d/689/0891-01,/pa/547/0171-01">689 A.2d 891</a>, 899 (1997). In this case, Taylor’s claim of incompetency is completely unsupported in fact. On the other hand, the PCRA court’s determination that Taylor was competent in all matters of decision and strategy is supported by substantial evidence of record, including Taylor’s own testimony, the testimony of his trial counsel, and the <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>report of the court-appointed psychiatrist. Taylor’s suggestion that stress and remorse associated with a capital case are such that he (and, by implication, others in his situation) are <em>per se </em>incompetent to make decisions of strategy does not comport with the well-established standard for determining mental competency, <em>see generally Appel, </em><a href="/pa/547/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="547 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="468718" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0171-01">547 Pa. at 187-89</a>, <a href="/a2d/689/0891-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="689 A.2d 891" data-case-ids="11926485,468718" data-case-paths="/a2d/689/0891-01,/pa/547/0171-01">689 A.2d at 899</a>, and has been squarely rejected. <em>See Morales, </em><a href="/pa/549/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="549 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="17254" data-case-paths="/pa/549/0400-01">549 Pa. at 420</a>, <a href="/a2d/701/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="701 A.2d 516" data-case-ids="11898471,17254" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0516-01,/pa/549/0400-01">701 A.2d at 526</a>; <em>Sam, </em><a href="/pa/535/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="535 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="1841565" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0350-01">535 Pa. at 368-69</a>, <a href="/pa/535/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="635 A.2d 603" data-case-ids="1841565,7368570" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0350-01,/a2d/635/0603-01">635 A.2d at 611-12</a>.</p>
    <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[239,772,1159,624]]]'>Finally, Taylor makes a broader attack upon trial counsel’s stewardship, claiming that the failure to override his decisions generally constituted ineffectiveness. By implication, the claim is limited to the penalty phase, as Taylor does not seek to withdraw his guilty plea or to overturn the first degree murder convictions. Taylor, however, does not describe any specific omission on the part of trial counsel other than the failure to present mitigating evidence. Without such description, there is no basis for assessing either the arguable merit of the claim or whether cognizable prejudice resulted. Accordingly, relief under the PCRA is not available. <em>See generally Collins, </em><a href="/pa/546/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="546 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="466722" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0616-01">546 Pa. at 619</a>, <a href="/pa/546/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="687 A.2d 1112" data-case-ids="466722,7360681" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0616-01,/a2d/687/1112-01">687 A.2d at 1113</a>.</p>
