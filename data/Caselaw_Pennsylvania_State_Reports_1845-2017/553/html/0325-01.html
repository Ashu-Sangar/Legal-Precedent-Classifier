Gates testified to a course of violent conduct by Derk toward little Clair, which escalated from July 1992 until little Clair’s death on August 7, 1992. In particular, she related that Derk smashed a roll of tape into the child’s chest, and, on the Monday before his death, smacked her son’s head against the end of a couch. She also testified as to Derk’s abuse of her and her fear of his violent temper, his verbal threats and statements that he was going to kill little Clair and “kick his ass.”</p>
    <p id="b507-6" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[205,1287,1155,744]]]'>She further testified that at about 10:00 or 10:30 a.m. on August 6, 1992, the day before her son’s death, she and Derk fought about a past due light bill During the fighting, little Clair began to cry and Derk swore at the child and sent him to his room. Gates followed little Clair and began to play with him in his room. Derk came to the doorway and continued to argue with Gates. When she refused to take immediate action on the bill, Derk kicked little Clair. He then grabbed the boy by the head and threw the child, stomach down, on the bed and grasped his right ankle, flipped him over and punched him in the stomach with a closed fist. Gates said she heard a cracking sound following the punch, and screamed at Derk not to hit the child in that manner. Derk responded, “I don’t care if I kill him or not, he’s not my son.”</p>

      <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>According to Gates, little Clair became ill in the evening of August 6, at about 11:00 p.m. and began vomiting throughout the night, and that both she and Derk were up with the child. She testified that Derk went to bed at 4:30 a.m., while she remained with little Clair on the living room couch. The child finally fell asleep about 8:30 a.m. on Friday, August 7, 1992 and Gates left little Clair on the couch and went to bed. At approximately 10:00 a.m. that same morning, Gates heard a thud and discovered the toddler lying with his head on the top of the stairs in the apartment. Gates, at Derk’s suggestion, took the child to the kitchen and fed him some chicken soup. After feeding him, Gates noticed that little Clair was cold to the touch so she and Derk put him in the tub. When Derk set him down in the water, the child fell, and at that point in time Gates became extremely concerned and insisted on taking little Clair to the hospital.</p>
    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[243,1215,1162,520]]]'>Derk called 911 and the emergency dispatch sent an ambulance to the apartment. Gates testified that her concern for little Clair had finally overtaken her fear of Derk so that she demanded medical treatment for the child. Gates told the technician that little Clair had fallen down the steps. Wflien the paramedic arrived at the scene and inquired about how long the child had been unresponsive, Gates replied that little Clair had banged his head against the wall. Little Clair was transported to the Sunbury Hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
    <p id="b508-6" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[240,1784,1163,581]]]'>At trial, the Commonwealth’s forensic pathologist testified that little Clair sustained three areas of fatal injury: to his head, neck, and abdomen, which were inflicted at varying times before the child’s death. His head injuries included linear skull fractures, epidural hemorrhaging, and brain herniation. The extent of the damage to the brain was consistent with the child having been dropped from a multistory building. The Commonwealth pathologist testified that brain herniation was probably the cause of death, and that the head injuries were inflicted twenty-four to forty-eight hours before death. He opined that blunt force trauma caused the head injuries.</p>

      <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>The injury to little Clair’s abdomen included blunt force trauma with damage to an abdominal artery and internal organs so severe that blood was in his abdomen. The pathologist testified that these injuries occurred twenty minutes to three hours before death. The injuries to the boy’s neck area included evidence of manual strangulation, bleeding in the “Adam’s Apple” region and in front of the spinal column, consistent with “shaking” baby syndrome. The child’s neck ligaments were completely torn, presumably from repeated shaking. The injuries to the front of the neck occurred within days before death, and the injuries to the spinal column occurred within minutes to hours of death.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[209,935,1153,625]]]'>The pathologist recounted to the jury the child’s multiple signs of blunt force trauma, manual strangulation and “shaking baby syndrome,” with more than 100 distinct bruises covering his complete body. The child had bruises on his entire face, around both of his eyes and on his forehead. He had bruises around his arms, chest, abdomen, both lower legs, his back, and buttocks. The size and shape of the bruises on his back and buttocks indicated repeated blows with a fist, hand, foot, or toes. There also was a large bruise over the right side of his head covering the ear, forehead, and eye. The right eye was swollen shut. The Commonwealth showed the jury pictures of these injuries.</p>
    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[207,1585,1154,572]]]'>In addition to the testimony of Gates and the pathologist, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of several neighbors and acquaintances, who testified that they overheard Derk verbally abuse the child, threaten to “fucking kill him” and to “smash little Clair against the wall.” One neighbor, Karen Treas, testified that she saw Derk grab little Clair under the arm and back of the head, and while holding him by the hair, forcibly place him on a step in the apartment. Ms. Treas also testified that on the night of the murder, she heard Gates say “knock it off, leave him alone, that’s enough.” N.T. (Vol.I) at 202, 210.</p>

Gates’ mother testified that she became so concerned as to the bruises on the child that she had made an appointment to take the boy to the doctor just days before his death. (This appointment never materialized because Gates prevented her mother from seeing the child on the scheduled date.)</p>
    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[237,632,1160,528]]]'>At trial, defense counsel argued that Gates, and not Derk, had committed the murder, pointing primarily to the time frames that the pathologist attributed to the child’s injuries and the inconsistencies in Gates’ testimony of events. Nonetheless, the jury convicted Derk of the murder. Following his conviction and sentence, Derk appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the trial court. We granted review on the sole issue of whether defense counsel was ineffective for failing to request that the court instruct the jury that Ms. Gates was a “corrupt” source since she was an accomplice to the murder.</p>

We rejected the appellant’s arguments that trial counsel was ineffective for not requesting an accomplice instruction regarding the witness’ testimony.

The Superior Court cogently stated that, “appellant’s trial counsel could not logically argue that appellant had an accomplice to a crime appellant maintains <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>that he did not commit because he has an alibi.

Counsel argued that Derk was innocent, and the defense strategy was to show that Ms. Gates killed Little Clair. For example, during the closing argument, Derk’s counsel told the jury that, “Mr. Derk is innocent of these charges.” N.T. (Vol.4) at 109. He proceeded to pose the question to the jury, “was it Steven or was it Tamie? Tamie Gates is on trial today as much as Steven Derk is.” N.T. (Vol.4) at 112. Counsel further told the jury that Gates was “covering up her own story.” N.T. (Vol.4) at 124. He then recounted all of the evidence that pointed to Derk’s innocence and that Gates killed the child, not Derk. N.T. (Vol.4) at 124-152. At one point in his closing, Counsel even explicitly told the jury, “Now what happened? She is writing him [Derk] letters, look how much I love you, because <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>she did it [killed little Clair].” N.T. (Vol.4) at 145 (emphasis added). Thus, an accomplice instruction would have been inconsistent with Derk’s defense that he did not kill the child, and it was a reasonable tactical consideration for trial counsel not to request an accomplice jury instruction. Our inquiry should end there. As we stated in <em>Commonwealth v.
