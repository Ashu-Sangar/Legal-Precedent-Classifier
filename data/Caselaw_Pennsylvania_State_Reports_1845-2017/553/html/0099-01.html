Because we find that the Commonwealth Court misapplied the appropriate standard of review and that appellant is a “subordinate unit” within § 4-461.1, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

To be a member of the post, one must be a veteran; one need not be a veteran to belong to the home corporation. The American Legion is a national organization headquartered in Minnesota with Pennsylvania headquarters in Harrisburg. Both the national and state American Legion organizations recognize home corporations as part of the Legion structure.</p>

Based upon these findings of fact, the trial court held that appellant was a subordinate unit within the meaning of § 4-461.1 and that the Board erred in finding that it was necessary for a party to be a “direct” subordinate unit in order to qualify for a liquor license under § 4-461.1.</p>

In § 4-461.1, the legislature defined “incorporated unit of a national veterans’ organization” to include several types of entities related to the veterans’ organization and then concluded with the catchall phrase “or other subordinate unit.” Home corporations are recognized by both the national and state American Legion organizations as subordinates of the individual posts. It is commonplace for an American Legion post to organize a home corporation to shield it from liability. The home corporation is completely controlled by the American Legion post and is therefore clearly subordinate to the post. Further, contrary to appellee’s decision, the statute does not require that the subordinate unit be a “direct” subordinate unit. A home corporation is precisely the type of entity that falls within the scope of the phrase “subordinate unit” as used in § 4-461.1.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The recent legislation makes this intent clear by providing that "only one club license may be issued to the incorporated unit of the national veterans' organization, and the board may not issue a license to an incorporated unit of a national veterans' organization if any of the unit's affiliated organizations holds a club license." 1998 Pa. Legis. Serv. Act 1998-86, section 11. The Majority’s decision today may interfere with this portion of Act 86, because if a home corporation qualifies as an incorporated unit of a national veterans organization, it will qualify for its own Section 4-461.1 liquor license, and the above-quoted restriction may not apply. For example, while a home corporation is specifically listed as an "affiliated organization” of an incorporated unit of a national veterans' organization, a Legion post is not specifically listed as an “affiliated organization.” In other words, if a Legion post held a Section 4-461.1 liquor license, its home corporation could also obtain one because: (1) it would qualify as an incorporated unit of a national veterans' organization, and; (2) it has a plausible argument that, because the term “affiliated organization” does not specifically include "posts,” its Legion post does not constitute an “affiliated organization." This problem further highlights the majority's error: a home corporation will be both an "affiliated organization" <em>and </em>an incorporated unit of a national veterans' organization.</p>
