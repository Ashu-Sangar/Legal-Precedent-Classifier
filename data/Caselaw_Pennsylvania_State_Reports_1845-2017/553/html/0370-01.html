The family relationship was strained by financial difficulty and Counterman’s abusive behavior.</p>
    <p id="b562-5" data-blocks='[["BL_562.4",562,[222,445,1160,636]]]'>On July 24, 1988, Counterman spent the day smoking marijuana and playing video games. At approximately 2:00 a.m. the following day, he awakened his wife, who was sleeping in an upstairs bedroom. Counterman made sexual advances, but, because Mrs. Counterman disapproved of his use of marijuana, she rebuffed him. Counterman became angry, slapped his wife and went to the first floor of the residence. Later that same morning, Christopher and James entered their mother’s bedroom crying and screaming, awakened her, and told her: “daddy is downstairs starting a fire.” Mrs. Counterman picked up her baby and, with Christopher and James following, started down the stairs.</p>
    <p id="b562-6" data-blocks='[["BL_562.5",562,[217,1114,1160,634]]]'>From the steps, Mrs. Counterman saw Counterman in the dining room holding a bucket and a cigarette lighter. Countermán stated that if she and the children did not go back upstairs, he would set them on fire. Mrs. Counterman retreated to the second floor, placed her baby in his crib, and directed the two older children to their shared bedroom. Immediately thereafter, flames engulfed the stairway, preventing her egress from the second floor. Mrs. Counterman ultimately escaped from a second story window with the assistance of a neighbor, but she suffered second and third-degree burns that covered fifty percent of her body, respiratory burns, and smoke inhalation.</p>
    <p id="b562-7" data-blocks='[["BL_562.6",562,[213,1780,1162,527]]]'>As the fire burned, Counterman stood in his yard looking at the ground. Upon learning of the fire from Counterman, several neighbors urged him to attempt a rescue of his family. He responded that he was unable because he was not wearing shoes and the fire was too far along. Eventually, Counterman climbed onto the porch roof in the rear of the residence and edged over to a window of the room occupied by Christopher and James. After looking into the window, Counterman turned to retreat from the roof, but lost his footing and fell to the yard below, injuring his leg.</p>

Nevertheless, the fire was subdued before it spread to neighboring row homes, although the Counterman residence was gutted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Despite their efforts, the firefighters and medical personnel were unable to save the lives of any of the children. Autopsies revealed that the children died from “conflagration,” a combination of smoke inhalation and burns from the fire.</p>
    <p id="b563-4" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[238,773,1155,1167]]]'>Counterman was eventually taken to the Lehigh Valley Hospital Center by Sergeant Kochan of the Allentown Police Department, who had also been injured while assisting with the fire fighting efforts. At the hospital, Sergeant Kochan questioned Counterman about the fire. Counterman stated that he had been sleeping upstairs with his wife when Christopher and James came into the room and told him that there was a fire downstairs, and that he went downstairs and found the couch on fire. He said that he attempted to extinguish the fire by filling a bucket with water from the kitchen sink and throwing it on the fire, but that the smoke caused him to abandon this effort and flee the home through the back door. However, the doctor who examined Counterman at the hospital found no evidence of burns on him, except for a slight singeing of his hair; furthermore, his lung function and blood studies were inconsistent with his assertion of having inhaled smoke. While at the hospital, Counterman was also seen by Jean Hoffman, a medical social worker. In speaking with Counterman, Ms. Hoffman observed that he did not appear to be grieving over the deaths of his children. Counterman also expressed concern over his insurance situation to Ms. Hoffman.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

He asked her how she had learned about the fire, to which she responded that Christopher had awakened her. When she was asked by Sergeant Kochan how the fire started, she looked away and did not answer. Sergeant Kochan then asked Mrs. Counterman where her husband had been, to which she responded, “woke him up.” At that point, she indicated that there was nothing else she could remember.</p>
    <p id="b564-5" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[213,765,1162,785]]]'>While Mrs. Counterman was at the hospital, medical personnel noticed that she did not include her husband on her visitor list. Because of this circumstance, the police requested notification from the hospital if she changed her visitor list. On July 30 and 31 of 1988, Detective James Stephens interviewed Mrs. Counterman, although because Mrs. Counterman was on a respirator and had been orally intubated, she was unable to communicate except by writing or nodding her head. During this interview, Mrs. Counterman indicated that her husband had started the fire with a cigarette lighter. When asked about his motive, she wrote “he wanted.” Detective Stephens then asked her whether they had fought, to which she responded, “yes.” Mrs. Counterman also told the police that she and her husband frequently quarreled, and that her husband was trying to hurt her and the children.</p>
    <p id="b564-6" data-blocks='[["BL_564.5",564,[209,1574,1160,628]]]'>On August 6, Detective Stephens interviewed Mrs. Counterman again. On this occasion, Mrs. Counterman was able to whisper. She stated that she knew that her husband had a cigarette lighter, because she heard him clicking the lighter downstairs. Mrs. Counterman acknowledged that her earlier statement to Sergeant Kochan, in which she indicated that her husband was in bed with her, was untrue. She also said that she feared her husband, and that he had abused her. She described their fight on the morning prior to the fire. She told Detective Stephens that her children awakened her to tell her of the fire, and that when she went to check on her husband, he shouted at her and told her to go back to bed.</p>
    <p id="b564-7" data-blocks='[["BL_564.6",564,[207,2224,1157,96]],["BL_565.1",565,[233,257,1153,751]]]'>Subsequent to August 6, Counterman spoke to his wife over the telephone and later visited her at the hospital. Because <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>Mrs. Counterman changed her visitor list to include her husband, hospital personnel notified the police, and she was interviewed again on August 22. During this interview, she related to Officer MacLean a version of events consistent with what her husband had told the police. When Officer MacLean contacted Detective Stephens regarding the change in Mrs. Counterman’s story, they decided to speak with her the next day, August 23. At this interview, Mrs. Counterman admitted that she had lied to Officer MacLean the day before and, once again, related to Officer MacLean and Detective Stephens the version of events she had provided in earlier statements. She also told the police that Counterman had threatened her and that she was afraid of him. Immediately after this interview, Counterman was arrested.</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[234,1058,1153,1241]]]'>During the guilt phase of trial, the Commonwealth presented expert testimony from Deputy Fire Chief Joseph D’Annibale, who expressed an opinion that the fire originated in an area between the refrigerator and a cabinet in the kitchen and dining room. He also concluded from the burn pattern on the stairway and dining room floor that approximately one gallon of liquid accelerant was used in starting the fire. Although no residue of the accelerant was found, Chief D’Annibale reasoned that the fire consumed all such material. Additionally, the Commonwealth presented expert testimony from Martin Wenzler, an insurance investigator, who also probed the cause and origin of the fire. Mr. Wenzler similarly concluded that an accelerant was used, testifying that a highly flammable liquid was poured on the stair area of the Counterman residence, through the dining room, and into the kitchen. Both Deputy Chief D’Annibale and Mr. Wenzler ruled out any mechanical cause of the fire. Because the doors to the Counterman home were locked from the inside, the Commonwealth’s experts reasoned that the fire was started by someone inside the home. Based upon the use of a large amount of accelerant and the location of the children, Deputy Chief D’Annibale and Mr. Wenzler concluded that the children did not start the fire.</p>

      <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>Counterman testified in his own defense and denied having set the fire. With some inconsistencies, he reiterated the substance of his statements to police that the children had awakened him and his wife, and that he had attempted to extinguish the fire before being forced from the house by smoke. Counterman’s defense centered upon the notion that the fire was started by someone else in the house, possibly his children. He presented expert testimony as to the cause and origin of the fire; however, his expert testified that the fire was intentionally set and that it did not originate from the couch.</p>

In mitigation, Counterman offered that he had no significant history of prior criminal convictions. 42 Pa.C.S § 9711(e)(1). He also sought to establish that his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired, 42 Pa.C.S § 9711(e)(3);<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> that he acted under extreme duress, 42 Pa.C.S § 9711(e)(5); and that the jury could find other evidence of mitigation concerning his character at the time of the offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8).</p>

Moreover, Mrs. Counterman testified to the abusive behavior Counterman exhibited during the course of their marriage and prior to the fire, when she rebuffed his sexual advances. She also testified to having seen Counterman in the location where the fire started holding a bucket and a cigarette lighter immediately before the blaze, as well as to Counterman’s subsequent threat to set her and the children on fire. The Commonwealth presented testimony from neighbors and bystanders as to Counterman’s statements and behavior during the fire, which were inconsistent with his own testimony and evinced a consciousness of guilt. In addition, the Commonwealth offered evidence of Counterman’s motives for setting the fire, including the argument with his wife, his financial difficulty, and the fact that the insurance policy on the residence was to expire the day after the fire.</p>

Credibility, of course, is within the sole province of the fact finder, in this case, the jury. Moreover, the jury in this case could have properly deduced that some of the inconsistency between Mrs. Counterman’s pretrial statements and her trial testimony resulted from Counterman’s intimidation, for which he was convicted. Furthermore, the scientific evidence established that the fire was intentionally set and that a flammable liquid was used as an accelerant. Counterman’s own arson expert testified contrary to Counterman in terms of the origin of the fire, admitted that the fire was intentionally set, and acknowledged that the burn patterns on the floor of the building were consistent with a pour pattern.
