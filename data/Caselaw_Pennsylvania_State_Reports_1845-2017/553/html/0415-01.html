At that time, Mucker became associated with a woman named Maryann Goldy. Mucker purchased methamphetamine from Goldy on several different occasions. On some of these occasions, Goldy had the methamphetamine with her; other times, she made a phone call to procure it.</p>
    <p id="b596-9" data-blocks='[["BL_596.8",596,[218,1182,1159,470]]]'>On one of these occasions, Mucker gave Goldy $340 for two “eightballs” of methamphetamine. Goldy then telephoned a man she referred to as “Frank.” A short time later, Goldy met Appellant in the bar. The pair then left the bar and met outside. Two other detectives, who were parked in a van about fifty feet from the bar, observed as Goldy handed Appellant cash in exchange for an unidentifiable item. Forty-five seconds after this exchange, Goldy handed Mucker the methamphetamine.</p>

On August 5, 1994, the jury returned a guilty verdict on the charges of delivery of a controlled substance and criminal conspiracy.

The lower courts seem to have concluded that the new rule has alleviated <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>Appellant of the obligation of listing all appellate issues in a 1925(b) statement as long as the issues not raised in the statement can be effectively reviewed from the record. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

We disagree with the conclusion of the Superior Court in these cases. The absence of a trial court opinion poses a substantial impediment to meaningful and effective appellate review. Rule 1925 is intended to aid trial judges in identifying and focusing upon those issues which the parties plan to raise on appeal. Rule 1925 is thus a crucial component of the appellate process.</p>

Failure to include an issue in the Post-verdict Motion resulted in it being waived on appeal and often led to subsequent attacks on the conviction claiming counsel’s ineffectiveness. New Rule 1410 was intended to eliminate this cumbersome process and allow the first appeal to address the issues properly raised before and during trial.</blockquote>
