It is only because nude dancing performances may generate emotions and feelings of eroticism and sensuality among the spectators that the State seeks to regulate such expressive activity, apparently on the assumption that creating or emphasizing such thoughts or <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>ideas in the minds of the spectators may lead to increased prostitution and the degradation of women.
