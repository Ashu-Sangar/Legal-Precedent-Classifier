    <p class="author" id="b350-8" data-blocks='[["BL_350.8",350,[287,799,513,39]]]'>FLAHERTY, Chief Justice.</p>
    <p id="b350-9" data-blocks='[["BL_350.9",350,[243,864,1155,256]]]'>The issue in this case is whether a possessor of land should be liable for injuries sustained by a police officer when the officer enters the land with no notice to the possessor in order to perform a police function not related to the land on which the injury occurred.</p>
    <p id="b350-10" data-blocks='[["BL_350.10",350,[242,1144,1159,578]]]'>On August 25, 1992 Nicholas Rossino was a police officer employed by Haverford Township, Pennsylvania. At about 10:30 p.m. on August 25, 1992 he was part of a team engaged in serving a warrant on a suspected drug house at 711 Haverford Road. The assignment of Rossino’s team was to secure the rear of the building while other officers went in the front. In order to accomplish this task, he and others crossed the vacant lot at 705 Haverford Road. While crossing this lot, Rossino alleges that he tripped on old chicken wire fencing that was obscured by weeds, and struck his knees on concrete blocks, seriously injuring himself.</p>
    <p id="b350-11" data-blocks='[["BL_350.11",350,[242,1747,1157,255]]]'>It is undisputed that although the raid on the suspected drug house was planned in advance, no one representing the police department contacted the owners or possessors of the property at 705 Haverford Road to request permission to enter the property.</p>
    <p id="b350-12" data-blocks='[["BL_350.12",350,[241,2026,1158,311]],["BL_351.1",351,[242,284,1152,357]]]'>711 Haverford Road, the target of the police raid, is adjacent to 705 and 701 Haverford Road. At the time of the accident, Bela and Martha Kovacs owned the properties at 705 and 701 Haverford Road. Titter Construction Co. had entered into an agreement with the Kovacs to demolish the building located at 705 Haverford Road and to construct a <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>parking lot in its place. When Rossino was injured, Titter’s subcontractor Main Line Paving Company, Inc. had demolished the building at 705 Haverford Road and had filled in the basement. Permits had been issued for additional construction work. At the time of the accident, the properties at 701 and 705 Haverford Road were unsecured and unmarked construction sites.</p>
    <p id="b351-5" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[240,676,1155,638]]]'>In February of 1994 the Rossinos filed a complaint seeking recovery for personal injuries sustained by Officer Rossino during the drug raid. The Kovaks and Titter Construction filed motions for summary judgment. Their theory was that Rossino was a trespasser and that the appellees had breached no duty which was owing to a trespasser, viz., to refrain from wanton and willful conduct. Rossino contended that he was a licensee and not a trespasser and that the appellees, therefore, had a higher duty of care than that applicable to a trespasser. The trial court granted the appellees’ motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Rossino was in fact a trespasser and that the appellees had not breached any duty toward him.</p>
    <p id="b351-6" data-blocks='[["BL_351.5",351,[242,1341,1150,528]]]'>On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed. The court determined that Rossino was on the Kovaks’ property in order to aid the execution of a search warrant, that he had not obtained the Kovaks’ permission to be there, and he was not on the property at the request of the Kovaks or to aid anyone on their property. On these facts, the Superior Court held that Rossino was a trespasser at the time of his injury and that no appellee had violated any duty owed a trespasser. The motion for summary judgment was, therefore, in the view of the Superior Court, properly granted.</p>

Rossino concedes that if he was a trespasser at the time of his injury, the duty of the landowner or possessor was merely to refrain from willful or wanton misconduct resulting in injury. He asserts, however, that as a licensee, the duty of the landowner or possessor was to warn <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>him of dangerous hidden conditions on the land that he knew or should have known existed.

A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to a licensee by a condition on the land if (1) the possessor knows or has reason to know of the condition and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to the licensee and should expect that the licensee will not discover or realize the danger; and (2) the possessor fails to exercise reasonable care to make the condition safe, or to warn the licensee of the condition and the risk involved; and (3) the licensee <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>did not know or have reason to know of the condition and the risk involved.

The trial court in the instant matter reasoned that a defendant property owner would owe the plaintiff officer or fireman a heightened duty only if the plaintiff entered the property in response to the defendant's call for assistance. However, section 345 contains no requirement that a police officer must be entering the property subject to the police activity on that property in order to be granted licensee status. Rather, section 345 requires only that the officer be acting “in the exercise of a privilege, for either a public or private purpose, and irrespective of the possessor's consent.” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 345(1).</p>
