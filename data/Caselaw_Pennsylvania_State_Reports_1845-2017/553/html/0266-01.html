Howard left the scene of the killing, stating that he was going home, and he subsequently fled to his mother’s residence in Georgia, where he was ultimately apprehended. Trial was conducted in September, 1989, and the jury returned verdicts of guilty on the charges of first degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a), and possessing instruments of crime, 18 Pa.C.S. § 907.</p>
