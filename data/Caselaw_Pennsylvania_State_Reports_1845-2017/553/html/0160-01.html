Since we find that this issue was not properly preserved for appeal due to appellee’s failure to lodge a timely objection to the trial court’s instruction, we reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b341-11" data-blocks='[["BL_341.10",341,[234,1414,1152,745]]]'>The relevant facts are as follows: On April 8, 1993, at approximately 3:30 a.m., Erie County Police Officer Tom Eberlein was on patrol when he observed a red Pontiac proceed across an intersection against a red light while traveling at a high rate of speed. Officer Eberlein pursued the vehicle for three city blocks. The Pontiac accelerated to a speed of approximately sixty or seventy miles an hour and ran two more red lights before the driver lost control of the vehicle which jumped the curb and came to a stop. Four people, including appellee, jumped out of the car and fled. Appellee was closest to Officer Eberlein, who pursued him first in his police vehicle, and then on foot. As he fled, appellee reached into his pocket and dropped a vial containing 3.7 grams of crack cocaine.</p>

Each of you must decide this case for him or herself. But only after there has been fair and impartial deliberation with your fellow jurors.

In post-sentence motions, appellee claimed for the first time that the supplemental instruction coerced the jury into reaching a verdict by implying that the jury would not be dismissed until it reached a unanimous verdict. The trial court denied relief, determining that the supplemental instruction was not coercive because the jury had deliberated for a mere one hour and thirty-five minutes before indicating its difficulty in reaching a verdict on the assault charge.

Requiring a timely, specific objection to be lodged in the trial court ensures that the trial judge has a chance to correct alleged trial errors and eliminates the possibility that the appellate court will be required to expend time and energy reviewing points on which no trial ruling has been made. <em>See Dilliplaine v.

This failure deprived the court of the opportunity to give a curative instruction if it felt that one was appropriate. Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1119 clearly requires that a timely objection be lodged in order to preserve error in the original instructions. The fact that appellee raised this issue in post-trial motions and in his statement of matters complained of on appeal and the trial court addressed the issue does not change the result. The appellant in <em>Dilliplaine </em>raised the issue of error in the trial court’s instructions in post-trial motions, and this Court found that the issue was nonetheless waived due to appellant’s failure to object.</p>

Contrary to Appellee's assertions, the trial judge did not state, or even indicate, that Appellee was guilty but merely recounted that there were only two people present during the alleged assault, each with differing versions of what occurred, and it was the jury's duty to determine who was telling the truth.</p>
