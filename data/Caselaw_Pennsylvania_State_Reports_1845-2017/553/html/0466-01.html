The child was left in the care of Sholcosky and his girlfriend, Cheryl Rollison, on March 12, 1993 while the child’s mother was working. Rollison left the house at 12:30 p.m., leaving the child alone with Sholcosky. When the child’s mother returned that afternoon, she found that the child was not breathing. Paramedics were called and the child was treated and transported to a local hospital. The child was revived and later transferred to Hershey Medical Center, where he died the next day at 1:00 p.m. after being removed from life support. An autopsy revealed a 2-1/2 inch skull fracture, massive hemorrhaging and swelling of the brain. The cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head. Sholcosky was arrested and charged with murder and other offenses.</p>

    <p id="b661-6" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[229,1038,1152,671]]]'>In this case, apparently as a matter of strategy, defense counsel chose not to explore before the jury the inconsistency between his expert’s trial testimony and pre-trial report when such inconsistency arose during the testimony. The defense having foregone its opportunity in this regard, the trial court should not be required to put before the jury a prior inconsistent expert report that is not the type of fact-based statement contemplated by <em>Brady </em>and that is not grounded in the testimony heard. Indeed, to allow two contradictory opinions, offered by the same expert, to go to the jury without explanation would inject confusion into the jury’s deliberations and require the jury to impermissibly speculate as to a critical fact.</p>
