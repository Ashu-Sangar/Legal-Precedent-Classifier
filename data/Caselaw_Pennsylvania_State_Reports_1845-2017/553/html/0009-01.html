Pursuant to the Pennsylvania Health Services Plan Corporations Act, 40 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq. and the contract entered into between the doctor and Blue Shield, the doctor submitted his claim to a medical review committee appointed by Blue Shield. On November 3, 1987 the committee denied the claims and ordered the doctor to repay $26,005, which it found had been improperly paid. On December 30, 1987 the doctor filed a contract action in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, and on March 20, 1992 the court ordered <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>that the case be heard by a panel of physician arbitrators. On February 15, 1994 the panel entered an award that Blue Shield must return the $26,005 which the Blue Shield medical review committee had ordered the doctor to repay, and also awarded the doctor $75,000 for other medical services. The trial court confirmed the award and after adding interest, it entered judgment against Blue Shield for $110,580.30.</p>
    <p id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[245,700,1163,960]]]'>Blue Shield appealed to the Superior Court, claiming that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the decision of the medical review committee. The Superior Court vacated the judgment of the trial court, holding that an award of a professional health corporation’s dispute review committee, promulgated pursuant to 40 Pa.C.S. § 6342(c), is not subject to de novo review, although it may be reviewed on the due process issues of lack of notice, opportunity to be heard, fraud or misconduct. One dissenting judge would allow de novo review of the medical review committee’s award on the due process ground that the committee, a majority of which were directors or members of the corporation, was not impartial. We granted allocatur in order to provide guidance on the question of what judicial review is available, if any, of the award of a medical review committee which conducted its adjudication pursuant to the contract between the parties and the Professional Health Services Plan Corporation Act, 40 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq.

The dissenter in the Superior Court, as indicated above, would allow de novo review in this case because, in the dissenter’s view, due process also requires an impartial tribunal, which was not present in this case because the committee selection process was inherently unfair.</p>
    <p id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.4",194,[249,909,1157,475]]]'>This court has held that “the requirement of due process of law extends to administrative as well as judicial proceedings.... ” <em>Commonwealth v.

Since the medical review committee is formed and functions pursuant to the terms of the regulatory act, it is a creature of the state, and like an administrative agency, is subject to due process review. The question then becomes the nature of the due process that is required in this setting.</p>
    <p id="b194-5" data-blocks='[["BL_194.5",194,[248,1409,1158,475]]]'>On the one hand, it is plain that the purpose of the regulatory act is to put medical claim review decisions in the hands of experts, i.e., physicians. It is less clear whether this forum of experts is intended to be the only forum. Neither the regulatory act nor the contract states that the medical review committee is the sole and exclusive forum. Regardless of the exclusivity of the forum, however, it would be absurd to conclude that the legislature would have contemplated an inherently unfair forum.</p>
    <p id="b194-6" data-blocks='[["BL_194.6",194,[247,1918,1162,419]]]'>The majority of the Superior Court is correct that due process requires that a person aggrieved by the award of a medical review committee is entitled to judicial review for notice and the opportunity to be heard in an appropriate forum and for fraud or other misconduct. But it is axiomatic that due process also requires that the forum be fair and impartial. Without that, the guarantee of notice, a hearing, and the right to be heard would be no more than an illusion.</p>

    <p id="b195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[219,716,1152,637]]]'>Since this panel was not, by definition, impartial, the doctor was entitled to some sort of review which could provide appropriate relief. If the bylaws of Blue Shield were written to include the possibility of an unbiased panel, a remand for a new hearing before a reconstituted and impartial panel would have been appropriate. In this case, however, the bylaws provide only for the creation of a per se biased panel. A remand for another medical review hearing before another panel, therefore, would necessarily have repeated the original error. For this reason, the trial court was correct in determining that the doctor was entitled to a de novo hearing in the court of common pleas on the merits of his claim.</p>

However, a closer examination reveals that each of the members of the Committee is appointed by the chairman of the Board of Directors of Blue Shield and a majority of those members must themselves be members of the Board of Directors or members of the corporation. The Committee therefore has every reason to be biased in favor of the company whose chairman appointed it and in keeping with its fiduciary responsibility to the financial interests of the corporation. If the bylaws are interpreted as to rule out de novo judicial review of such disputes, requiring a provider physician to agree to such terms is oppressive and therefore unconscionable since meaningful review is merely illusory.</p>

As a consequence, the provider physician is often “stuck” with making treatment decisions based, not in the best medical interests of the patient, but on likelihood of reimbursement. Thus, an unconscionable contract, driven substantially by economics favorable to Blue Shield, may ultimately result in the physician’s being hamstrung in providing the best possible medical care for the patient. I believe that such is contrary to the “beliefs of the people and ... their conviction of what is just and right and in the interests of the public weal ...” and, as such, requires this Court to interpret the intent of The Professional Health Services Plan Corporations Act to include impartial judicial review of the decisions of Blue Shield’s self-serving Medical Review Committee.
