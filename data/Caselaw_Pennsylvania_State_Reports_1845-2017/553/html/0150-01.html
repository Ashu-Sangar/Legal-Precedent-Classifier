    </p>
    <p class="author" id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[274,364,512,39]]]'>FLAHERTY, Chief Justice.</p>
    <p id="b332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[230,429,1157,151]]]'>The sole issue in this case is whether the warrantless stop by police of a car operated by suspects in a drug investigation was supported by probable cause.</p>
    <p id="b332-6" data-blocks='[["BL_332.6",332,[231,603,1157,584]]]'>The facts underlying this issue are as follows. In October of 1992 Hatboro police were informed by a confidential informant that one Richard Martin was selling methamphetamine, a controlled substance. As a result of their investigation, police determined that Anthony Constantino was probably the source of Martin’s supply, and as a result, they obtained a search warrant for 16 South Chester Avenue, Constantino’s residence. The warrant authorized a search for contraband, paraphernalia and drug records within the Constantino’s home, its outbuildings and curtilage and any vehicle or person at the premises.</p>
    <p id="b332-7" data-blocks='[["BL_332.7",332,[229,1210,1162,960]]]'>Shortly before police arrived to execute the warrant, Anthony and Mary Constantino left their home, driving a pickup truck. Police who were assigned to keep the residence under surveillance followed them. Other police who were assigned to execute the search warrant had not yet arrived to conduct the search of the premises. Approximately two and a half miles from the Constantino’s home, the truck stopped at a stop sign. At that point, police exited their vehicle and approached the truck with guns drawn, one officer on each side of the truck. The officer on the passenger side opened the door and told the passenger, Mary Constantino, that he possessed a search warrant for her home and believed she was transporting methamphetamine. Ms. Constantino stated: “the dope is in my purse.” Ms. Constantino was then arrested and taken back to her home. The search at the Constantino residence, conducted pursuant to the warrant, disclosed various drug-related items, including 73.41 grams of methamphetamine. At that point, Mr. Constantino was also arrested.</p>
    <p id="b332-8" data-blocks='[["BL_332.8",332,[228,2195,1162,149]],["BL_333.1",333,[221,289,1150,197]]]'>The Constantinos were both convicted of fourteen counts of various drug charges and each was sentenced to seven to twenty years imprisonment. Timely appeals were taken and <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>although several issues were raised before the Superior Court, at issue on this appeal is only whether it was error for the trial court to fail to suppress evidence seized as a result of the stop of the truck.</p>
    <p id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[220,534,1154,476]]]'>The trial court determined that at the time of the stop of the truck, Mary Constanino was not under arrest. Further, it held that no questions were asked of her, and that police “merely approached the vehicle to inform the occupants that their house was being searched pursuant to a search warrant.” The trial court also determined that Mary Constanino volunteered the statement about drugs in her purse, and that based on this statement, the officer had probable cause to search the purse.</p>
    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[219,1051,1154,1284]],["BL_334.1",334,[223,286,1157,93]]]'>On appeal, the Superior Court held that in assessing the lawfulness of the intrusion into the Constantinos’ liberty when the truck was stopped, a major consideration was that a valid search warrant for the couple’s home had been issued. Since the affidavit in support of the warrant established that the couple were probably involved in drug activity, it was proper to detain them and transport them back to the house where the search was being conducted. The court based this conclusion on <em>Commonwealth v. Reicherter, </em><a href="/pa-super/317/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="317 Pa. Super. 256" data-case-ids="89536" data-case-paths="/pa-super/317/0256-01">317 Pa.Super. 256</a>, <a href="/pa-super/317/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="317 Pa. Super. 256" data-case-ids="89536" data-case-paths="/pa-super/317/0256-01">463 A.2d 1183</a> (1983), where Reicherter was detained as he was riding in a friend’s truck away from his residence immediately before a search of his residence was begun. Authorities possessed a search warrant for Reicherter’s home. He was stopped several blocks from his residence and a pistol was found after he was searched. Superior Court upheld both the stop and frisk of Reicherter citing <em>Michigan v. Summers, </em><a href="/us/452/0692-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="452 U.S. 692" data-case-ids="1313927" data-case-paths="/us/452/0692-01">452 U.S. 692</a>, <a href="/us/452/0692-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="452 U.S. 692" data-case-ids="1313927" data-case-paths="/us/452/0692-01">101 S.Ct. 2587</a>, <a href="/us/452/0692-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="452 U.S. 692" data-case-ids="1313927" data-case-paths="/us/452/0692-01">69 L.Ed.2d 340</a> (1981). In <em>Summers </em>the Supreme Court held that where officers executed a valid search warrant for a home and encountered its owner leaving the building to be searched, they were justified in requiring him to reenter the building for the duration of the search. The Superior Court also held that Mary Constantino consented to the search of her purse, thus eliminating the need for probable cause. According to the Superior Court, police did <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>not request a search and, notwithstanding the police use of drawn firearms, there was no coercion.</p>

In <em>Melendez, </em>police were in the process of applying for a search warrant for the home of Melendez based on their belief that she and a companion were involved in illegal drug-related activity. Before the warrant was issued but while police had the property under surveillance, Melendez got in an automobile and drove away. Police followed Melendez and stopped her. They removed her from the car, searched her purse, where they found cash, a gun, and purported drug materials, and transported her back to her house, where they used her keys to gain entrance. They then held Melendez and another occupant of the house for approximately an hour until the warrant arrived. Melendez was stopped and searched, in essence, because she was a suspect in a felony investigation. We held that the stop and the search was impermissible under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>

Unlike in <em>Melendez, </em>a neutral magistrate had determined that there was probable cause that the vehicle in which Ms. Constantino was traveling contained contraband, and issued the search warrant that the police were about to execute.

There is, moreover, no question that the vehicle could have been searched pursuant to the warrant if it had remained at the Constantinos residence during the search, or that, if the police had executed the search warrant while the Constantinos were at home, the amount of drugs found on the premises would have given them probable cause to arrest Ms. Constantino and to search her purse incident to her arrest. In effect, the only significant factor that distinguishes this case from <em>Summers </em>is the distance between the house and the defendants at the time of their respective seizures. That distance, however, does not amount to a constitutionally-<a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>significant difference. <em>See U.S. v.

    <p id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[219,461,1158,1413]]]'>We have not previously held that Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution prohibits police from detaining an individual while executing a search warrant of that individual’s residence, as happened in <em>Summers. </em>This Court was quite careful, in <em>Commonwealth v. Rodriquez, </em><a href="/pa/532/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="532 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1835945" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0062-01">532 Pa. 62</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="532 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1835945" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0062-01">614 A.2d 1378</a> (1992), to distinguish <em>Summers. </em>In <em>Rodriquez, </em>the police officer entered an apartment building without a warrant and detained three women who were sitting on the front steps of the building. We noted two significant differences between <em>Summers </em>and the facts of <em>Rodriquez: </em>(1) the absence of a probable cause determination by a neutral and detached magistrate; and (2) the lack of a connection between the suspected criminal activity in the targeted residence and the persons actually detained. <em><a href="/pa/532/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="532 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1835945" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0062-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/532/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="532 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1835945" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0062-01">at 68</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="532 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1835945" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0062-01">614 A.2d at 1380-81</a>. We concluded that <em>Summers </em>did not apply, and went on to hold that the seizure in question violated the defendant’s rights under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. We did not, however, expressly state that seizures permissible under the Fourth Amendment pursuant to <em>Summers </em>would violate a defendant’s Pennsylvania constitutional rights. Nor did we address the question of the constitutionality under the Pennsylvania Constitution of <em>Summers </em>detentions in <em>Melendez; </em>rightfully so, because there was no warrant in <em>Melendez. </em>There is, therefore, no previous decision from this Court that prohibits <em>Summers </em>detentions under the Pennsylvania Constitution, and, furthermore, no reason for this Court not to apply <em>Summers </em>to this case.</p>
