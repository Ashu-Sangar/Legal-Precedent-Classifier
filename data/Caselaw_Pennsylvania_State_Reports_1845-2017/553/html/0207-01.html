The principal question is whether the common pleas court had jurisdiction when it directed that its prior order for a recount be stricken. The secondary question, which is relevant only if the first question is answered in the affirmative, is whether, on the merits, the striking of the <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>recount order was erroneous. Commonwealth Court held that the court did not have jurisdiction to strike the recount order. We reverse. We also conclude that the common pleas court ruled correctly in striking the recount order.</p>
    <p id="b389-4" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[213,550,1153,520]]]'>There were two candidates for the office in question. On November 7th, the county election board canvassed the returns and certified Appellant Marvin Shrawder as the winner, with 2121 votes. Appellee Robert B. Geiger received 2120 votes. On November 12th, Geiger filed a Petition to Open Ballot Box and Recount Vote as to each of the fifteen election districts involved. On November 13th, the common pleas court ordered a recount to be conducted on November 19th and 20th and appointed five individuals to perform the recount.</p>
    <p id="b389-5" data-blocks='[["BL_389.5",389,[214,1106,1152,302]]]'>The recount was conducted on November 19th. Each candidate received 2135 votes. The court entered an order that same day reporting the tie vote to the county election board and ordering that lots should be cast on November 21st to determine the winner. This was done and Geiger was declared the winner.</p>
    <p id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.6",389,[212,1444,1151,250]]]'>On November 24th, Shrawder filed a Petition to Dismiss and/or Set Aside the Recount Proceedings.

The court treated Shrawder’s petition as a timely appeal pursuant to Section 1407 of the Election Code, 25 P.S. § 3157, stating that Shrawder was an “aggrieved person, resulting from the casting of lots.” The court held that the lack of verification of the signatures on Geiger’s Petitions to Open Ballot Box and Recount Vote was a jurisdictional defect that could not be cured. Being a jurisdictional defect, it was not waivable and thus could properly be raised after the results of the casting of <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>lots had been reported by the court to the election board. The court noted in its Opinion, “had I recognized that the jurat on each petition was made only to the signature of Robert B. Geiger, “AS TO ROBERT B. GEIGER’S SIGNATURE,” I would not, as I have done in the past, ordered a recount because of the lacking verification.”</p>
    <p id="b390-4" data-blocks='[["BL_390.4",390,[244,641,1160,458]]]'>Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that once the results of the recount had been certified to the election board, the recount was final and could only be challenged by the filing of an election contest. The court cited <em>In re Ballot Boxes and Recount of Ballots Cast in General Election on November 3, 1959, of Justice of Peace and Township Commissioner (Appeal of Komoroski), </em>399 Pa.77, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.2d%20905" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="159 A.2d 905">159 A.2d 905</a> (1960), in concluding that the Petition to Dismiss was nonjusticiable after the results of the recount had been certified.</p>
    <p id="b390-5" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[244,1131,1160,308]]]'>Shrawder argues that the <em>Appeal of Komoroski </em>case cited by the Commonwealth Court is distinguishable. We agree. The appeal in that case was from an order refusing to vacate a recount. The Opinion, which is a mere four paragraphs, does not contain a detailed chronology of the events or pleadings. However, the final paragraph states</p>
    <blockquote id="b390-6" data-blocks='[["BL_390.6",390,[285,1455,1119,465]]]'>There was no legal basis for the petition to vacate the recount after the result thereof had been certified by the Recount Board to the County Return Board before the latter board’s canvass and computation of the votes cast at the election had been completed, <em>and the recount had become merged in the final official tabulation, as certified by the County Return Board. </em>The only procedure then for questioning the ultimate result was an election contest, and such the appellant did not institute.</blockquote>
    <p id="b390-7" data-blocks='[["BL_390.7",390,[241,1941,1161,412]],["BL_391.1",391,[211,320,1146,94]]]'>399 Pa. at 78, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.2d%20905" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="159 A.2d 905">159 A.2d at 906-07</a> (emphasis added). Thus it appears that Komoroski sought to vacate the results of the recount after the election board had certified the results of the election. In this case, the recount board reported its results to the court, which in turn reported the results to the election board and ordered the casting of lots, but although the lots were cast, Shrawder filed his Petition before the election board certified the results of the election (casting of lots). <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>Unlike <em>Appeal of Komoroski, </em>the matter of the recount in this case remained within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
    <p id="b391-4" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[208,439,1156,733]]]'>That having been said, we do not agree with the common pleas court’s characterization of Shrawder’s Petition as an appeal pursuant to Section 1407 of the Election Code, 25 P.S. § 3157. That section deals with appeals from decisions of county boards to the court of common pleas. The decision at issue here was the court’s own order directing a recount, not any decision or order of the recount board. See <em>In re Recount of Ballots of Albany Township (Appeal of Cullen), </em>392 Pa.602, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.2d%20389" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="141 A.2d 389">141 A.2d 389</a> (1958) (distinguishing between appeal from decision of a county board under Section 1407 and a recount proceeding under Section 1701). Regardless of how Shrawder’s petition is characterized, though, we conclude that the court acted within its authority when it reconsidered and ultimately vacated its previous orders.</p>

When the last of the districts was recounted, the court determined that certain ballots had been tampered with between the time of the tabulation by the election officers and the time of the recount. After determining how these ballots should be counted, the court certified the recount. The result caused the election to be a tie. Five days later, however, the court sua sponte revoked the certification of the recount as to the first fifteen districts to determine whether the same type of tampering had occurred in them as had been discovered in the last district to be recounted. Tampering was found in one. The court determined that erasures, which had caused ten ballots to be invalidated in the original recount, had been made after the original tabulation and before the recount. With these changes, the result was no longer a tie.</p>

      <em>In re Nomination Petition of Ross </em>is clearly inapposite and merits no discussion as it deals with the verification requirements for petitions to be placed on the ballot, not petitions for recount.
