He relies on the following language in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(4): <em>“If the Supreme Court determines that the death penalty must be vacated </em>for any other reason [i.e., reasons other than disproportionality or lack of evidence of aggravating circumstances], <em>it shall remand for a new sentencing hearing </em>pursuant to subsections (a) through (g).” Appellant reasons that because the statute does not specify what is to occur when courts other than this one vacate a sentence, the legislature must have intended that there would be no new sentencing hearing and that a remand for imposition of a life sentence would occur. Such an approach would lead, however, to a highly irrational sentencing scheme. Those whose sentences are vacated by this court would be in a far worse position than those whose sentences are vacated by other courts, since the former would be at risk of incurring another death sentence while the latter would not. The legislature cannot be deemed to have intended such an illogical result. See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (presumption that the legislature did not intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable).</p>

Appellant notes that, because we completed appellate and post-conviction review of this matter in 1986, this case was not pending before us at the time of the 1988 amendment. The statute contains no language, however, that makes it applicable only to cases pending in a particular court. In fact, the legislature expressly designated that the amendment should be applied to <em>“all </em>criminal cases <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>and appeals <em>pending </em>on the effective date of this act.” Act of 1988, Dec. 21, P.L. 1862, No. 179, § 3 (emphasis added).

We do not agree. The other murders, namely those in which Peter Levato and Marlene Sue Newcomer were victims, were committed prior to appellant’s trial in this case. No trials in the other cases had yet taken place. Hence, the convictions were simply not available for use at appellant’s original sentencing hearing. Regardless, it is well established that the Commonwealth may introduce new aggravating factors in the penalty phase of a second capital murder trial without providing an excuse for not having presented those factors in the first trial. <em>Commonwealth v.

Since the Nichols guilty plea was introduced in the Miller case, the district court determined that a second penalty proceeding was to be conducted in the Miller case and that evidence of the guilty plea in the Nichols matter was not to be introduced in the second Miller penalty trial. <em>Lesko v.

Lesko’s counsel argued principally that his client was at most guilty of felony-murder. He argued that in instigating the police chase, defendants planned first to divert the officer from the Stop-and-Go store, and later return to rob the establishment. Therefore, Lesko’s lawyer urged, the killing was not pre-meditated, but was the unintended result of a botched robbery attempt.</blockquote>

The jury could only have fairly evaluated the Commonwealth’s theory regarding Lesko’s state of mind by hearing evidence tending to show that <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>Travaglia and Lesko had jointly embarked that evening on a crime spree, that they had already committed a homicide likely to command the death penalty, that they had in their possession powerful evidence of their guilt of that homicide. Moreover, to be in a position to evaluate Lesko’s state of mind during the critical moments during the Miller encounter, the jury needed to hear sufficient details about these matters to be able to appreciate the nature of the evening’s joint undertaking, the relationship and mood of the participants, and the extent of the criminal exposure of those participants in the event of their apprehension by Miller.</blockquote>

Pa.R.Crim.P. 1126 provides that in capital felony trials involving one defendant, the Commonwealth and the defendant each has twenty peremptory challenges. That is a ratio of 10 challenges to every 6 jurors. However, in selecting alternate jurors, Pa.R.Crim.P. 1108 provides that each party is entitled to one peremptory challenge for each two alternate jurors.

Fourth, appellant offers no authority for the proposition that due process is violated merely by providing for a different number of peremptory challenges for jurors and alternate jurors.

The United States District Court subsequently determined that the Commonwealth reneged on the plea bargain between appellant and the county prosecutor. Although these errors required a reversal of the imposition of the death penalty, neither the Third Circuit Court of Appeals nor any other court has determined that the prosecutor’s conduct was an intentional attempt to impermissibly prejudice appellant. It was, instead, erroneous.
