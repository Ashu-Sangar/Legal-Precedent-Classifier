The Commonwealth Court remanded to the Unity Township Zoning Hearing Board with direction that the requested occupancy permit be granted. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b765-6" data-blocks='[["BL_765.6",765,[222,893,1152,411]]]'>Latrobe owns a 35-acre tract of land near Pleasant Unity, Pennsylvania, which was used as a stock-car speedway from 1977 to 1982. Between 1982 and 1994, no racing or other activity was conducted on the premises. The physical components of the racetrack, the track, grandstands, fence, light stands and out-buildings, remain on the property; however, these structures have deteriorated over the years to the extent that they are not usable for any purpose.</p>
    <p id="b765-7" data-blocks='[["BL_765.7",765,[219,1328,1155,617]]]'>On December 7, 1994, Latrobe leased the property to Appellee, Chester Aretta.

Unity Township’s zoning officer denied the permit on the grounds that the use of the property as a racetrack had been abandoned. The officer therefore concluded that Aretta’s use of the property as a racetrack would violate Section 118-42(C) of the 1991 ordinance, which provides:</p>

      <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>Aretta appealed the zoning officer’s denial to the Board. At the March 28, 1995 hearing before the Board, Latrobe’s sole stockholder testified that he never intended to abandon the use of the property as a racetrack. As evidence of his intent, he noted that he faithfully paid property taxes based on the property’s assessment as a racetrack. He also testified that he attempted more than 23 times to lease or sell the site as a racetrack before he finally entered into the lease agreement with Aretta.</p>
    <p id="b766-4" data-blocks='[["BL_766.4",766,[228,784,1157,314]]]'>The Board unanimously concluded, however, that because no racing activity had been conducted on the property for nearly 14 years, both before and after the zoning ordinance had been enacted, Latrobe had abandoned the previously permitted use of the property as a racetrack facility.

The court found that no abandonment analysis was necessary because Latrobe failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of showing that the property had nonconforming use status, i.e., by demonstrating that the property was being used for a nonconforming purpose at the time the 1991 zoning ordinance was enacted.</p>
    <p id="b766-6" data-blocks='[["BL_766.6",766,[227,1516,1160,691]]]'>The Commonwealth Court reversed, noting first that the issue addressed by the common pleas court was subsumed by the proper issue, namely, whether the nonconforming racetrack use had been abandoned by Latrobe within the meaning of Section 118-42(C) of the Township ordinance. The court pointed out that “[i]f the nonconforming use was abandoned, it would not have been in existence at the time of the enactment of the ordinance; if the nonconforming use was not abandoned, it was in existence at this time.” <em>Latrobe Speedway v.

While this principle is correct, neither <em>Ralph &amp; Joanne’s </em>nor <em>Heyman </em>involved, as here, a determination of whether an undisputed prior use of the subject property had been abandoned at the time the zoning ordinance took effect. In <em>Ralph &amp; Joanne’s, </em>the landowner’s proposed use of the property, a banquet facility, undisputedly did not pre-date the ordinance. In <em>Hey-man, </em>there was no dispute that the subject land, a four acre parcel of the landowner’s 169 acre parcel, was undeveloped and not used for any purpose prior to the development sought by the landowner therein. Accordingly, in those cases, it was clear that the uses at issue did not exist at the time the subject ordinances were enacted.</p>

Therefore, the significant question is whether this use was abandoned prior to the time the ordinance was enacted. If the use was abandoned, our inquiry ends since the use, unquestionably, would not have been in existence at the time the ordinance was enacted. If, however, the use was not abandoned, then it existed at the time the ordinance was enacted. Section 118-42(B)(1) of the Township’s zoning ordinance specifically permits the continuation of prior lawful uses existing at the time of its enactment. This section states:</p>

The stable portion of the building contained 25 horse stalls. The property was used for stabling animals until 1924, when the business utilizing the building ceased. In 1927, a zoning ordinance was enacted and the property in question was designated residential. A permitted accessory use of the property was for use as a “minor stable,” which allowed for the stabling of four animals. A “major stable,” which allowed for the stabling of more than four animals, was not permitted in the district pursuant to the ordinance. The ordinance, however, allowed for the continua<a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>tion of prior nonconforming uses except where the use had been discontinued.</p>

The zoning board denied the certificate based on its conclusion that at the time the zoning ordinance became effective, the property was not actually being used as a major stable. The lower court affirmed this decision, holding that because there had been no real or substantial use of the building as a stable since 1925, and, specifically, when the ordinance was enacted, a continuation of the prior use as a major stable was not warranted.</p>

It had use before, intent to continue, <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>and an effort made to effectuate the purpose.

Thus, a presumption of an intent to abandon the use of the property as a racetrack arose. Appellees, the party with the burden of persuasion, presented evidence to rebut this presumption. Specifically, as relied upon by the Commonwealth Court, Appellees provided the following evidence:</p>

Second, although the structures on the property are in disrepair, no attempt had been made to dismantle these structures or otherwise convert the use on this thirty-<a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>five acre tract. Third, since racing activity ceased, Latrobe has negotiated with twenty-three persons, aside from Aretta, for the sale or lease of the premises as a racetrack. That Latrobe was not able to come to terms with these persons indicates a financial circumstance explaining the non-use of the premises.</blockquote>

    <p id="b773-5" data-blocks='[["BL_773.5",773,[189,710,1154,684]]]'>We agree with the Commonwealth Court that the foregoing evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption that Appellees intended to abandon the use of the property as a racetrack. Thus, the burden of persuasion shifted back to the Township to demonstrate abandonment. As the Township failed to present further evidence, it clearly failed to sustain its burden of demonstrating that the use of the property for racing activity was actually abandoned for the prescribed period. Accordingly, the use of the property as a racetrack facility existed at the time the zoning ordinance was enacted. The Commonwealth Court, therefore, properly remanded the matter for the grant of Appellees’ requested occupancy permit.</p>
