Since his death was also the result of an asbestos-related occupational disease, Appellant maintains that she satisfied the requirements of Section 411(2). Like the Workers’ Compensation Judge, the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board rejected this argument because Sporio suffered from mixed dust pneumoconiosis during his lifetime and ultimately died from mesothelioma, a different disease. It stated that the Act should not be broadly interpreted so that any type of disability resulting from an exposure to a hazard at work is compensable. The Commonwealth Court agreed that unless Sporio’s mesothelioma is related to the condition for which he received benefits during his life, it is a new disease falling outside the three hundred week statutory period.</p>

Appellant states that since Sporio received benefits for asbestosis during his lifetime, she is entitled to benefits for the asbestos-related cancer that caused his death. We agree. While asbestosis does not medically progress to cancer, the legislature’s coupling of these two diseases together as an occupational disease supports a contemplation that both diseases would occur in workers exposed to asbestos and they should be treated as one occupational disease for purposes of workers’ compensation benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Furthermore, it is undisputed that Sporio’s mesothelioma resulted from his exposure to asbestos at work.
