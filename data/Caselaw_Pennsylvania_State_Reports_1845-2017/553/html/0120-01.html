Superseding cause allows the unforeseeable acts of a third party, someone or something other than the plaintiff or the defendant, to supplant the defendant’s conduct as the legal cause of the plaintiffs injuries. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 440; <em>see also Trade, </em><a href="/pa-super/442/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="442 Pa.

Thus, if the jury finds a superseding cause, then the defendant is relieved of any liability to the plaintiff. Comparative negligence, while a completely different concept, may have the similar effect of barring a plaintiffs recovery, assuming the plaintiffs relative fault in causing the injury is greater than the defendant’s fault. Comparative negligence denotes the negligent conduct of the plaintiff which is concurrent with the defendant’s negligent conduct. <em>See </em>Comparative Negligence Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 7102; <em>Elder v. Orluck, </em><a href="/pa/511/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="511 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1798694" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0402-01">511 Pa. 402</a>, 404, <a href="/pa/511/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="511 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1798694" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0402-01">515 A.2d 517</a>, 517 (1986). Under the Comparative Negligence Act, if the jury determines that the injuries were due more to the plaintiffs negligence than to the defendant’s then the defendant is relieved of any liability. <em><a href="/pa/511/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="511 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1798694" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0402-01">Id.</a> </em>Consequently, the plaintiff cannot recover against the defendant. Nonetheless, this identity of outcomes in no way makes comparative negligence, whatever the degree, the equivalent of superseding cause.</p>

Particularly, application of the doctrine of superseding cause would seem appropriate in a case in which a plaintiffs own intentional, unforeseeable conduct severs the <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>causal connection between the defendant’s negligence and the plaintiffs injuries.</p>
