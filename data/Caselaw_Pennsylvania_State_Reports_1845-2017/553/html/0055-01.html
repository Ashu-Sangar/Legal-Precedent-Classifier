At approximately 5:30 p.m. on March 28, 1994, appellant, who was then 20 years of age, drove to the residence of his 13 year old sister, Angela, in Corry, Pennsylvania. Angela asked appellant to pick up two of her friends, also juveniles, at another residence in Corry. Appellant and Angela proceeded to the home of Sue Ann, also 13 years of age, where they picked up Sue Ann and Michelle who was 15 years <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>of age. Appellant and Angela had previously brought Michelle to Corry from her family home in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, because Michelle wanted to run away from home. At the behest of Michelle, appellant proceeded to a location in Corry where he picked up two male juveniles, Steven and Lucas, each 12 years of age.</p>

Aware that they would need funds to continue their journey, appellant and the boys committed two additional burglaries on the way to Erie. At the first stop in Union City, Pennsylvania, they burglarized the home of Steven’s uncle. Appellant then drove to Waterford, Pennsylvania where he and the boys burglarized a garage and stole money from a truck within the garage, belonging to appellant’s stepfather.</p>

The next day the group spent some time at a mall in Erie and then decided to proceed to the state of Florida. During the trip to Florida appellant, with the aid of Steven and Lucas, committed additional burglaries and thefts. The journey came to an abrupt end on April 1, 1994 in Florida when the car appellant was driving was stopped by the police and everyone was taken into custody.</p>

Count 3 charged appellant with the transportation of a female juvenile to Florida without the permission of her parents, as well as encouraging the female juvenile to commit various criminal activities. Appellant was sentenced on October 21, 1995 to concurrent terms of five to eleven months incarceration and fined three hundred dollars ($300).</p>

These charges arose directly from the activities of appellant, Steven, and Lucas on the evening of March 28, 1994 for the burglary of Steven’s uncle’s residence in Union Township, Union City, Erie County, Pennsylvania.</p>

In the first Information appellant is charged with corrupting the morals of Steven, Lucas and Sue Ann by removing them from Corry, Pennsylvania on March 28, 1994, encouraging their <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>participation in various criminal acts, including burglary and theft, and transporting the juveniles to Florida where they were apprehended. The first information does not specify the location of the burglaries referenced in connection with the corruption charges. However, even without a specific delineation of which burglaries were at issue in the first Information, the burglary in Union City on the night of March 28, 1994 is temporally connected to the crimes appellant has already been convicted of, as the first Information charged criminal acts spanning from March 28, 1994 through April 1, 1994.</p>
    <p id="b244-5" data-blocks='[["BL_244.4",244,[226,859,1160,574]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that the crimes in the present information are not logically related to the prior charges as they do not involve the same conduct. Here, the Commonwealth focuses on the nature of the criminal acts: corrupting the morals of minors versus burglary and theft. This argument has surface appeal, but lacks substance. A logical relationship is not conditioned upon the duplication of identical criminal acts. A logical relationship exists where the sequence of criminal acts reveals a substantial duplication of issues of law and fact. <em>Bracalielly, </em><a href="/pa/540/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="540 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="472136" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0460-01">540 Pa. at 460</a>, <a href="/pa/540/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="658 A.2d 755" data-case-ids="472136,7872367" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0460-01,/a2d/658/0755-01">658 A.2d at 755</a>.</p>
    <p id="b244-6" data-blocks='[["BL_244.5",244,[224,1467,1159,583]]]'>In the present case, such a substantial duplication of issues of law and fact exists. The evidence to support appellant’s original conviction is the statement of appellant as taken by the Corry Police; the testimony and/or statements of Steven, Lucas and Sue Ann and Angela; the parents of the juveniles; and the Corry Police officers involved in the investigation. In the present prosecution all of the above witnesses will again be required to present the same testimony. Given that a high percentage of the testimony from the first trial must be repeated in the second trial, a substantial duplication of factual issues is obviously present.</p>
    <p id="b244-7" data-blocks='[["BL_244.6",244,[223,2077,1159,257]],["BL_245.1",245,[206,307,1154,1056]]]'>The only additional witnesses that would be called in the present trial, that were not needed in the first trial are the victim of the burglary and the State Police. Although two different police departments are involved there is nothing of record indicating that two different investigations were ongo<a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>ing, independent of each other, which led to the two separate prosecutions. To the contrary, the Corry Police were in possession of all relevant incriminating information regarding all the criminal activity set forth in both Informations prior to any involvement by the State Police. The Corry Police chose to forward the information to the State Police. The dual involvement of two different law enforcement offices is not sufficient to preclude joinder of charges given the facts of this case. <em>Cfi Bracalielly. </em>As for the legal issues, appellant’s first conviction for corrupting the morals of the minors was grounded on his encouraging and enticing the minors to commit burglaries and thefts. The second Information also charges burglary and theft, the variation in the form of the criminal charges cannot disguise the commonality of the legal issues within the two informations. Thus, we find that the present charges did arise from the same criminal episode as the first set of charges as all of the criminal acts are temporally and logically related. Accordingly, we find that all four factors necessary to bar the present prosecution under § 110 have been met.</p>
    <p id="b245-5" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[208,1393,1153,955]]]'>Returning to the policy considerations which guide our review of this question, it is undeniable that the policy goals of § 110 would be thwarted by separate trials in this instance. Appellant will be forced to undergo two criminal prosecutions when all the evidence necessary to support both prosecutions was within the hands of the Commonwealth at the same time. The vast majority of the witnesses will be forced to give up their time and again undergo the pressure of courtroom testimony, to repeat in the second trial virtually everything that was stated in the first trial. Both trials tax the resources of the same District Attorney, almost identical law enforcement personnel, and the same judicial system. The Commonwealth offers no reason for the unnecessary duplication caused by the failure to join the charges in this matter. Having found the four factors of § 110(1)(ii) to be met in this case, we further find that the purpose of the compulsory joinder rule would be violated by permitting the present prosecution to go forward.</p>

      <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that even if we find the criminal acts at issue constitute a single criminal episode, the present prosecution is not barred because of the exception found in § 110(iii)(A).
