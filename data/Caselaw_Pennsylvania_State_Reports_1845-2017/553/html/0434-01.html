We do not see this language as an unambiguous directive that the trial judge, and not the jury, should make the threshold determination of whether the plaintiff has indeed suffered a serious impairment of a body function. Of course, the language cited does plainly restrict a limited tort elector’s recovery to those situations where he can establish that he has sustained a serious injury. However, the statute is utterly silent as to which entity—the judge or the jury—is entrusted with making that threshold determination. Thus, as the plain language of the statute offers no directive on whether the judge or the jury should make this decision, we must now ascertain the intent of the legislature in enacting the limited tort option.</p>

One of the legislative purposes in enacting the limited tort option as part of Act 6 was to lower insurance premiums by reducing the number of small claims for pain and suffering; the intent was that by lowering insurance premiums, automobile owners who had been pushed out of the insurance market because of skyrocketing costs could once again obtain affordable motor vehicle insurance. <em>See Legislative Journal-House, </em>No. 11, February 7, 1990, pp. 202, 223.</p>

In striking such a balance, the legislature rejected attempts to insert language which would have made the question of whether a limited tort elector had suffered a serious injury one for the trial judge to determine rather than the jury. One such attempt was made by Senator Scanlon on December 11, 1989 when he introduced an amendment which would have altered the limited tort option so that it read that “[t]he determination of whether an injury constitutes a serious injury shall be a question of law and not a question of fact.” Scanlon Amendment, A-4129, Printer’s No. 2829.

As to the first factor in the <em>DiFranco </em>test, it is the use of Appellant’s right foot that has been impaired. The next question to be answered is whether this impairment of the use of Appellant’s right foot was serious. The evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to Appellant, shows that Appellant was immediately treated in a hospital emergency room, where his injuries were diagnosed as consisting of contusions, sprains, and strains; he was discharged from the emergency room within a few hours. He missed four or five days of work at his full-time job, and missed approximately four of his weekly shifts at his part-time job. Approximately six months after the accident, one of Appellant’s physicians stated that there appeared to be some type of joint arthritis or coalition in the right foot, and that Appellant might need to utilize orthotic heel lifts; his physician also injected one shot of cortisone. Finally, at his deposition approximately one year after the accident, Appellant indicated that although his foot caused him pain approximately every other week, he was still able to perform his work duties and, aside from having to utilize a riding mower, he was able to engage in his normal daily activities.</p>

Appellant’s injuries as <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>diagnosed by the emergency room physician were mild and he was discharged after a few hours. Furthermore, he missed only four or five shifts at both his full-time and part-time jobs, where he was required to perform most of his work while on his feet. Also, the treatment for his injuries was not extensive. Finally, although some type of arthritis or coalition is affecting one of the joints in Appellant’s right foot, the injury seems to have had little or no impact on Appellant’s performance of his job functions and engagement in personal activities. Therefore, although the evidence, when taken in the light most favorable to Appellant, does show that he was injured in the accident, the impairment resulting from that injury is clearly <em>de minimis.</em>

In arguing this, Appellant focuses primarily on Dr. Bream’s pronouncement that there was some type of arthritis or coalition in Appellant’s right foot; apparently, Appellant assumes that this evidence alone is sufficient to bring the matter to a jury. Appellant seems to have misapprehended the nature of the inquiry here. The question to be answered is not whether Appellant has adduced sufficient evidence to show that Appellant suffered <em>any </em>injury; rather, the question is whether Appellant has shown that he has suffered a <em>serious </em>injury such that a body function has been seriously impaired. Clearly, it is insufficient for Appellant to show that there has been some injury—no matter how minor—in order to avoid the entry of summary judgment against him. Were we to fail to require Appellant to adduce evidence that not only was there an injury, but that it was also serious, before allowing him to present his case to the jury, we would make a mockery out of the summary judgment standard. Although Appellant has introduced evidence that there is some type of arthritis or coalition in his foot, he has failed to show that this injury has had such an impact on him so that it constitutes a serious injury.

    <p id="b630-6" data-blocks='[["BL_630.7",630,[206,646,1162,1174]]]'>It is initially for the trial court, not the jury, to decide whether a plaintiff has suffered a “serious injury” which, for purposes of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d), allows suit to be maintained for noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering, where limited tort coverage has been elected under an auto insurance policy. Section 1705(d) states in pertinent part: “Unless the injury sustained is a serious injury, each person who is bound by the limited tort election shall be precluded from maintaining an action for any noneconomic loss....” In cases where there is no genuine issue of fact as to the nature and extent of the plaintiffs injury, the question of whether the action can be maintained is one for the trial court. In providing the limited tort option, the legislature intended to reduce both litigation and the cost of insurance. To permit cases where plaintiffs claim serious injury to go to the jury without first having the court determine whether the injury is a serious one could prove as expensive as an unrestricted right to sue, and would not substantially rein in costs of insurance and litigation. Permitting the trial court to make the threshold determination as to the seriousness of an injury, where there is no issue of fact as to the nature and extent of the injury, much better serves the legislative goal.</p>
