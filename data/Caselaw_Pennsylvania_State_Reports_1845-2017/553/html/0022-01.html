In <em>Finn, </em>the plaintiff had been walking on a sidewalk adjacent to city-owned property in Philadelphia when she slipped on an accumulation of grease. The plaintiff argued to this Court that because the accumulation of the grease constituted a dangerous condition “of the sidewalk” under § 8542(b)(7), an exception to the general rule of governmental immunity applied. <em>Finn, supra, </em><a href="/pa/541/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="541 Pa. 596" data-case-ids="470765,470792" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0596-01,/pa/541/0596-02">541 Pa. at 599</a>, <a href="/pa/541/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="664 A.2d 1342" data-case-ids="470765,470792,7879558,7879726" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0596-01,/pa/541/0596-02,/a2d/664/1342-01,/a2d/664/1342-02">664 A.2d at 1343</a>. The City argued that in order to pierce its shield of governmental immunity, a claim involving government property must establish that an actionable dangerous condition of government property derives or originates from the property in question and may not arise from a source outside the property. Because grease does not derive or originate from the sidewalk itself, the City argued that it is not a defect “of the sidewalk” and thus that the plaintiffs injury was not encompassed by the relevant exception.</p>
