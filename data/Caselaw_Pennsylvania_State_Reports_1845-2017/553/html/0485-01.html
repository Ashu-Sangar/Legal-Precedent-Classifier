At the conclusion of the penalty phase hearing, the jury found one aggravating circumstance, the killing of a police officer acting in the line of duty,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and one mitigating circumstance, no significant history of criminal convictions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Finding that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstance, the jury returned a verdict of death.

It was farther alleged that Ms. Jones would testify that she, indeed, succumbed to this police intimidation and accordingly altered her testimony at trial by repudiating her true eyewitness account that she saw two men flee the scene immediately after the shooting. This court ultimately entered an order remanding the matter to the PCRA court to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding this claim. After holding a hearing thereon, the PCRA court disagreed with Appellant’s contention; specifically, the court concluded that the testimony of Ms. Jones did not constitute “after-discovered evidence.” Alternatively, the court ruled that even assuming such testimony were to be incorporated into the record, her testimony was of such an incredible nature that it would provide no relief to Appellant.</p>

The car was driven by the appellant’s brother, William Cook. After making the stop, Officer Faulkner called for assistance on his police radio, requesting a police wagon to transport a prisoner. While Faulkner was trying to handcuff Cook, the appellant ran from across the street and shot the officer once in the back. Faulkner was able to fire one shot, which wounded the appellant, but after Faulkner had fallen to the ground the appellant shot him four more times at close range; once through the center of the face. The appellant was found slumped against the curb in front of Cook’s car and taken into custody by police officers who arrived on the scene within thirty to forty-five seconds. The officers had been in the area and were turning onto Locust Street from Twelfth Street in response to Faulkner’s radio request. They were flagged down by a cab driver who had witnessed the shooting while stopped at the intersection of Thirteenth and Locust. Two other pedestrians also witnessed the incident and identified the appellant as the perpetrator, both at the scene and during the trial.</blockquote>

Our review of the record evidences, first, that during trial in 1982, Judge Sabo displayed no such adversarial position towards Appellant. Rather, we find evidence therein that quite the contrary was true; that it was Appellant who, from the very beginning of the trial proceedings, openly criticized Judge Sabo and repeatedly asserted that he would not abide by the court’s rulings.

(N.T. 8/1/95 p. 22). Officer Wakshul explained the omission of the information regarding Appellant’s confession in the first statement by saying that he was emotionally overwrought after hearing Appellant state that he had shot the officer and then seeing the body of Officer Faulkner on a gurney and that he remembers little of what transpired after he heard Appellant’s exclamation. (N.T. 8/1/95 p. 71). Specifically, Wakshul testified that when Appellant uttered this confession, Wakshul was so stunned that he stumbled into an alcove and began to cry. He then went outside in an effort to regain his composure. He testified that upon his eventual return, he remembers little else but having seen Officer Faulkner’s feet on a gurney. Admitting that his recollection after leaving the hospital was somewhat weak, Wakshul testified that he remembered being in the Homicide Unit and, after leaving there, crashing his vehicle into a cement pole. (N.T. 8/1/95 pp. 25-26). He testified that he and Officer Faulkner were friends and that the fact that a police officer was killed was trying. (N.T. 8/1/95 p. 5). He explains the second statement by saying that he was simply answering very specific questions relating to specific items and was not asked whether he had heard the admission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> (N.T. 8/1/95 p. 64).</p>

Appellant claims he was unable to muster an attack on this confession for the following reasons: first, because the prosecution engineered his absence; second, because the trial court erred in denying the defense a continuance so as to secure the presence of Wakshul; and third, because trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call Mr. Wakshul.</p>

First, as noted above, Wakshul testified that his failure to report the confession in his initial statement was due to his emotional state at that time. The PCRA court found this explanation credible. Where, as here, there is record support for a PCRA court’s credibility determinations, we, as a reviewing court, are bound by those determinations. <em>Beasley, </em><a href="/pa/544/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="544 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="463559" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0554-01">544 Pa. at 564-566</a>, <a href="/a2d/678/0773-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="678 A.2d 773" data-case-ids="11740422,463559" data-case-paths="/a2d/678/0773-01,/pa/544/0554-01">678 A.2d at 778</a>.

Wakshul testified that at the time he gave the third statement, in response to the Internal Affairs Bureau investigation, he was not aware that Ms. Durham had given a similar statement. (N.T. 8/1/95 pp. 47-48). Wakshul testified that he did not know Durham. (N.T. 8/1/95 p. 48, 117). In addition, Durham testified at trial that she told no one but her superiors about her statement given the day after the shooting. (N.T. 6/24/82 pp. 48-52).</p>

We note that the PCRA court explicitly found incredible trial counsel’s statements at the PCRA hearing, to wit, that it was counsel’s fault alone that he did not make a timely attempt to call Officer Wakshul at trial. The court further found that it was Appellant’s decision, and not that of trial counsel, to call Officer Wakshul at the last minute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> The court’s findings <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>here are supported by the record.

He further testified that he did remain at his home for the beginning part of his vacation, which lasted from June 25, 1982 through July 8, 1982, but that when he was not notified that he was to appear, he left the city during the latter part of this vacation.

Eye-witness testimony at the trial established that the defendant was wounded and sitting on the curb a short distance from the fallen officer when Ms. Jones would have peered around the corner. Whether two men were running towards the officer or away from the officer, it is clear the incident between the officer and the defendant was over when Ms. Jones made her observations. The defendant was found sitting on the curb a few feet away from the police officer he had shot to death. Defendant’s emptied gun was found nearby. Eyewitnesses independently identified the defendant as the shooter. Defendant boasted in front of witnesses that he had killed the officer.

      <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>Our review of the record reveals ample support for the court’s findings as set forth above. Moreover, even assuming the truth of Jones’s PCRA testimony, we cannot conclude that Appellant has proven a <em>Brady </em>violation. Her testimony reveals that she was almost a block away, and that after hearing the shots, she did not even look in the direction of the shooting for a few minutes because she was afraid. In addition, contrary to the assertions of the defense, her December 15, 1981 statement does not even mention someone “fleeing from the scene.” Rather, she stated only that she saw two persons jogging, presumably away from the fallen officer. Accordingly, testimony to that effect would do little to support the defense theory that the true shooter fled the scene. Also, the jury heard her claim during her original trial testimony, that police tried to get her to implicate Appellant when she was taken to the station in January 1982. Finally, she never portends to have witnessed the actual shooting. Accordingly, there is nothing exculpatory about her statement. Thus, this claim warrants no relief. <em>See, Green, </em>supra.</p>

Hightower testified at trial that as he and his friend were walking towards their car, they heard gunshots being fired and shortly thereafter, saw someone wearing a red and black sweater running in a direction opposite the site of the shooting. (N.T. 6/28/82 pp. 28.122-126). This testimony was consistent with two prior statements he had given to police. The defense called him to testify at the PCRA hearing for the purpose of establishing that he had taken a polygraph examination at the behest of the police. It is Appellant’s contention that Hightower was subjected to this polygraph for the purpose of intimidating him. In support thereof, Appellant submits that PCRA testimony establishes that Hightower was the only witness subjected to a polygraph; that the results of that polygraph show <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>that he was telling the truth; and that during the polygraph, he was not even asked about whether he saw someone run from the scene.

(N.T. 8/3/95 pp. 27, 71). However, Lieutenant Craig Sterling, the detective who administered the polygraph to Hightower, testified that the test revealed, and that he so told Hightower, that he had not been telling the whole truth about the shooting. (N.T. 8/4/95 p. 124). It appears that the test revealed that Hightower was not being truthful when he was asked whether he saw a gun in Appellant’s hand on December 15, 1981 and he answered “no.” (N.T. 8/3/95 p. 66).</p>

Singletary testified that while being interviewed, he was asked to write a statement respecting his observations of the shooting incident. He testified that he attempted to complete two or perhaps three such statements, but that after each statement was complete, the detective read it and then ripped it in pieces and threw it in the trash. Detective Green then told Singletary to write what Detective Green wanted him to write or else he would be beaten and his business would be destroyed. Accordingly, Singletary then wrote what the detective dictated and after that statement was typed, Singletary signed it. (N.T. 8/11/95 pp. 210-212). The substance of that statement was that as he was stopped at a red light at 13th and Locust Streets, he heard what he initially thought to be firecrackers, but soon realized it was not firecrackers because they were going too <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>fast. He looked down Locust Street and saw a police car parked at the curb. He then parked his own vehicle and exited it. He proceeded to the southwest corner of 13th and Locust from where he observed two figures some twenty-five to thirty feet away. One was standing facing the wall; the other with his back to the wall, bent over at the waist. As he began to walk towards these two figures, someone yelled to him that a policeman had been shot. He then saw a policeman sitting on the ground with his back against the wall with his blood covered right hand to his face. The other person, an African-American man with dreadlocks and wearing green pants, was sitting on the curb, holding his leg that was stretched in front of him. After the fallen officer was placed in a police car and transported elsewhere, Singletary encountered Officer Vernon Jones with whom he was familiar.

The first specific claim focuses on Deborah Kordansky, who allegedly also saw someone fleeing, and who was unavailable at trial allegedly due to the prosecution’s deliberate withholding of her address and phone number. Kordansky, who, at the time of the murder, lived in an apartment located at 13th and Walnut Streets from where she could overlook the scene of the shooting, gave a statement to police on December 9, 1981. Her testimony at the PCRA hearing, which was consistent with that statement, was that between 3:45 and 4:00 a.m. on that date, she heard several shots that she thought were firecrackers, and then heard sirens. (N.T. 8/3/95 pp. 232, 235). <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>When she heard the sirens she looked out her window, saw some eight to ten police vehicles and saw someone running down the street. (N.T. 8/3/95 p. 240). She was questioned extensively respecting the sequence of events to which she was testifying, and remained steadfast that at the point that she saw a person running, the police had already arrived on the scene. Contrary to Appellant’s contentions, trial counsel did contact Kordansky by phone during the time of trial. Kordansky told counsel during that conversation that she doubted she could be of assistance to the defense. (N.T. 8/3/95 pp. 210-212).</p>

Her testimony is simply not corroborative of the defense theory that the true shooter fled the scene since her testimony places someone running well after the police and emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene. Accordingly, even assuming the truth of Appellant’s claim that he was unable to locate Kordansky at the time of trial due to the prosecution’s actions, that claim would not provide PCRA relief since Kordansky’s testimony was not material. <em>See, Green, supra.</em>

He testified that also in the line-up was a neighborhood friend of his, Kenneth “Poppy” Freeman, to whom he had loaned his driver’s license. He testified that Freeman was a partner of Appellant’s brother, William Cook, in a vending stand operation where Howard himself sometimes worked. Howard also claimed he saw a person known to him as “Sweet Sam,” an alleged pimp in the Center City area of Philadelphia, also being held by police. Howard testified that he witnessed “Sweet Sam” being escorted away by two men in suits and that he never saw “Sweet Sam” again. When asked, Howard identified “Sweet Sam” as Cynthia White’s pimp.

While in the restaurant he saw Appellant, with whom he was familiar, on the sidewalk outside and quickly left to talk to Appellant. While outside, the two men heard loud arguing whereupon Appellant began to walk through a parking lot towards the noise and Harmon followed. At that point, Harmon heard a shot and when he looked in the direction where he heard the shot, he saw an officer fall. According to Harmon, the officer was laying with his back against a wall with his gun visible. While Harmon stopped walking when he heard this shot, Appellant continued in the direction of the fallen officer. Harmon then heard a second shot and saw Appellant fall. Harmon claimed to have seen someone running down Locust Street in the direction of 12th Street after the first shot was heard. Then, shortly after hearing the second shot and seeing Appellant fall, Harmon saw a car pull up, someone alight from that car and shoot the officer again, and then get back into the car and drive off.

When she then looked out her window, she saw several police officers beating a black man with their sticks and kicking him. She claimed to hear the officers shouting: “kill the black m....f...er” and “beat the shit out of the black m.. .f.. .er.” (N.T. 8/9/95 pp. 112-115). She testified that the man she saw was being beaten so bad that she thought he might die. (N.T. 8/9/95 p. 125).

Since there is support in the record for the court’s finding respecting the testimony of Smith, this court is bound by that finding. <em>Beasley, supra. </em>The PCRA court also found her testimony that she was unavailable at trial to be not credible. Essentially, the PCRA court found significant the fact that Smith never explained why her alleged reasons for not coming forward with this information sooner ceased to have an affect on her willingness to testify in 1995. As noted previously, in reviewing credibility determinations we, as an appellate court, give deference to the trier of fact’s assessment of a witness’ trustworthiness since it is the trier of fact who had the opportunity to personally observe the demeanor of the witness. <em>Farquharson, supra. </em>After giving such deference to the PCRA court’s findings regarding Smith, and having found sufficient support in the record for those findings, we conclude that Appellant’s claim that Smith’s testimony constitutes newly discovered favorable evidence is without merit.</p>

Following closing arguments at the PCRA hearing, counsel for Appellant indicated that he wished to call William Cook, but that Cook’s counsel, Daniel-Paul Alva, wished to first make certain representations to the court respecting his client. Following some further discussion, it was determined that Mr. Alva would have Cook in the courtroom the following day. However, when the court reconvened the following day for that express purpose, Appellant’s counsel represented that he was not successful in securing William Cook’s presence, and, instead offered Cook’s attorney, Mr. Alva, to explain Cook’s absence. Respecting whether or not William Cook was “unavailable” at the time of trial due to an assertion of the Fifth Amendment, Mr. Alva commented only that he was informed that “it had been decided that he [William Cook] would not testify.” (N.T. 9/12/95 p.8). As such, Appellant has failed to establish that William Cook was unavailable at the time of trial. Further, contrary to Appellant’s assertions, the court did not refuse to continue the matter until Cook could be located.

However, as discussed previously, the alleged promise of penal benefits in connection with Chobert’s suspended license was not proven by Appellant to actually exist. Moreover, the prosecutor did not personally vouch for the credibility of Chobert, but merely argued from the evidence that his testimony supported a guilty verdict. Such argument is permissible. <em>Chester, supra.</em>

It is not entirely clear from this trial testimony at what point Durham is claiming that La-Grand was present. Arguably, the challenged comment of the prosecution implies that this testimony established that La-Grand was present when Appellant allegedly made the confession that he had killed Officer Faulkner and, thus, may not be fair representation of the original testimony. On review, we cannot conclude that this representation had the unavoidable effect of prejudicing the jury to the point that it could not render a true verdict. First, the comment was an isolated occurrence. Moreover, the statement itself, when viewed against the evidence the jury heard during trial on this issue, was ambiguous enough so as not likely to have led the jury to believe, as Appellant suggests, that LaGrand, too, heard Ap<a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>pellant’s confession.

To do so, a defendant must demonstrate that he/she is of a cognizable racial group; that the prosecution has exercised peremptory challenges to exclude members of that racial group from the panel of venirepersons; and finally, that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to exclude venirepersons on the basis of race. Implicit in this scheme is the notion that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that allows for such discrimination by those who have a design to discriminate. <em>Commonwealth v. Dinwiddie, </em><a href="/pa/529/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="529 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1831180" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0066-01">529 Pa. 66</a>, 69-71, <a href="/pa/529/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="529 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1831180" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0066-01">601 A.2d 1216</a>, 1218 (1992).

It now appears, via a stipulation, that there may have been two more African-American venirepersons stricken by the prosecution. That evidence does not alter our original conclusion. Significantly, in concluding on direct appeal that Appellant failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, we stated: “... we have examined the prosecutor’s questions and comments during <em>voir dire, </em>along <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>with those of the appellant and his counsel, and find not a trace of support for an inference that the use of peremptories was racially motivated.” <a href="/pa/521/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="521 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1817450" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0188-01">521 Pa. at 198</a>, 555 A.2d at 850.

The PCRA court correctly ruled that this precise claim has been repeatedly rejected by this court. <em>See, e.g. Commonwealth v.

Contrary to Appellant’s intimations, our review of the record reveals that Appellant did not raise this precise argument, but rather raised the issue addressed by the PCRA court.

It appears that during the course of the trial, an African-American woman juror had asked the court crier if she could go home to tend to her sick cat and was told, after the crier had consulted with Judge Sabo, that she was not permitted to leave. This juror nevertheless left that same evening without notifying anyone, returning to the hotel several hours later. When confronted upon her return, she commented: “I don’t care what Judge Sabo or anybody says, I do what I have to do. Nobody is going to stop me.” Prior to the beginning of testimony the following day, a conference was held in the judge’s chambers respecting numerous issues, one of which involved Ms. Dawley’s violation of sequestration. Present during the relevant discussion was the judge, the court crier, the prosecutor and Appellant’s counsel, Anthony Jackson. It appears that Appellant was not present due to the court’s prior ruling barring him from the proceedings due to his misbehavior. Given this juror’s open defiance of the court’s sequestration order, the judge, with the concurrence of both counsel, determined that the juror should be removed. <em>(See </em>N.T. 6/18/82 pp. 2.35-2.47). It was discussed at this hearing that during <em>voir dire </em>this particular juror had openly expressed a dislike for Appellant.

Rather, Judge Sabo was justifiably concerned that the jury remain free from external influence. The court evidenced a legitimate concern for the integrity of the jury. <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>Rule 1108(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a trial court may seat an alternate juror whenever a principal juror becomes unable or disqualified to perform his or her duties.

However, the PCRA court made a credibility determination that Jackson was not credible when he testified to such. The court found as a fact, that Appellant chose to exercise personal control over his trial strategy, including, specifically, the selection of character witness during the guilt phase. Also, the court found that it was Appellant who chose to read a statement at the penalty hearing and that Appellant never consulted with counsel regarding this statement. In short, the court found that Appellant’s steadfast refusal to cooperate with his counsel continued in the penalty phase. Our review of the record leads us to no different conclusion. As noted previously, where, as here, an accused makes his own strategic choices at trial, he has no recourse for those choices in the form of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em><a href="/pa/506/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="506 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1790932" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0228-01">Id.</a> </em>Accordingly, since the record supports the PCRA court’s conclusion that the failure to present mitigating witnesses was as a result of Appellant’s own choosing, this court is bound thereby and Appellant’s claim, thus, warrants no relief.</p>

A persistent theme of the prosecution’s closing was that Appellant believed himself to be above “law and order.” This argument was made in response to the defense’s closing argument which attempted to discredit the aggravating circumstance “killing of a police officer.” In essence the defense argued that there should be no distinction between killing just anyone and killing a police officer. Pertinent to the instant claim of Appellant, the prosecution argued that Appellant’s lack of concern and respect for the law and <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>society was demonstrated by his murder of this police officer.

This claim is devoid of merit. First, Appellant recites only a portion of the actual comment made by the prosecution. The challenged remarks were uttered as part of the prosecution’s discussion of the law regarding the jury’s statutory duties upon the finding of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The challenged comments correctly conveyed the law. The prosecution correctly stated that once the jury determines that one or more aggravating circumstance outweighs any mitigating circumstance, section 9711(c)(iv) mandates that the sentence be death. This mandatory sentencing scheme has since been found to be constitutional. <em>See Blystone v.

The Court noted that had the prosecution offered the evidence it initially claimed it had which would demonstrate that this is a white racist gang associated with drugs and violent escape attempts at prison and that this gang advocates the murder of fellow inmates, the Court would likely have found no error in admitting evidence of the defendant’s membership in that gang since the violent nature of that gang would be relevant to rebut evidence of the defendant’s good character.

The crux of Appellant’s argument on this point is that the structure of the form was such that the jury would be led to believe that unanimity was required in order to find, and thus consider, a mitigating circumstance. Appellant’s argument regarding the structure is:</p>
    <blockquote id="b745-7" data-blocks='[["BL_745.6",745,[240,1680,1114,354]]]'>The jury’s completed verdict form showed one aggravating circumstance and one mitigating circumstance.

This argument is without merit. In <em>Mills, </em>the Supreme Court vacated a sentence of death on the basis that the judge’s instructions, together with the verdict form, created a substantial probability that reasonable jurors may have believed that they were barred from considering mitigating evidence unless all twelve jurors agreed on the existence of any given circumstance. The form employed in <em>Mills </em>contained printed instructions for both the section respecting aggravating circumstances and that for mitigating circumstances. These instructions were identical but for the respective burdens of proof. In both, the term “unanimously” was used.

The requirement of unanimity is found only at page one in the section wherein the jury is to indicate its sentence. The second page of the form lists all the statutorily enumerated aggravating circumstances and includes next to each such circumstance a designated space for the jury to mark those circumstances found. The section where the jury is to checkmark those mitigating circumstances found, appears at page three and includes no reference to a finding of unanimity.

Significantly, the PCRA court cited <em>McCleskey </em>for the proposition that a claim of constitutional violation cannot be established merely upon an allegation that a certain percentage of murderers sentenced to death in Pennsylvania are African-American. Appellant submits this was an erroneous application of that ease since the PCRA court precluded his proffered evidence to support the claim. Appellant’s claim is disingenuous. As the PCRA court noted, Appellant proffered nothing more than conclusory statements; he never offered to present facts in support thereof. As noted by Appellant, <em>McCleskey </em>requires proof of discriminatory intent; accordingly, the PCRA court’s citation to <em>McCleskey </em>was proper.</p>

In any event, there was no error committed here, and, thus, nothing on which to seek correction. Appellant’s counsel did, indeed, inform the jury that life imprisonment meant precisely that and that parole was an unlikely event. Contrary to Appellant’s assertion, the trial court’s interruption of the summation was not done in a manner so as to instill in the jury’s minds the notion that some persons <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>sentenced to life imprisonment are “out in a few years.” (Brief of Appellant at p. 117). Appellant’s counsel was not interrupted until after he informed the jury as to the harshness of a sentence of life imprisonment and that the jury should realize that a sentence of life would likely be just that. Upon review of this particular portion of the defense summation, we cannot conclude, as suggested by Appellant, that the jury would have believed that the imposition of a life sentence might have resulted in Appellant being released from prison. Instead we find that the jury was informed of precisely what Appellant now argues he was entitled; that a defendant sentenced to life is not likely to receive parole.</p>

Appellant contends that many of the issues raised in his PCRA petition are based on evidence outside the trial record and that, therefore, they could not have been presented fully on direct appeal.

Prior to the initiation of cross-examination of Chobert at trial, a side bar conference was held to determine whether the defense was permitted to question Chobert regarding his prior record for arson; a crime for which he remained on probation at the time of trial. During this conference, the defense argued that because the witness had been paid for committing this arson, such conviction qualified as <em>crimen falsi </em>and the defense should, therefore, be permitted to cross-examine the witness as to that crime. The trial court ultimately ruled that arson did not qualify as <em>crimen falsi </em>and, accordingly, precluded the cross-examination. Appellant now claims that such a ruling was in error. In support thereof, he claims that the conviction could have been used to establish bias of the witness given his probationary status. He argues both trial court error in not allowing the questioning for purposes of establishing bias and trial counsel's failings for not pursuing such a claim. Appellant implies that, notwithstanding the fact that the defense specifically offered this evidence only to impeach credibility, the court should have recognized the value of this evidence in exposing alleged bias. The trial court, however, had no duty to present Appellant’s case. Moreover, at the time of trial, the law allowed evidence tending to show bias only where there was a pending indictment and the prosecutor's ability to grant leniency. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Coades, </em><a href="/pa/454/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="180" data-cite="454 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="579865" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0448-01">454 Pa. 448</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20896" class="citation" data-index="181" data-cite="311 A.2d 896">311 A.2d 896</a> (1973). It was not until 1986 when this area of the law was expanded to allow questions tending to show that the witness may expect leniency even absent any such promises on an outstanding charge. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Evans, </em><a href="/pa/511/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="511 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1798719" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0214-01">511 Pa. 214</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="183" data-cite="511 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1798719" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0214-01">512 A.2d 626</a> (1986).

Appellant asserts that the trial court's ruling precluding further questioning of Jones regarding this alleged conversation in January 1982, was improper. However, Appellant offers no argument in support thereof. It appears from a reading of the record that the court's ruling was, at least in part, based upon finding that this line of questioning was irrelevant since the proffer regarding Jones’ testimony was only that she would testify as to what she saw on December 9, 1981. In its opinion following the remand hearing, the court noted that this additional questioning was not permitted since the witness had already testified concerning this conversation of January, 1982. Appellant subsequently claimed in his brief following the remand hearing which specifically involved this issue regarding Jones, that the court's ruling prejudiced him.

While, indeed, there was no request by Appellant, nor a directive of this court, for the PCRA court to determine whether this allegedly "newly discovered evidence” should be added to the record, the court's ruling to that effect simply reflects the court's legal conclusion that the evidence does not constitute “after-discovered evidence.” In any event, the PCRA court properly complied with this court’s order and the testimony from this supplemental hearing has been made part of the record.</p>

At this second remand hearing, it was Appellant's contention that the inducements and/or coercion of Jenkins was at the behest of one,Officer Thomas Ryan. Jenkins testified that she met Officer Ryan approximately one year prior to the shooting when he stopped her for truancy while she was attending Simon Gratz High School. (N.T. 6/26/97 p. 82). Respecting the shooting, it was Jenkins' testimony that Officer Ryan escorted her to police headquarters the Saturday following the shooting where she was then placed in an interrogation room where Officer <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>Ryan and another officer attempted to pressure her into incriminating Appellant.

However, in rebuttal, the Commonwealth offered evidence that Jenkins could not have had these alleged contacts with Officer Ryan at the time's she testified they occurred. First, the Commonwealth offered evidence that Officer Ryan did not become a police officer until December 21, 1981. That date post-dates both the date of the alleged truancy stop and the date of the alleged interrogation. Also, the custodian of records for the Philadelphia School District, confirmed that Jenkins was enrolled at Simon Gratz between January 19, 1982 and December 6, 1982.</p>

In connection with this argument, Appellant further submits: "[t]he prosecutor went on to tell the jury that his mother told him that very morning: 'Joe, if you can come up and kill a police officer, who is going to protect me?’ and invoked the ‘constant battleground that we have during the course of every day in this City,' remarking ‘we are one step from the jungle without the opportunity of individuals to enforce the law.’ ” (See N.T. 7/3/82 pp. 65-66). These excerpts, obviously taken out of context, were made as part of the prosecution’s response to the defense claim that the murder of a police officer should not be an aggravating circumstance. When read in context they are fair response. Contrary to Appellant’s intimations, these remarks did not <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>improperly attempt to persuade the jurors to sentence Appellant to death on the basis of any fact other than that he killed an officer; a factor which has clearly been recognized as worthy of the imposition of the death penalty given its status as an aggravating circumstance. <em>LaCava, </em><a href="/pa/542/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="194" data-cite="542 Pa. 160" data-case-ids="458423" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0160-01">542 Pa. at 192-194</a>, <a href="/a2d/666/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="195" data-cite="666 A.2d 221" data-case-ids="12043856,458423" data-case-paths="/a2d/666/0221-01,/pa/542/0160-01">666 A.2d at 237</a>.</p>

At the penalty phase of Appellant's trial, Appellant himself presented a statement which has been referred to as a "plea in mitigation.” The prosecution was then permitted to cross-examine him. Counsel for Appellant then proceeded to give the closing argument for the defense.</p>

Appellant here refers to the proffered testimony of one Professor John Lamberth who, according to the offer of proof, interviewed approximately thirty-five persons who had been jurors in death penally cases before one particular judge, Judge Jackson. The offer of proof further provided that, as a result of those interviews, Dr. Lam-berth had formed opinions about jurors in general. Apparently, it was proposed that he would testify regarding those opinions. The court precluded this testimony on the grounds that it was not only irrelevant, but also inadmissible. Not only was this proffered testimony irrelevant, but, as noted previously herein, a juror may not impeach or invalidate a verdict by his or her testimony. <em>Patrick, supra. </em>The court, thus, properly excluded this proffered testimony.</p>
