Court appointed counsel met with Appellant on one occasion and advised him to enter guilty pleas to the charges against him. Counsel informed Appellant that in his opinion, the court would sentence him to a range of <em>7½ </em>to 12 years imprisonment, although sentencing would depend on the victim impact statements received by the court. At a hearing on July 25, 1994, Appellant appeared before the court and entered open pleas of guilty to all the charged crimes. The court conducted an on-the-record colloquy where Appellant stipulated that the Affidavits of Probable Cause to each arrest warrant could be accepted by the court as the factual basis for the plea. The court accepted the pleas and deferred sentencing until September 7, 1994. The court then inquired of Appellant’s counsel regarding whether Appellant was aware of his right to ask that his plea be withdrawn, to which counsel replied that he was. The court then in<a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>formed Appellant that if he sought to withdraw his plea he should do so “before I sentence you,” noting that his “right to withdraw or take back [the] plea at a later date [would] be severely limited” and “much harder to do.” N.T.

Despite Appellant’s statement that his basis for seeking to withdraw his pleas was that he was “not guilty,” the court focused on the validity of the plea colloquy, stating:</p>

An on-the-record colloquy was conducted prior to the court’s entrance of appellant’s pleas.

In reversing the judgment of sentence and granting a new trial, we again stated that “a request [to withdraw] made before sentencing has been generally construed liberally in favor of the accused.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20268" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="299 A.2d 268">Id.</a> </em><a href="/pa/450/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="450 Pa. 185" data-case-ids="1947087" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0185-01">450 Pa. at 190</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20268" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="299 A.2d 268">299 A.2d at 271</a>.

September 7, 1994 at 4. Moreover, even if Appellant had not made this initial declaration, given the liberal standard articulated in <em>Forbes </em>and the lack of prejudice to the Commonwealth, Appellant’s admission that he was not innocent of all the crimes charged should not have defeated his requested withdrawal. The Superior Court attempted to apply a new standard whereby participation in a plea colloquy results in a defendant’s waiver of the rights established by this Court pursuant to <em>Forbes.</em>
