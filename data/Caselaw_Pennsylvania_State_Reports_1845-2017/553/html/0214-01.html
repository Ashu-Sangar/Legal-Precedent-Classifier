Where no attendant is present and a student must cross a <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>roadway, the School Bus Manual directs the bus driver to remain in his seat, visually clear the roadway and signal to the student to cross.

Lee was distracted momentarily; when he looked at the mirrors again, he saw the front of a car traveling in the parking lane along the left side of the bus.

The plaintiff prevailed at trial in a civil action against the city, in which she contended that the driver had been negligent in placing the stairs.

Along with using mirrors and checking traffic, the Pennsylvania School Bus Driver’s Manual requires drivers to give a signal to alighted passengers.
