It asserts that the Uniform System of Accounts divides total operating revenue into two categories. The first category is entitled “Sales of Electric Energy” which includes all revenue sources constituting sales of electricity and specifically excludes late payment charges. The second category, “Other Electric Revenues,” includes an account called “forfeited discounts,” which is defined to include charges “to customers for failure to pay bills within a specified time.” PP &amp; L contends that because 52 Pa.Code § 57.42(a) requires that it utilize the Uniform Systems of Accounts of the FERC, the term “sales of electric energy” should be examined in light of its use in the accounting system.</p>
