The Court summarized the facts giving rise to appellant’s conviction as follows:</p>
    <p id="b477-6" data-blocks='[["BL_477.6",477,[223,954,1155,1149]]]'>On June 16, 1988, the victim, Sally Weiner, received a telephone call purporting to be from a congressman’s office asking that she meet with the caller to discuss arrangements for the presentation of a civic award to her husband, to which she agreed. The next day, around noon, she drove to the designated meeting place, parked her car, and was never seen alive again. Several hours later, her husband, Harry, manager of the Corry, Pennsylvania office of Pennbank, received a telephone call playing a recorded message from his wife explaining that she had been kidnapped and that the kidnapper demanded ransom money from the bank. Mr. Weiner was directed to retrieve a duffel bag from the parking lot outside his bank; the bag contained additional threats and instructions. Mr. Weiner called a vice-president of the bank, as well as the bank’s security office, local police, state police, and the FBI. Mr. Weiner never received the additional radio instructions necessary to follow the directions contained in the duffel bag and therefore could not comply with the kidnapper’s demands. Two days later, on July 19, 1988, Sally Weiner’s body was discovered in a rural area north of her home. She had died as a result of a single gunshot wound to the back of her head.</p>
    <p id="b478-3" data-blocks='[["BL_478.3",478,[234,296,1160,474]]]'>
      <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>Initial investigations by the FBI, state police, and local police resulted in the discovery of a series of computer-generated notes and instructions, each one leading to another, which had been concealed at various hiding places in and around Corry. The investigation also produced several possible suspects, including appellant, who owned a nearby bookstore, who had experienced unproductive transactions with Mr. Weiner’s bank, and who had a negative personal relationship with the Weiners.</p>
    <p id="b478-4" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[233,811,1160,413]]]'>An examination of trash discarded from appellant’s bookstore revealed drafts of the ransom note and the ransom directions. Subsequent search warrants resulted in the seizure of an array of remarkably comprehensive evidence against appellant. This included evidence tying appellant’s fingerprints, computer, weapons and ammunition, clothing, automobile, and materials from his home and office to both the victim and the murder site.</p>
    <p id="b478-5" data-blocks='[["BL_478.5",478,[231,1273,1163,1067]],["BL_479.1",479,[229,288,1150,88]]]'>Appellant’s fingerprints appeared on the original ransom note and on some of the hidden notes. Police discovered rough drafts of the ransom note, a map of the hidden notes, and notes and directions in appellant’s handwriting, some of which bore his fingerprints. Appellant had a collection of guns; ballistics evidence established that two of these could have been used to kill the victim. He also had “glazier” ammunition, a nonstandard composition bullet designed to fragment on impact after entering a body, the same type used to murder the victim. A metal rod traced to his home had been used to secure one of the hidden notes. Crepe paper from a roll found at his store had been used to help secure another note. Human female skin tissue was found on his clothing. Tread marks matching appellant’s automobile tires were found at one hiding place and at the murder scene. Finally, appellant’s computer contained a series of drafts and amendments of the texts of the phone call to Mr. Weiner, the ransom note, the series of hidden notes, and a twenty-two point plan for the entire kidnapping scheme. On direct appeal, this Court unsurprisingly concluded that the above-<a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>related facts were sufficient to support the conviction and sentence of death.</p>

Specifically, appellant argues that the trial judge erred by declining to allow trial counsel to ask the following question: “Do you believe that a death penalty verdict should occur in every case where the defendant is found guilty of first-degree murder.” However, the trial court rejected the question proffered by trial counsel, not on the basis that life-qualifying of jurors was impermissible, but rather on the basis that the question itself was overbroad, ambiguous, and meaningless to jurors, since they had not yet been furnished a definition of “first-degree murder.” Trial counsel did not attempt to amend the question after this ruling. Therefore, the claim that appellant now raises must be construed as a claim that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to seek to life-qualify jurors in a proper fashion. It is well-settled in this Commonwealth that although trial counsel is permitted to attempt to life-qualify jurors, counsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to seek to do so. <em>Commonwealth v. Hardcastle, </em><a href="/pa/549/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="549 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="18399" data-case-paths="/pa/549/0450-01">549 Pa. 450</a>, 454-56, <a href="/a2d/701/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="701 A.2d 541" data-case-ids="11898539,18399" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0541-01,/pa/549/0450-01">701 A.2d 541</a>, 543 (1997); <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, trial counsel was not ineffective for his omission in this regard, and appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue a frivolous claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness. Moreover, the record reveals that during the <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>individual voir dire, trial counsel did have the opportunity to life qualify jurors on an individual basis. Thus, any putative ineffectiveness stemming from trial counsel’s failure to properly life-qualify the jurors during the general voir dire was transparently non-prejudicial.

This testimonial assertion simply did not reflect the reality of appellant’s selective non-responsiveness to certain highly relevant questions, and the prosecutor properly pointed this out by confronting appellant with his invocation of silence in response to the question pertaining to Friday, June 17. Appellant may not assert to a jury that on the one hand he was entirely cooperative with investigators but on the other hand not place before that same jury the fact that he belatedly invoked his right to remain silent to refuse to answer the most incriminating questions put to him. Not only would such a situation be misleading to the factfinder, but it would allow appellant to convert the Fifth Amendment shield into a sword which could not be countered by the prosecutor’s further inquiry or fair comment thereon.

Appellant fails to bridge the mountain of alleged facts and the mountain of conclusions to be drawn therefrom with even the smallest pebble of reasoning. This failure is undoubtedly attributable to the fact that the Commonwealth’s expert entomologist opined that the victim was not killed until sometime between 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.; therefore, the asserted inconsistency in the time the victim was supposedly kidnapped and when she was reportedly seen by the two witnesses, even if credited by the jury, would be inconsequential.
