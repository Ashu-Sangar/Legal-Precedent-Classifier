With respect to my employment as an Assistant District Attorney, I find that there is no basis for my recusal based upon such employment, since I personally neither contributed to, nor participated in, the prosecution of appellant’s case.

Given the enormous volume of criminal cases processed in Philadelphia County, it is virtually impossible for any duly-elected District Attorney administering such a caseload to be personally familiar with the details of each and every criminal case and appellate proceeding prosecuted by the over 225 Assistant District Attorneys, Chiefs, or Deputy District Attorneys employed in that office. Indeed, with respect to appellant’s matter, despite my position as District Attorney while his appeal was pending, I did not participate personally in the Office’s appellate response to his appeal or otherwise gain knowledge of information exclusively within the control of the District Attorney’s Office by virtue of my position. The mere placing of my name on the Commonwealth’s brief as a formal administrative requirement fails to demonstrate that I was, <em>per se, </em>personally and directly involved with the prosecution or appeal of appellant’s case such that a claim for recusal would be colorable.</p>

Appellant attempts to support this claim with references to entirely unrelated matters. Specifically, appellant claims that my public support of a particular Assistant District Attorney in the wake of certain judicial rulings in an unrelated case somehow affects my ability to judge the behavior of other prosecutors who handled this case. Such a claim cannot rationally be addressed because there is simply no logical connection between my public comments regarding a particular prosecuting attorney in a completely different matter, who had no connection with this case, and my determination of this matter.</p>

In <em>LaCava, </em>which appellant does not acknowledge in his Application for Recusal, the Court determined that an Assistant District Attorney in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office had engaged in misconduct in the death penalty phase of a case involving the murder of a Philadelphia police officer such that a reversal of the death penalty was warranted. Despite appellant’s argument to the contrary in the instant matter, my rulings, whether adverse to or favorable to an appellant, or whether they involve my former office or any other prosecuting agency, are based solely upon the law.

Appellant’s stated conviction that the FOP’s endorsement of my candidacy warrants my recusal is belied by appellant’s failure to seek the recusal of any other Justice due to an FOP endorsement in their respective elections to this Court.
