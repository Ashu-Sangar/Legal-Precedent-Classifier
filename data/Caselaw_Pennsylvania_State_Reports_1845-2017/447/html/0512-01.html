Prior to trial, the plaintiff directed a timely interrogatory to the defendant seeking to ascertain if the defendant were covered by liability insurance at the time of the accident and, if so, the identity of the insurer and the maximum amount of the insurance coverage. Objections to the interrogatory were overruled by the trial court, and (he defendant was directed to answer the interrogatory within twenty (20) days. Subsequently, when the defendant failed to comply with this directive a rule issued to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court. Following a hearing before the court at which the defendant refused to divulge the information sought to be ascertained by the interrogatory, he was adjudged in contempt of <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>court and fined the sum of one hundred (f 100) dollars.

    <p id="b588-4" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[186,511,1147,594]]]'>Under Article III, §302 of the “Appellate Court. Jurisdiction Act,” Act of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, 17 P.S. 211.302, jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of a court of common pleas in personal injury actions is in the Superior Court. The order instantly appealed arose from a personal injury action instituted by the plaintiff and as such is cognizable on appeal as part of the original action. See <em>Commonwealth v. Harris, </em><a href="/pa/409/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="409 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1883327" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0163-01">409 Pa. 163</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20586" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="185 A.2d 586">185 A. 2d 586</a> (1962), and <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

And as we stated in <em>Knaus v. Knaus, </em><a href="/pa/387/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="387 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1271028" data-case-paths="/pa/387/0370-01">387 Pa. 370</a>, 377, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.2d%20669" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="127 A.2d 669">127 A. 2d 669</a> (1956), “where the act of contempt complained of is the refusal to do or refrain from doing some act ordered or prohibited primarily for the benefit of a private party, proceedings to enforce compliance with the decree of the court are civil in nature.” See also, <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
