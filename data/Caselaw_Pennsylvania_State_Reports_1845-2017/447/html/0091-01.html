The benchmark decision in this area is <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579 (1824), wherein the following language was employed: “We think, that in all cases of this nature the law has invested Courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes; and, in capital cases especially, Courts should be extremely careful how they interfere with any of the chances of life, in favor of the prisoner. But, after all, they have the right to order the discharge; and the security which the public have for the faithful, sound, and conscientious exercise of the discretion, rests, in this, as in other cases, upon the responsibility of the Judges, under their oaths of office.” Id. at 580. Mr. Justice Story for the majority therein developed the manifest necessity doctrine which in certain cases allows the trial judge to declare a mistrial without jeopardy attaching. Since 1824, the Supreme Court has consistently expanded on this theme. The classic example of properly declaring a mistrial without jeopardy attaching is where the jury is unable to agree. <em>United States v. Prez, </em>supra; <em>Keerl v.

A power in government <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>to subject the individual to repeated prosecutions for the same offense would cut deeply into the framework of procedural protections which the Constitution establishes for the conduct of a criminal trial.

The main difficulty with this position is that appellant confuses an inference with a rebuttable presumption. A rebuttable presumption is a means by which a rule of substantive law is invoked to force the trier of fact to reach a given conclusion, once the facts constituting its hypothesis are established, absent contrary evidence. See 9 Wigmore, Evidence, §2491 (3rd ed. 1940). An inference is no more than a logical tool enabling the trier of fact to proceed from one fact to another, if the trier believes that the weight of the evi<a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>dence and the experiential accuracy of the inference warrant so doing. A rebuttable presumption forces the defendant to come forth or suffer inevitable defeat on the issue in controversy. An inference, on the other hand, does not put the defendant in such a position. It does not shift the burden of going forward with the evidence, for the trier of fact can reject the inference in whole or in part. Moreover, an inference does not shift the burden of persuasion or relieve the Commonwealth of the burden of proving every essential element of the alleged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. See 9 Wigmore, supra, at §2513.</p>

The upshot of its analysis of its prior case law on the subject was thus stated: “. . . a criminal statutory presumption must be regarded as ‘irrational’ or ‘arbitrary’, and hence unconstitutional, unless it can at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.

To use the <em>Leary </em>formulation, I believe that practical human experience allows it to be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact (that of <em>knowledge </em>of the stolen character of the goods) “is more likely than not” to flow from the proved facts, above stated, on which the assumed fact is made to depend.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Moreover, when we considered <em>Owens, </em>it <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>was my belief, still held, that the particular presumptions treated in <em>Owens </em>and <em>Lewy, </em>respectively, were quite distinguishable, notwithstanding that each was bottomed on possession of goods.

As I indicated in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Whitner, <em>supra </em>(concurring opinion), neither of these crimes includes any element of continuing possession of stolen property. To sustain a conviction of burglary there must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused entered a building with the intent of committing a felony. To sustain a conviction of larceny, there must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused took and carried away the personal property of another with the specific intent of depriving the owner permanently of the property. Unquestion<a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>ably, these elements of the two crimes under consideration, like other crimes, can be proved by circumstantial evidence. Possession may be an important link in a chain of circumstantial evidence, and it concededly supports an inference, if not a presumption, that <em>someone </em>stole the goods. I find it difficult to believe, however, that it is more likely than not that the possessor was himself the burglar and the thief, or that, even if such an inference is permissible, it is the equivalent of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the elements of the two crimes in issue.</p>
