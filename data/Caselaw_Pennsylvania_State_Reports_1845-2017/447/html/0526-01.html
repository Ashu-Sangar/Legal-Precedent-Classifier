On February 22, the respondent, a Democrat and the incumbent Representative for the 3rd Congressional District, filed objections to the Moore nomination petitions. The following day, February 23, the court ordered that a hearing on the objections be held February 28 and directed that notice of the time and place of said hearing, together with a copy of the objections, be served personally upon the appellant or upon an adult member of his family by February 25. The hearing was convened on February 28 as ordered, at which time appellant’s attorney entered a “special appearance” to challenge the manner of personal service on his client. Respondent introduced an affidavit of service of one Stephen K. Lubell, supplemented by Lubell’s direct testimony, to the effect that on the 2áth of February Lubell had entered appellant’s law office in Philadelphia and there handed copies of the objections and the notice of <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>hearing to one Jones, who held himself out as an agent authorized to receive service.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Service was effected shortly after noon on February 29 when copies of the objections and court order of February 28 were handed to appellant personally. On March 1, counsel for appellant again appeared specially to contest jurisdiction. This time he did not dispute the return of personal service, but asserted that the court was without power to issue its February 28 order continuing the hearing and allowing further time for service. Upon conclusion of his argument, counsel for appellant withdrew and the hearing proceeded on the merits <em>e® parte. </em>Later the same day the court entered the order appealed from, which both dismissed the challenge to jurisdiction and set aside appellant’s nomination petitions. Following a denial of rehearing, this appeal was taken.</p>

The question has been previously raised and decided by our Court. In <em>American Labor Party Case, </em><a href="/pa/352/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="352 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="464121" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0576-01">352 Pa. 576</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%2048" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="44 A.2d 48">44 A. 2d 48</a> (1945), the Court observed: “Clearly the legislature intended all provisions of Section 977 to be mandatory. It could not, however, constitutionally impose upon the courts mandatory duties pertaining to the exercise of the judicial function: Socialist Labor Case, supra, 80 [<a href="/pa/332/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="332 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1186558" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0078-01">332 Pa. 78</a>, 80]. As applied to all others, the provisions are mandatory.” The Court in <em>American Labor Party Case, supra, </em>held, accordingly, that the requirement that a petition specifying objections to a nomination petition be filed “within seven days after the last day for filing said nomination petition or paper” is mandatory. On the other hand, the statutory stipulation that the court must make an order fixing a time for hearing which shall be not later than ten days after the last day for filing the nomination petition is an encroachment on the judicial function, and thus is considered directory merely and not mandatory. <em>Socialist Labor Case, </em><a href="/pa/332/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="332 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1186558" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0078-01">332 Pa. 78</a>, 80, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20A.2d%20831" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 A.2d 831">1 A. 2d 831</a> (1938).

In contrast, not only the continued hearing date of March 1, but also the original hearing date of February 28, were beyond the statutory ten day limit. Appellant does not challenge the February 28 date, apparently recognizing that the schedule of the Commonwealth Court would not permit an earlier time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Appellant would have us hold, however, that impossibility of judicial performance is the only circumstance admitting an exception of the ten day requirement, and thus invalidate the continuance in this case merely to permit another attempt at service of process. His re<a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>liance on <em>Socialist Labor Case, supra, </em>for this proposition is misplaced. While that case admittedly involved a crowded court docket, it was not limited to such situations; it included within the purview of “purely judicial functions” justifying time extensions the “hearing and decision of matters properly before the court”. The scheduling of hearings is definitely a “purely judicial function”, as is also the “specifying of the time and manner of notice” which the statute directs the court to include in its order. While no case in this Court has involved this precise question, the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County in <em>Nomination Petition of Gangewere, </em>60 Dauph. 534 (1950) is in point. In that case, as here, a continuance of hearing on objections to a nomination petition to a date four days later, and beyond the statutory ten day period, was ordered after the candidate had challenged the original attempt at service. We accept the reasoning of President Judge Rickards in speaking for the court: “We do not agree that the court loses control over the time and manner of giving notice merely because personal service had not been effected by the time set for the hearing, or that a hearing could not be held after that time. Jurisdiction having once attached is retained until the conclusion of the case, both as to notice and as to continuance. . . . [T]he court had complete control to regulate the time and manner of giving notice and the fixing of hearings and the continuance thereof.” 60 Dauph. 537, 538.</p>

The legislative timetable in §977 of the Code, <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>however, allows as little as three days between filing objections and a hearing thereon.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> This period includes the time necessary to obtain a court order fixing the hearing date and directing the mode of service, and the time used in making such service. That the net time span between service and hearing, as provided in the court order, should be 24 hours is not unreasonable under the circumstances. Moreover, appellant knew of the objections to his nomination papers at least by the 28th of February when his counsel appeared at the first hearing. On March 1, when personal service had admittedly been made, appellant could properly have moved for a brief continuance if more time to prepare was deemed necessary. Counsel was present, but made no such motion, even after his challenge to the jurisdiction was overruled; instead he withdrew from further participation because of lack of authority to do more. We think this was an effective waiver of any objection based on shortness of time.</p>
    <p id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[208,1380,1148,595]]]'>The time available for adjudication of election disputes must necessarily be short. To hold that inability to perfect the initial service of process within the time allowed automatically circumvents all objections to a nomination petition by defeating the court’s jurisdiction would produce a far greater distortion of the legislative intent than to permit reasonable extensions of the ten day limit at the court’s discretion. We think the lower court was pursuing a judicial function when it exercised its discretion, and that it did so in a reasonable and responsible manner.</p>

It was stated that “[ujnless these requisite procedural steps have been properly performed, the nomination papers are deemed valid and a court is without power to set them aside.” <a href="/pa/352/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="352 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="464121" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0576-01">352 Pa. at 579</a>, <em><a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%2048" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="44 A.2d 48">44 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%2048" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="44 A.2d 48">A. 2d at 50</a>. In <em>American Labor Party Gase </em>this Court not only recognized the existence of a legislative intention to make these time limits mandatory but also conceded the wisdom of the intention: “Each failure to comply strictly would necessitate judicial determination of a reasonable time, under the circumstances. . . . Matters of vital importance to our popular election system of govern<a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>ment would be removed from the uniform and definite, and relegated to uncertainty dependent upon a question of degree and relative desirability.” <a href="/pa/352/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="352 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="464121" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0576-01">352 Pa. at 580-81</a>, 14 A. 2d at 50.

Unless time limits were set within which to challenge the results of elections, government would permanently sit on a shaky foundation, and the citizenry would never be certain of the identity of the officeholders chosen to direct and operate the complex activities of the State, County and Municipality.”</p>

The present issue arose only after the moving party had failed to effectuate service in the manner and time allotted and the court, for the convenience of the respondent-objector, improperly rescheduled the hearing and altered the original method of service.
