The complaint alleged facts which may be summarized as follows: In 1958 appellant was the owner of certain premises located at 1900 North 32nd Street in Philadelphia which she leased to a tenant. Appellee Dorfman was a real estate broker in the area. In September, 1958, while the premises were under lease, appellant and appellee entered into an oral agreement whereby the latter promised that in return for appellant’s terminating the tenancy of the then occupant of the premises and entering into a new lease with a tenant to be obtained by him, Dorfman, he would guarantee the performance of the new lease if the tenant obtained by him should default. Pursuant to this agreement, appellant released her old tenant and accepted one procured by appellee. The new tenant defaulted in December, 1958. In April of 1959, the default still continuing, appellant made demand on the appellee to pay the rent, which appellee refused to do. Instead, the parties entered into a new oral agreement whereby the appellant released the new tenant for the balance of the term and rented the premises to the appellee personally for 10 years at a rental of $250 per <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>month, the appellee further agreeing to pay excess water bills and repair costs. Pursuant to this arrangement, Dorfman occupied the premises from April, 1959 to January, 1962; he paid the rent until March, 1961, but not thereafter; at the end of January, 1962 appellee abandoned the premises.</p>

The statute relating to leases being waivable, it improperly served as the basis for judgment below; that relating to suretyship agreements being nonwaivable, judgment on the pleadings was permissible, but we <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>conclude that sufficient facts were pleaded in appellant’s complaint to take the promise to guarantee the tenant’s rent outside the statute.

If, as decided in <em>Leonard, </em>a nonwaivable Statute of Frauds defense can support a judgment on the pleadings where the defense is not raised until after the close of the pleadings (in the motion for judgment), it would be anomalous indeed not to allow the defense to prevail where the defendant raises it in his answer by way of new matter.</p>

The facts pleaded in the complaint are tha.t in consideration of appellant’s paying a commission to appellee, a realtor, and releasing appellant’s then tenant, appellee procured a new tenant and promised to pay the rent should the new occupant default. It seems apparent to us that this arrangement, involving as it did a distinct benefit to the promisor (appellee) and detriment to the promisee (appellant) is at least consistent with an original and primary un<a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>dertaking between those parties rather than merely a collateral suretyship promise within the statute.

This result followed logically from the fact that such a motion is in effect a demurrer, “. . . afford [ing] defendant another opportunity, in addition to a preliminary objection, to challenge the sufficiency of a complaint. This similarity between preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer and the motion for judgment on the pleadings also gains support from the fact that in both cases the trial judge must accept as true all facts properly pleaded by the opposing party. When the defendant moves for summary judgment [sic], therefore, he is merely alleging that plaintiff’s complaint has not stated a claim upon which relief may be granted. . . .

She claims that defendant occupied and used the premises from April, 1959 through January, 1962 but paid the rent only through March’ 1961. The statute in question does not render unenforceable in their entirety leases which exceed three years in duration; its effect, rather, is to give violating leases the force and effect of leases at will, unless the parties recognize its existence by paying and accepting the rent for longer than one year, in which case the tenancy becomes one from year to year. <em>Ferri v.
