There seems to be no basis on which such a conclusion can be supported. A mere restraint on alienation has nothing to do with Vesting’.

Pew. Until that occurs, there is to be no division into shares for children, including this decedent, and all the language of that paragraph, spelling out what happens to each share for children, is so far inoperative. The instru<a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>uient nowhere expressly gives this decedent any interest of any kind in the trust estate, even a right to any portion of income, until the death of her mother; I cannot see the justification for construing it as if it does.

Under the majority’s holding, the balance in this case of $1,-801,692.21 (to be further reduced by expenses and costs),<a class="footnotemark">1</a> would be hit by additional death taxes of at least $1,244,000.00.

      <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>It is perfectly obvious that the provisions for settlor’s children prior to their ages of 32 years are substantively meaningless to them prior to the death of their mother (who yet lives). This is so because the settlor specifically provided that his childrens’ shares would be determined <em>upon the death of his wife, </em>decedent’s mother, at which time the assets would be allocated in equal “parts or shares, one such equal part or share to be held for my daughter, Mary Caven Pew [the decedent, Mary Pew Benson], one such equal part or share. . . .” [for each of his other three children]. Since the trust was established when decedent was only 15 years of age, and her brothers and sisters were 14, 9 and 4 years of age, decedent made clear and familiar provision for them should their mother die during their early years. If she did so die a carefully drawn program was spelled out so that the children would receive their shares in instalments at their ages of 24, 28 and 32. But they would get nothing out of the trust at any of these ages if their mother still lived. The settlor’s wife did survive her daughter, decedent herein, who was 47 when she died on November 28, 1964. Nowhere in the trust instrument is there any statement or expressed intent that any of settlor’s children would have any interest after 32 or at any time before their mother died. I am convinced that the lower court.properly concluded that, under all of the circumstances, it could not be construed that the settlor in this case intended a technical vesting in his children that would be worthless to them.</p>
