However, as to this, we agree with the thinking of Judge Cercone, as expressed in the opinion for the majority of the Superior Court, namely, that this position fails to recognize the real foundation of successive prosecutions by the state and federal governments, i.e., dual sovereignty and that the <em>Bartkus </em>decision “clearly reveals that it was the Court’s opinion that successive state and federal prosecutions could not be construed as double jeopardy. . . .” <a href="/citations/?q=217%20Pa.%20Super.%20273" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="217 Pa.

The judiciary views these rules as expressions of self-evident moral precepts: It is wrong to retry a man for a crime of which he previously has been found innocent, wrong to harass him with vexatious prosecution, and wrong to punish him twice for the same offense. The policies which underlie the prohibition are first, guilt should be established by proving the elements of a crime to the satisfaction <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>of a single jury, not by capitalizing oh the increased probability of conviction resulting from repeated prosecutions before many juries; second, the authorities should not be able to search for an agreeable sentence by bringing successive prosecutions for the same offense before different juries; and third, criminal trial should not become an instrument for badgering individuals.

The late Mr. Justice Black in his dissent, however, by focusing on the individual points out that it makes little difference to a defendant who is prosecuting the case, the simple fact is there is double prosecution and possibly double punishment. We are talking about the two governments protecting their interests, when we really should be talking about the individual, since by focusing on the individual we see that it matters little where he is confined—in a federal or state prison—the fact is that his liberty is taken away twice for the same offense.</p>

We can assume that normally double prosecutions will involve felonies less than homicides, and when dealing with such felonies the primary goal for imprisonment must be reform and rehabilitation. In our view, placing an individual in a state prison after he had been incarcerated in a federal prison for the same offense is not in any way going to aid in his reformation and rehabilitation. If anything, after the second term of imprisonment, he will be more of an acomplished criminal, and he will also be much more embittered against everything our government stands for, as well as against society in general; thus, we have really defeated our own purpose.</p>

In this vexing field of multiple prosecutions in our federal system, the effect of <em>BartJms </em>was to leave a state free, in the words of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, “to develop a rational and just body of criminal law in the protection of its citizens” without federal interference. <em>Bupra, </em>at pp. 138-139.

These problems are spelled out both in the cases and the literature on the subject. While the interest analysis approach recommended in the court’s opinion has merit in the abstract, it will, I fear, prove difficult in application. I think more specific guidelines should be established, if not by statute, then by judicial decision. A commendable effort to set forth such guidelines was made by the American Law Institute in its <em>Model Penal Code, </em>§1.10 (Proposed Official Draft, 1962), quoted in the margin.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> In my view these standards, or <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>some similar statement as to the effect of a former prosecution, merit adoption in Pennsylvania. This section has been incorporated, practically verbatim, as Section 111 of a proposed new Pennsylvania Crimes Code now pending in the General Assembly (Senate Bill No. 455, as amended November 29, 1971—Printer’s No. 1379). If this section of the Bill were now the statutory law of the Commonwealth, it would undoubtedly require vacation of the orders now before us, for Mills’ offense does not come within the exceptions of the proposed new section. In the meantime, I am satisfied that it is properly within the judicial competence to hold that Mills should not be prosecuted for the offense charged, and I accordingly concur in vacating the orders below.</p>

In order to rule on a double jeopardy plea in Pennsylvania the court must review and pass judgment upon the sentence imposed by another court in the judicial system of a separate sovereign. The Pennsylvania judge must review the other judge’s sentence, and presumably the entire penal, probation and parole apparatus applicable to that sentence, for, under the majority rule, “if it appears that the interests of this Commonwealth were not sufficiently protected in the initial prosecution, then a second prosecution and imposition of additional punishment in Pennsylvania will be allowed”. This makes the application of a constitutional safeguard depend, not upon guilt, or upon conviction or acquittal <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>in a prior proceeding, but upon the nature of the punishment or sentence previously ordered, and on how the Pennsylvania judge views the other sovereign’s solution for guilt determined under that sovereign’s laws and procedures.</p>
    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[197,619,1147,546]]]'>One may ask what might be our course in a case like this one where we have ruled out guilt as an issue under Pennsylvania law, only to find that the conviction by the other court has later been set aside, or that the sentence in that case has been so altered as to no longer protect “the interests of this Commonwealth?” Who then will look out for the “interests of the Commonwealth”, if we have lapsed our judicial responsibility to do so by a double jeopardy ruling in a preliminary proceeding?</p>
    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[195,1178,1149,600]]]'>Secondly, I see serious opportunities for injustice to result from inequality of-treatment under the view adopted by the majority. For example, two defendants in the same bank robbery who are guilty of the same offense may well have unequal treatment depending solely upon the result of a race for forum. Thus, one who is tried first in the Federal court system may successfully interpose a double jeopardy plea in our courts, whereas one who is tried first in our court will have no such plea available to him in a subsequent Federal proceeding.</p>

In my view both can best be protected by continuing to have Pennsylvania guilt proceedings as heretofore, with the trial judge retaining his traditional discretion in his sentencing procedures to decide what new measures, if any are needed, will sufficiently protect “the interests of this Commonwealth”.</p>
