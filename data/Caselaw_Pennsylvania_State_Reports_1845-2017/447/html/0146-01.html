On the night before Thanksgiving in 1969, Mrs. Marshall heard loud shouting at 12:30 a.m. She came downstairs to the kitchen to find Lucas and appellant in argument. The two men began to fight until pulled apart by John Pugh. Lucas then told Mrs. Marshall he was going to get his clothes and leave. He then stepped out onto the rear porch.</p>

The record establishes that Lucas was the initial aggressor. Appellant, however, significantly contributed to the continuation of the controversy and all but monopolized its conclusion. After the stabbing, Lucas momentarily left the house only to return to the kitchen to get a glass of water. Appellant, while wounded, walked up two flights of stairs to John Pugh’s room and secured a gun and returned to the first floor ten minutes later. He purposefully concealed the gun as he returned to the first floor. Appellant then verbally confronted Lucas and started shooting. Even accepting appellant’s testimony, apparently disbelieved by the trial court, that Lucas started moving toward appellant threatening him with a knife, appellant had acted so forcefully to continue the conflict that he was properly barred on that ground alone from claiming self-defense.</p>

This claim indulges in fiction regarding this record. There is no doubt that both Lucas and appellant were permanent residents of the house and that status remained unchanged up to the time of the shooting. It is well established that a “man . . . dangerously assaulted or feloniously attacked in his own dwelling house .. . need not retreat, but may stand his ground” only if the attacker is “not a member of the household. . . .” <em>Commonwealth v.

If any of these be wanting— if there be provocation without passion, or passion without a sufficient cause of provocation, or there be time to cool, and reason has resumed its sway, the killing will be murder. . . .’” <em>Commonwealth v.

The record clearly indicates that there was plenty of “time to cool” any passions excited by Lucas’ attack. More than ten minutes elapsed as appellant went to the third floor to obtain Pugh’s gun. Appellant showed a cool mind in con<a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>cealing the gun from Pugh as he passed Pugh on the second floor.

His counsel filed a petition advising the Court of Walker’s death and praying both that the appeal be dismissed as moot and that the prior proceedings be abated <em>ab initio. </em>The Commonwealth answered the abatement petition, agreeing that the appeal is moot but arguing that the proceedings below should not be abated. At the time scheduled for argument on the appeal, argument was had instead on the issue raised by the petition and answer. Without addressing itself to the issue thus raised, the Court ordered that the appeal be argued on the merits. Believing that it was a mistake to consider this appeal on the merits, I dissented from the order directing further argument, and by the same token T must respectfully dissent from the Court’s present action in rendering a decision.</p>

Should the appeal and all prior proceedings be abated in such circumstances, or should the appeal be mooted, or should the case proceed to a conclusion as though the appellant were still living? The Court has opted for the last alternative.</p>

No reasons are advanced for this conclusion, which is clearly not in accord with the normal concept of mootness or with our practically invariable practice not to decide moot questions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> One may ask, moreover, on whom the burden of this new requirement is to be placed. If there is an “Estate” of James Walker, the deceased defendant, it has not sought to be made a party appellant. The record is silent as to whether James Walker left any family to survive him, or what their circumstances may be. Does the family, if there is one, have the duty to pick up the case and carry it forward? If not, is the lawyer who represented the deceased in his lifetime obligated to seek full appellate review for a nonexistent client, and regardless of remuneration for his services? Is any and every kind of “criminal proceeding” embraced by the Court’s new fiat? And what is the limit of “fully reviewed”? The fact that these questions are at once presented by the Court’s pronouncement indicates its unwisdom.</p>

L. 816, §1 et seq., 20 P.S. §3441 et seq., neither the Commonwealth nor the decedent has an interest in or will benefit from a final adjudication. In hearing argument, rendering a decision and writing an opinion, the Court is engaging in a useless exercise; no liberty would have accrued to the defendant had this appeal succeeded, and no punishment can be administered to him now that it is lost. Furthermore, if a federal question were involved, the determination of our Court that the case is not moot would not be controlling in the federal courts so as to allow review there. “Even in cases arising in the state courts, the question of mootness is a federal one which a federal court must resolve before it assumes jurisdiction.” <em>North Carolina v.

It will thus be clear to all who read that the defendant was convicted, for such indeed was the fact; it will be equally clear that the judgment of sentence never became final because the defendant died before his appeal from that judgment could be considered.
