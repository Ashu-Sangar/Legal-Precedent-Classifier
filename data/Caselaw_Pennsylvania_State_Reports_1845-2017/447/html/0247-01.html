Plaintiffs contracted with C. R. Holbein, a nonunion building contractor, to construct a portion of a new appliance store at another location near Butler. Between April 15 and April 23, 1971, the Council engaged members of its local unions to picket the new construction site on Mercer Road carrying signs reading “C. R. Holbein is unfair to organized labor.” On April 24 the picketing activity shifted to appellee’s store at North Main Street under the banner: “George Kerr is unfair to Local 323. Do Not Patronize Him.” The picketing continued until the preliminary injunction now appealed from was entered on April 30, 1971.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

We recognized, however, that “[i]t is clear beyond any doubt that it has been the intent of the Congress through its legislative enactments and of the United States Supreme Court through its pronouncements to fashion a labor policy which is <em>national </em>in. scope.” This recognition was based principally on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>San Diego Trades Council, etc. v.

As the majority of the Court, speaking through the late Mr. Justice Hablan, said: “The constitutional principles of pre-emption, in whatever particular field of law they operate, are designed with a common end in view: to avoid conflicting regulation of conduct by various official bodies which might have some authority over the subject matter.” Specifically referring to “the principle of pre-emption that informs our general national labor law”, the Court said: “The rationale for pre-emption, then, rests in large measure upon our determination that when it set down a federal labor policy Congress plainly meant to do more than simply to alter the then prevailing substantive law. It sought as well to restructure fundamentally the processes for effectuating that policy, deliberately placing the responsibility for applying and developing this comprehensive legal system in the hands of an expert administrative body rather than the federalized judicial system.” 403 IT.S. 285-86, 288, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20482" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="29 L.

As in the <em>Denver Building </em>case, so here, the object of “what transpired . . . was to force or require [Kerr] to cease doing business with [Holbein]”. It was an object of the picketing to force Kerr, the owner, to terminate the construction contract with Holbein, the contractor. Appellant’s activity was clearly a secondary boycott. In the frequently cited description of Judge Learned Hand, “The gravamen of a secondary boycott is that its sanctions bear, not upon the employer [here Holbein] who alone is a party to the dispute, but upon some third party [here Kerr] who has no concern in it. Its aim is to compel him to stop business with the employer in the hope that this will induce the employer to give in to his employees’ demands.” <em>Local </em>501, <em>IBEW v. </em>NLRB, <a href="/f2d/181/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="181 F.2d 34" data-case-ids="1246544" data-case-paths="/f2d/181/0034-01">181 F. 2d 34</a>, 37, aff’d, <a href="/us/341/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="341 U.S. 694" data-case-ids="1147976" data-case-paths="/us/341/0694-01">341 U.S. 694</a> (2d Cir. 1950).

The Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act of 1937, Act of June 1, 1937, P. L. 1168, No. 294, §1 et seq., as amended, 43 P.S. §211.1 et seq. (the “L.R.A.”), is patterned after the national act.

Appellees rely on the decision in <em>Bright v. Pgh. Musical Society Am.

The holding in <em>Bright </em>was that on the particular facts there involved there was no “labor dispute”, and hence the State Labor <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>Relations Board was without jurisdiction and, by the same token, a court injunction was not barred by the Labor Anti-Injunction Act of 1937, Act of June 2, P.

To bolster its position, the union announced that its members would refuse to perform for any entertainer permitting himself to be interviewed by a disc jockey. When the union carried out its announced policy with respect to plaintiff, and in addition placed him on their unfair list and requested the national union to do the same, injunctive relief was sought in the state courts. In sustaining the lower court’s jurisdiction, we considered critical the fact that the defendant union “does not represent and has no desire to represent either appellee or disc jockeys. It has no concern with the wages or working conditions of appellee or disc jockeys, whether the employment of the disc jockey is in connection with a radio broadcast or a disc hop. It appears self-evident that an employer must be involved to some extent in any labor dispute, either as one of the parties to a dispute or as one whose employe representation is an issue between competing unions. None of the essential elements of a labor dispute as defined <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>in the Labor Relations Act and the Anti-Injunction Act, are present.” <em>Bright, supra, </em>at 341-42.

        <em> </em>Assuming interstate commerce in some measure is iound to be involved in this unfair labor practice, it is unclear whether this necessarily vests jurisdiction in the National Board.

(N.L.R.B. Release No. 576 issued October 2, 1958), establishing a $500,000 per year gross volume of sales requirement for retail concerns before the N.L.R.B. will consider the case, is arguably a qualifying declination of jurisdiction where this volume of business is not shown. In <em>Stryjewski, supra, </em>however, we considered this question and rejected the argument that the guidelines are “published rules”. In accord see <em>Douds v.

      <p id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[176,1911,1149,403]]]'> This Pennsylvania version of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 TJ.S.C. §101 et seq. is often referred to as the “Little NorrisLaGuardia Act”. It parallels the federal statute in narrowly circumscribing the power of the courts to issue injunctions in cases involving or growing out of labor disputes. These two complementary statutes, like the two labor relations statutes mentioned in the text, emphasize the federal and state policy of avoiding court intervention in disputes which are “labor disputes” as defined in the several statutes.</p>
