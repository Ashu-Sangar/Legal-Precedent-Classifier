Defendant argues that as a result of the failure to comply with Eule 118, in-court identifications which he contends were based upon a lineup prior to being taken “before the proper issuing authority” were improperly admitted at trial. While agreeing with defendant that in-court identifications based on a lineup held in violation of the “unnecessary delay” provision of Eule 118 become inadmissible at trial, nevertheless we affirm appellant’s judgment of sentence. We reach this result because the record establishes that in-court identifications of defendant by several eyewitnesses were not based on the challenged lineup but rather had an independent origin.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Futch and an accomplice allegedly entered a Pittsburgh bar with the intention of committing a robbery. Their entrance and subsequent two-to five-minute stay in the bar was observed by most of the bar’s approximately twelve patrons. During the course of the robbery several shots were fired and a patron of the bar was killed.</p>
    <p id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.6",465,[165,1671,1149,374]]]'>Futch was arrested without a warrant at 11:00 p.m., on the evening of August 25, 1970, three days after the robbery-murder. Without the assistance of counsel he was placed in a lineup the following afternoon at 12:15 p.m., some thirteen hours after his arrest. Thereafter at 1:00 p.m., defendant was finally taken before the “issuing authority”.</p>

      <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>The Commonwealth first argues that Rule 118 is inapposite to the facts of this case because there was no “unnecessary delay” in presenting defendant before a magistrate. Such an assertion is difficult to square with the facts. Defendant was arrested at 11:00 p.m., and was held in custody some fourteen hours, placed in a lineup, and finally brought before a magistrate. Permissible delay between arrest and arraignment has been defined by Judge, now Chief Justice Burger, in the following fashion: “Necessary delay can reasonably relate to time to administratively process an accused with booldng, fingerprinting and other steps and sometimes even to make same [sic] limited preliminary investigation into his connection with the crime for which he was arrested, especially when it is directed to possible exculpation of the one arrested.” <em>Adams v. United </em>States, <a href="/f2d/399/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="399 F.2d 574" data-case-ids="2140731" data-case-paths="/f2d/399/0574-01">399 F. 2d 574</a>, 579 (D.C.

    <p id="b466-4" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[191,1329,1148,915]]]'>The Commonwealth concedes that it had ample probable cause to arrest defendant, thus there existed no necessity for additional time to ascertain whether the police did indeed have the right man. Nor were the police warranted or even constitutionally able to take additional time to interrogate defendant; the record reveals that defendant specifically refused to give a statement at the time of his arrest and repeatedly thereafter and indeed said that he would not answer any questions without the presence of a lawyer. Compare <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Koch, <a href="/pa/446/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="446 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="1941806" data-case-paths="/pa/446/0469-01">446 Pa. 469</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20791" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="288 A.2d 791">288 A. 2d 791</a> (1972). In view of the uncontested availability of a magistrate during much of this fourteen-hour interim, the record can only support a conclusion that defendant’s lengthy custody prior to presentment before a magistrate constituted “unnecessary delay” contrary to Rule 118.</p>

Rule 118 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure parallels Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which provides that “[a]n officer making an arrest . . . shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available commissioner”. The United States Supreme Court in the exercise of its supervisory powers<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> has fashioned the so-called <em>McNabb-Mallory </em>rule<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> which precludes the use of any evidence obtained during an “unnecessary delay”. This is subject to the cominonsense caveat that the “unnecessary delay” must have contributed to the securing of the evidence. In <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/us/322/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="322 U.S. 65" data-case-ids="6141959" data-case-paths="/us/322/0065-01">322 U.S. 65</a>, <a href="/us/322/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="322 U.S. 65" data-case-ids="6141959" data-case-paths="/us/322/0065-01">64 S. Ct. 896</a> (1944), for example, a confession given within minutes of arrest was held admissible despite a subsequent eight-day delay before presentment to a committing magistrate because the Court found that the delay did not contribute in any way to securing the challenged confession. Compare <em>Upshaw v.

Had the mandate of Eule 118 been complied with an officer of the court would have informed defendant before the lineup of his right to counsel at the lineup, and thus a constitutionally valid procedure would have been assured. Defendant was instead given a waiver of counsel form which he refused to sign. The text of the waiver form was in itself misleading for it explicitly assured defendant that the lineup would be composed of “a group of other individuals possessing physical characteristics similar to your own”—a guarantee not borne out by the record. In fact, defendant, who had quite distinctive hair, sideburns, goatee and mustache was the only one of seven individuals in the lineup so adorned. These features were mentioned by virtually every witness who identified defendant at the lineup. Had the defendant the assistance of counsel at the lineup, counsel’s presence might have preclxided the linup’s suggestive nature. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>United States v. Wade, </em><a href="/us/388/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="388 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6168076" data-case-paths="/us/388/0218-01">388 U.S. 218</a>, 228, <a href="/us/388/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="388 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6168076" data-case-paths="/us/388/0218-01">87 S.

We approach this question fully cognizant of the United States Supreme Court’s admonition that independent basis must be established by “clear and convincing evidence”. <em>United States v. Wade, </em><a href="/us/388/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="388 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6168076" data-case-paths="/us/388/0218-01">388 U.S. 218</a>, 240, <a href="/us/388/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="388 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6168076" data-case-paths="/us/388/0218-01">87 S.

In applying this test the Court enumerated the following essential considerations: “[T]he prior opportunity to observe the alleged criminal act, the existence of any discrepancy between any pre-lineup description and the defendant’s actual description, any identification prior to lineup of another person, the identification by picture of the defendant prior to the lineup, failure to identify the defendant on a prior occasion, and the lapse of time between the alleged act and the lineup identification.

Immediately after the incident many of the eyewitnesses gave the police identifications which accurately described defendant.
