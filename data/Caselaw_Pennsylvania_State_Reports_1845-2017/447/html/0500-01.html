One such individual, Anne Mangini, was immediately taken to police headquarters and questioned over an extended period of time. She subsequently gave a statement to the police, which implicated herself and the appellant in the crimes which are the subject of this appeal. She informed the police that appellant and herself engaged in a fraudulent check cashing operation whereby she, at the urging of appellant, would take a forged check into a bank and “split deposit” the proceeds, that is, after opening an account under a fictitious name, she would deposit a portion of the check in the account, and receive the remainder in cash.</p>

We find the reasoning of Mr. Justice Brennan, speaking for the Court, in <em>Wong Sun v. United </em>States, <a href="/us/371/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="371 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="450611" data-case-paths="/us/371/0471-01">371 U.S. 471</a>, <a href="/us/371/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="371 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="450611" data-case-paths="/us/371/0471-01">83 S. Ct. 407</a> (1963), pertinent to this point. He stated: “The exclusionary rule has traditionally barred from trial physical, tangible materials obtained either during or as a direct result of an unlawful invasion. It follows from our holding in Silverman v. United States, <a href="/us/365/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="365 U.S. 505" data-case-ids="6167071" data-case-paths="/us/365/0505-01">365 U.S. 505</a>, <a href="/us/365/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="365 U.S. 505" data-case-ids="6167071" data-case-paths="/us/365/0505-01">81 S.

Similarly, testimony as to matters observed during an unlawful invasion has been excluded in order to enforce the basic constitutional policies. McGinnis v. United States, 1st Cir., <a href="/f2d/227/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="227 F.2d 598" data-case-ids="61714" data-case-paths="/f2d/227/0598-01">227 F. 2d 598</a>. Thus verbal evidence which derives so immediately from an unlawful entry and an unauthorized arrest as the officers’ action in the present case is no less the ‘fruit’ of official illegality than the more common tangible fruits of the unwarranted intrusion. See Nueslein v. District of Columbia, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20App.%20D.C.%2085" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="73 App. D.C. 85">73 App. D.C. 85</a>, <a href="/f2d/115/0690-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="115 F.2d 690" data-case-ids="1101939" data-case-paths="/f2d/115/0690-01">115 F. 2d 690</a>.

      <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>In Silverthorne, Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the majority, first espoused the doctrine in a case where the federal government sought to introduce photographs they had made of illegally seized corporate records which had been held inadmissible. “The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the Court but that it shall not be used at all. Of course, this does not mean that the facts thus obtained become sacred and inaccessible. If knowledge of them is gained from an independent source they may be proved like any others, but the knowledge gained by the Government’s own wrong cannot be used by it in the way proposed.” <a href="/citations/?q=251%20U.S.%20392" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="251 U.S. 392">251 U.S. 392</a>, <a href="/us/251/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="251 U.S. 385" data-case-ids="3680880" data-case-paths="/us/251/0385-01">40 S. Ct. at 183</a>. Hence, the only apparent exception under Mr. Justice Holmes’ rule was if the evidence were derived from an independent source. Mr. Justice Frankfurter broadened this exception in <em>Nardone, </em>wherein he stated: “Sophisticated argument may prove a causal connection between information obtained through illicit wire-tapping and the Government’s proof. As a matter of good sense, however, such connection may have become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.” <a href="/citations/?q=308%20U.S.%20341" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="308 U.S. 341">308 U.S. 341</a>, <a href="/us/308/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="308 U.S. 338" data-case-ids="6140061" data-case-paths="/us/308/0338-01">60 S.

Thus, facts not obtained from an independent source, but far removed from the original illegality, so that “as a matter of good sense” the causal chain has been broken could be employed.</p>

Rather, the more apt question in such a case is ‘whether, granted establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by the exploitation <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint’.” <a href="/citations/?q=371%20U.S.%20487" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="371 U.S. 487">371 U.S. 487</a>-88, <a href="/us/371/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="371 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="450611" data-case-paths="/us/371/0471-01">83 S.

Nor were the authorities apprised of the information she offered before the search.

The road from the initial illegality and the exploitation of this in the form of the statement by Anne Mangini to her guilty plea and testimony is direct. Common sense dictates that her guilty plea at least in part flowed directly from the completely inculpatory statement and the trial testimony reasonably followed therefrom. The primary question as we view it when dealing with the taint issue, as herein presented, is not whether the witness voluntarily pled guilty and testified, rather it is <em>why </em>she chose to do this.

However, <em>Hoffman </em>is factually distinguished since the primary illegality was not the sole source of information which motivated the witness to plead guilty. The only evidence the authorities gained by the illegal arrest was the actual name of the witness, prior to the arrest the police knew of the existence of the witness (he was at that time using a fictitious name), they knew of his association with the other parties, and the fact that stolen money orders had been in the possession of the parties was also information the police had independently gained. Thus, it was not the illegal arrest that formed the first link in the causal chain which eventually led to the testimony, it was the lawfully gained information. The <em>Hoffman </em>court ruled that the taint was attenuated by the guilty plea, however, under the facts of the instant case we cannot come to the same conclusion, since the sole genesis of all the evidence was the exploitation in the form of the statement, and to say the plea and testimony were not motivated, at least in part, by the exploited statement is not reasonable under the instant facts. We do no believe that it can be said that the guilty plea could act as attenuation in the instant case.</p>
