    <p id="b473-12" data-blocks='[["BL_473.19",473,[160,1642,1151,637]]]'>Appellant Endicott Peabody filed a complaint in mandamus in the Commonwealth Court requesting that the Secretary of the Commonwealth be ordered to certify his name for inclusion on the official ballot of the Democratic Party as a candidate for Vice-President of the United States at the primary to be held on April 25, 1972. The Commonwealth Court, after hearing, entered judgment against appellant. Appellant thereupon appealed to this Court. On March 20, 1972, this Court issued an order affirming the judgment of the Commonwealth Court, and indicating that an opinion would follow.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Nevertheless, appellant contends that the Pennsylvania Election Code can and should be construed to provide for a Vice-Presidential preferential primary. We disagree. We believe that the Legislature did not intend to establish a Vice-Presidential preferential primary, and we recognize that we cannot substitute our judgment on this matter for that of the Legislature. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b474-4" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[198,1160,1145,309]]]'>In our view Section 902 of the Election Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> clearly indicates that the Legislature did not intend to provide for a Vice-Presidential primary. • That section expressly provides for a Presidential preferential primary, but makes no mention of a Vice-Presidential primary. The section states:</p>

We cannot believe that the Legislature, having expressly established a Presidential preferential primary, intended by the same act to establish a Vice-Presidential preferential primary by implication. Moreover, at least six other sections of the Election Code—sections dealing with notice to the county boards of offices for which nominations are to be made,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> filing of nominating petitions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> affidavits of candidates,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> number of signers required on nominating petitions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> filing fees,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> and determination of victorious candidates<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>—the Legislature expressly refers to candidates for party nominations for President, but says nothing about Vice-Presidential candidates.</p>

Appellant contends that since he is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Vice-President, he is a “candidate for party nomination” within the meaning of Section 907, and his name must be placed upon the official primary ballot of the Democratic party as a candidate for that office. We disagree.</p>
    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[196,872,1147,649]]]'>Section 907 was designed merely to require the Secretary of the Commonwealth to place on the ballot the names of all candidates who have filed proper nominating petitions. Section 907 was obviously not intended to specify those elective offices or positions that are to appear on the primary ballot. For example, following appellant’s interpretation of Section 907, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the Governorship of Texas could have his name placed upon the Pennsylvania primary ballot if he presented a proper nominating petition. For such a candidate is surely a “candidate for party nomination”.</p>
    <p id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[198,1533,1149,541]]]'>We agree with the Commonwealth Court that Section 907 must be read in connection with Section 902. It is Section 902 that specifies which offices or elective positions are to appear on the primary ballot. Section 907 was intended only to establish the obligation of the Secretary to place on the ballot the names of all candidates who file proper nominating petitions, and cannot be interpreted to expand Section 902’s careful enumeration of the contests that are to appear on the primary ballot.</p>
    <p id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.6",476,[199,2083,1149,207]],["BL_477.1",477,[143,325,1151,969]]]'>Section 902 provides for only one preferential primary—a Presidential preferential primary.

Accordingly we conclude that Section 907 did not oblige or permit the Secretary to certify appellant’s name for inclusion on the ballot.</p>
    <p id="b477-4" data-blocks='[["BL_477.4",477,[145,1316,1149,539]]]'>Appellant also attempts to support his argument that the Legislature intended to establish a Vice-Presidential primary by pointing to Section 903 of the Election Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> That section provides: “It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, prior to each primary, to ascertain the various national and State offices to be filled at the ensuing November election, and for which candidates are to be nominated at such primary, <em>and otherwise, </em>in accordance with the provisions of this act.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

All Section 903 sought to accomplish was to make it the duty of the Secretary of the Commonwealth to set in motion a process by which the voters of the Commonwealth, through the county boards of elections, are informed of the contests that will appear on the primary ballot.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> Section 903 was not intended to specify the contests that are to appear on the Pennsylvania primary ballot.
