At this time, after having traveled approximately 450-500 feet with her left-tum signal on, Mrs. McCay brought her car to a complete stop in the middle of the Rutledge Avenue intersection.</p>

The rules which determine the causal relation between the plaintiff’s negligence and the injury are the same as those determining the causal relation between defendant’s negligent conduct and the injury sustained by others.

Those cases following the <em>Grane </em>“slightest degree” test failed to distinguish slight negligence from slight contribution. The “slightest degree” test properly applies to the degree of negligence and is but a reaffirmation of Pennsylvania’s long standing refusal to accept any theory of comparative negligence.

      <em> </em>The correct statement of the law is that a plaintiff cannot recover if his own negligence, however slight, contributes to the happening of the accident in a proximate way.</p>

The applicable portion of the lower court’s instruction to the jury on contributory negligence was as follows: “Any plaintiff who is guilty of contributory negligence cannot recover under the law of this State, no matter how negligent the defendant may have been. <em>If a plaintiff was guilty of negligence which contributed </em>
      <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>

The test is tohether the act or acts alleged as constituting negligence contributed in any degree to the production of the </em>injuryRecord, Vol. 2, at 248a (emphasis added). Although this portion of the charge could possibly be interpreted to suggest an adherence to the erroneous “slightest degree” test, we believe that when reviewed in its entirety the trial court’s charge to the jury on contributory negligence was in compliance with Pennsylvania law. It is important to note that immediately after explaining contributory negligence and the appropriate burdens of proof, the trial court charged the jury with respect to the distinction between “proximate cause” and “remote cause”. Although the charge was phrased in reference to defendant’s negligence, its positioning immediately following a description of plaintiff’s conduct left a clear implication that plaintiff’s negligence must be a proximate cause. This is reinforced by the fact that proximate cause had previously been discussed with reference to defendant’s negligence.</p>

      <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>Appellants also argue that the trial judge committed prejudicial error requiring the granting of a new trial when he allowed opposing counsel to question Mrs. McCay concerning a prior rear-end automobile accident. Initially, plaintiffs’ objection to this line of inquiry was sustained. However, after the wife-plaintiff’s testimony with respect to her pre-existing physical condition, the trial judge permitted the defendant to inquire into her prior accident. It is apparent that Mrs. McCay’s testimony developed an issue as to the true origin of the injuries which formed the basis of her present complaints.</p>
    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[135,994,1151,1071]]]'>To begin with, Mrs. McCay admitted to the police officer on the scene that she was not hurt in any way. On direct examination, Mrs. McCay stated that in November of 1958, she had suffered a herniated lumbar disc for which she received treatment, but it was emphasized that she had completely recovered at least eight months before the accident in question. However, during cross-examination Mrs. McCay admitted that she had received 187 chiropractic treatments following the 1958 herniation between November 11, 1980 and May 15, 1963, which was only three months prior to this accident. Another conflict as to the origin of her present difficulties arose when she stated on direct examination that her present complaints of pain in her lower back and legs originated with symptoms that developed within a month or so after the accident in <em>1963; </em>yet, she had testified under oath at a hearing before a Workmen’s Compensation Eeferee on December 12, 1966, that these symptoms had first appeared in March of 1965.</p>

Even in February of 1966, when she secured Dr. DePalma as a witness in this matter and finally told him of her previously existing back problem, Mrs. McCay did not mention the 187 chiropractic treatments she had received. It was also brought out on cross-examination that between the time the instant accident occurred and the time of trial, Mrs. McCay was being treated by Dr. J. Hubert Conner, who was also a medical witness for appellants at the trial. Yet during this entire period she never discussed with him the conditions relating to the prior back complaints.</p>
    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[206,1051,1147,698]]]'>In light of these revelations, it is apparent that the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in allowing defense counsel to inquire into the prior automobile accident. Mrs. McCay testified that the accident in question had caused serious injury although a very similar incident a few months earlier had not injured her at all. The jury was entitled to consider this prior accident since it bears directly on the credibility to be given her testimony regarding the severe consequences she claims to have resulted from this very slight rear-end collision. A real issue of fact as to the true origin of the present difficulties was involved and evidence of the prior accident was relevant.</p>

However, in reviewing a trial judge’s charge the proper test is not whether certain portions taken out of context appear erroneous. As this Court recently stated in another collision case: “As in all cases questioning the accuracy of a charge to the jury, we must not take the challenged words or passage out of the context of the whole charge, but must look to the charge in its entirety, against the background of the evidence in the particular case, to determine whether or not error was committed and whether that error was prejudicial to the complaining party.” <em>Whitner v.

Also with respect to burden of proof, appellants argue that by affirming the defendants fourth and fifth Points for Charge, the court in effect placed upon Mrs. McCay the burden of proving her freedom from contributory negligence. They maintain that such instruction in the absence of the instruction on the defendant’s burden of proof was tantamount to a directed verdict for defendant. Lastly, appellants suggest that the trial court’s instruction on the “sudden emergency” doctrine misled the jury to the prejudice of Mrs. McCay because there was no specific instruction on Philadelphia Electric Company’s duty to prove the existence of an emergency beyond their driver’s control.</p>
