It should be done only for very compelling reasons. . . . ‘Marking a ballot in voting is a matter not of precision engineering but of an unmistakable registration of the voter’s will in substantial conformity to statutory requirement1 ”. In construing election laws while we must strictly enforce all provisions to prevent fraud our overriding concern at all times must be to be flexible in order to favor the right to vote. Our goal must be to enfranchise and not to disenfranchise. See, <em>James Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/377/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="377 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1249534" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0405-01">377 Pa. 405</a> (1954). This section of the code <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>merely assures the validity of ballots marked in blue, black or blue-black ink. It does not as the appellant urges us to find specify that any other type of marking will necessarily be void. We have noted in other cases that the dominant theme of this section is to prevent ballots from being identifiable. “A ballot should not be inva1',bated under Section 1223 of the Act of 1937, supra 25 P.S. §3063, unless the voter purposely makes a mark thereon or commits some other act in connection with his ballot to distingush and identify it.” <em>McKelvey Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/444/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="444 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1938627" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0392-01">444 Pa. 392</a> at 396 (1971). The proper interpretation of this portion of the statute considering the occasion for its enactment, the mischief to be remedied, and the policy to liberally construe voting laws in the absence of fraud, is that the ballot is valid unless there is a clear showing that the ink used was for the purpose of making the ballot identifiable.</p>

This same section of the Code, however, dealing in detail with the manner of marking and counting of ballots, expressly provides that a ballot marked “in blue, black or blue-black ink, in fountain pen or ballpoint pen, or black lead pencil or indelible pencil, shall be valid and counted: . . .” When the legislature has, with such specificity, stated what ballot markings shall be valid and counted, it has in effect also stated, in aid of the cherished secrecy of the American ballot, that use of inks or instruments other than those specified is not permissible and that ballots so marked shall be invalid and not counted.</p>

The instruction to the voter required to be printed on each ballot contains the following admonition, among others: “Mark ballot <em>only </em>in black lead pencil, indelible pencil or blue, black or blue-black ink, in fountain pen or ballpoint pen. . . (Emphasis supplied.)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Thus the question here presented is not whether the elector had a purpose to make the ballot identifiable, or whether the red ink did in fact have that effect in this particu<a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>lar case.

If the voter undertakes to deviate from the requirements prescribed for all, he takes the risk of his failure to comply. The concern is not the possible disenfranchisement of a voter who casts his ballot in a manner not permitted by the Election Code, but rather the preservation of the sanctity of the whole election process by giving effect to only those ballots marked in accordance with the election laws. ...” It is my view that the electors in the ballots here challenged transgressed one of the prescribed rules, though no doubt inadvertently. I would therefore reverse.</p>
