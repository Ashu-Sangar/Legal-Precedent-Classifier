Olson testified that “he was not explained” the meaning of the signature card and had not read the terms of the contract before signing it. Nevertheless, when asked, “If you read it would you have understood what it meant?” he replied, “I think so.” This Court has repeatedly held that in the absence of proof of fraud, “failure to read is an unavailing excuse or defense and cannot justify an avoidance, modification or nullification of the contract or any provision thereof.” <em>Orner v.

Nolan’s Estate, </em>supra, one Mary Nolan opened an individual savings account and many years later converted the account into a joint savings account making her sister Margaret Nolan a joint tenant.

Furthermore, failure to read the provisions of the joint savings accounts furnishes no basis for relieving the accounts of tax liability. Like <em>Nolan’s Estate, </em>supra, there is no evidence of “duress or fraud”. In both cases, the parties expressly created a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship.
