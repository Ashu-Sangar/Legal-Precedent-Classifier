    <p id="b620-4" data-blocks='[["BL_620.4",620,[175,675,1149,540]]]'>There is absolutely no support in the language of Section 7 for the Commonwealth’s contention. In fact, Rule 150G of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, adopted to implement the Post Conviction Hearing Act, clearly indicates that additional issues may be raised by amendment. That rule states in relevant part: “When the court grants a post conviction hearing, it shall . . . [h]old a hearing which may extend only to the <em>issues raised in the petition </em>or <em>amended petition. . </em>. .” (Emphasis added.)</p>
    <p id="b620-5" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[173,1227,1148,1094]]]'>Moreover, to ban amendments if they raise additional issues would completely undermine the major purpose of the Post Conviction Hearing Act—to discourage piecemeal litigation of post-conviction claims. A large majority of PCHA petitions are composed either by the prisoner or' by a jail house lawyer. In many instances counsel is not appointed until after the court receives the petition. Frequently, after talking with the prisoner and reviewing the transcript of the trial, counsel realizes that there are additional meritorious issues to be raised. If amendments raising issues not included in prisoners’ pro se petitions were prohibited, we would be unable to presume that petitioner knowingly and understandingly waived those issues. For as we stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Mumford, </em><a href="/pa/430/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="430 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1915778" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0451-01">430 Pa. 451</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=243%20A.2d%20440" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="243 A.2d 440">243 A. 2d 440</a> (1968) : “[Wjaiver may be <em>presumed </em>only where the petitioner had counsel at the time the waiver allegedly occurred.” <a href="/citations/?q=243%20A.2d%20440" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="243 A.2d 440">Id. at 455</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=243%20A.2d%20440" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="243 A.2d 440">243 A. 2d at 442</a>.

But in the case at hand there was absolutely no apparent reason to do so.

Consequently, we conclude that petitioners should have been permitted to amend his petition to include the additional issues.</p>

    <p id="b621-4" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[156,1014,1150,929]]]'>There are two conceivable theories upon which the hearing court might have based its determination that appellant waived his right to assert his prejudiced-juror claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> First, the court might have concluded that appellant waived his right to assert his claim by failing to raise it at trial or in subsequent court proceedings. See Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, §4(b) (1), 19 P.S. §1180-4 (b) (1). Second, the court might have concluded, as the Commonwealth argues on this appeal, that defense counsel’s failure to ask questions on voir dire which may have brought to light the alleged prejudice of the juror prevents appellant from now raising the claim. See <em>Commonwealth v. Aljoe, </em><a href="/pa/420/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="420 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1898598" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0198-01">420 Pa. 198</a>, 205-07, <a href="/citations/?q=216%20A.2d%2050" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="216 A.2d 50">216 A. 2d 50</a>, 54-55 (1966).

After a hearing on February 21, 1967, appellant’s first PCHA petition was dismissed, and that dismissal was affirmed by the Superior Court on January 5, 1968. Appellant’s second petition was dismissed without a hearing on December 17,1969, and no appeal was taken from that dismissal. In neither of these petitions did appellant raise the prejudiced-juror claim which he now asserts.</p>

After his trial, appellant was told by a fellow prisoner that this man whom appellant had fought had been a juror at appellant’s trial. Appellant had not recognized the juror at the time of his trial since appellant had been intoxicated at the time of the fight.</p>
    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[192,1285,1149,538]]]'>Appellant thereupon contacted a Mr. Pepp of the Defender Association of Philadelphia. Mr. Pepp forwarded to appellant a list purporting to include the names of all of the jurors at appellant’s trial. This list was offered into evidence at the hearing below. Since the name of the individual who lived on Cedar Avenue, and with whom appellant allegedly had the altercation, did not appear on this list, appellant did not raise the prejudiced-juror claim in his first or second PCHA petition.</p>
    <p id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[190,1836,1148,373]]]'>However, appellant subsequently requested and obtained a second list of the jurors at his trial from the court clerk.

L. (1965) 1580, §4(b) (1), 19 P.S. §1180-4(b) (1) (Supp. 1970) (emphasis added). Since appellant was not aware of the alleged presence of the prejudiced juror at his trial until after he had filed his first and second PCHA petitions, he “could not” have raised the issue previously. Since no reason appears on the record to disbelieve appellant’s testimony, and since we have no indication that the hearing judge disbelieved appellant’s testimony, we conclude that appellant cannot be regarded as having waived his claim under §4(b) (1) of the Post Conviction Hearing Act.</p>

Williams, </em><a href="/pa/437/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="437 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="1927796" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0526-01">437 Pa. 526</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20127" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="263 A.2d 127">263 A. 2d 127</a> (1970). The mere fact that a hearing was conducted, indeed <em>ordered </em>by the Administrative Judge of the Trial Division of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the decision of the PCHA judge was not bottomed on a Section 4 waiver. Nor do I believe that relief was denied due to a failure to question the jurors on voir dire. Nowhere in the transcript of the PCHA hearing is there any mention of the fact that defense counsel failed to adequately question the jurors on voir dire. Since this point was never discussed at the hearing, I do not believe the PCHA judge relied on this “waiver” theory.</p>

Lastly, two interruptions of appellant’s testimony by the PCHA <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>judge indicate a total rejection of appellant’s claim.

However, contrary to footnote five of the majority opinion, I believe the <em>Bruton </em>claim is finally litigated due to the presence of this argument in appellant’s second PCHA petition. The majority’s initial contention-—a dismissal of this third petition as finally litigated is improper since the second petition was not denied on the merits—ignores the fact that appellant could have appealed the denial of the second petition. <em>See, Com. v. Black, </em><a href="/pa/433/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="433 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="1920950" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0150-01">433 Pa. 150</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=249%20A.2d%20561" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="249 A.2d 561">249 A. 2d 561</a> (1969). Acceptance of the majority’s argument <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>violates the overriding philosophy of section 4: avoidance of multiple petitions raising the same issue and piecemeal litigation. The majority’s second argument that the second petition was uncounselled is only a matter of perspective: while there is no indication that counsel was appointed, there is also no indication that counsel was not appointed. Since the record does demonstrate that appellant had counsel<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">*</a> in all of the other actions cited in the first paragraph of this dissent, I tend to think that the second PCHA petition was counselled. To allow an amendment under these circumstances is most unwise.</p>
