The Act of June 24, 1939, P.

This statute provides that: “Whoever administers, or causes to be administered by another, any poison or other destructive thing or stabs, cuts or wounds any person, or by any means causes any person bodily injury, dangerous to life, with intention to commit murder, is guilty of felony. . . .” This statute was clearly inapposite herein since the superficial injuries (ones certainly not dangerous to life) sustained by Riner were not inflicted with the intent to commit murder, but merely to force him to the place where such a homicidal wound could be inflicted.</p>

This section punishes, as a felon: “Whoever attempts to administer any poison or other destructive thing, or attempts to cut or stab or wound, or shoots at any person, or, by drawing a trigger or in any other manner, attempts to discharge any kind of loaded arms at any person, or attempts to drown, suffocate or strangle any person, with intent to commit the crime of murder, although no bodily injury is effected. . . .” Maximum penalty under the statute is seven years imprisonment. To violate this provision when a gun is the criminal instrumentality, the accused must have actually pulled the trigger, and one who stops as he is preparing to shoot, even with the requisite specific intent, cannot be validly convicted under this section of the statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thus the <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>classic cases under the statute, involving a gun, are where the would-be slayer draws the trigger with the requisite intent only to have the weapon misfire, or where he actually shoots but entirely misses his target.</p>

Thus the giving of poison to an agent, under the belief that said agent would deposit it in the spring of the intended victim, did not amount to an attempt to administer poison under the statute. See <em>Stabler v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/95/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="95 Pa. 318" data-case-ids="492882" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0318-01">95 Pa. 318</a> (1880).

Since there was no evidence in the case at bar that Clopton pulled the trigger, the Commonwealth properly did not seek an indictment under this section.</p>

In law, the definition must have this further qualification, that the overt act must be sufficiently proximate to the intended crime to form one of the natural series of acts which the intent requires for its full execution. So long as the acts are confined to preparation only, and can be abandoned before any transgression of the law or of others’ rights, they are within the sphere of intent and do not amount to attempts’: Commonwealth v. Eagan, <a href="/pa/190/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="190 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="905128" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0010-01">190 Pa. 10</a>, 21-2.” We find that the facts of the instant case satisfactorily fulfill this definition. Clopton’s act of forcing Riner, at gunpoint, out of his apartment and into a waiting vehicle, with the expressed intent to murder him as soon as he could be speeded to the appropriate destination, and the accomplishment thwarted only by a near-miraculous burst of energy from the intended victim, would most certainly constitute an overt act, in transgression <em>of both </em>the law and of another’s rights, in pursuance of an intent to do “the specific thing” of murder, sufficiently proximate to the crime but falling short of its completion. Clopton’s repeated statements concerning his intent to kill Riner made all his acts unequivocally related to the crime of murder.</p>

      <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>Having concluded that such acts would constitute common law attempted murder, the issue this Court must now face, and on which this case turns, is whether the promulgation of statutes defining and punishing specific forms of the crime of attempted murder have pre-empted the field, thereby ousting the court of common law jurisdiction in this area, at least insofar as attempts via poison, knives and guns are concerned. In determining this question, we are mindful of the mandate of the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §1104, 18 P.S. §5104, that: “In all cases where a remedy is provided or duty enjoined, or anything directed to be done by the penal provisions of any act of assembly, the direction of said act shall be strictly pursued; and no penalty shall be inflicted, or anything done agreeably to the provisions of the common law in such cases, further than shall be necessary for carrying such act into effect.”</p>

Firstly, guided by the presumption of the Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, Art. IY, §52, 46 P.S. §552: “That the Legislature does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable”, we make the inquiry into whether it would indeed be “unreasonable” to hold that the statutes do not work a derogation of the common law crime of attempted murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Secondly, since our attempted murder statutes are taken directly from the English enactments,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> we find that the experience <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>of the English courts in the application of such acts, although not binding, proves to be most instructive.</p>
    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[179,450,1149,940]]]'>Turning to our consideration of legislative intent,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> we must determine why the legislature would define, with such specificity, the most aggravated form of the crime, this extreme being the most obvious to discern and easiest to establish. Certainly, if our lawmakers intended that lesser acts be punishable as <em>attempted murder, </em>it would have made much greater sense to define the acts that would most minimally constitute the crime. At the very least, if the legislature wished that acts more remote to the completed crime were to be considered as attempted murder, it would not have defined it at all. Instead, the legislature would have simply promulgated a general enactment that all attempted murders were to be punishable by a seven-year maximum term of imprisonment, leaving to the courts the difficult task of defining and line drawing under the precepts of the common law.</p>
    <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.6",82,[178,1404,1148,650]]]'>For the legislature to have rationally specified the most aggravated form of attempt without intending to pre-empt the field would require that there be some meaningful difference between the statutory crime and the lesser attempts remaining at common law. We find none. It is true that at common law all attempts, even the attempts to ldll, were only misdemeanors. See Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, (4th ed. 1792). The statutory offense makes the crime as defined a felony. But this difference is really one of semantics unless the sentence reflects the classification. We find that it does not.</p>

See <em>Hackett v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/15/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="15 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="408678" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0095-01">15 Pa. 95</a> (1850). In 1790, such inhumane punishments (nailing the offender’s ears to the pillory is one example) were repealed, and the crimes in the “pillory” category were accorded two-year maximum prison sentences. In 1807, the two-year maximum sentence was repealed in favor of a seven-year maximum sentence. Although the Act of March 31, 1860 (which unlike the Act of 1807, contained the provisions for attempted murder such as the ones found in our current Act of 1939) repealed the section providing for a seven-year maximum for the pillory offenses, we find that seven years continued to be the standard, at least so far as the crime of common law attempted murder. This would obliterate any real difference between the statutory and common law form of the crime. We reach this result by employing either one of two acceptable approaches for determining sentences for common law crimes.</p>

Section 15 was a catch-all provision punishing with a term of life imprisonment (the maximum sentence employed throughout the act) attempted murder “by any means other than those specified in any of the preceding sections of this Act”. This last section has been interpreted by English courts to deal only with “any other means not <em>ejusdem generis </em>with the means specified in those earlier sections.” <em>Queen v.

Other areas of common law attempted murder, however, do not lend themselves to such neat caterogization.
