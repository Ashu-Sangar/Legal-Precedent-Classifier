In support of this contention, appellant argues that his guilty plea was motivated primarily by his fear of the death penalty. At the PCHA hearing both of appellant’s trial counsel testified that they informed the appellant that, in their opinion, the death penalty would be the likely result of a jury trial. In addition, the record shows that the alternatives were fully and carefully explained to the appellant. Even if a fear of the death penalty was appellant’s sole motive in pleading guilty, this fact in and of itself is not sufficient to render the guilty plea involuntary. The United States Supreme Court has said, in <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em><a href="/us/400/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="400 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="12045986" data-case-paths="/us/400/0025-01">400 U.S. 25</a>, 31, 27 L. ed. 162, <a href="/us/400/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="400 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="12045986" data-case-paths="/us/400/0025-01">91 S.

The standard was and remains whether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant. [Citations omitted]. That he would not have pleaded except for the opportunity to limit the possible penalty does not necessarily demonstrate that the plea of guilty was hot the product of a free and rational choice, especially where the defendant was represented by competent counsel whose ad<a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>vice was that the plea would he to the defendant’s advantage.” We adopted this principle in <em>Alford </em>in <em>Com. v.

In so doing, the Court held that the defendant’s plea was not knowingly and intelligently entered since it was based on erroneous information. In <em>Wright, </em>after a judgment of sentence of life imprisonment had been reversed, the defendant entered a plea of guilty. On appeal, he asserted that his guilty plea was motivated by both his counsel’s and the court’s statements that, notwithstanding his earlier sentence, he might still be sentenced to death in the second trial. In reversing this obvious error, the Court said: “[HJerein, Wright was deprived of properly evaluating and asserting these rights by a false understanding inspired by erroneous advice received both from his trial counsel and the court.” <a href="/pa/444/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="444 Pa. 588" data-case-ids="1938618" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0588-01">444 Pa. at 591</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20266" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="282 A.2d 266">282 A. 2d at 267</a>.</p>

Here appellant falls far short of fulfilling the requirements of <em>Marsh. </em>In fact, the sole allegation in support of his contention is that he gave his confession in order to protect his younger brother, who was also involved in the crime.</p>

Furthermore, at the time of the entry of the guilty plea there was an extensive on-the-record colloquy between the court and the appellant in which the court thoroughly explained the appellant’s rights to him and inquired into his motivation. Examining the facts in light of <em>Marsh, </em>it is obvious that appellant’s arguments are without merit. Appellant’s bald assertion that his plea was motivated by an allegedly illegal confession lacks support in the record. There appears in the transcript approximately twenty pages of colloquy between the court, appellant and his counsel discussing the circumstances under which the appellant’s confession was secured and the part it played in his decision to plead guilty. At no time during this colloquy did the appellant contest the introduction of the confession. Last<a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>ly, counsel’s advice to plead guilty cannot be said to be outside “the ambit of that which could reasonably be given by counsel in a criminal case in the circumstances.” <em>Com. v.

Appellant concedes that there are no Pennsylvania cases or statutes which mandate such a duty upon the court and counsel. Even assuming that he had the right to be so informed, any problems arising out of a failure to so warn him in the thirty-eight day period were cured by the court’s colloquy at the degree-of-guili hearing. Again, the record exhibits that, at both the entry of the plea and the degree-of-guilt hearing, the court went to great lengths to establish that appellant understood the nature and consequences of his plea and that he was making it of his own free choice.</p>
