Cumberland Street, Philadelphia, in response to a “burglary in progress” report pertaining to a real estate office located at that address. They found the door loose, but not openable and heard noises coming from within the building. Looking down the outside of the structure, Officer Anthony Briscella saw two men run from the rear of the building down a nearby alley. The officer jumped into his police vehicle and drove around the block to the place where the alley exits into a street. At that point Officer Briscella saw a man run from the alley. The man was later apprehended and identified as one Stanley Cimaszewski, appellant’s brother. Another officer, Dewald, proceeded on foot to the rear of the property through a walkway adjoining the real estate office, and while so doing <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>“heard noises coming from the fences.” When he reached the rear of the structure, the officer “. . . looked down through the [adjoining back] yards and observed the defendant, Bichard, standing on top of a shed roof” which was located three lots away. The officer called to the person he observed to halt, climbed over the fences separating the several yards, and apprehended appellant, who had by then climbed down to the yard. The Commonwealth’s evidence also showed that a window of the real estate office had been “jimmied”, and its lock broken; a flashlight which did not belong to any of the employees of the agency was found on a desk located next to an office safe.</p>

While it is of course true that the Commonwealth must prove every essential element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Commonwealth v. Radford, </em><a href="/pa/428/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="428 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1912429" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0279-01">428 Pa. 279</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=236%20A.2d%20802" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="236 A.2d 802">236 A. 2d 802</a> (1968), it is equally well established that the Commonwealth may sustain this burden by means of wholly circumstantial evidence. <em>Commonwealth v. Sullivan, </em><a href="/pa/445/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="445 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="1940082" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0616-01">445 Pa. 616</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=284%20A.2d%20504" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="284 A.2d 504">284 A. 2d 504</a> (1971); <em>Commonwealth v.

The line between the requisite degree of persuasion and impermissible speculation is, admittedly, sometimes difficult to draw. We are satisfied that in this case the evidence was sufficient to permit the trier of fact, here the judge, to conclude that appellant was guilty of attempted burglary beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p id="b218-6" data-blocks='[["BL_218.6",218,[181,2179,1144,153]],["BL_219.1",219,[155,336,1151,1091]]]'>Without repeating the summary of the testimony given above, in essence it is this: A report is received by the police that a burglary is “in progress” at the <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>building in question; two police officers, responding immediately, hear noises coming from within the building, the front door of which has been loosened and a window jimmied; two men flee from the rear of the building, one of whom is intercepted by one officer when he emerges from an alley into a street; noises “coming from the fences” at the back of the property direct the attention of the other officer to a man on a nearby shed roof, who turns out to be the brother of the first suspect. All of this occurred in a very short space of time, a few minutes at most, and probably measurable in seconds. The trier of fact could reasonably conclude from this sequence of events that appellant had indeed been in the building and had been one of the two men seen running from it, and had then attempted escape by noisily climbing over fences separating adjoining properties, only to be detected when in a position of visibility atop the shed roof. The assignment of error on the ground of insufficiency of evidence must be dismissed.</p>

L. 872, §904,18 P.S. §4904. The conviction here was based altogether on evidence which established only that a flashlight had been found on the premises of the real estate office; the flashlight could not be identified as belonging to any employee in that office.</p>
    <p id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.6",219,[162,2251,1146,97]],["BL_220.1",220,[190,329,1147,255]]]'>The record, then, is devoid of any evidence tying appellant to the flashlight.
