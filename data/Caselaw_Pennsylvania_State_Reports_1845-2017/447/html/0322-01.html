After the fight was stopped inside the bar, it moved out onto the street. Santos Soto, and several others, went outside to watch the fight. When Carmen Encarnación, who Avorked at the bar and was Soto’s -wife, went out to see what was <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>happening, she found Soto lying on the ground bleeding and unconscious. Then appellant informed Carmen that he was responsible for her husband’s injuries. The police arrived and took Soto to a nearby hospital accompanied by his wife. Carmen had been informed by a bystander that appellant had left to go to Martin’s Bar, a few blocks away. After Carmen left the hospital, she decided to go to Martin’s Bar to find out why Zapata had beat up her husband whom she believed to be an innocent bystander. Carmen drove to Martin’s Bar accompanied by her two brothers, Antonio Ramos and Carlos Lopez, and a friend, Gilberto Colon.</p>

Carmen testified for the Commonwealth that she began to ask Zapata why he had beaten her husband. At this point, her two brothers entered the bar and stood behind her. Appellant suddenly took a step backward and shot Carlos who fell to the floor. Antonio was then shot as he tried to run out the door. He made it outside and collapsed on the sidewalk.
