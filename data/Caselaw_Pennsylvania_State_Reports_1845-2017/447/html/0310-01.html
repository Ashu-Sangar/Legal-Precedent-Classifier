    <p id="b395-6" data-blocks='[["BL_395.7",395,[167,916,1147,430]]]'>The litigation concerns the annexation by a borough of land located in a township. It was initiated by the filing of a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas pursuant to the provisions of Section 1010 of The Borough Code, Act of February 1, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1656, No. 581, §3010, 53 P.S. §46010, which in part states “the determination and order of the court [court of common pleas] thereon shall be conclusive.”</p>

Cf. <em>Washington Arbitration Case, </em><a href="/pa/436/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="436 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1926078" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0168-01">436 Pa. 168</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=259%20A.2d%20437" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="259 A.2d 437">259 A. 2d 437</a> (1969). However, despite this statutory limitation, under Article V, Section 9 of the 1968 Pennsylvania Constitution, as implemented by the Act of December 2, 1968, P. L. , No. 351, §1-2, 12 P.S. §§1111.1 and 1111.2, an aggrieved party is now entitled to a full review of the order of the Court of Common Pleas by an appellate court. In this instance, the appellate court is the Commonwealth Court. See the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, No. 223, Art. IV, §402, 17 P.S. §211.402 (4) (Supp. 1971). However, this does not mean that full appeal rights are afforded after this first appellate <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>review. All Article V, Section 9 of the 1968 Pennsylvania Constitution, supra, gives is the right to one full appellate review, which has been effected. Our review from the order of the Commonwealth Court is, in my opinion, limited to narrow certiorari.</p>
    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[197,615,1145,541]]]'>It is true that Section 204 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, supra, 17 P.S. §211.204 (Supp. 1971) provides that the Supreme Court may assume broad review in all cases appealed thereto from the Commonwealth Court but this statutory provision merely describes the subject matter jurisdiction and the type of appeal (discretionary allowance) that may lie to the Supreme Court. It does not of itself create a right of appeal. See <em>Bell Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/396/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="396 Pa. 592" data-case-ids="1284873" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0592-01">396 Pa. 592</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20731" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="152 A.2d 731">152 A. 2d 731</a> (1959).</p>
