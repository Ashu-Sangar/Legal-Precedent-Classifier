To do any less violates the very framework of our constitutional form of government. Almost 125 years ago, construing the Constitution of 1838, it was aptly stated: “The mandate requiring an ‘adequate compensation’ to be provided for all ‘services’ required of these judges is as imperative as that which prohibits its diminution during their continuance in office. The first is as obligatory as the last, springing equally with it from the great frame of government established by the people themselves as the paramount law, which neither legislators, governors, nor judges are at liberty to disregard. ... It was for the safety of the people and not for the benefit of the judges that the latter were protected from legislative usurpation. To insure their independence it was as necessary to provide that they ‘shall receive an adequate compensation for their services’ as to declare that the compensation when ‘fixed by law’ shall not be ‘diminished during their continuance in office.’ "<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

It follows, therefore, that the Magistrates’ Court Act of 1937, Act of June 15, 1937, P. L. 1743, No. 368, §37, as amended, 42 P.S. §1138, which contains authorization for the payment of magistrates, will no longer support any salary payment to appellants. Furthermore, Article 5, §16(a), supra, provides that compensation be paid to the judges of the new Philadelphia courts by the Commonwealth, while the Magistrates’ Court Act orders payment by the City of Philadelphia. As the salary bill for these two courts which was finally enacted by the legislature, Act of October 17, 1969, P. L. 259, §2, 17 P.S. §711.2, related the increased salaries bach only to July 1, 1969, it is clear that for the period commencing January 1, 1969, and ending June 30, 1969, there was <em>no law </em>authorizing the payment of salaries to appellants. That during this time they in fact received compensation at the old rate for magistrates does not affect the legal issues involved. In the absence of specific legal authorization of judicial salaries covering the period in question, appellees had no express legal authority to pay any amount.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> They cannot now be compelled by a suit in mandamus to perform a further act admittedly beyond their legal poAvers, viz., to pay the increase in the new judicial rate over the old magisterial rate for the first six <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>months of the year.

Such a suit would presumably involve, <em>inter alia, </em>the questions whether the amount of the old magistrate’s salary, which in fact was paid to appellants for the first six months of 1969, was constitutionally adequate and whether the constitutional prohibition against diminution of judicial salaries during their terms of office, unless by law applying to all salaried officers of the Commonwealth, Article 5, §16(a), would inhibit the payment of any amount less than that provided by the Act of October 17, 1969, establishing a salary scale for the period commencing July 1, 1969. Any comment on these questions at this time would, of course, be both premature and unwise.</p>
