Section 1714 of the Act (16 P.S. §4714) provides in part as follows: “(a) Any person contributing monthly into the retirement fund who shall, for any cause, cease to be a county employe before he or she shall be eligible to receive the benefits of the retirement allowances, the total amount of the contributions paid into the retirement fund by such county employe shall be refunded to him or her by the board, or, in the event of the death of any such county employe, the amount of said contributions shall be paid to such person or persons as he or she shall have designated in writing, as filed with the board, as his or her beneficiary, or to his or her estate. If no person or persons have been designated as his or her beneficiary, or no notice has been filed with the board to pay the amount of such contributions to his or her estate, as herein provided, then the board is herewith authorized to pay such contributions to the executor, administra<a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>tor, surviving spouse, or next of kin of the deceased county employe . . . The employee, Adams, duly designated appellant in writing as his beneficiary and filed the writing with the Board. There was no restriction as to whom he might designate, and no requirement that it be someone to whom he was related, although the designation forms had a space in which to describe the relationship, if any, of the beneficiary to the employee. The narrow question is whether the relationship status indicated in the designation form had to be in existence at the time of the employee’s death.</p>
    <p id="b255-4" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[135,947,1152,984]]]'>It seems clear to us that the disposition of contributions which have been paid into the retirement fund by an employee whose employment ends before he is eligible for retirement benefits is governed by the quoted section of the Code, <em>supra, </em>and that this in turn is part and parcel of the employee’s terms of employment with his employer, the County. The statute recognizes the obligation of the system to return the contributions to the employee if his employment ceases prior to retirement, or to his designee if the employment status is terminated by death. That the undertaking of the County is of statutory origin does not make it any the less a contractual obligation. See <em>Geary v.

The sum of these decisions is that “wife” is merely descriptive of the particular individual, not that the individual name is an identification of the person who is then the wife, used in a generic sense. If, of course, the term “wife” were used alone, unaccompanied by the name of a person, the contrary result would be indicated. <em>Erny Trust, </em><a href="/pa/415/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="415 Pa. 8" data-case-ids="1891837" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0008-01">415 Pa. 8</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=202%20A.2d%2030" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="202 A.2d 30">202 A. 2d 30</a> (1964).

The former provides that a divorce decree terminates “all and any property rights <em>which are dependent upon such marital relation, </em>save those which are vested rights . . . .” (Emphasis added.)

If the testator is divorced from the bonds of matrimony after making a will, all provisions in the will in favor of his spouse so divorced shall be thereby revoked.” The lower court, acknowledging that the writing before it was non testamentary, nevertheless felt that the quoted section of the Wills Act could be considered public recognition of the presumed wishes of the decedent with respect to writings which were not wills. We disagree. Such a reading of the Wills Act provision is unwarrantedly broad. Among other things, it fails to take into account the legislature’s treatment in the Estates Act of beneficiary designations under life insurance policies and employee benefit plans as being nontestamentary in character.

She then requested that the Retirement Board pay her the balance to her son’s credit in the Fund. The Board refused, and the administratrix then sued the Board in assumpsit in the Civil Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. Appellant was interpleaded by the Board as party plaintiff and also filed a claim. Preliminary objections to appellant’s claim were filed, averring that the designation was testamentary in character and therefore the matter was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court Division.

When reviewing this <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>motion, Judge Bolte reconsidered the question of jurisdiction and found controlling our decision in <em>Eherhardt v.

He found that the disposition of these funds was essentially testamentary and accordingly directed that the Retirement Board pay into the estate the fund in dispute, without prejudice to appellant’s right to pursue her claim in the Orphans’ Court Division. The’ Retirement Board complied, and the litigation resumed in that division, which then unquestionably had acquired jurisdiction over the property and the conflicting claims thereto. We entertain serious doubt, however, whether initially the proceeds of the Retirement Fund were part of the estate, and whether our decision in <em>Eberhardt v. Ovens, supra, </em>dictated a transfer to the Orphans’ Court Division. However that may be, the case having been transferred to the Orphans’ Court Division in the manner described, and without objection, we now treat it as one properly before that tribunal and thus properly appealable directly to this Court.

    <p id="b258-7" data-blocks='[["BL_258.9",258,[198,1176,1145,208]]]'>Although the majority opinion accurately summarizes the facts and precisely recites the narrow issue presented by this appeal, I am unable to agree with the conclusion of a majority of my colleagues.</p>
    <p id="b258-8" data-blocks='[["BL_258.10",258,[194,1397,1149,925]],["BL_259.1",259,[138,332,1151,435]]]'>Initially, I must note my disagreement with the majority that Section 55(3) of The Divorce Law, Act of May 2,1929, P. L. 1237, §55, <em>as amended, </em>23 P.S. §55(3) (Supp. 1971), “is of no help in deciding the case at hand. . . .” In addition to stating that all property rights dependent upon a marital relationship are terminated by a divorce decree, Section 55(3) of The Divorce Law further provides that, “[a] 11 duties, rights and claims accruing to either of said parties at any time heretofore in pursuance of said marriage, shall cease and determine . . . .” Although a spouse’s right or claim to retirement funds under the Act of July 28, 1953, P. L. 723, §1701 <em>et seq., as amended, </em>16 P.S. §4701 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp 1971), does not automatically accrue “in pursuance of said marriage” since the employee must designate “such person or persons ... as his or her beneficiary,” Act of July 28, 1953, P. L. 723, §1714, <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>
      <em>as amended, </em>16 P.S. §4714 (Supp. 1971), <em>appellant’s right or claim accrued pursuant to the marriage. </em>I make this statement in view of the fact that decedent did not designate appellant as the beneficiary until six days <em>after </em>the marriage even though decedent could have done so beforehand. As appellant’s right or claim accrued pursuant to the marriage, it was dissolved by the divorce under Section 55(3) of The Divorce Law.</p>
    <p id="b259-4" data-blocks='[["BL_259.4",259,[141,780,1150,872]]]'>If decedent was so interested in appellant’s well-being after the divorce, and that is the assumption implicit in the majority opinion, why did decedent wait until after the marriage to designate appellant? It seems most logical to me that just as decedent’s concern for appellant’s well-being did not arise until after the marriage, his concern lapsed after the divorce. Indeed, decedent was married to appellant for less than four months when appellant filed for divorce. While I do not profess to be an expert on human affairs, I do not believe decedent intended to benefit appellant. Moreover, this result is in accord with the public policy of this Commonwealth as evidenced by Section 55(3) of The Divorce Law and Section 7(2) of the Wills Act of 1947, Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, §7(2), <em>as amended, </em>20 P.S. §180.7(2) (Supp. 1971).</p>
    <p id="b259-5" data-blocks='[["BL_259.5",259,[143,1665,1149,539]]]'>As the majority expressly recognizes, if the term “wife” were used alone, unaccompanied by the name of a person, appellant would not be entitled to this fund. <em>Erny Trust, </em><a href="/pa/415/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="415 Pa. 8" data-case-ids="1891837" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0008-01">415 Pa. 8</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=202%20A.2d%2030" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="202 A.2d 30">202 A. 2d 30</a> (1964). Similarly, the majority opinion implicitly acknowledges that a contrary result would occur if this transfer of retirement benefits were deemed testamentary. In light of Section 55(3) of The Divorce Law, the public policy of this Commonwealth and the facts of this case, I believe that appellant is not entitled to this fund.</p>
