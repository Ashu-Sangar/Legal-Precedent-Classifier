Purdy died testate on October 5, 1954, leaving a life estate to his widow with an unlimited power of consumption and the remainder, if any, to his nephew. As of February 24, 1956, the executors of William C. Purdy’s estate overpaid the inheritance tax by the amount of $4,824.30. After the death of the life tenant, the executors of William C. Purdy’s estate claimed as a credit on the inheritance tax not only this overpayment but also the legal interest on the overpayment, to wit, $3,200.85. While crediting the overpayment, the Commonwealth disallowed the interest claim and the estate filed a protest with the Department of Revenue. The protest was denied and an appeal was taken to the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County. That court held that the Commonwealth was liable for interest on the overpayment and this appeal followed.</p>

      <em>tunc </em>was improper. Since the decree of the court below was entered on February 24, 1969, more than two years before this appeal was filed, the appellee argues that the statutory appeals period is mandatory and that this Court is powerless to extend the time. <em>E.g., Dixon Estate, </em><a href="/pa/443/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="443 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="1936965" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0303-01">443 Pa. 303</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%2039" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="279 A.2d 39">279 A. 2d 39</a> (1971); <em>Hanna Estate, </em><a href="/pa/367/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="367 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1228262" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0337-01">367 Pa. 337</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.2d%20740" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="80 A.2d 740">80 A. 2d 740</a> (1951).

The court below relied on an adjudication by the same court in <em>Willcox Estate, </em>14 Fiduc. Rep. 314, 319-20, <a href="/pa-d-c2d/33/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="33 Pa.

Justice and equity require that where there has been a prepayment of part, but less than all, of the tax due at some future date, the taxpayer should be entitled at the time of final assessment to credit not only for the dollar amount of. the prepayment, <em>but also interest thereon.” </em>(Emphasis added)</p>

Lastly, the appellee ignores the well-settled rule that a sovereign state is not liable for interest in any case except where, expressly or by reasonable construction of a contract or statute, it has placed itself in a position of liability. <em>See, Marianelli v.
