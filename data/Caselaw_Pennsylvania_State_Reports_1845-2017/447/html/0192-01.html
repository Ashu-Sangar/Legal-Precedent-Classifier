Hyneman, Jr. During the jury trial relating to the death of Carla Irene Timmons, an infant, appellant elected to plead guilty to murder generally; the jury was dismissed and the trial judge continued to take evidence in order to determine the degree of guilt. During this degree-of-guilt hearing appellant pled guilty to the murder of Marie Peggy Timmons. Found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Marie Peggy Timmons, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Supp. 819</a> (E.D. Pa. 1967), appellant sought relief under the provisions of the Post Conviction' Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, §1 <em>et seq., </em>19 P.S. §1180-1 et seq.

Hyneman, Jr. There is ample evidence to support the conclusion that appellant was aware of this other romance and that John P. Hyneman, Jr., was at Marie Peggy Timmons’ residence on the night in question. Briefly summarized, appellant went to the Timmons’ home, found Marie Peggy Timmons in bed with Hyneman and proceeded to strangle the two of them as well as the infant, Carla Irene Timmons.</p>

After reviewing the record, we are in agreement with the court below that appellant, “came to the Timmons’ house, not for the purpose of securing his glasses, as he states, but for the purpose of causing an incident because Hyneman was present and was being favored with the attention and love of the woman he, the [ap<a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>pellant], was largely supporting, for whom he had provided a home, and with whom he had just a few hours previously been having intercourse.”</p>
