The Commonwealth analogizes this examination to the taking of handwriting exemplars, finger-X&gt;rints, blood samples, voice identifications and other kinds of “real”, “physical” or “body” evidence. Although some jurisdictions have apparently accepted this line of reasoning,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> we do not. Our previous decisions, as well as those of the United States Supreme Court, including <em>Sehmerber </em>and <em>United States v.

In <em>Musto </em>our Court cited with approval Wigmore’s analysis of the difference between testimonial and physical evidence: “Unless some attempt is made to secure a communication, written or oral, upon which reliance is to be placed as involving his consciousness of the facts and the operations of his mind in expressing it, the demand made upon him is not a testimonial one.” Wigmore, supra, §2265.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> There can be little doubt that in answering a psychiatrist’s questions a defendant would be making an oral communication involving “his consciousness of the facts and the operations of his mind.”</p>

    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[190,831,1147,818]]]'>The Commonwealth’s second argument is for the adoption of an automatic waiver approach; that is, even assuming that a psychiatric examination involves an accused’s being compelled to give self-incriminating testimonial evidence, a defendant must be held to waive his fifth amendment privilege when he pleads not guilty by reason of insanity because otherwise a fair state-individual balance will not be maintained. The Commonwealth grounds this argument on assertions that, without its own examination, the Commonwealth will have “no effective means of rebutting the insanity defense” and that our recent decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Vogel, </em><a href="/pa/440/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="440 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1932311" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0001-01">440 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=268%20A.2d%2089" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="268 A.2d 89">268 A. 2d 89</a> (1970) “has placed a greater burden on the Commonwealth ... by removing the presumption of sanity.”</p>
    <p id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[189,1662,1147,645]]]'>We find this argument unconvincing. We do not believe that the idea of an automatic waiver of a constitutional privilege is consistent with the principle that a waiver, to be effective, must be voluntary and must be an “intentional relinquishment of a known right.” <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em><a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">304 U.S. 458</a>, 464 (1938). It is difficult to understand how a waiver could be characterized as either voluntary or intentional if automatically triggered by a defendant’s assertion of the defense of insanity. Such a characterization would do violence to the concept associated with <em>Johnson </em>of a free choice between anticipated benefits and detriments.</p>

      <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>Nor can appellant gain support from those cases which hold that a defendant who takes the witness stand waives the privilege for purposes of cross-examination. See, e.g., <em>Brown v. United </em>States, <a href="/us/356/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="356 U.S. 148" data-case-ids="6161452" data-case-paths="/us/356/0148-01">356 U.S. 148</a> (1958) ; <em>Fitzpatrick v.

Both the language of the fifth amendment and the interests it protects weigh against an extension of the automatic waiver to out-of-court psychiatric examinations. As one commentator has said, “the language of the privilege—the accused shall not ‘be compelled ... to be a witness against hi mself7—implies that once a defendant becomes a ‘witness’, the privilege no longer applies.” Harvard Note, supra, at 669. In addition, the protection afforded the defendant by the privilege is more important to him when he is questioned out-of-court where he is not safeguarded by the presence of procedural rules, the trial judge, and his attorney.</p>

The Commonwealth’s expert psychiatric witnesses could use whatever basic facts were used by defendant’s psychiatrist in his testimony as forming the grounds for his opinion. The prosecution could also garner these facts from eyewitness testimony, including the personal observation of family, friends and co-workers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The prose<a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>eution could rebut or undermine a defendant’s psychiatrist’s version of the basic facts by attacking his methods or by the testimony of lay witnesses.

Our Court now decides that upon examination by the Commonwealth’s psychiatrist in the presence of defendant’s counsel, defendant does not have to answer any questions which would in any way tend to incriminate him, or indeed divulge any information whatsoever. This ruling makes it virtually impossible for the Commonwealth to rebut the testimony of defendant’s psychiatrists, who were permitted to examine and question defendant about his feelings and absolutely anything else they desired—and hence makes it virtually impossible for the Commonwealth’s psychiatrist or other expert witnesses to testify about defendant’s sanity or insanity at the time he committed the murder.</p>
