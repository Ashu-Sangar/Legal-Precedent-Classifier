K. Fawcett in July 1969, in Washington, Pennsylvania. Banks was adjudged guilty <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>of murder in tlie second degree. In a subsequent and separate jury trial, Norvelle DeWitt Jennings, another alleged participant in the Fawcett crimes, was convicted of murder in the first degree. Today, we affirmed the judgment and conviction of Jennings. As noted in our opinion disposing of the Jennings appeal, the evidence of guilt introduced by the Commonwealth in the Jennings trial was more substantial than that offered during the Banks trial.</p>
    <p id="b433-3" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[171,835,1148,153]]]'>The facts giving rise to the prosecutions are detailed in our opinion disposing of the Jennings appeal and will not be repeated here.</p>
    <p id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.5",433,[170,1001,1148,264]]]'>In the instant appeal, it is urged Banks is entitled to a new trial because “the verdict was against the weight of the credible evidence,” and also because certain errors during the trial proceedings were prejudicial to Banks’ rights.</p>
    <p id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.6",433,[164,1278,1153,809]]]'>In reviewing the validity of a criminal conviction, it is not the duty of this Court to weigh the evidence or to pass upon the credibility of the trial witnesses. Cf. <em>Commonwealth, v. Green, </em><a href="/pa/358/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="358 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="8845304" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0192-01">358 Pa. 192</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%2095" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="56 A.2d 95">56 A. 2d 95</a> (1948). However, this does not mean that in a proper case, we are precluded from awarding a new trial in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> if the assignment of error under discussion is construed to establish that the evidence below was such that justice requires a new trial. However, in the instant ease, we are not so persuaded. The sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction is not disputed, and our review of the record satisfies us that no error of law ensued in leaving the issue of guilt to the jury’s determination.</p>

Herein, just as in the <em>Jennings </em>case, the court did not follow the mandate of Buie 317 by reading the contents of the indictment to the defendant because it included counts charging the commission of other crimes. However, the court did inform Banks he stood before the court indicted for the murder of P. K. Fawcett, and in response to this admonition, Banks plead “not guilty.” In Jennings, we overruled the contention that a new trial was necessary because of the court’s failure to read the contents of the indictment to the accused during the arraignment proceedings, and we reject it here also for the reasons given in the <em>Jennings </em>opinion.</p>
    <p id="b434-6" data-blocks='[["BL_434.6",434,[192,1617,1147,319]]]'>However, the trial court created another unnecessary problem in the instant case by not arraigning Banks until after the jury was selected and sworn. This was error and, while we emphatically condemn the disregard of our Buies, we fail to see how Banks was prejudiced by this particular infraction.</p>

The instant record discloses these particular purposes were amply fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.4",435,[162,769,1149,488]]]'>The burglary-homicide involved occurred on July 26, 1969. Banks was arrested on August 19th for burglary, larceny, conspiracy and murder in connection therewith. On August 26th, the court appointed counsel to represent him and he was given a preliminary hearing on the charges before a committing magistrate on September 11th. He was indicted on January 6, 1970, and a pretrial conference with all parties present was held before the court on January 14th.</p>
    <p id="b435-5" data-blocks='[["BL_435.5",435,[159,1270,1151,985]]]'>Following his appointment, counsel for Banks served the interests of his client assiduously. He sought Banks’ discharge pretrial through habeas corpus. He filed motions challenging the array of the grand jury, and the array of the petit jury. He succeeded in having the court sever the burglary, larceny and conspiracy counts in the indictment from the murder count. He also filed a petition for a bill of particulars; a motion asking the court to direct the district attorney to provide the defense with copies of certain written documents in the possession of the prosecution; a motion for a change of venue and a motion to suppress certain evidence. Under the circumstances, it can hardly be said that the identity of the accused was not fixed, or that Banks was not fully informed of the nature of the charges pending against him. Cf. 21 Am. Jut. 2d, Criminal Law §454 (1965), and 22 C.J.S., Criminal Law §411(1) (1961).</p>

This exhibit served a clear evidentiary purpose, and, under the circumstances, this fact amply outweighs any reason for rejection of the exhibit, such as the likelihood it might inflame the minds of the jurors. Hence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this photograph. <em>Commonwealth v.

The challenged portion of the charge was as follows: “Naser’s testimony is of extreme importance in this case and his credibility should be weighed carefully. I repeat, his testimony, if it is believed, reveals he was an accomplice of the defendant. It is for you to say whether Naser was in fact the defendant’s accomplice for this is a matter which depends upon his credibility, that is, his truthfulness. In making your determination, you must realize that if the defendant did not commit the crime, he could not have had any accomplice at all.”</p>

But, a reading of the charge in its entirety demonstrates that this is what the court did if the jury believed his testimony as to the commission of the crimes, and that he and Banks participated therein. As the court explained, if Naser’s testimony that Banks participated in the commission of the crimes Avere not true, Naser could not have been <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>his accomplice. Under the circumstances, no prejudicial error ensued, particularly since the court clearly instructed the jury as to the care and scrutiny to be given the testimony of an accomplice before it is accepted as credible.</p>
