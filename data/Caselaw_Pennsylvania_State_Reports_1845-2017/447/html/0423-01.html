By this resolution the Board “re-affirm [ed] its policy of developing integrated quality education in the District”, and to that end “adopt[ed] as a policy the reorganization of all elementary units for the school year beginning September 1970, so that the student enrollment in each school will reflect within ten percent (10%) the racial composition of the total public school population.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (2) By reason of the Plan the 1970-71 school year budget as tentatively adopted by the Board on May 22, 1970, contained proposed expenditures of $1% million more than those for the preceding school year. (3) The Plan requires daily cross-city busing of approximately 28% of the students enrolled in the District schools in order to establish racially balanced school attendance patterns. (4) The proposed budget for 1970-71 placed the cost of busing, school bus monitors, and a school lunch program for transported children at more than $500,000 but made no provision for certain other unstated costs involved in the program, estimated at an additional $300,000 to $500,000. (5) The Plan resulted from the desegregation directive giv<a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>en to the Board by the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. (6) No segregation has ever existed within the Harrisburg Public School system nor has the Board ever embarked on any “Plan of Segregation”. (This averment is arguably a conclusion of law.)</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[195,605,1147,209]]]'>Following the recitation of these facts, the complaint states the legal conclusion that the adoption of the Plan was “unconstitutional and unreasonable”. Three reasons are given in support of this conclusion:</p>

The complaint alleges, finally, that the expenditure of tax monies in pursuance of the Plan is “needless, wasteful and arbitrary”.</p>

In its pursuit of such ends, the Plan establishes an early childhood education program designed to bring together pre-kindergarten through second grade age children in special “early childhood” centers. The centers are intended to offer a wide variety of programs and facilities which smaller neighborhood schools could not economi<a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>cally provide.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Programs and groupings with similar purpose are included in the Plan’s reorganization and consolidation of the District’s schools into elementary (grades three to six), intermediate (grades seven and eight), and comprehensive high schools (grades nine through twelve).</p>
    <p id="b503-4" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[131,656,1150,539]]]'>The Plan declares interaction between students of different races, cultural groups, economic backgrounds, and levels of achievement to be an essential component of quality education. Thus, the Plan envisions random assignment (by computer) of each child not only on the basis of race, but also on the basis of sex, socioeconomic status and academic achievement “in order to achieve completely mixed schools and classrooms”. The Plan provides, moreover, that the same instructional programs be made available to every child.</p>
    <p id="b503-5" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[129,1207,1151,595]]]'>As an aid in achieving such a heterogeneous school and classroom composition, the Plan calls for the busing of approximately 29 percent of the total number of students presently enrolled in the Harrisburg public school system. It is explained, however, that “[n]o racial group will have to transport more children than any other group; each group will be subject to transportation equally since the computer program will assign each child at random on the basis of race, socioeconomic status and academic achievement in order to achieve completely mixed schools and classrooms.”</p>

This allegation is also <em>in pari materia </em>with the allegations (1) that the expenditure of public monies in order to finance an unconstitutional program, particularly as it provides for pupil transportation, is also unconstitutional, and (2) that no racial segregation has ever existed in the Harrisburg schools.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In sum, this second thrust of the com<a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>plaint seems to be premised on the assumption that there is some sort of inherent right, enforceable by parents, pupils and taxpayers, to a “neighborhood school”.
