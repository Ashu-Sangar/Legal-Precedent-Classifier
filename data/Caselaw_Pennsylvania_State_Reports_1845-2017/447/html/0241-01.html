    <p id="b316-12" data-blocks='[["BL_316.19",316,[214,1764,1146,373]]]'>This appeal is from a judgment on the pleadings declaring terminated and of no effect an oil and gas lease in which defendant has a lessee interest, enjoining defendant from carrying on any operations on the leased premises, and directing that it remove its equipment therefrom. From the pleadings the following appears :</p>
    <p id="b316-13" data-blocks='[["BL_316.20",316,[213,2150,1147,208]],["BL_317.1",317,[163,336,1148,487]]]'>Plaintiff (herein “North Star”) purchased the property in question, some 229 acres, in September, 1960, from one George C. Kuehnert. The deed was made under and subject to an oil and gas lease which had been <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>entered into in 1891 between James Mevey (also referred to as McVey) Kuehnert’s predecessor in title, as lessor, and John A. Steel and M. C. Egbert (also referred to as N. C. Eghart), as lessees. This lease was for a term of five years “or as long thereafter as oil and gas is found in paying quantities”. The lease provided that it would become null and void if the lessees should “at any time cease to operate on the above premises for the continuous space of six mouths”.</p>
    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[163,834,1149,1096]]]'>The complaint alleged that defendant Waverly Oil “Works Company (“Waverly”) was “successor in interest to the original lessees”,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and that it had forfeited the lease under the six months clause, and also that the lease had automatically terminated because oil and gas were no longer to be found in paying quantities. Waverly by its answer: (1) admitted that drilling had stopped for a period in excess of six months, but stated that this w'as made necessary to protect two producing gas wells from the blasting operations of a coal stripper operating under lease from North Star; (2) averred that the lease had not been abandoned, as evidenced by its repair of an oil tank before receipt of North Star’s Declaration of Forfeiture and the resumption of drilling as promptly as possible following back-filling by the stripper; and (8) averred that Kuehnert liad reserved to himself the royalties under the lease, so that North Star had no interest therein and was attempting by this suit to defraud those rightfully entitled to the royalty interest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The petition further alleged, without denial, the death of George 0. Kuehnert in 1961 and that one-half of his royalty interest in the Steel-Egbert lease was devised by will to Kuehnert’s two children, who had in turn conveyed the same to one Blair E. Bell, and that the other one-half interest was now owned by one Paul Giaffoni. The petition, after reciting various statements from the pleadings, asserted that if not permitted to intervene, Pennzoil might lose its right to produce oil and gas from the deep sands of the leased premises without having been given an opportunity to defend.</p>
    <p id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[159,1003,1148,532]]]'>There can be no doubt that the judgment on the pleadings was entered in error, and must be reversed. This would have been true even as matters stood prior to the Pennzoil intervention. The answer to the complaint, while formally deficient in not setting up defenses by way of new matter (a defect which Waverly sought unsuccessfully to cure), was sufficient to indicate that at least the following factual and legal questions required determination before judgment for plaintiff could be entered:</p>
    <p id="b319-5" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[160,1555,1147,535]]]'>(1) Did Kuehnert, as alleged by Waverly in its answer, reserve the royalties from the oil and gas lease to himself? If so, is the reversionary interest in that lease in Kuehnert, his heirs and assigns, or is it in North Star? The answer to this question requires at the minimum an examination of the full text of the deed to North Star, which is not of record. On the answer depends, of course, North Star’s standing both to declare a forfeiture of the lease and to bring this suit to declare it terminated.</p>
    <p id="b319-6" data-blocks='[["BL_319.6",319,[160,2109,1147,262]],["BL_320.1",320,[193,331,1144,97]]]'>(2) If North Star has no interest in the royalties, can it undertake to declare a forfeiture without the consent of the royalty owners (Kuehnert’s heirs, successors or assigns) or without making them parties defendant? Whether such consent has been given and <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>who are the present owners of the royalty interest did not appear in the record before the lower court.</p>
    <p id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.4",320,[192,441,1146,429]]]'>(3) Is it true that the cessation of operations between May, 1964 and September, 1966, admitted by Waverly, was to protect producing sands from the effects of coal stripping operations, and were these operations, including blasting, at the insistence of plaintiff’s own coal stripping lessee? If so, a question of estoppel to declare a forfeiture would be presented and require determination.</p>
    <p id="b320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[191,884,1145,485]]]'>In addition, the Pennzoil intervention makes it clear that Waverly is not the complete successor to the oil and gas lease in dispute, as the complaint alleged, but that Pennzoil itself retains some interest therein. The court decree, however, purported to terminate not only the Waverly interest, but the entire original lease of 1891 from McVey to Steel and Egbert. As it now appears, this it could not do without Pennzoil in court as an indispensable party defendant.</p>
