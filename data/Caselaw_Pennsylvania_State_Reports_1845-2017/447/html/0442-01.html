He felt well and <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>believed that he was in good health. On July 19, 1965, a physician for the company examined Mr. Sherman and confirmed that he was in good health. On August 24, 1965, between nine and ten a.m., a policy in the amount of $15,000 was delivered to Mr. Sherman at the place of business operated by him and his brother.</p>

Since it was his day off, he went to a family physician, Dr. Nemez, for relief. Upon examining Mr. Sherman, Dr. Nemez discovered a mass, said to be “the size of a lemon,” in his left mid-abdomen. Two days later x-rays established that Mr. Sherman had a tumor in his colon. The tumor was malignant. Surgery was performed on August 30,1965, which may have prolonged his life but could not save it. Mr. Sherman died nine months later, on May 17, 1966.</p>

However, under Pennsylvania law, the. continued growth of an already existent tumor from a. stage where it is <em>not </em>discovered to a stage where it <em>is </em>discovered is not the type of “material change” in the physical condition of the insured necessary for an insurer to avoid liability under “a good health clause” of a policy .issued after the insured has been examined by a medical representative of the insurer.</p>

For the company later to be allowed successfully to contend that the policy never became <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>effective because the applicant breached the sound-health clause in that he suffered from disease or bodily-impairment when the policy was delivered to him, in a case where the same condition existed when the company examined him, would be to give countenance to a practice that, while perhaps not fairly to be characterized as fraudulent, would be unreasonably destructive of the protection which life insurance is aimed to secure. . . . We conclude, therefore, that the sound-health clause has no application to such diseases as the insured may have had at the time of the medical examination, but that its legal scope must be restricted to mean only that the applicant did not contract any new disease impairing his health nor suffer any material change in his physical condition between the time of such examination and the date of the policy.”</p>

Laboratory examination of the removed gland indicated that the insured had Hodgkin’s disease. The policy was delivered after the gland was removed, but before the dreaded diagnosis was confirmed.
