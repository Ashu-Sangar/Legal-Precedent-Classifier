To remove the burden of proof from the Commonwealth and place it instead upon the defendant who retains private counsel at trial is as repugnant to the equal protection clause as was the invidious discrimination against indigents that <em>Douglas </em>required be eliminated. <em>Douglas </em>guaranteed that an indigent defendant would have the same access to the appeal process as the nonindigent defendant. To place a substantially more onerous burden on a defendant with privately retained counsel than a defendant with court-appointed counsel creates an inverse discrimination that favors defendants with court-appointed counsel. The United States Supreme Court held that such inverse discrimination violates the equal protection clause: “The State is not powerless to enforce judgments against those financially unable to pay a fine; <em>indeed, a different result would amount to inverse discrimination since it would enable an indigent to avoid, both the fine and imprisonment for nonpayment whereas other defendants must always suffer one or the other conviction. . . </em>.” (Emphasis added.) <em>Tate v.

In <em>Fay </em>the Supreme Court was presented with a defendant who had retained private counsel in a <em>pre-Douglas </em>trial. The issue before the Court was whether the defendant had “deliberately by-passed” his right of appeal. In analyzing the problem of deliberate by-pass the Court explicitly compelled the application of federal standards for determining waiver of a constitutional right: “The classic definition of waiver enunciated in Johnson v. Zerbst, <a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">304 U.S. 458</a>, 464, <a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">58 S.

Ed. 1461</a>—(an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege’—furnishes the controlling standard. If a habeas applicant, after consultation with competent counsel or otherwise, understandingly and knowingly forewent the privilege of seeking to vindicate his federal claims in the state courts, whether for strategic, tactical, or any other reasons that can fairly be described as the deliberate by-passing of state procedures then it is open to the federal court on habeas to deny him all relief. ... At all events we wish it clearly understood that the standard here put forth depends on the <em>considered choice </em>of the petitioner.” (Citations omitted) (Emphasis added).
