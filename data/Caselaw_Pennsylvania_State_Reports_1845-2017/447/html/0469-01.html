L. 512, as amended, 20 P.S. §320.305. The petition stated that appellees refused to recognize her rights, and prayed for a determination of the antagonistic claims, so that orderly administration of the estate could be proceeded with. The case was heard on the pleadings, apparently without a hearing, resulting in judgment in favor of the two sons. The niece has appealed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> We affirm.</p>

Lapsed nonresiduary gifts fall into the residue, while lapsed residuary bequests or devises pass to other residuary legatees or devisees, if any, and in their absence pass as by intestacy. Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, §§14(9) and (10), 20 P.S. §§180.14(9) and (10). Clearly, if the testamentary gifts to Frances Sweeney lapse, the entire estate must pass by intestacy to appellees, testatrix’ heirs, at law, because the sister is the sole residuary legatee.</p>

It is presently found in §14(8) of the Wills Act as a rule of construction, as follows: “In the absence of a contrary intent appearing therein, <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>wills shall be construed as to real and personal estate in accordance with the following rules: ... (8) Lapsed and void devises and legacies.—Substitution of issue. A devise or bequest . . . to . . . [testator’s] brother or sister . . . shall not lapse if the beneficiary shall fail to survive the testator and shall leave issue surviving the testator but shall pass to such surviving issue . . .; Provided, That such a devise or bequest to a brother or sister . . . shall lapse to the extent to which it will pass to the testator’s spouse or issue as a part of the residuary estate or under the intestate laws.” Act of April 24, 1947, P.

We cannot agree. The only intent possible to discern from the will is that testatrix favored her sister over her sons as primary beneficiary of her entire estate. There is nothing whatever in the instrument which indicates that testatrix would have favored her niece over her sons in the circumstance that occurred, and were we to so hold, the proviso clause in §14(8) would be <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>rendered nugatory. The legislature’s concern that “in the absence of a contrary intent appearing [in the will]” the spouse and children of the testator are the next favored beneficiaries after brothers or sisters (or a child of a brother or sister) is not to be thus ignored. <em>Corbett Estate, </em><a href="/pa/430/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="430 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1915738" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0054-01">430 Pa. 54</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=241%20A.2d%20524" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="241 A.2d 524">241 A. 2d 524</a> (1968) is in no way to the contrary of this holding, and the cases from other jurisdictions cited by appellant are not helpful in applying the Pennsylvania statutory provision here involved.</p>

Thus, if testator is survived by a widow and children, but leaves his entire estate to his brother who dies before testator but is survived by issue of his own, the gift to the brother will clearly lapse and the property will pass to the spouse and testator’s children under the Intestate Act.
