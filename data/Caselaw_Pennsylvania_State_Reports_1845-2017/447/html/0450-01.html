    <p id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.7",525,[168,648,1148,321]]]'>Appellant, Edward J. Donovan, at age sixteen, was found guilty of second-degree murder on February 2, 1970, after a non jury trial. The Commonwealth had certified that the case was not one of first-degree murder. After denial of his post-trial motions, appellant was sentenced to a term of six to twenty years.</p>
    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.8",525,[166,981,1148,374]]]'>On appeal, appellant raises only one issue. He contends that the trial judge committed reversible error Avhen he permitted the Commonwealth to introduce testimony concerning the good character and reputation of the Adctim, Arthur Eliot, a seventeen-year-old boy whom appellant had stabbed during an altercation on a public street.</p>
    <p id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.9",525,[163,1370,1149,704]]]'>The argument is made Avith reference to the testi mony of Arthur Eliot’s father, mother, and some of his high school friends, all of whom testified in the Commomvealth’s case in chief that Arthur was a peaceful, law-abiding youngster, who did not belong to any gang or engage in fighting. Appellant contends that the admission of such testimony violates the well-established principle of laAV that evidence showing the character or reputation of the deceased may not be given by the Commonwealth in its case in chief before such character or reputation has been attacked by the defendant. <em>Commonwealth v.
