    <p id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.8",193,[141,720,1150,1482]]]'>This appeal arises out of a dispute concerning an agreement of sale, under the terms of which the appellants agreed to purchase from the appellee a lot and home to be constructed thereon. The water supply for this home was to be provided by a private well drilled on the lot. It is undisputed that appellee, the builder-vendor of the home, adequately constructed the home and the well; it is also undisputed that the well has never produced water of a quality suitable for human consumption. Appellants refused to release the remaining balance in the construction fund unless and until appellee would provide them with an adequate supply of unpolluted water. Appellee sued the appellants for the balance of the construction fund, whereupon appellants brought suit in equity against appellee praying that he be ordered to supply them with an adequate quantity of water fit for human consumption. The two causes were consolidated for hearing and tried before a judge sitting without a jury. The lower court ruled in favor of appellee in both suits and awarded appellee the monies due him under the construction agreement. Although finding that it was not appellee’s duty to supply the home buyers with a source of potable water, the trial judge nevertheless ordered the builder-vendor to redrill the well to the deepest water bearing stratum on appellants’ property.

The pertinent facts are as follows: Appellee Gaster subdivided an area of land owned by him and referred to in the record as Spring Valley, Middletown Township, Delaware County, into 32 lots, each approximately one acre in size. Gaster would sell a lot to an interested purchaser only if the purchaser concurrently agreed to have Gaster construct a home on the property. For sales purposes, appellee maintained a model home in the development.</p>
    <p id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.5",194,[208,890,1147,917]]]'>On January 16, 1963, Gaster and the Elderkins entered into an agreement whereby the latter would purchase a lot and home in Spring Valley for a total consideration of $26,430, $500 of which was paid at the signing of the sales agreement. The balance was to be paid partially at settlement of the sale transaction and partially under the terms of a subsequently executed construction agreement'. On January 31, 1963, appellee deeded a lot to appellants for the consideration of $6,000,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and the parties executed a construction agreement obligating the appellee to construct a house, similar to the display house, on appellants’ lot. For this service appellant was to receive a total of $20,430 in installment payments to be paid at various stages of construction. It was the final $4,086 of this fund, withheld by appellants, that appellee was awarded by the lower court.</p>

We have concluded that one who purchases a development house conforms to this standard; he justifiably relies on the skill of the developer that the house will be a suitable living unit. Not only does a housing developer hold himself out as having the necessary expertise with which to produce an adequate dwelling, but he has by far the better opportunity to examine the suitability of the home site and to determine what measures should be taken to provide a home fit for habitation. As between the builder-vendor and the vendee, the position of the former, even though he exercises reasonable care, dictates that he bear the risk that a home which he has built will be functional and habitable in accordance with contemporary community standards. We thus hold that the builder-vendor impliedly warrants that the home he has built and is selling is constructed in a reasonably workmanlike manner and that it is fit for the purpose intended—habitation.</p>

        <em> </em>Closely related to the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>is what is known, in Pennsylvania, as the doctrine of merger. This latter doctrine, normally applied to warranties of title, holds that all warranties and representations in connection with a sale or other transaction made prior to or contemporaneous with a deed are merged into the deed and that unless therein expressly provided for, they are forever lost. See, e.g., <em>Dick v.

The court specifically noted that there was no evidence that the builder-vendor knew or should have known of the underground water, but because be selected the homesite the builder was in the better position to protect against the hazard involved. A similar rationale was employed by the Supreme Court of Washington in <em>House v. Thornton, supra, </em>where the foundation of a house began to crumble because of the instability of the land upon which it was situated. In the latter case, the builder-vendor before beginning construction bad been assured by municipal engineers that the land would be suitable as a homesite.</p>
