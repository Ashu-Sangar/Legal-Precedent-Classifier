Lastly, <em>Darlington </em>held that stock dividends of 6% or less generated by the corpus of a pre-1939 trust and received after 1963 are considered income in the absence of a contrary direction by the settlor; but if the settlor directed the allocation of such dividends to principal, thereby accumulating that which would otherwise be income, this direction is valid and the rationale of <em>Maris </em>is inapplicable since the Principal and Income Act of 1947 not only permits the settlor to make such allocation but also repeals any other acts, including Section 9 of the 1853 Act, which are inconsistent.</p>

Specifically, we must interpret the settlor’s language in paragraph seven of the 1917 trust which is identical to his language in paragraph six of the 1933 trust: “Seventh: Pull discretion, power and authority is hereby given to the said Trustee to take and pay for out of the principal of the trust estate, all allotments of bonds, stock or stock dividends which it as the holder of bonds or stock forming part of the trust estate shall have the right to take, and to borrow money when in its judgment necessary for the proper execution of this power, and <em>all allotments of bonds, stock' or stock dividends shall be treated amd regarded as belonging to the principal of the trust estate and not as income.” </em>(Emphasis added) As indicated by our italics, the pivotal question concerns the <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>definition of “allotments.” The construction urged by appellants, and rejected by the court below, is that only those stock dividends paid for from principal should be retained in principal and all other stock dividends should be allocated to income in accordance with the law applicable at the date of receipt. The court below construed this language as a direction that <em>all </em>stock dividends should be awarded to principal.</p>

On this point, appellants cite several dictionaries, cases and textbooks that were popular when these trusts were created to demonstrate that the term “allotment” was used in connection with stock subscriptions. Therefore, appellants contend that settlor, by this language, only intended to cover the hybrid situation where stock dividends <em>had to be paid </em>for: only those stock dividends that were paid for out of principal should remain in principal; by implication, all other stock dividends received without payment therefor should be awarded to the income beneficiaries.</p>

In the first place, the words “all allotments” mean “all allotments” and not just those that are paid for. <em>Cf. Biddle Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/390/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="390 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1275704" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0460-01">390 Pa. 460</a>, 466, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.2d%20915" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="135 A.2d 915">135 A. 2d 915</a>, 918 (1957). Secondly, appellants collaterally argue that a construction of this language as a direction to allocate all stock dividends to principal results in a violation of the accumulations statute and thereby contravenes a decided preference for a construction resulting in a lawful disposition, <em>e.g., Renner Estate, </em><a href="/pa/358/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="358 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="8845630" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0409-01">358 Pa. 409</a>, 413, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.2d%20836" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="57 A.2d 836">57 A. 2d 836</a>, 838 (1948). This contention is not persuasive since <em>Maris, </em>which first held that the accumulation of stock dividends transgresses the accumulations statute, was not decided until thirteen years after settlor first used this language. Thirdly, it seems most strange that the settlor and scrivener of these elaborate trusts would only direct the allocation of a rare, hybrid stock dividend which must be paid for and ignore the garden-variety stock dividend which has generated the most litigation in the area of apportionment. Lastly, even if we were to accept the appellants’ argument that only “paid for” stock dividends should be awarded to principal, it does not follow that all other stock dividends are allocable to income; in the absence of an <em>empress </em>direction by the settlor, allocation is made in accordance with the apportionment rules then in effect. On balance, we agree with the court en banc that, “[t]he word ‘allotment’ is merely synonymous with ‘distribution’ or ‘allocation.’ ” We believe that settlor intended and directed that all stock dividends, ordinary or extraordinary, paid for or not paid for, “shall be treated and regarded as belonging to the principal of the trust estate and not as income.”</p>
