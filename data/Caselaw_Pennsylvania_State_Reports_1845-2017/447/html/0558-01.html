    <p id="b635-5" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[155,929,1153,1408]]]'>Carl Cody’s primary duty in his employment with 8.K.F. was chauffeuring its executives. He enjoyed general good health and a consistently good work record. On March 10, 1966, he checked out of work two hours early complaining of being “sick” and was given transportation part-way borne by a fellow employee and took a taxicab the remaining distance. Upon arriving home, Cody complained of a severe headache and informed his wife that at work, after driving a company automobile into the executive garage, he was struck on the head and knocked to the ground by an overhead garage door. He reported for work on March 11th and 32th, hut the headache did not abate and on the evening of March 12th Cody was confined to bed suffering from chills and general pain. On March 13th, the family physician was consulted to whom Cody described how on March 1.0th he had been hit on the head by the overhead garage door. On March 15th Cody’s condition worsened and the physician ordered him transferred to a hospital. At this time, Cody was found to be suffering from high temperatures, severe headaches, periods of delerium and tosis of the eyelids. Cody remained in the hospital until March 27th, but was re-admitted on March 31st, when he underwent surgery to alleviate an infection in the subdural region of the brain. He died on April 10th.</p>

      <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>To establish the causal connection between the alleged head injury and the ultimate death, the claimant produced a Dr. Theodore Kushner, a specialist in neurology and psychiatry. Dr. Kushner testified that in his opinion trauma to the head caused a blood clot, or a subdural hematoma of the tissue, and this became infected and the subdural collection of blood through the infection turned into a collection of pus, or a subdural empyema, and this was the cause of death. The doctor stated that an injury to the head was the only thing which could have caused the subdural empyema since there was no brain abscess or infection in the paranasal sinus or in the middle ear. He totally discounted the theory that the infection was blood borne since the blood supply to the subdural space is quite limited and there was no evidence of an infection in the lungs, kidneys, spleen or liver, thus the infection had to be a local condition and a head injury was the only possible cause.</p>
    <p id="b636-4" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[208,1374,1147,425]]]'>Claimant also called Dr. Morris Segal, a surgeon with a background in head injury treatment, who testified that in his opinion the deceased had sustained a subdural hematoma, that eventually the hematoma became infected, and turned into an empyema and this was the cause of death.

Appellants also called Dr. Zung Pah Woo, a pathologist who did a large part of the autopsy protocol. Dr. Woo was also unable to say with medical certainty what caused the empyema, but could not discount the fact that a trauma could have caused the condition.</p>

A res gestae declaration is a spontaneous utterance by an individual whose mind has suddenly been made subject to an overpowering emotion caused by some unexpected and shocking act or occurrence. <em>Allen v. </em>Mack, <a href="/pa/345/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="345 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1213387" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0407-01">345 Pa. 407</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20A.2d%20783" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="28 A.2d 783">28 A. 2d 783</a> (1942). The utterance is generated by, or springs out of the act, and the words are in a sense part of the act itself. <em>Haas v.

The words, which are in the nature of this emotional impulsive <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>outburst, must be in the same continuous transaction with the acts, thus they are in a sense integrated into the acts. <em>Weshalek v.

The basis for the admission of the utterance is its spontaneity, thus all utterances which do not display the mandated instinctive naturalness must be excluded for fear that the words will emanate in whole or in part from the declarant’s reflective faculties. The declaration must be spoken under conditions which insure that it is not the result of premeditation, consideration or design, and it cannot be in the form of a narration or attempted explanation of past events, thus the process of the intellect cannot have had an opportunity to be set in motion. <em>Commonwealth v. Cheeks, </em><a href="/pa/423/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="423 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1903156" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0067-01">423 Pa. 67</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%20291" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="223 A.2d 291">223 A. 2d 291</a> (1966); <em>Weshalek v.

The exciting event, closely followed by the spontaneous exclamation emanating from the event, <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>insures the truthfulness of the declaration, thus allowing for its admission into evidence.</p>
    <p id="b639-3" data-blocks='[["BL_639.4",639,[158,439,1150,1018]]]'>Under these principles we are compelled to conclude that the statements made by the decedent concerning the accident to his wife were not within the res gestae exception. We do not view these as spontaneous utterances springing out of the act. Initially, we note that the words were not in “the same continuous transaction” with the act of being struck over the head with the garage door. There was a distinct break in the continuity during which time the decedent had seen a number of other people, to whom he did not mention anything about the accident. Moreover, during this time the requisite spontaneity vanished as the decedent’s reflective faculties resumed functioning. Thus, the statements were the result of consideration, and must be viewed as a narration or explanation of the past event. Consequently, we conclude that the statements to the wife were hearsay and not competent evidence to support the finding that decedent suffered a compensable accident.</p>
    <p id="b639-4" data-blocks='[["BL_639.5",639,[161,1479,1150,812]],["BL_640.1",640,[193,332,1146,317]]]'>Next, we turn our attention to the testimony of the family physician, Dr. Cannon. The relevent facts pertaining to his testimony are: Dr. Cannon was called to administer treatment to the decedent at his home three days after the accident. Over objection of appellants’ counsel, the Doctor testified that decedent had explained to him that on Thursday preceding the examination the decedent was struck over the head with a garage door. Based on the law before stated, we likewise rule this testimony was not admissible as res gestae. The foundation of res geatae rests on spontaneity, the statement must spring out from the act, and as we view the statements to the Doctor, the requisite sponaneity is clearly lacking. The statements related to the Doctor were made three days after the accident. <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>Under the facts of the present case, the statement must be viewed as a narration or explanation of a past event. The statement cannot be viewed as part of the “same act” as the blow on the head, and hence cannot be considered as part of the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule.</p>

The professional standards for the regulation of hospitals require the gathering of this information from the patient and the person treated will be fully conscious that his treatment may well be affected by his report as to the cause, whether a fall, a crushing by a heavy object, or a collision. Other features of the incident, such as the place where it occurred or who was at fault, seem unrelated to treatment. Some courts have accepted the view that these statements as to external cause when relevant to treatment and made to a doctor employed for that purpose are evidence of the fact stated. This conclusion particularly in actions for death where there were no eyewitnesses other than the victim, seems the view most consonant with the demands of justice.” McCormick on Evidence, §266, p. 564 (1954).</p>

As to trustworthiness, for a patient to misrepresent to a treating physician the cause of his physical injury would be totally contrary to his most vital concern of saving his life and restoring his health. Moreover, statements as to cause, as long as they are germane to treatment are inseparable from the description of the injury and the pain it is causing the declarant. We believe that as long as there are no circumstances casting suspicion on the genuineness of the utterances, statements as to cause clearly meet the trustworthiness test.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Cf.

In tlie Instant case, there is no question that the statement meets this test. Here, the deceased was confined to bed with a severe headache and suffering from chills and generalized pain. For a man to lie about the cause of his ailment while in this condition is not reasonable.
