My interpretation of the line of Superior Court cases following <em>Dawkins, supra, </em>is that the legislature could not have intended to compensate a person whose remuneration is not subject to contribution by the employer. By the same token, I am of the opinion that it was not the legislative intent to deny benefits to those whose wages have been subjected to an employer’s tax under §301 of the Act, 43 P.S. 781. In the present case, appellant owned less than 50% of the stock of the employer company, and no other member of his family was a shareholder. While it is of <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>course true that there are many corporate situations, the present one possibly included, where a shareholder with less than a majority of the outstanding stock has either substantial or effective control, the legislature was not speaking in those terms. In my view the legislature has indicated that the concept of independent businessman is to be limited to a person who, either alone or in combination with his relatives, controls 50% or more of the stock. Had it wanted to exclude from benefits an employee “who, through his ownership of stock and his position in the corporation, exercises a substantial degree of control over the corporation and its operation”, it would have made nontaxable the wages of such a person. This it did not do.</p>
