Contending that trial errors influenced an inadequate and unfair award, the plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial limited to the question of damages. When the trial court denied this motion, and judgment was entered on the verdict, the plaintiff filed an appeal in the Superior Court. The judgment was subsequently affirmed, without opinion, with Judge Hoffman filing a dissenting <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>opinion in which Judge Spaulding and Judge Cekcone, joined.

Both vehicles were proceeding north on Roosevelt Boulevard in Philadelphia and admittedly the defendant’s automobile ran into the rear of the plaintiff’s automobile, after it had come to a stop because of a traffic light at the intersection where Red Lion Road crosses the Boulevard highway. The testimony, however, was in conflict as to exactly how long a period the plaintiff’s automobile was stopped before the collision occurred, and also as to whether or not it had switched from one traffic lane to another immediately before being hit.</p>

This witness also attributed the impairment of the muscles in the plaintiff’s legs to poor diet, advanced age and nervousness. A psychiatrist-neurologist called by the defendant, testified that from his examination of the plaintiff he could find no organic cause for the alleged impotence and expressed the belief that if such a condition existed, it was due to causes not connected with the accident, possibly plaintiff’s “advanced age”,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and/or an operation plaintiff had undergone on the epididymis about three weeks after the accident.</p>

A neurologist-psychiatrist also testified on plaintiff’s behalf and stated that the impotence was definitely caused by the accident. During his own testimony, the plaintiff said that in addition to the physicians who testified at trial, he was given medical attention by a Dr. Rouse and a Dr. Polakoff while he was confined in the Nazareth Hospital in Philadelphia as a patient of Dr. Abrahamson, and after leaving the hospital he “saw” a Dr. Kyle, a urologist, on three occasions; a Dr. Wolgin, an internist; a Dr. Joyce, an orthopedist; a Dr. Waldron; a Dr. Coyle and a Dr. Lin.

The defendant, therefore, was at least knowledgeable before trial of Dr. Rouse’s and Dr. Polakoff’s connection with the treatment of plaintiff’s injuries. Moreover, the defendant took the pretrial deposition of the plaintiff and was afforded the opportunity of ascertaining at that time the identity of all doctors who had treated the plaintiff during his convalescence. Finally, the plaintiff’s testimony as to the doctors who aided in the treatment of his injuries was given on the first of a five-day trial. Under the circumstances, this is <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>not a case where the uncalled witnesses were “peculiarly within the knowledge and reach” of the plaintiff.</p>

The record shows that immediately after the jury left the jury box and retired to begin its deliberations, counsel for the plaintiff and for the defendant both requested a specific exception to the points for charge submitted by each side, which were approved and read to the jury by the trial judge. The court granted the request. While the trial judge could properly have refused to allow any exceptions to the charge after the jury retired (Bee Rule 227(b) of Pa. R. Civ. P. and <em>Dinio v.
