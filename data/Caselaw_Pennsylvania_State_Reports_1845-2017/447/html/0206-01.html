Dews admitted that he had been drinking before the alleged attack, and further testified that although he personally knew defendant Williams <em>before </em>the incident in question, he was <em>unable </em>to identify Williams as one of the assailants when the police brought Williams before him in a one-on-one confrontation shortly after the attack.
