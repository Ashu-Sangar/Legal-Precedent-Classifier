In this appeal he raises questions concerning the selection of the jury, rulings of the court during trial, and the jury charge. We find no error in the jury selection or in the charge of the court.

He attempts to create an analogy between the Commonwealth’s right to ash prospective jurors whether under certain circumstances they could impose the death penalty and this defendant’s claimed right to ascertain whether a juror could apply the law of self-defense.

There has been no showing of a widespread public concern with a juror’s ability to impartially and fairly apply the law of self-defense similar to that involving the imposition of the death penalty.

Absent such a showing or any reasonable basis for the requested extension of the present permissible limits of voir dire we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow defense counsel to probe into this area.

After the Commonwealth objected to defense counsel’s initial inquiry into a prospective juror’s nationality and race the trial court warned counsel to refrain from asking such questions. Nevertheless, defense counsel persisted and during the very early stages of the jury selection two prospective jurors were so questioned. The trial court initially separated these two jurors from the rest of the prospective jurors pending trial selection of the jury, but then recalled them and, over defense counsel’s objection, dismissed those two veniremen.</p>

See the ABA Project on Minimum' Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Trial by Jury, §2.5 (Approved Draft, 1968) which provides that: “[i]f the judge after examination of any juror is of the opinion that grounds for challenge for cause are present, the judge should excuse that juror from the trial of the case.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In addition, here defense counsel fully participated in the selection of the ultimate jury, and there has been no demonstration or even suggestion that defendant was harmed by the trial court’s action. Moreover, “[t]he defendant is not entitled to the services of any particular juror but only as to twelve unprejudiced jurors.” <em>Commonwealth v. Moon, </em><a href="/pa/389/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="389 Pa. 304" data-case-ids="1274025" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0304-01">389 Pa. 304</a>, 308, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20A.2d%20224" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="132 A.2d 224">132 A. 2d 224</a>, 226 (1957). We conclude that on this record the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The exercise of challenges, of course, is within the province of counsel.

The Act of May 10, 1949, P. L. 1066, 17 P.S. §§1251 et seq., provides that the members of the jury panel are to be randomly selected from the lists <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>of the registered voters in the county.

Appellant concedes, as he must, that the Legislature has the power to set some minimum age requirement for jury service. We cannot conclude that the Legislature was acting without a rational basis in determining that the minimum age for voting was an appropriate minimum age for jury service. See <em>Hoyt v. Florida, </em><a href="/us/368/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="368 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="6167820" data-case-paths="/us/368/0057-01">368 U.S. 57</a>, <a href="/us/368/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="368 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="6167820" data-case-paths="/us/368/0057-01">82 S.

    <p id="b485-4" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[167,1385,1150,483]]]'>Appellant’s second argument is that limiting the selection of the jury panel list to registered voters in Philadelphia County systemically excludes non-registered persons and consequently serves to exclude a discernible “economic, religious and racial class.” At trial defendant requested an opportunity to present witnesses to show what he asserts to be the unconstitutionality of the present method of selecting juries in Philadelphia County. This request was denied by the trial court.</p>

That fact was not in dispute. The witnesses requested would not have aided defendant in his attempt to show the asserted systematic exclusion of a definable class. Appellant’s brief is similarly silent on any specific proof or convincing argument that the present method of jury selection serves as a de facto exclusion of any class.

In the first place, that act applies only to counties of the <em>second class. </em>Philadelphia County is a county of the <em>first class, </em>defined by the Act of July 10, 1919, P.

Over defense counsel’s further objection the prosecutor then proceeded to read from the notes of the pre-trial suppression hearing. There defendant specifically claimed police brutality, a contention which he had subsequently dropped at trial. Defendant now argues that becaxise the issue of the voluntariness of the statement was not in any way contested by defendant or defendant’s direct examination, this was an impei*missible form of impeachment.</p>

Defendant’s written confession was determined to be voluntary at the suppression hearing. At trial defendant did not contest its voluntariness. His testimony at trial in this respect was in complete harmony with the Commonwealth’s position.

These issues therefore at trial were clearly “collateral matters”.</p>

By not challenging the voluntariness of the confession at trial defendant took a position consistent with that of the Commonwealth. There was therefore no proper basis or need to seek to impeach defendant on a matter that was unchallenged at trial.

    <p id="b490-6" data-blocks='[["BL_490.6",490,[198,1581,1147,263]]]'>Appellant makes three specific attacks on portions of the jury charge and a general allegation that the charge was unfair and prejudicial to defendant. , His arguments are based to a large extent on partial quotes from the charge taken out of context.</p>
    <p id="b490-7" data-blocks='[["BL_490.7",490,[198,1856,1147,481]],["BL_491.1",491,[168,341,1148,254]]]'>Appellant first contends that the trial court erred in charging the jury that: “if you have a conscientious scruple about it [defendant’s guilt], you are entitled under our law to stand by your conscientious convic* tion concerning the evidence.” Appellant argues that such a charge is an improper and inadequate replacement for the constitutionally inquired reasonable doubt standard. What appellant ignores is that on numerous occasions the trial court instmcted the jury that de<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>fendant could not be convicted if there was a reasonable doubt as to his guilt and had properly defined reasonable doubt to the jury. We fail to see how appellant was harmed by this additional “conscientious scruple” comment.</p>
    <p id="b491-4" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[170,616,1147,486]]]'>The trial court also instructed the jury that if the evidence introduced on a matter was in equipoise “you give the benefit of that to the defendant because the defendant is presumed to be innocent.” No exception was taken to this portion of the charge. Furthermore, it is substantially similar to a charge requested by defense counsel. Indeed, the similarity was pointed out to defense counsel during trial and he replied: “Fine, Your Honor, I think that is fair enough.”</p>
    <p id="b491-5" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[170,1114,1151,651]]]'>In the charge to the jury the court instructed: “You understand, members of the jury, that all twelve of you must agree. Your verdict must be unanimous, all twelve of you must agree.” Appellant urges that such a charge was error. In <em>Commonwealth v. Peterman, </em><a href="/pa/430/0627-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="430 Pa. 627" data-case-ids="1915700" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0627-01">430 Pa. 627</a>, 637, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20723" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="244 A.2d 723">244 A. 2d 723</a>, 729 (1968), this Court explicitly upheld such a charge: “[I]t was not error for the trial court to instruct the jury that its verdict must ‘reflect the unanimous vote of all of you.’ . . . The effect of such instruction was simply to inform the jury that their verdict could not be rendered by a majority vote but only by a unanimity of opinion.”</p>
