        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPAPADAKOS, Justice.\nThis case involves the redistricting of Pennsylvania\u2019s seats in the United States House of Representatives. After the 1990 census was taken, the Clerk of the United States Congress informed the Pennsylvania Secretary of State that Pennsylvania was henceforth only entitled to have twenty-one (21) seats in the United States House of Representatives, a net loss of two (2) seats or districts. From early 1991 to the present, the Pennsylvania Legislature failed to enact a 21-district reapportionment plan. On January 28, 1992, the first day for circulating nomination petitions for election to Congress (under 25 P.S. \u00a7 2868), Appellants (eight Democratic State Senators) filed an equity action in the Commonwealth Court, invoking that Court\u2019s original jurisdiction against Appellees (certain State election officials). Noting that February 18, 1992, the last day to file nomination petitions, was fast approaching, Plaintiff-Appellants asked the Commonwealth Court to declare the existing congressional apportionment law (25 P.S. \u00a7 3571) unconstitutional; to enjoin the implementation of the official congressional election schedule until a valid plan could be adopted; and to adopt a valid reapportionment plan if the Legislature was unable to do so. Senior Judge Barry of the Commonwealth Court held a prompt hearing and, on January 30, 1992, he granted a preliminary injunction on the basis that the existing 23-seat apportionment plan was unconstitutional, enjoining the implementation of the then present schedule for electing members of Congress in Pennsylvania. Judge Barry\u2019s order required all parties and intervenors, if any, to submit their proposed reapportionment plans to the Commonwealth Court no later than February 11, 1992. His order also provided notice that the Court would select a plan if the Legislature failed to act by February 11, 1992.\nAs of February 12, 1992, the Legislature had failed to enact a reapportionment plan. Hence, by order of that date, the Commonwealth Court ordered final hearings to begin the next day, February 13, 1992, to receive evidence and to consider all proposed plans that had been timely filed on or before February 11, 1992. Plaintiff-Appellants presented three plans, styled Plaintiffs\u2019 Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Plaintiffs\u2019 No. 3 was later withdrawn. The Attorney General intervened and additional parties, a number of whom submitted plans of their own, were also granted intervenor status to represent the interests of specific counties or other geographical areas around the State or to protect the voting rights of African-Americans in various congressional districts. Additional details concerning these plans and other issues raised by some intervenors are addressed below.\nMeanwhile, Plaintiff-Appellants applied to this Court to take plenary jurisdiction of the matter. By order of February 13, 1992, this Court exercised such plenary jurisdiction. We designated President Judge David W. Craig of the Commonwealth Court as Master to conduct hearings and report to us not later than February 26,1992. The hearings before the Commonwealth Court began on February 13 and were concluded on February 15. Judge Craig\u2019s \u201cFindings, Recommended Decision and Form Order,\u201d along with a proposed election schedule revision were filed with this Court on February 24, 1992, and a copy thereof is attached to this Opinion as Appendix A. Subsequently, exceptions to Judge Craig\u2019s Findings and briefs were filed with this Court and oral arguments were held on Saturday, March 7, 1992, in Pittsburgh. We issued a Per Curiam Order on March 10, 1992, adopting Judge Craig\u2019s Findings, Recommended Decision and Form of Order, along with our \u201cRevised Election Calendar\u201d and dismissing all exceptions thereto. A copy of our Order is attached hereto as Appendix B. This Opinion explains our disposition of this matter.\nJudge Craig\u2019s Recommended Decision (Appendix A) compares and evaluates the six different plans timely submitted to him. The plans scrutinized were Plaintiffs\u2019 No. 1 and No. 2; two plans styled O\u2019Donnell A and O\u2019Donnell B (both submitted by Speaker of the House Robert W. O\u2019Donnell and seven other Democratic members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives); the \u201cMurtha-McDade\u201d Plan (a \u201cbi-partisan\u201d plan submitted by Congressmen John P. Murtha, Joseph M. McDade and nine other incumbent members of Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional delegation); and a plan styled \u201cLoeper 1\u201d (submitted by Senate Majority Leader F. Joseph Loeper and five other Republican State Senators). Plans filed after the February 11 deadline, including the \u201cRyan-Cornell\u201d plan submitted by two Republican members of the Pennsylvania House \u2014 Matthew J. Ryan and Roy W. Cornell, and an amended version of the Loeper plan (\u201cLoeper 2\u201d) were properly not considered by Judge Craig. As he pointed out, the various parties had many months to formulate their plans, and to have allowed consideration of plans, amendments or revisions submitted late would have created the potential of endless proceedings. Thus, Judge Craig was absolutely correct in adhering to the pre-announced deadline of February 11.\nJudge Craig correctly notes that federal law requires, primarily, that districts be equal in population to the greatest practical extent. Slight departures from mathematical perfection have been justified by the federal courts only to advance the cause of equality in the following respects: avoiding fragmentation of local government territories and the splitting of election precincts; effectuating adequate representation of a minority group; creating compact and contiguous districts; maintaining relationships of shared community interests; and not unduly departing from the useful familiarity of existing districts. Finding of Fact No. 16 in Judge Craig\u2019s Recommended Decision (see Appendix A) is a table with nine columns summarizing the six competing plans.\nAfter a detailed analysis of regional concerns, Judge Craig recommended approval of Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 because it: (1) has a low maximum population deviation; (2) is consistent with minimal splitting of precincts; (3) achieves an enlarged number of two congressional districts with a majority of African-American population; and (4) comes closest to implementing the community-of-interest factors in those regions across the State which have identified them. While the Murtha-McDade Plan achieved remarkable mathematical exactitude, it splits twenty-two (22) election precincts and twenty-seven (27) local governments. Next in mathematical exactitude, and both meeting constitutional standards, are O\u2019Donnell Plan B and Plaintiffs\u2019 No. 2, respectively. Unlike O\u2019Donnell Plan B, Plaintiffs\u2019 Plans No. 1 and 2 would achieve the goal of forming two black majority congressional districts, thought possible and, hence, constitutionally necessary in light of Pennsylvania\u2019s 9% African-American population, by increasing the African-American population in the First Congressional District to 52.4% while maintaining a strong majority African-American population of 62.242% in the Second Congressional District.\nNumerous exceptions to Judge Craig\u2019s report, and submissions from other interested persons objecting to aspects of the report, have been filed with this Court. They are set forth in full in Appendix C to this Opinion. We have consolidated them into the various legal issues raised and we will now address said issues.\nI. Population Deviations\nA number of exceptions filed contend that Judge Craig erred in recommending Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 because that plan has a higher maximum total deviation than two other plans. In Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 526, 11 L.Ed.2d 481 (1964), the United States Supreme Court held that congressional districts within a state must have equal numbers of people based on the \u201cone man, one vote\u201d principle. 376 U.S. at 7-8, 84 S.Ct. at 529-30. While Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526, 89 S.Ct. 1225, 22 L.Ed.2d 519 (1969), stands for mathematical absolutism in congressional reapportionment, the court has since conceded that \u201cprecise mathematical equality ... may be impossible to achieve in an imperfect world____\u201d Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725, 730, 103 S.Ct. 2653, 77 L.Ed.2d 133 (1983). Consequently, the Constitution requires only that \u201cdistricts be apportioned to achieve population equality \u2018as nearly as is practicable.\u2019 \u201d Karcher, supra, 462 U.S. at 730, 103 S.Ct. at 2658.\nTo determine whether the maximum total deviation of a plan satisfies the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d standard, the United States Supreme Court has established a two-part test. Karcher, supra, 462 U.S. at 730, 103 S.Ct. at 2658. First, the party challenging a redistricting plan must show that \u201cthe population differences among districts could have been reduced or eliminated altogether by a good-faith effort to draw districts of equal population.\u201d Karcher, supra, 462 U.S. at 730, 103 S.Ct. at 2658. As Judge Craig correctly stated, however, \u201ca plan is not per se unconstitutional just because a smaller population deviation could be achieved.\u201d Recommended Decision at 12; see also, Karcher, supra, 462 U.S. at 740, 103 S.Ct. at 2663 (\u201cBy itself, ... [appellees\u2019 showing that the Feldman Plan did not come as nearly as practicable to population equality] does not establish that the Feldman Plan is unconstitutional.\u201d) Rather, the existence of plans with smaller deviations simply obligates a court to apply the second part of the test, i.e., to ask whether the proponent of the plan can show that \u201ceach significant variance between districts was necessary to achieve some legitimate goal.\u201d Karcher, supra, 462 U.S. at 731, 103 S.Ct. at 2658; see, id., at 740, 103 S.Ct. at 2663 (showing that plan could have had smaller deviations \u201cmeans only that the burden shifted to the State to prove that the population deviations in its plan were necessary to achieve some legitimate state objective\u201d).\nAmong the \u201clegitimate state objective[s]\u201d identified by the Court in Karcher v. Daggett were \u201cmaking districts compact, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving the cores of prior districts, and avoiding contests between incumbent Representatives.\u201d Id. at 740, 103 S.Ct. at 2663. See, e.g., Turner v. State of Arkansas, 784 F.Supp. 553 (E.D.Ark.1991) (upholding congressional reapportionment plan which contained a 0.73% deviation, even though six other plans had smaller deviations, because variance achieved the legitimate state objective of attempting, to the extent possible, to keep counties and voters in the same district to which they had been assigned under the prior redistricting plan); Stone v. Hechler, 782 F.Supp. 1116 (N.D.W.Va.1992) (upholding congressional redistricting plan with deviation of 0.09% because it served goals of \u201cpreserving the cores of previous districts and maintaining district compactness;\u201d court reasoned that \u201c[t]he smaller the population deviation, the greater the importance of the State\u2019s interests, and the more consistently the plan as a whole reflects the State\u2019s interest, the smaller the State\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d); Wilson v. Eu, 1 Cal. 4th 707, 4 Cal.Rptr.2d 379, 823 P.2d 545 (1992) (\u201cthe need to form reasonably compact districts, to use census tracts rather than blocks in forming districts ... and to comply with the Voting Rights Act,\u201d justified a maximum range in the Congressional Plan of O. 25%).\nConsistent with this body of cases, Judge Craig properly held that the extremely small deviations in district populations may be justified by, inter alia, a desire to avoid splitting of political subdivisions and precincts, to provide adequate representation to a minority group, and/or to preserve communities of interest.\nJudge Craig also properly held that Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 inherently satisfies the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d requirement. That plan has a total maximum deviation of only 0.0111%. This deviation is smaller than those upheld in Turner, Stone and Wilson, and is fully justified by the policy of preserving the boundaries of municipalities and precincts. Plaintiffs\u2019 witness Mark McKillop, who supervised the drawing of the plan, testified that \u201c[W]e did not feel that splitting a lot of municipalities would serve a purpose,\u201d and that eliminating all the deviations in Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 \u201cwould [have] mean[t] additional municipal and voting district splits.\u201d Tr., Vol. I, p. 58. Thus, Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 splits only nineteen (19) counties, eight (8) localities, and three (3) precincts \u2014 a smaller number than either O\u2019Donnell Plan A, Loeper Plan 1, or the mathematically exact Murtha-McDade Plan. In short, Judge Craig sensibly held that Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 satisfied the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d requirement, and the Intervenors\u2019 arguments to the contrary must be rejected.\nII. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act\nAt the beginning of the hearings, Judge Craig stated one factor that he would consider was \u201cwhether the plans operate to dilute the voting impact of any minority.\u201d Tr., Vol. I, p. 11. After evaluating the various plans with this factor in mind, Judge Craig ruled that Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 best protected minority voting rights. We agree. Judge Craig must be affirmed based on the evidence adduced at the hearings that: (a) Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 did not effectively dilute minority voting strength in the Second Congressional District, and (b) all plans except Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 did dilute minority voting strength in the First Congressional District.\nThe primary tool for preventing minority voting dilution is Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973. As amended in 1982, Section 2(a) prohibits any state law or practice which \u201cresults in a denial or abridgement of the right ... to vote on account of race____\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1973(a). Section 2(b) provides that:\nA violation of subsection (a) of this section is established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of the class of citizens protected by subsection (a) of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. The extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the state or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered. Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973(b) (emphasis added).\nAll parties submitted plans that decreased the African-American percentage in the Second Congressional District (which is currently about 81% African-American in total population) and increased it in the First (which is currently 34% African-American). Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 made both districts over 50% African-American in total population, with the First Congressional District at 52.4% and the Second Congressional District at 62.242%. The evidence showed that both Districts would henceforth give African-Americans the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. Tr., Vol. I, pp. 71-72. There is no evidence that any other plan provided such an opportunity. The issue that divided the various parties was whether Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 lowered the African-American percentage too much in the Second Congressional District thereby depriving African-American voters of their opportunity to participate in the political process and elect candidates of their choice.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 creates a so-called \u201csuper-majority\u201d African-American district of 62.242% in the Second Congressional District. Recommended Decision, at 25. This district is an \u201ceffective\u201d minority district, i.e., one that will provide African-American voters an opportunity to continue to elect a representative of their choice. Tr., Vol. I, pp. 71-72.\nAlthough it has been argued that the Second Congressional District should have a total African-American population closer to 70%, Judge Craig properly found that \u201cThe record here contains no evidence that 65% to 62% would risk minority group effectiveness----\u201d Recommended Decision, at 25. Moreover, the cases in this Court and others confirm that Plaintiffs\u2019 62% African-American district will not dilute minority voting rights. This Court recently affirmed a legislative reapportionment plan which contained four State Senate Districts with a 60% African-American total population in each. In re: Pennsylvania Legislative Reapportionment Commission, 530 Pa. 335, 609 A.2d 132 (1992). A voting analysis in that case indicated that the participation rate of African-Americans exceeded that of whites in Democratic primary elections in Philadelphia and that there is considerable \u201ccrossover\u201d voting by whites for Democratic African-American candidates in Philadelphia. Based on these facts, the analysis concluded that a district with a total African-American population of approximately 60%, or a voting age population in the high 50\u2019s, would provide African-American voters a viable opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.\nOther courts have approved districts with African-American total populations well below 65%. For example, in Jordan v. Winter, 604 F.Supp. 807 (N.D.Miss.) aff'd, 469 U.S. 1002, 105 S.Ct. 416, 83 L.Ed.2d 343 (1984), the court ordered into effect a redistricting plan for Mississippi that established one congressional district with an African-American total population of 58.3%. The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that this percentage was too small to enable African-Americans to elect a representative of their choice and that a district with a voting age population of at least 60% African-American was necessary. Id. at 814. This district, in 1986, elected Mississippi\u2019s first African-American congressman since Reconstruction.\nSimilarly, in James v. City of Sarasota, 611 F.Supp. 25, 28 (M.D.Fla.1985), the court held that a district containing a 50.1% African-American total population and a 42.6 voting age African-American population was sufficient for purposes of Section 2, despite the existence of white bloc voting, because minority voter turnout had historically exceeded that of whites in the district. The Department of Justice, in a letter to the court, noted that:\n... figures on minority voting-age populations [are] far more useful to the analysis than total minority population percentages. But in neither case do we attach particular significance to a 65 percent population figure, and no attempt is made to add arbitrarily increments of five percentage points each to compensate for age, registration and turn-out differences.\nAccordingly, the Attorney General has frequently concluded, based on the facts presented in a particular submission, that districts containing a minority population significantly less than 65 percent of the total are racially fair districts and that the plan submitted is entitled to Section 5 preclearance.\n611 F.Supp. at 32 and 33.\nIn short, there is no legal requirement either in the courts of the Commonwealth or the federal courts, that a district have a 65% African-American total population to satisfy Section 2. The arguments to the contrary must, therefore, be rejected.\nIn Thornburgh v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986), the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201cDilution of racial minority group voting strength may be caused by the dispersal of blacks into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters or from the concentration of blacks into districts where they constitute an excessive majority.\u201d 478 U.S. at 46, n. 11, 106 S.Ct. at 2764, n. 11. Here, other plans concentrate African-American voters into the Second Congressional District thereby diluting the voting strength of African-American voters in the First Congressional District.\nThe justification advanced for this dilution has been that the Second Congressional District had to be over 65% in order to protect the incumbent. Such a justification, however, does not mandate making the Second Congressional District almost 70% African-American when the result is to dilute African-American voting strength in the neighboring First District, which is only 46.76% African-American under the Loeper Plan and even less under both O\u2019Donnell Plans and the Murtha-McDade Plan. Although incumbency protection is not in and of itself an inappropriate consideration, it may not be accomplished at the expense of minority voting potential. Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 771 (9th Cir.1990), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 681, 112 L.Ed.2d 673 (1991). There is no statistical evidence indicating that a 70% African-American district is necessary to provide the African-American community an equal opportunity to elect a representative of their choice. To the contrary, the evidence shows that a 62% African-American district would suffice. The effect of creating a concentrated Second Congressional District is to dilute impermissibly the voting strength of minorities in the adjacent First Congressional District. See, Williams v. City of Dallas, 734 F.Supp. 1317, 1415 (N.D.Tex.1990). We think that Judge Craig made a sound, lawful choice under these facts and circumstances, and we adopt it as our own.\nIII. Additional Criteria\nA. Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 is Politically Fair\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 results in a politically fair balance in the Pennsylvania delegation between Democrats and Republicans. Pennsylvania is losing two (2) seats, and Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 divides the loss evenly. Consequently, the estimated political party balance will be ten (10) Democratic and eleven (11) Republican districts. The other plans submitted to this Court appear to strike a similar political balance.\nB. Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 Splits a Minimum Number of Municipalities and Precincts\nAny municipality or precinct splits in Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 were necessary to comply with applicable state and federal legal requirements concerning the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d standard or minority voting rights. As discussed above, Plaintiffs' Plan No. 2 splits far fewer precincts and municipalities than either the mathematically exact Murtha-McDade or the Loeper Plan, and splits about the same number as the O\u2019Donnell Plans. We are sympathetic to those Intervenors, or parties who filed amicus briefs with this Court, complaining of county, municipality or precinct splits in their areas. We think, however, that some such splitting is inevitable and that Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 eliminates these defects to the maximum degree possible.\nIV. The February 11, 1992 Deadline\nWe repeat what we stated above. Judge Craig\u2019s rigid adherence to the February 11, 1992, deadline was absolutely correct. The parties complaining had ample notice of the deadline and should have been well aware of its importance as they would be of any statute of limitations or other judicial order imposing a time deadline. Not to adhere to the deadline imposed would create or would have created chaos and we will not countenance such a result.\nFor the reasons set forth above, we have adopted Judge Craig\u2019s \u201cFindings, Recommended Decision and Form of Order\u201d and dismissed all exceptions filed to it.\nAPPENDIX A TO OPINION OF THE COURT\nFINDINGS, RECOMMENDED DECISION AND FORM OF ORDER\nBy President Judge David W. Craig Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania\nFILED: February 24, 1992\nThis case involves some feats of modern computer technology, by which one plan has been able to reapportion Pennsylvania\u2019s 1990 population of 11,881,643 persons with ultimate mathematical precision among 21 proposed congressional districts so that the average deviation from the ideally equal district population of 565,793 is less than 1 person.\nWhere the task of selecting among at least six reapportionment plans has fallen to the judiciary because the General Assembly has not acted, does the constitutional principle requiring district population equality \u201cas nearly as is practicable____,\u201d Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 7-8, 84 S.Ct. 526, 530, 11 L.Ed.2d 481 (1964), mandate acceptance of only a mathematically absolute plan?\nOr is some departure from mathematical perfection warranted by concerns about whether the proposed congressional districts\n\u2014are compact and contiguous,\n\u2014facilitate community-of-interest concerns of minority groups and of areas having regional ties, and \u2014minimize fragmentation of municipalities and voting precincts,\nto provide reassurance that gerrymandering is not involved?\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\n(1) On December 31, 1990, after the 1990 decennial census count established Pennsylvania\u2019s population, at the point of counting, to be 11,881,643, the Clerk of the U.S. Congress issued a Certificate of Entitlement to the Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth entitling the Commonwealth henceforth to have only 21 districts, a loss of 2 seats below the 23 districts established by the General Assembly in 1981. 25 P.S. \u00a7 3571.\n(2) During 1991 and in 1992 until the present, efforts of Pennsylvania\u2019s legislators to enact a new 21-district reapportionment statute fell short of the votes needed for passage in both houses.\n(3) On January 28, 1992, the first day for circulating nomination petitions for election to the U.S. Congress, 25 P.S. \u00a7 2868, eight Democratic state senators filed this equity action in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court against Pennsylvania\u2019s state election officials. \u201c\nThe pleadings noted that the last day for filing nomination petitions, February 18, 1992, was fast approaching, and the plaintiffs requested this court \u2014to declare the existing congressional apportionment law, 25 P.S. \u00a7 3571, to be unconstitutional, as in violation of art. 1, \u00a7 2 of the U.S. Constitution,\n\u2014to enjoin the implementation of the official election schedule as to the congressional election until a valid plan is adopted, and\n\u2014to adopt a valid reapportionment plan if the legislature continues to be unable to do so.\nSenior Judge Barry of the Commonwealth Court held a prompt hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction with respect to the relief requested.\n(4) The pre-existing congressional districts now depart from the ideal population of 565,793 per district by as much as 19.89% below that figure (present 14th District with 112,514 fewer persons) and as much as 3.76% above the ideal figure (present 16th District with 21,255 persons above the ideal).\nOf course, the underpopulation of most existing districts is exacerbated by the fact that there are 23 of them, instead of just 21 districts, on which the ideal population is based.\nOn January 30, 1992, Judge Barry granted a preliminary injunction on the basis that the present apportionment is unconstitutional, enjoining the implementation of the present schedule for electing members of Congress in Pennsylvania.\nThe order retained jurisdiction and required all parties and intervenors, if any, to submit their proposed reapportionment plans to this court not later than February 11, 1992.\nFinally, Judge Barry\u2019s order advised that the court would select a plan for adoption and implementation if the General Assembly had not enacted a valid 21-district plan by February 11, 1992.\n(5) As of February 12, 1992, the legislature had not enacted any reapportionment plan for Pennsylvania.\nHence, by order of that date, the Commonwealth Court directed final hearings to begin on the following day, Thursday, February 13, 1992, to receive evidence and to consider all proposed plans which had been timely filed on or before February 11.\nIn the meantime, the plaintiffs presented 3 plans, called Plaintiffs 1, 2 and 3. The Attorney General intervened, and additional parties were granted intervention as follows.\n(6) Eight Democratic members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives intervened and timely filed 2 plans, called O\u2019Donnell A and O\u2019Donnell B.\n(7) Representative Harold James of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives also timely filed a plan, the Hughes Plan, which, although in the form of a statewide bill, seeks political effectuation of African-American interests in congressional districts in Philadelphia.\n(8) Two members of Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional delegation, Congressmen Joseph M. McDade and John P. Murtha, intervened and timely presented a plan, the Murtha-McDade Plan, prepared on behalf of 11 members of the present Pennsylvania congressional delegation.\n(9) Six Republican state senators intervened and timely filed a plan, called Loeper 1.\n(10) Four groups of intervenors, persons concerned with maintaining congressional district configurations, also intervened with reference to Bucks County, Cumberland County, Berks and Schuylkill Counties, and the Lehigh Valley, involving Lehigh and Northampton Counties. These parties proposed to support certain statewide plans and to oppose other plans.\n(11) On February 12, 1992, after the expiration of the February 11 deadline set by Judge Barry\u2019s order, two Republican members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Matthew J. Ryan and RoyW. Cornell, intervened, but the plan they filed had to be deemed not timely in accordance with this court\u2019s order.\n(12) Finally, after February 11, 1992, intervention also was obtained by Albert Swann, together with the Frederick Douglas Society and Philadelphia Leadership Conference, with a petition expressly supporting a proposal to establish an additional congressional district in which the African-American population would be a majority group, over and above the one district (the Second) now having a majority Black population.\n(13) Congressman Lucien Blackwell, who sought intervention after the record was closed, was allowed intervention limited to the filing of a brief.\nThe plaintiffs had applied to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to take plenary jurisdiction and had also filed a companion action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\nDuring the course of the three days of hearings in the Commonwealth Court, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, by order of February 13, adopted a sound course for expediting the matter \u2014 and obviating the delay which could be incurred by the course of an appeal-of-right taken from the Commonwealth Court to the Supreme Court \u2014 by taking plenary jurisdiction, designating President Judge David W. Craig of the Commonwealth Court as Master to conduct the hearings and report to the Supreme Court not later than Wednesday, February 26, 1992 with findings, a recommended decision and a form of order.\nJudge Sylvia Rambo of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania advised that the district court would await state court action providing that the Commonwealth Court had acted by Monday, February 24, 1992 (the date on which these findings, recommended decision and form of order are being filed).\nThe hearings by the Commonwealth Court, begun on Thursday, February 13, were concluded on Saturday, February 15, at which time the election administrators agreed to file a proposed election schedule revision with the Commonwealth Court by February 19, with briefs to be filed by regional parties on Thursday, February 20, and by statewide parties on Friday, February 21.\n(14) During the course of the three days of hearings, the plaintiffs withdrew Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan 3.\n(15) The Republican state senators sought to present an amended version of Loeper Plan 1, which amendment is referred to as Loeper Plan 2 in the record. Having deferred ruling on its admission for consideration as a statewide plan, the President Judge ruled at the close of the evidence that such amended plan, Loeper 2, was not entitled to consideration as a separate plan because it had not been timely filed by February 11, but held that testimony concerning it was admissible as evidence relevant to the evaluation of all other plans.\nThe President Judge did not reverse any ruling, but only deferred ruling to provide maximum consideration, even as to untimely filings.\nExclusion of Untimely Plan Filings\nEnforcement of the February 11 filing deadline with respect to statewide proposals has been necessary to assure that the courts would have a reasonable opportunity to consider the plans which were timely filed.\nAll parties have had many months to prepare a proper plan.\nIf the court had opened this time-constrained case to late plans and amendments filed after the February 11 deadline plainly stated in Judge Barry\u2019s order, the proceedings would have been endless because (1) new intervenors would have required many new plans to be reviewed, and (2) the earlier parties could have amended their timely plans repeatedly, to surpass the new plans.\nHence, the late amendment of the Loeper Plan was excluded, although Loeper counsel was allotted full participation and the amended data was received in Court Exh. AA.\nSimilarly, the Ryan-Cornell Plan proponents were accorded status as parties with full participation in cross-examination. Ryan Plan data was received in Court Exh. AA.\nExclusion of full consideration of the Ryan Plan was justified because that plan was in existence on and before February 11. There was no reason that the plan could not have been timely presented. It was knowingly withheld from being filed in the court on that date, on the ground that further legislative action then was possible.\nThe President Judge did not exclude plans on the basis of political party. The President Judge excluded all untimely proposals and considered all timely ones of all parties.\nTHE CONTROLLING CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES\nBelow, as Finding No. 16, a factual comparison of the plans will be presented. Before considering that finding and other facts constituting the minor premises of the logic involved, reference to the constitutional principles, as enunciated by the United States Supreme Court, is necessary.\nEquality of Congressional District Populations One Person, One Vote\nCongressional redistricting becomes a judicial responsibility only when, as here, the state legislature has not acted after having had an adequate opportunity to do so. White v. Weiser, 412 U.S. 783, 794-95, 93 S.Ct. 2348, 2354-55, 37 L.Ed.2d 335 (1973), Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 586, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1394, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964).\nIn applying art. I, \u00a7 2 of the U.S. Constitution, the United States Supreme Court has held, as noted above, that the goal is to make \u201cas nearly as is practicable one man\u2019s vote in a congressional election ... worth as much as another\u2019s.\u201d Wesberry.\nThis requirement is the \u201cpreeminent if not the sole, criterion\u201d for appraising the validity of redistricting plans. Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 23, 95 S.Ct. 751, 764, 42 L.Ed.2d 766 (1964).\nThe United States Supreme Court has declined to adopt any particular deviation figure as the maximum deviation per se allowable. Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526, 530-31, 89 S.Ct. 1225, 1228-29, 22 L.Ed.2d 519 (1969). Population variances among districts must be justified. Id.\nThat reluctance has fostered a wise constraint, as we can see by noting our advancing ability, in the last two decades, to perform mathematical manipulations by computer tools which can review in a short time great multitudes of variables which could not be examined by the machine-aided methods of the past within any feasible time period.\nHowever, a plan is not per se unconstitutional just because a smaller population deviation could be achieved. Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725, 103 S.Ct. 2653, 77 L.Ed.2d 133 (1983).\nConsider the various maximum total deviations \u2014 at times on this record called the \u201cmaximum range of deviations\u201d\u2014 which have been accepted or rejected during recent years. The Supreme Court has defined maximum total deviation as\nthe sum of the percentage by which ... [the] most populous district ... exceeds the ideal district population ... and the percentage by which ... the least populous ... [is] below this ideal.\nBoard of Estimate v. Morris, 489 U.S. 688, 700 n. 7, 109 S.Ct. 1433, 1441 n. 7, 103 L.Ed.2d 717 (1989).\nIn 1969, Kirkpatrick held that a 5.97% maximum deviation was bad. In 1973, White v. Weiser rejected a .284% maximum deviation (less than 3/10ths of 1 percent) in favor of a .149% maximum deviation.\nIn 1982, the most recent Pennsylvania Congressional District Reapportionment Case, 567 F.Supp. 1507 (M.D.Pa. 1982), aff'd without opinion, sub nom., Simon v. Davis, 463 U.S. 1219, 103 S.Ct. 3564, 77 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1983), an opinion by Circuit Judge Weis, for a three-judge court, accepted a maximum deviation of .2354%, and, after further census revision, a maximum deviation of .399%, noting that the difference between those two figures \u2014 one-fourth of one percent v. four-tenths of one percent \u2014 could be statistically insignificant, particularly when our constantly moving population necessarily means that a census count is simply the \u201csnapshot\u201d of a particular moment in time. 567 F.Supp. at 1515.\nThis present case has produced, in the Murtha-McDade Plan, the ultimate of equality with a maximum deviation of .0000017%, consisting of a difference of just one person out of 565,793. Departures from such mathematical perfection, according to the federal courts, are justified but only to advance the cause of equality realistically in the following respects:\n\u2014avoiding fragmentation of local government territories and splitting of election precincts, Shayer v. Kirkpatrick, 541 F.Supp. 922, 933 (1982), aff'd sub nom., Schatzle v. Kirkpatrick, 456 U.S. 966, 102 S.Ct. 2228, 72 L.Ed.2d 841 (1982);\n\u2014effectuating adequate representation of a minority community, Shayer, 541 F.Supp. at 930-31;\n\u2014creating districts which are compact and contiguous, Carstens v. Lamm, 543 F.Supp. 68, 82-88 (1982);\n\u2014maintaining relationships of shared community interests, Carstens, 543 F.Supp. at 82, 90-91; and\n\u2014not unduly departing from the useful familiarity of existing districts, Dunnell v. Austin, 344 F.Supp. 210 (1972).\nAll timely plans must be considered on the same footing, despite the Murtha-McDade Plans claim to be the only \u201cbipartisan\u201d one. It is, but, like all the plans, it is not disinterested, having been submitted on behalf of 11 incumbents.\nFACTUAL ANALYSIS\nDirect and close comparison of the six competing plans is facilitated by Finding No. 16, which follows.\nFirst, an explanation of the columns in Finding No. 16 is desirable.\nColumn 1 \u2014 Identification of Plan: In addition to the record name for each plan, this column identifies the specific legislative bills, if any, which have substantially embodied the plan in the General Assembly. None of the listed bills was passed by both houses.\nColumn 2 \u2014 Maximum Deviation: As defined above, this percentage figure is the sum of the percentage by which the most populous district exceeds the ideal equality number, plus the percentage by which the least populous district falls below that ideal number.\nColumn 3 \u2014 Average Deviation: The mean figure which reflects an average of the percentage deviations for all 21 districts in the respective plan.\nColumn 4 \u2014 Split Municipalities: Remembering that the term \u201cmunicipality\u201d includes counties, as well as cities, boroughs and townships in Pennsylvania, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1991, this column gives a count of the municipalities to which more than one of the proposed districts of the plan applies. This column treats Philadelphia as a county rather than a city.\nColumn 5 \u2014 Split Election Precincts: Although a voting unit in Pennsylvania is officially termed an \u201celection district,\u201d 25 P.S. \u00a7 2602(g), the table and the record here use, for the same concept, the term \u201cprecinct\u201d in order to avoid confusion with the congressional \u201cdistricts\u201d which are the principal subject matter of this proceeding.\nColumns 6, 7 \u2014 African-American Population of District 1: These columns relate to the potentiality of a second congressional district with an African-American majority population, which would be in addition to Congressional District 2, which all plans recognize as presently being a majority African-American district in Philadelphia. Column 6 gives the African-American population percentage of the respective proposed district, and Column 7 gives the percentage of voting age African-American population in the proposed district.\nColumn 8 \u2014 Regional Communities of Interest: This column indicates those plans which recognize the community-of-interest relationships established by the evidence (discussed below) as to (1) Lehigh Valley\u2019s long-standing joinder of Lehigh and Northampton Counties in one congressional district, (2) Berks and Schuylkill Counties\u2019 long-standing joinder in one congressional district, (3) keeping Bucks County in one congressional district, and (4) retention of Carlisle and adjacent municipalities such as North Middleton Township, in Cumberland County, within the 19th Congressional District.\nColumn 9 \u2014 Estimates of Party Balance of Seats: Based solely on party registration statistics, this column gives the number of congressional seats thus projected for each party with respect to each plan across the state.\nBecause the criterion of compactness and contiguity involves visual inspection of a graphic presentation of the shape of a congressional district, that factor cannot be reflected by means of the tabulation in Finding No. 16, but must be considered separately.\nThe information tabulated in Finding No. 16 is drawn from Court Exhibit AA, comprised of listings of plan elements supplied by each party proposing a statewide plan, to confirm the stipulations of data which counsel entered into the record. Record Vol. 1: pp. 14-16, 20, 31, 61, 62, 76.\nIn cases like the present, the judicial task has usually consisted of choosing one redistricting plan out of two or more, as the plan conforming most closely to constitutional standards, e.g., White v. Weiser, O\u2019Sullivan v. Brier, 540 F.Supp. 1200 (1982).\nUnequipped to formulate a plan from scratch, the courts are also hard put to develop an ideal plan from a combination of several plans because that would be a feat similar to assembling a single completed jigsaw puzzle from the disparate pieces of several of them.\nMoreover, if the courts adhere to a tradition of choosing one or the other of the plans proposed by the antagonists\u2014 like an arbitrator who confines approval to either the high demand of one side or the low offer of the other \u2014 then the challenge to develop mutually acceptable plans will be left in the legislature, where the job of political compromise belongs, rather than with the courts.\nTherefore, the general question in this case is: Which of the half-dozen plans timely offered to this court comes closest to the constitutional standards in all pertinent respects?\nDistricts Equal In Population To The Greatest Practicable Extent\nThe Murtha-McDade Plan (M-McD Exhs. 1-3) has achieved remarkable mathematical exactitude, with a maximum deviation of .0000017% and an average deviation of .0000009%.\nHowever, the Murtha-McDade Plan falls below others precisely because the cost of achieving maximum mathematical equality lies in having the congressional district boundaries split 22 election precincts as well as 27 local governments.\nAlthough 22 precincts constitute a small fraction of the 9,434 precincts in the state (Rl:164), a serious election administration problem arises from requiring the voters in a single precinct to look to two different sets of congressional candidates. Shayer.\nThe problem is not a minor one. It arises from the fact that exactitude requires manipulation of the smallest census unit, the census block; Pennsylvania has 300,000 of them (Rl:164) and their boundaries, based on visual limits useful to census taker functions, are not coterminous with the governmentally determined boundaries of the 9,435 election precincts.\nOf course, redrawing official precinct boundaries to match the ideal congressional district is theoretically possible, but is not practical because each election precinct must serve many other different exercises of the franchise \u2014 for the election of legislators and council members, for example.\nNearest to the Murtha-McDade Plan in exactitude is the O\u2019Donnell Plan B (O-B Exhs. 4-6), with a .0083% maximum deviation (Rl:16), a .0027% average deviation (Rl:20) and no split precincts.\nAlso close in equality of districts is Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan 2, with .0111% maximum deviation (Rl:14), a .0024% average deviation, and with three split precincts, one of which affects no population.\nThe Loeper Plan, splitting just one precinct, has only a slighter higher deviation, at .1334% maximum and .0324% average.\nThe Murtha-McDade Plan proponents have questioned the validity of data adjustments made by the Legislative Data Processing Center and therefore affecting all of the other plans at issue, as drawn by legislative caucuses.\nThe Executive Director of the Legislative Data Processing Center described how the Center dealt with the problem which arises when a census block is split between two precincts or among more than two precincts (Rl:162). This problem involves 2.6% (7,915) of the 300,000 census blocks in Pennsylvania; none of the census blocks are split across any municipal boundary.\nRather than arbitrarily assign a split census block entirely to one precinct or another, the Legislative Data Processing Center, since 1980, has divided the census block population between the two precincts in proportion to the ratio of voting registrations in the two precincts.\nThe Murtha-McDade proponents\u2019 question is based on the contention that such an adjustment can be an invalidating factor because it departs from the official U.S. census figures. However, no authority for that proposition has been presented, and it is obvious that an arbitrary assignment of all of the population of a split census block to just one of the precincts would provide a result necessarily less accurate, and therefore less valid than the adjustment described.\nFurther evaluation of these plans, all of which are acceptable in terms of population equality, must ultimately depend upon other criteria. Karcher.\nRacial Minority Empowerment Or Dilution\nBecause the African-American population constitutes 9% of Pennsylvania\u2019s people, the formation of two Black majority districts is possible. When possible, an increase in the number of minority-in-the-majority districts is constitutionally required. Thornburgh v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986); Jeffers v. Clinton, 730 F.Supp. 196 (1989); Hastert v. State Board of Elections, 777 F.Supp. 634, 651 (1991).\nPhiladelphia, one of the three Pennsylvania counties large enough to embrace more than one congressional district, has a 39.85% African-American population (Rl:38). Therefore, the various planners have looked to Philadelphia and to the City of Chester, the city in adjacent Delaware County which is the only Pennsylvania city with an African-American majority of citizens.\nTo date, the only African-American majority congressional district has been the Second District, currently at about 81% African-American population (R2A:54).\nThe key question is whether another Black majority congressional district can be mapped out of the adjoining First District, by including in it Chester City and, necessarily, some small part of the present super-majority Second District.\nNot surprisingly, the serious positions of the parties with special African-American concerns differ on this issue.\nSupporters of the Hughes Plan for Philadelphia, represented by intervenor Harold James, would avoid reducing the Second District below 68% African-American population by raising the First District African-American population only to 47.18%, not a majority. Although that First District would also then have an ethnic Hispanic population of 10.71%, which is an acceptable consideration, Campos v. City of Baytown, Texas, 840 F.2d 1240 (5th Cir.1988), the result does not fully address the racial group goal by counting in a group which is an ethnic one in census terms. Moreover, aggregating two minority groups is allowable only if they are shown to be politically cohesive, League of United Latin American Citizens v. Midland, 648 F.Supp. 596 (1986), and there is no such proof on this record as to Hispanic and Black minorities.\nThere has been a contention that, to be a safe super-majority district, the Second District should not go below 69% or 68% African-American population. Congressman Blackwell, the incumbent of the Second District, permitted to intervene late in this case to submit a brief, contends that reduction below the present 81% African-American population would be a \u201cdilution\u201d of the minority representation effectiveness, but that term has normally been applied when the result is to fence minority groups into minority voting positions. Carstens.\nMinority voting should be maximized as much as possible. Jeffers v. Clinton.\nThe Loeper Plan keeps the Second District at 68.055% African-American population but at the cost of achieving only 46.7% African-American population in the First District. The excluded Loeper Plan amendment, with 65.857% African-American population in the Second District still would have had the First District just below a majority of African-American population, with 49.048%.\nThe Ryan Plan data in Court Exh. AA shows that, even if it had been timely filed so as to receive full consideration, it would not be acceptable because it did not create another Black majority district, in that its proposed First District would have been 47.5% African-American population.\nIntervenors Philadelphia Leadership Conference, Frederick Douglas Society and Albert Swann urge the court to uphold the creation of a second African-American minority-in-majority district, namely the First District, while maintaining a substantial majority population of the minority group in the Second District.\nThe Plaintiffs\u2019 plans, both 1 and 2, would achieve that goal by getting the First District past the 50% barrier to 52.4% African-American population (Rl:62), which would still leave the Second District at a healthy 62.242% African-American majority (Rl:61), still entitled to be labeled as a strong majority, if not a \u201csuper\u201d one.\nThe record here contains no evidence that 65% or 62% would risk minority group effectiveness (R3:21, 22). Indeed, a 60% minority group threshold has been held to be acceptable in this respect. Martin v. Mabus, 700 F.Supp. 327 (S.D.Miss.1988).\nThe O\u2019Donnell Plan A, on the other hand, proposes only 39.2% in the First District and the O\u2019Donnell Plan B only 36.6% in the First District. The Murtha-McDade Plan also does not achieve a Black majority in the First District, with a 41.7% African-American population figure.\nThe hearings in this case have investigated this matter from all aspects, even pointing out that many African-American voters which would be added to the First District from Chester City may be registered Republican, not Democratic. Of course, that is not a startling revelation. No court can accept any false stereotypical belief that Black voters have a monolithic position. Indeed, the variety of views in this case disprove any such idea.\nOn the basis of deviations from equality minimized as much as possible, with a lessened administrative problem as a result of minimal precinct splitting, and embodiment of a potential for two African-American majority districts, our scrutiny now must focus on Plaintiff Plan 2 as the leading prospect for approval. Examination of that plan in relation to the salient regional concerns, as voiced in this record, must come next.\nRegional Concerns\nVarious intervenors have raised community-of-interest issues with respect to five regions of the state. Evidence of a community of interest among neighboring areas in those regions has been clear and undisputed.\nCheltenham Township, Montgomery County\nBy brief amicus curiae, Cheltenham Township in Montgomery County has reflected a desire to keep the entire township in the Thirteenth Congressional District.\n(17) That is proposed by Plaintiffs\u2019 Plans 1 and 2, by the Loeper Plan and by the O\u2019Donnell Plans A and B. However, the Murtha-McDade Plan describes only 73 persons out of Cheltenham\u2019s population of 34,923 as being in the Thirteenth Congressional District, thus placing the bulk of Cheltenham elsewhere.\nLehigh Valley, Lehigh and Northampton Counties\n(18) Undisputed testimony by Intervenors Freeman, Ritter and McHale establish that Lehigh and Northampton Counties, with aggregate population close to the ideal district population, have been together within the Fifteenth Congressional District since 1972.\n(19) The valley itself, its circulation arteries, its common news media, and its organizational and cultural ties have a unifying influence on this Lehigh Valley Area. (R3:154190).\n(20) None of the statewide plans precisely include all of the area preferred by the Lehigh Valley advocates, who would also include a portion of Berks County. The two counties of Lehigh and Northampton are joined by Plaintiffs\u2019 Plans 1 and 2, and by the Loeper Plan. The O\u2019Donnell Plans A and B and the Murtha-McDade Plan do not embrace all of the two counties in a proposed congressional district.\nBerks and Schuylkill Counties\n(21) The evidence presented by Intervenor Brightbill establishes that the Berks and Schuylkill Counties share a community of interest in a common economic base, in circulation arteries, and in schools of higher education as well as other matters. (R3:190-198)\n(22) The relationship of these two entire counties is maintained in Plaintiffs\u2019 Plans 1 and 2 but not in the O\u2019Donnell A or B Plans, the Loeper Plan or in the Murtha-McDade Plan.\nCumberland County\n(23) Evidence on behalf of Intervenor Jarvis supports the affinity of Carlisle and North Middleton Township, in Cumberland County, with other communities in the Nineteenth Congressional District, rather than in the Ninth.\n(24) Plaintiffs\u2019 Plans 1 and 2, O\u2019Donnell Plan A and the Murtha-McDade Plan maintain that relationship. The O\u2019Donnell Plan B and the Loeper Plan do not do so.\nSummary\n(25) The Plaintiffs\u2019 Plans 1 and 2 are the only plans which substantially satisfy all of the regional concerns.\nAllegheny County\nHowever, the Plaintiffs\u2019 Plans 1 and 2 encounter a challenge in their proposed disposition of Congressional Districts Fourteen and Eighteen in Allegheny County and in areas surrounding it, a portion of the state where the most substantial population decline has occurred over the previous decade.\nBecause of -the anticipated retirement of Congressman Gaydos in the Twentieth Congressional District, the repositioning of a portion of that district has loomed large in reducing the number of Pennsylvania districts from 23 to 21. Accusations of partisanship have been directed by various parties at each other.\nThe issue requires graphic illustration. On the following two pages are shown proposals for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. The first map following is that proposed by Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan 2. The second map following is the same area as it appears in Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan 3, the plan which the plaintiffs withdrew during the hearings.\n(26) The City of Pittsburgh has been, and is proposed by all to remain entirely within the Fourteenth Congressional District.\n(27) The City of Pittsburgh is surrounded by suburbs on all sides, with suburbs in the North Hills, in Sewickley Valley (in the northwest), and in Chartiers Valley, all having some community of interest. (R2B:108-110)\n(28) The city has more in common with the close-in easterly suburbs and in the Monongahela Valley\u2019s former steel-making areas than with the suburbs in the north, west and south.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Plan 3 (the second map) appears to recognize those community-of-interest factors by extending the Fourteenth District into the westerly side of the Monongahela Valley and encircling the Fourteenth District with the Eighteenth to embrace the northerly, westerly and southerly suburbs.\nThe result, however, is to create an Eighteenth Congressional District which in shape is almost a hollow circle with an open arc at the bottom. The present Eighteenth Congressional District also embraces the city on the north, west and south but, not quite in a configuration approximating a circle.\nThe configuration in Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan 2, on the first map, is visually more compact, with the Fourteenth District covering the city and part of the suburbs north and northwest of the city, while the Eighteenth District is proposed to embrace the northeasterly suburbs, the easternmost suburbs and municipalities on both sides of the Monongahela River, plus an arm extending westward to some of the suburbs due south of the city.\nNeither of these proposals are models of compactness or contiguity, but in that respect, the Plaintiffs\u2019 Plans are not alone. The Loeper Plan proposes a result similar to Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan 3, and the Murtha-McDade Plan would treat the Fourteenth District in some respects similar to Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan 3 by extending that district into the northerly suburbs.\nAgain, when the courts are thrust into this role, with no feasible option except to take one entire plan or the other, applying the more objective criteria of compactness and contiguity indicates acceptance of Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan 2 on that basis, as a less satisfying aspect of a plan otherwise meritorious.\nCONCLUSION\nThe resulting recommendation, considering all of the elements reviewed above, is to advise in favor of approval of Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan 2 as (1) having a low maximum deviation, (2) consistent with minimal splitting of precincts, (3) achieving an enlarged number of two congressional districts with a majority African-American population and (4) coming closest to implementing the community-of-interest factors in those regions across the state which have identified them.\nREVISED ELECTION CALENDAR RECOMMENDATIONS\nReference is made to Memorandum of Respondents, filed on behalf of the Secretary of the Commonwealth and the Election Commissioner, to recommend suggested revisions in the election calendar resulting from this litigation (and also from the separate case involving appeals to the Supreme Court from the Reapportionment Commission).\nNoted and recommended for adoption by the Supreme Court is the Secretary\u2019s recommendation that the calendar for electing delegates and alternate delegates to the national conventions be revised along with the congressional election calendar because of their related nature.\nAll of the proposals of the Secretary are hereby recommended for consideration by the Supreme Court, with the exception of the proposed dates for the Commonwealth Court\u2019s latest hearing and deadline for filing that court\u2019s decisions on objections to nominating petitions.\nThe Election Code limitation for judicial review of such objections, 25 P.S. \u00a7 2937, has been held to be directory, not mandatory. In re Moore, 447 Pa. 526, 291 A.2d 531 (1972).\nThe development of objections to nominating petitions, usually involving scrutiny of numerous signatures, is time consuming. Nevertheless, Commonwealth Court, following a Friday, March 13 deadline for filing nominating petitions, would propose to convene hearings on objections promptly on Monday, March 16, before the proposed March 19 deadline for filing such objections.\nWith Thursday, March 19, as the last day for filing objections, as the Secretary recommends, Commonwealth Court should also have the week of March 23-27 to conclude all hearings. And the latest day for the filing of the court\u2019s decisions, pursuant to those hearings, could be the following Monday, March 30.\nHence, the period from April 1 through April 28 would remain for the important administrative aspects of the election process to proceed.\nOf course, if nominating petition objection cases could possibly be concluded sooner than the recommended dates, the Commonwealth Court, being experienced in such litigation, would certainly strive to do so.\nAccordingly, a recommended revised election calendar for Congress and delegates to national conventions is appended hereto as Appendix B.\nThe Secretary has also recommended a revised schedule for elections for Senator and Representative in the General Assembly, appended hereto as Appendix C.\nAlthough that election schedule is not involved in this case, coordination of the congressional election schedule with it would be desirable.\nFor Commonwealth Court review of objections to nominating petitions for state legislative offices, there is recommended the same period, with hearings to be concluded not later than March 27 and decisions to be filed not later than Monday, March 30. The last such decision probably could be filed substantially sooner because of the earlier March 6 deadline which the Supreme Court has set for filing nominating petitions for legislative office.\nFORM OF ORDER\nA proposed form of order follows.\nRespectfully submitted,\n/&/ David W. Craig\nDAVID W. CRAIG,\nPresident Judge\nRECOMMENDED FORM OF ORDER\nNOW, , 1992, pursuant to hearing held upon complaint, it is hereby ORDERED as follows:\n1.

Exceptions of F. JOSEPH LOEPER, et al.\n1) Erred in enforcing an arbitrary deadline for submission of redistricting plan.\n2) Finding of Fact 15 is erroneous insofar as it characterizes the proceeding involving the amended version of the Loeper Plan.\n3) Erred in excluding the amended Loeper Plan for consideration.\n4) Finding of Fact 16 is erroneous in that the record contains no evidence to support the findings as to party registration balance for all the listed statewide plans, except the Loeper Plan. Finding of Fact 16 is also erroneous in stating the maximum and average deviation of the Murtha-McDade Plan as well as in stating the number of precincts split by that plan as being 22 rather than 30.\n5) Fails to make adequate findings regarding the protection of minority voting rights from dilution.\n6) Erred in failing to make findings regarding the dilution in minority population that would be effected in Allegheny County by all statewide plans accepted for consideration.\n7) Erred in the legal standard applied to the selection process. Standard used was one arguably appropriate for legislatively enacted reapportionment plans. Master should have selected a plan that approached equality of population as nearly as practicable while also protecting voting rights.\n8) The recommended plan by the Master has an unacceptably high deviation from equal population.\n9) Erred in relying on maximum and average deviation for the selected plan.\n10) Erred in recommending a plan for Allegheny County that produces a result contrary to the Findings of Fact at Nos. 27 and 28.\n11) Erred in recommending the elimination of the present 5th District and in effectively eliminating the present 18th District since every other district west of the Alleghenies suffered a greater population decline.\n12) Erred in not recommending the adoption of the amended Loeper Plan.\nIntervenors request the adoption of the amended Loeper Plan or the Court to design its own plan or remand to the Master for further proceedings.\nB. Exceptions of MATTHEW J. RYAN, et al.\n1) Erred in using artificial deadlines to exclude plans and amendments filed after the February 11, 1992 date.\n2) Erred in excluding consideration of the Ryan-Cornell Plan first offered publicly in the House on February 11, 1992.\n3) Erred in choosing a plan having an unacceptable maximum range of deviation, which dilutes minority voting strength in District 2 in Philadelphia and District 14 in Allegheny County, fragments municipalities and is not compact nor contiguous.\n4) Erred in permitting an incomplete record be made on the dilution of minority voting strength.\nJoins with Loeper Exceptions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.\n5) Argues that their plan is superior to the Loeper Plan.\nC. Exceptions of ROBERT W. O\u2019DONNELL\n1) Erred by ignoring constitutional requirement of using the lowest population deviation practicable in favor of a standard of \u201cacceptability in terms of population equality.\u201d\n2) Erred by treating all the submitted plans as having the same population deviation. Argues that the Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 deviation could have been further reduced by selecting the O\u2019Donnell Plan B.\n3) Erred in interpreting and applying the federal Voting Rights Act in concluding that it is required to create minority-in-the-majority districts. Argues that the record reflects the conclusion that two black majority districts can be created.\n4) Recommended plan dilutes minority voting strength in the Second Congressional District in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n5) Erred by equating subjective expressions of \u201cregional interest\u201d with constitutional requirements of population equality.\n6) Erred in determining that the Murtha-McDade Plan is the only bi-partisan plan.\n7) Erred in finding for a second African-American majority district in Philadelphia based on population proportions.\n8) Erred by not correcting reported deviation adjustments.\nD. Exceptions of EDWARD J. WILKES, JR., et al.\n1) Division of Township of Upper Merion into two congressional districts violates Article 1, Section 2 and the First and Fourteenth Amendments, Article I, Sections 5 and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution since the plan fragments the Township of Upper Merion; disenfranchises voters and interferes with voters\u2019 right to free and equal elections.\n2) Upper Merion division violates the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, Article I, Section 5 of the Pennsylvania Constitution because it forces the Township to spend additional time and money to establish liaison for two separate representatives for 109 residents in a district separate from the remainder of the Township.\n3) Upper Merion division violates the Fourteenth Amendment because it is not supported by a rational basis or related to any necessary governmental interest.\n4) Impairs voters\u2019 rights in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments because the division results in unnecessary expense in conducting elections, financing and staffing campaigns and might lead to confusion in voting.\n5) Erred by not considering the hardship the recommended plan would have on the Township.\nE. Exceptions of Amicus Curiae, THOMAS A. FOGLIETTA, et al.\nArgues for remand for a new plan which was also submitted.\nF. Submission of Intervenors, JOHN P. MURTHA and JOSEPH W. McDADE\nThey argue:\n1) The bi-partisan statewide congressional plan is constitutionally preferable to party caucus plans prepared for partisan political advantage.\n2) Only the bi-partisan plan accomplishes the constitutionally-mandated minimum deviation of less than one person per district.\n3) There is no evidence in the record to implicate the provisions of the Voting Rights Act as respects the present configuration of the Second Congressional District in Philadelphia.\n4) The bi-partisan plan complies with the policies of the Voting Rights Act.\nG. Amicus Curiae, WILLIAM H. LAMB\nArgues against the splitting of Chester County in Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2.\nH. Amicus Curiae, JERRY B. FULMER\nArgues against the splitting of communities in Allegheny County in Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2.\n. Judge Craig relied on earlier cases, to wit, Shayer v. Kirkpatrick, 541 F.Supp. 922 (1982), aff\u2019d. sub nom., Schatzle v. Kirkpatrick, 456 U.S. 966, 102 S.Ct. 2228, 72 L.Ed.2d 841 (1982); Carstens v. Lamm, 543 F.Supp. 68 (1982); Dunnell v. Austin, 344 F.Supp. 210 (1972).\n. The only plan that split fewer precincts and political subdivisions than Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 was O\u2019Donnell Plan B, which also had a slightly lower deviation. As shown below, however, this plan failed to give adequate recognition to minority voting strength in Philadelphia, since it created only one district with an African-American majority, whereas Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 created two such districts.\n. The Loeper Intervenors also argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 Plan No. 2 reduces the African-American population in Congressional District 14 (Pittsburgh) from 23% to 17.81% and that Judge Craig improperly failed to make findings that these reductions would be harmless to minority voters in Allegheny County. This argument must be rejected. Neither the Loeper Intervenors nor anyone else has offered any evidence regarding the degree of influence presently enjoyed by minority voters in Allegheny County, much less any evidence that such influence would be impaired by the small reduction in the African-American percentage in a district that already has a relatively small African-American population.\n.
