        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nCAPPY, Justice.\nThis case presents the question of whether judges removed from office for disciplinary reasons, pursuant to Article V, Section 18 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, automatically forfeit their pension benefits by virtue of Article V, Section 16(b).\nFor the reasons set out as follows, we conclude that neither the history nor the language of the Constitution support a conclusion that Article V, Section 16(b) is meant to create a broad pension forfeiture provision.\nProcedural History\nInvolved in this appeal are four individual Petitioners whose cases have been consolidated at two docket numbers. As each Petitioner raises the identical issue we shall resolve the matter in one opinion, referring to separate facts when necessary.\nThe Petitioners are all former judges of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, who have been removed from judicial office by this Court. Such disciplinary action occurred after the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board (JIRB) of Pennsylvania, which is established pursuant to Article Y, Section 18 of the state Constitution, recommended removal upon finding that each Petitioner judge had accepted small cash Christmas gifts (generally amounting to several hundred dollars) from a Roofers\u2019 Union in Philadelphia. Some of the Petitioner judges also failed to report such gifts on their mandatory Statements of Financial Interest, and furthermore made misrepresentations to federal agents when questioned about the receipt of these gifts.\nFollowing removal from office, each of the Petitioner judges sought to collect his monthly pension benefits from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania State Employees\u2019 Retirement System (SERS). Each application was denied by the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board (SERB), under the purported authority of Article V, Section 16(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The latter provision of the state Constitution states simply: \u201cNo compensation shall be paid to any justice, judge or justice of the peace who is suspended or removed from office under section eighteen of this article or under article six.\u201d However, Petitioners were permitted to withdraw that portion of the pension benefits which they had contributed themselves, along with statutory interest.\nThe particular facts relevant to each of these four cases may be briefly summarized as follows. Petitioner Joseph R. Glancey became a judge on the Philadelphia Municipal Court effective January 6,1969. He remained in that office until he resigned on March 31, 1988, under the cloud of the Roofers\u2019 Union scandal. JIRB, in due course, recommended the removal of Petitioner Glancey based upon his misconduct. Prior to the matter being argued and reviewed by this Court, however, he resigned. This Court reviewed the record of JIRB and entered an order which \u201cforever barred (Glancey) from holding judicial office in this Commonwealth.\u201d See, In the Matter of Glancey, 515 Pa. 201, 527 A.2d 997 (1987) (Glancey I) and In the Matter of Glancey, 518 Pa. 276, 542 A.2d 1350 (1988) (Glancey II).\nWhen Petitioner Glancey filed an application seeking to withdraw his own pension contributions and seeking to receive a reduced retirement allowance for the rest of his life, SERB denied his request. The Board determined that Petitioner Glancey was entitled to no more than the return of his own contributions, plus statutory interest. The Commonwealth Court affirmed. See, Glancey v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 126 Pa.Commw. 457, 560 A.2d 263 (1989).\nThe second Petitioner, William Porter, was appointed to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County on December 30, 1971. He was elected to a full ten-year term commencing January 7, 1974, and was reelected to a second term commencing January 2, 1984. Judge Porter received $300 from the Roofers\u2019 Union under unacceptable circumstances during the year 1985, but did not engage in any cover-up after that investigation was made public. By Order dated February 25, 1988, this Court directed that Petitioner Porter be suspended from judicial office, forfeit his office, and furthermore declared Petitioner\u2019s office to be vacant. See, Matter of Cunningham, 517 Pa. 417, 538 A.2d 473, appeal dismissed sub nom. White v. Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, 488 U.S. 805, 109 S.Ct. 36, 102 L.Ed.2d 16 (1988).\nOn July 22, 1988, SERB denied Petitioner Porter\u2019s request for his vested retirement benefits. A divided panel of the Commonwealth Court affirmed, holding that since Porter had \u201cforfeited\u201d his office, this was akin to \u201cremoval\u201d under Section 16(b) and, therefore, he was not entitled to retirement benefits. See, Porter v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 129 Pa.Commw. 290, 565 A.2d 512 (1989). The Commonwealth Court noted that if Petitioner Porter was elected or appointed to judicial office in the future \u2014 a possibility which was not precluded by his suspension \u2014 he would be entitled to become a member of SERS again. However, his pension benefits would only run from that date forward. Id., 129 Pa.Commonwealth at 295, 565 A.2d at 515, n. 4.\nPetitioner Julian F. King was appointed to the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, in December of 1971, at which time he became a member of SERS. He was elected to a ten-year term commencing November of 1973, and was re-elected to another ten-year term in November of 1983. On July 20, 1988, this Court entered an Order directing that Judge King be removed from office; that his salary cease from that date forward; and that he thereafter be ineligible to hold judicial office. See, Cunningham. The evidence indicated that Judge King had received $200 in cash in 1983, $200 in cash in 1984, and $300 in cash in 1985. It also indicated that Judge King had failed to report such gifts on his financial disclosure forms in 1984, the first year such forms were mandatory.\nOn May 17,1988, Petitioner King filed an application with SERS seeking to withdraw a lump sum amount equal to his own contributions plus statutory interest, along with a reduced retirement allowance for life. SERB denied this request, with the exception of permitting King to withdraw his own contributions, plus interest. The Commonwealth Court affirmed. See, King v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 129 Pa. Commw. 444, 566 A.2d 323 (1989).\nFinally, Petitioner Thomas N. Shiomos served as a judge on the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County from January 3, 1973 until his retirement on March 1, 1984. At the time of his retirement he began receiving a monthly pension benefit of $1,883.61 from SERS. Thereafter, this Court granted Petitioner Shiomos status as a Senior Judge, pursuant to the power set forth in Article Y, Section 16(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In this capacity, Judge Shiomos served on an as-needed basis, with his last assignment on the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas during the month of November, 1986. On November 18, 1986, Chief Justice Nix revoked the order assigning Petitioner a seat on the Court of Common Pleas, thus ending his service.\nOn November 28, 1986, JIRB commenced disciplinary proceedings against Petitioner Shiomos, and on August 5, 1987 recommended that he be removed from office. The Board found that Shiomos had accepted cash gifts on at least six occasions from the Roofers\u2019 Union, and had lied to FBI agents in an attempt to cover up his misconduct. On November 4, 1987 this Court entered the following Order:\nAND NOW, this 4th day of November, 1987 the recommendation of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board in the instant proceeding is accepted, and it is ORDERED that respondent, Thomas N. Shiomos, be forever barred from judicial duties or office.\nOn July 20,1988, the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board (SERB) entered an order suspending payment of retirement benefits to Shiomos, citing Article V, Section 16(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Commonwealth Court sitting en banc approved the termination of Petitioner Shiomos\u2019 retirement benefits. See, Shiomos v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 128 Pa.Commw. 39, 562 A.2d 969 (1989).\nIn each instance, appellants herein filed a petition for allowance of appeal to this court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 724(a), and those petitions were granted.\nDiscussion\nThis case brings into collision two competing concerns of the highest order in our society. First, that public officials \u2014 including judges \u2014 who betray the public trust, must expect to endure the most weighty sanctions for their conduct. Second, in conflict with the first, is the concern that no individual \u2014 even an errant public official \u2014 should be stripped of his or her contractual right to receive deferred compensation, see McKenna v. State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 495 Pa. 324, 433 A.2d 871 (1981) (Nix and Flaherty, JJ., concurring) (pension benefits are based upon contract theory of deferred compensation), without explicit statutory or Constitutional authority.\nIn unraveling this conundrum, we begin by observing that the language of Article V, Section 16(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution is inherently ambiguous. In full, Section 16 of the Constitution provides as follows:\nSec. 16. Compensation and retirement of justices, judges, and justices of the peace\n(a) Justices, judges and justices of the peace shall be compensated by the Commonwealth as provided by law. Their compensation shall not be diminished during their terms of office, unless by law applying generally to all salaried officers of the Commonwealth.\n(b) Justices, judges and justices of the peace shall be retired upon attaining the age of seventy years. Former and retired justices, judges and justices of the peace shall receive such compensation as shall be provided by law. No compensation shall be paid to any justice, judge or justice of the peace who is suspended or removed from office under section eighteen of this article or under article six.\n(c) A former or retired justice or judge may, with his consent, be assigned by the Supreme Court on temporary judicial service as may be prescribed by rule of the Supreme Court.\nSection 16(b) nowhere uses the word \u201cpensions\u201d or \u201cretirement benefits\u201d in referring to that which is forfeited by reason of a judge\u2019s removal. Rather, the word \u201ccompensation\u201d remains undefined in the Constitution, thus requiring a broader analysis of the language and history of Section 16(b) in order to derive that term\u2019s meaning.\nFirst, with respect to the language, the inherent ambiguity is heightened by the juxtaposition of Sections 16(a) and 16(b) in the Constitution, which deal with distinct subjects yet allow a common sentence to straddle the two provisions. Section 16(a) traces its origin to the Constitution of 1790, and provides that full-time judges shall be \u201ccompensated by the Commonwealth as provided by law.\u201d Section 16(b) owes its origin to the Constitutional Convention of 1967-68, and deals primarily with former and retired judges. The latter provision mandates the retirement of judges at age 70; it provides that former and retired judges \u201cshall receive such compensation as shall be provided by law;\u201d it finally includes a sentence dealing with removal from office, which ostensibly applies to both sitting and former or retired judges, creating an overlap between 16(a) and 16(b). It is this final sentence, hung in limbo between two otherwise unrelated constitutional provisions, which generates the confusion in the instant case. It states as follows:\nNo compensation shall be paid to any justice, judge or justice of the peace who is suspended or removed from office under section eighteen of this article (the JIRB provision) or under article six (the impeachment provision).\nThe first question is what the word \u201ccompensation\u201d means in Section 16(b). The Commonwealth Court in Glancey, in its effort to make sense of this imprecise language hung between two sections, found it significant that the word \u201ccompensation\u201d is used in Section 16(b), while the word \u201csalary\u201d is used in other parts of the Constitution, including Section 18(h). This difference in language, according to the Commonwealth Court, indicated that Section 16(b) was meant to broadly encompass all sorts of \u201ccompensation,\u201d including pension benefits.\nHowever, we find this distinction to be a hollow one. Sitting judges receive a \u201csalary.\u201d Former or retired judges do not; they receive \u201ccompensation\u201d at irregular intervals, because they sit by special appointment only. The framers of Section 16, having drafted the language to straddle both 16(a) and 16(b), had no choice but to use the word \u201ccompensation\u201d in the latter provision, since it referred to both sitting judges (who draw a regular paycheck), and former or retired judges (who receive only sporadic remuneration). The word \u201ccompensation\u201d in Section 16(b) thus supplies no hidden clue to the Framers\u2019 intent; in this context, no other word (including \u201csalary\u201d) would have made sense.\nNor is it significant, as the Commonwealth Court seeks to suggest in King, that a subcommittee of the Constitutional Convention changed the word \u201csalary\u201d back to \u201ccompensation\u201d two days before the end of the Convention. King, 129 Pa.Commw. at 449, 566 A.2d at 327. This change occurred only after it was discovered that a subcommittee on style and drafting had inadvertently interchanged the words. Id. Such a correction in language was therefore perfectly consistent with the interplay between Section 16(a) and Section 16(b), discussed above, since the drafters intended the language to apply to both full-time and former or retired judges. Moreover, the comments of Delegate Barry, at the time the change in wording occurred, indicate that it had nothing to do with pension benefits.\nWe therefore conclude that the language of the Constitution does nothing to solve the question whether pension benefits are meant to be included within the term \u201ccompensation\u201d under Section 16(b). It becomes necessary to explore the history of the Constitutional Convention of 1967-68, in order to attempt to derive an understanding of the Framers\u2019 intent in drafting this inherently ambiguous provision.\nAfter an exhaustive review of that constitutional history, we conclude that there was very little discussion of the pension issue; that there was no consensus among the drafters whether this language should have any application to pensions whatsoever; and that the weight of history suggests that a majority of the subcommittee intended the Constitution to remain purposely silent on the matter of pension forfeiture, and meant to leave the matter exclusively in the hands of the legislature.\nWe begin by observing that the Journal of the Constitutional Convention of 1967-68 reveals little discussion of pension benefits, generally, in the context of Section 16(b). Indeed, the last sentence of 16(b) attracted little attention throughout the debates, because the bulk of the discussion centered around fixing a mandatory retirement age of 70 for judges in the Commonwealth, as well as the related issue of allowing competent judges to be appointed on an as-needed basis, after retirement.\nThe history of the Convention reveals only sporadic mention of the pension issue under what became Section 16(b). One of the earliest meetings of the Sub-Committee on Retirement and Post-Retirement Service of Judges shows an agreement by the sub-committee to consider the following broad issue: \u201cShould the question of pensions \u2014 qualifications, amount, etc. \u2014 be dealt with in the Constitution?\u201d The history reveals a lack of consensus each time that issue was subsequently raised. It is true, as the Commonwealth Court in King pointed out, that certain members of the subcommittee recommended language which would have defined \u201ccompensation\u201d in pension-like terms in the new constitutional provision, linking it to a ceiling of \u201cseventy-five percentum\u201d of the judge\u2019s last salary. King, supra, 126 Pa.Commonwealth at 452, 566 A.2d at 327. However, the official minutes make clear that this was a minority proposal, and a majority of the sub-committee resisted any language linking the word \u201ccompensation\u201d with retirement benefits. To the contrary, it was the position of the majority that a great deal of latitude should be given to the legislature in dealing with the issue of pensions under what became Section 16(b), and that the new Constitutional language should be drafted in general terms to allow broad flexibility to the legislative branch. The following language in the sub-committee\u2019s minutes of January 25, 1968, bears out this point:\n\u201c2. Retirement Compensation Benefits\u2014\nThis sub-committee was unable to agree on how this subject should be treated in the Constitution. While there was general agreement that only former justices and judges who had completed at least one term in office and those who retired or were retired for mental and physical disability should be entitled to retirement compensation, there was disagreement as to whether these restrictions and others ... should properly be included in the Constitution. The majority of the Committee ... take the view that specific details and restrictions as to pensions are properly questions for the legislature and not the Constitutional Convention. They believe that the Convention should draft as flexible a document as possible and that if what they consider to be statutory details are included in the Constitution, the effective life expectancy of that document will be unnecessarily shortened \u00bb\nIt is significant that throughout this debate in the subcommittee, the language relating to the forfeiture of \u201ccompensation\u201d by removed judges \u2014 now the critical language in Section 16(b) \u2014 was already in place. Such language had appeared in the first draft proposal of the sub-committee as early as December 20, 1967. Thus, it is clear that the word \u201ccompensation\u201d did not encompass \u201cpension benefits,\u201d in the early stages of the convention which drafted Section 16(b), since that very issue was still being debated by the sub-committee without consensus.\nMoreover, it is significant that each time the sub-committee addressed the pension issue in the context of this new constitutional provision, it specifically used the words \u201cRetirement Compensation Benefits,\u201d indicating that it clearly understood the difference between this term and the generic term \u201ccompensation\u201d for purposes of the pension forfeiture provision.\nAs late as February 8, 1968, in reviewing drafts of Proposal 7, which included the provision which later became Section 16(b) relating to compensation forfeiture, the Judiciary Committee issued a memorandum containing the following query: \u201cSection 14(b) L.10 \u2014 Does \u2018compensation\u2019 include pension to which a judge may have a vested right?\u201d This the only direct evidence of the pension forfeiture issue being addressed. After the February memorandum, the question continued to remain unanswered by the sub-committee; nothing appeared in the later minutes or the language of the proposal to indicate that the subcommittee\u2019s previous ambivalence ever changed.\nThe language and history of the provision which became Article V, Section 16(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution at the close of the Constitutional Convention, on February 28, 1968, thus leads to the inescapable conclusion that the authors of that provision never reached any consensus whether the word \u201ccompensation\u201d should include retirement benefits with respect to the pension forfeiture provision of Section 16(b). To the contrary, the majority of the sub-committee drafting the language wished to leave the Constitution purposely silent on this matter, in order that it would be dealt with in toto by the legislature.\nNot only does an exhaustive review of the Journal and minutes of the Constitutional Convention compel this conclusion, but a host of other considerations convince us that Section 16(b) was not meant to be a pension forfeiture provision.\nFirst, there has been no provision in the Pennsylvania Constitution dealing with pension forfeiture for over 200 years. Although the Constitution has explicitly dealt with the subject of judicial \u201ccompensation\u201d since the year 1790, and has inferentially required that pensions be treated as part of the adequate \u201ccompensation\u201d mandated by Section 16(a), the matter of pensions, including pension forfeiture, historically has been left to the legislature. Indeed, at the time of the Constitutional Convention in 1967-68, legislation existed which comprehensively governed the pension rights of judges in this Commonwealth. We believe that if the framers of Section 16(b) would have intended to alter the status quo and bring an entirely new subject \u2014 pension forfeiture \u2014 into the language of the Constitution, it would have done so in explicit terms.\nSecond, not only do the minutes of the Convention suggest that the matter of pension forfeiture was intended to be left to the legislature, but the legislature of this Commonwealth specifically enacted a statute in 1978 which dealt with this topic, in a comprehensive fashion. The Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act of 1978, 43 P.S. Sec. 1311 et seq., establishes a specific and uniform method for the forfeiture of pensions by public officials, where certain \u201ccrimes related to public office or public employment\u201d have been committed. Section 1313(a) of that law provides for forfeiture of pension benefits as follows:\n\u201cDisqualification and Forfeiture of Benefits, (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no public official or public employee nor any beneficiary designated by such public official or public employee shall be entitled to receive any retirement or other benefit or payment of any kind except a return of the contribution paid into any pension fund without interest, if such public official or public employee is convicted or pleads guilty or no defense to any crime related to public office or public employment.\u201d\nSection 1312 of the Act defines \u201ccrimes related to public office or public employment\u201d in great detail, spelling out twenty-two specific offenses which shall trigger the pension forfeiture provision. Section 1313 allows the return of the public official\u2019s contribution into the pension fund, but allows SERB to retain such contributions until it is determined whether a fine or restitution is required. Id. Sec. 1313(a), (d), and (e). The Act also deals with the difficult issue of vesting, by providing that: \u201cEach time a public officer or public employee is elected, appointed, promoted or otherwise changes a job classification, there is a termination and renewal of the contract for purposes of this Act.\u201d Id. Sec. 1313(c). In short, the Pension Forfeiture Act provides a clear, detailed, comprehensive scheme with regard to the forfeiture of pensions. By its terms, it is specifically made applicable to \u201cjustices, judges and justices of the peace ...\u201d Id. Sec. 1312.\nIf this Court were to read the words \u201cpension benefits\u201d into Article V, Section 16(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution, words which do not exist, the result would be to render the Pension Forfeiture Act of 1978 largely meaningless, particularly as it applies to the judicial branch. Rather than following the specific statutory scheme established by the legislature, any removal of a judge by this Court for any reason, great or small, would lead to an automatic extinguishment of retirement benefits under Section 16(b). Not only would such a reading render the Pension Forfeiture Act a nullity as it applies to judges, but it would force the Pension Forfeiture Act into the black hole of unconstitutionality, because it would create an irreconcilable conflict between that Act and Section 16(b).\nThird, such an interpretation of Section 16(b) would result in a treatment of judges which is different from, and more drastic than, the treatment accorded to all other public officials under the Pension Forfeiture Act. It is beyond peradventure that if Petitioners were members of the legislative or executive branches of government, including the Governor or the highest ranking public officials serving in the Pennsylvania Senate, they would forfeit their retirement benefits only in accordance with the detailed strictures of the Pension Forfeiture Act. Although it is abundantly clear that members of the judiciary must be held to extremely high standards given the public trust which is reposed in them, other public officials are held to the same high standards. The Pennsylvania legislature has spelled out these standards in the Pension Forfeiture Act. Any reading of the Constitution which would treat one co-equal branch of government differently, and more harshly, than any other branch of government \u2014 whether the legislature, executive, or judiciary \u2014 particularly where a matter as fundamental as retirement benefits is at stake, must come as a result of an explicit, rationally-based Constitutional directive, rather than by judicial fiat.\nFourth, an interpretation of Section 16(b) which requires an automatic forfeiture of pension benefits, upon removal of a judge for any reason, would lead this Court into a quagmire of contractual dilemmas. Is the judge entitled to a return of his or her own pension contributions, as is authorized under Section 1313(a) of the Pension Forfeiture Act? Is the judge entitled to statutory interest? Is a judge entitled to recover that portion of the pension which has already vested, as Petitioner Glancey has requested, thus treating the retirement contract as divisible into segments? None of these weighty questions can be answered with reference to Article V, Section 16(b) of the Constitution, because \u2014 unlike the detailed provisions of the Pension Forfeiture Act \u2014 the Constitution simply does not address any of them.\nRespondent SERB, in effect, would have us draft a code of pension forfeiture law and append it to Section 16(b), allowing that Board to write its own rules based (ironically) upon the procedures already established under the Pension Forfeiture Act. It would have us construct a rule that a judge may receive a return of his or her past pension contributions, as is authorized under Section 1313(a) of the Pension Forfeiture Act, while SERB would be authorized to permanently withhold the balance. But under what Constitutional authority? It would have us conclude that the judge is entitled to statutory interest on his or her benefits returned. Under what language of the Constitution? The reason the Framers of Section 16(b) did not deal with these critical contractual issues was not due to inartfulness, but because Section 16(b) had nothing to do with pension benefits. Any interpretation of Section 16(b) to the contrary would yield a multitude of contractual complexities, about which the Constitution is tellingly silent.\nFifth, and perhaps most importantly, an interpretation of Section 16(b) requiring automatic forfeiture of retirement benefits any time a judge is removed from office, for any reason, would seriously undermine the flexibility afforded this Court by the suspension and removal provisions of the Constitution. Article V, Section 17(b) states that \u201cJustices and judges shall not engage in any activity prohibited by law and shall not violate any canon of legal or judicial ethics proscribed by the Supreme Court.\u201d Section 18(h) allows this Court to order suspension or removal of a jurist, upon the recommendation of JIRB, wherever this Court finds such a remedy to be \u201cjust and proper.\u201d Id. Taken together, these provisions grant wide latitude to this Court to suspend or remove judges for a host of reasons, some involving serious misconduct, others not involving proof of misconduct at all. This Court may discipline a judge for the \u201cappearance of impropriety,\u201d even where no crime or misconduct is proven, in order to ensure that the public confidence in the judiciary is not undermined. See, Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2. This Court may suspend or remove a judge for inappropriate behavior completely unrelated to the individual\u2019s duties on the bench, where such aberrant behavior, although not a violation of the law, may jeopardize the \u201chigh standards\u201d and \u201cintegrity\u201d of the judicial branch. Id. Canons 1 and 2. This Court may remove a judge for physical or mental infirmity, however delicate the issue, and may utilize Article V, Section 18(h) to discipline, suspend or remove judges for the tiniest to the gravest infractions, wherever it is determined that the public interest is best served by this flexible tool.\nAn interpretation of Section 16(b) which would automatically require pension forfeiture, each time this Court in its best judgment disciplined a judge for the sake of preserving public confidence, chills rather than fosters the scheme established by JIRB and the Constitution.\nLoss of retirement benefits, particularly where an individual has invested many years of service on the bench, is a serious matter. It strips an individual of his or her expectation in remuneration for services already performed. Often it seriously impacts upon a spouse and family, who have ordered their lives in reliance upon the eventual receipt of a pension check. In Pennsylvania, a pension is marital property subject to distribution, King v. King, 332 Pa.Super. 526, 481 A.2d 913 (1984), thus allowing a spouse to rely upon payments even in the case of a divorce.\nIf Section 16(b) were interpreted as Respondents urge, this Court would be forced to make a pension forfeiture decision each time it invoked the JIRB provisions, for any reason, whether it involved acceptance of a gift, inappropriate public intoxication, or conduct relating to physical or mental infirmities of a judge for which he or she may not even be responsible. If the Journal of the Constitutional Convention of 1967-68 makes anything clear, it is that the purpose of JIRB and related constitutional provisions was to vest wide latitude with this Court, to suspend or remove not only for crimes and morally reprehensible conduct, proven with certainty, but for any conduct which might shake the public\u2019s confidence in the judiciary. Requiring automatic pension forfeiture under Section 16(b) would frustrate this flexible mandate; it would force this Court to adopt the extreme penalty of pension forfeiture, effecting judges and their families for life, even where such a dire consequence may be far too serious a punishment to fit the crime, or lack thereof.\nCONCLUSION\nIt is certainly appropriate for judges \u2014 like all public officials \u2014 to forfeit their expectation in future pension benefits where their conduct has malevolently betrayed the public trust in their office. The legislature of Pennsylvania has established a detailed statutory scheme to determine which conduct of judicial officers shall trigger such pension forfeiture. See, 43 P.S. Sec. 1311 et seq. At the same time, the language of Article V, Section 16(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution is conspicuously silent on matters dealing with pension forfeiture. Our review of the language and history of that provision suggests that the Framers intended this Constitutional hush. If certain conduct of judges and other public officials is serious enough to warrant a surrendering of pension, it shall be enumerated explicitly in the Pension Forfeiture Act. If certain judicial conduct should be covered by the Act, which is not already covered, the legislature need only amend that statute to broaden its reach.\nHowever, it was not intended that this Court should strip a judge of retirement benefits each time it imposes removal under the JIRB provisions, without any regard for the nature or severity of the conduct at issue. Such a constitutional straight-jacket was specifically avoided by the Framers of Section 16(b). Nor is it required by the language of the Constitution. Given the need for flexibility and case-by-case options in the realm of sanctioning judges, the Constitution wisely leaves the distinct issue of pension forfeiture to the legislative branch.\nFor all of the reasons set forth above, the judgments of the Commonwealth Court in the above cases are hereby REVERSED.\nLARSEN, J., did not participate in the decision of this matter.\nMcDERMOTT, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a joining concurring opinion in which ZAPPALA, J., joins.\nNIX, C.J., files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which FLAHERTY, J., joins.\n. Petitioner Porter contends that he had become a member of SERS as early as 1958, when he served as an Assistant Attorney General and thereafter as an Assistant District Attorney and Assistant City Solicitor for the City of Philadelphia. However, SERB found otherwise, determining that his entry into the system commenced on December 30, 1971, when he was appointed to the Court of Common Pleas. Because there was no hearing on the above issue, this Court is not able to address the merits of such factual dispute.\n. Article V, Section 18(h) is the JIRB provision which states that upon removal or suspension, a judge\u2019s \u201csalary shall cease from the date of such order.\u201d (emphasis added). Judge Barry, writing for the Commonwealth Court in Glancey, turned to Webster\u2019s Dictionary for definitions and concluded that retirement benefits are necessarily a form of \u201ccompensation\u201d rather than \u201csalary.\" He wrote:\nA review of these definitions shows that \u201csalary is a part of a total compensation package, more specifically, present compensation. Public retirement benefits, again, are deferred compensation. Once a judge is removed and therefore has forfeited his office, no more services may be rendered and no more salary can be due. It necessarily follows that the section 16(b) prohibition against paying \u2018compensation\u2019 to a removed judge must refer to deferred compensation, i.e., retirement benefits. Id., 126 Pa.Commonwealth at 462, 560 A.2d 263 at 266.\nAs explained above, the problem with this sharp distinction between the words \u201csalary\u201d and \"compensation\u201d is that it ignores the pivotal fact that Section 16(b) is referring to both sitting judges and former or retired judges, making the word \"salary\u201d inapposite here.\n. A \"salary\u201d is defined as \"fixed compensation paid regularly (as by the year, quarter, month or week) ...\u201d Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary at 2003 (1966).\n. Delegate Barry stated on the floor of the Convention:\n\"Mr. President, this language was taken out by Style and Drafting. We think it is a substantive change and we ask that it be reinstated. Delegate Curran and myself as co-chairmen of the sub-committee recommend this, and it is with the consent of Delegate Amsterdam and Governor Scranton.\nWe feel if there is an order by the Supreme Court for suspension or removal of a judge, this states, the suspension or removal shall take effect as of the date of that order. It provides the salary shall cease from the date of that order. This is not taken care of by the-language in the retirement section ...\u201d II Journal of the Constitutional Convention. 1373, Feb. 29, 1968.\nDelegate Barry is Judge Francis A. Barry, now of the Commonwealth Court and the author of the Commonwealth Court opinion in the King case sub judice.\n. The matter of permitting former and retired judges to be \u201cappointed\u201d on a temporary basis was part and parcel of the \"mandatory retirement age of 70\u201d issue, which dominated the Convention and gained widespread attention. Judges would be automatically retired at age 70, to confront the sensitive issue of mental and physical competency on the bench. At the same time, former and retired judges who were competent would be eligible for appointment on a temporary basis, assuaging those who believed that \u201cgood judges\u201d should be given an opportunity to serve, regardless of age. It is this interlocking arrangement between the first and second sentences of Section 16(b) which dominated the debate and subcommittee work, along with the creation of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board under Section 18, which was modeled after a similar ethics board in California. See, Memorandum from Committee on the Judiciary, Feb. 12, 1968. SA-113.\n. Minutes of Sub-Committee on Retirement and Post-Retirement Service of Judges, Dec. 12, 1967. SA-1. See, also, Minutes of Sub-Committee on Retirement v. Post-Retirement, Jan. 25, 1968, raising the same question. SA-31.\n. Committee Action Report, Sub-Committee on Retirement of Judges, Jan. 17, 1968. SA-25-26.\n. Id. See, also, Minutes of the Sub-Committee on Retirement and Post-Retirement, Jan. 25, 1968. SA-34-35.\n.

The proposal contained provision for:\n\"1) Mandatory retirement of judges and justices at age 70;\n2) former judges and justices to be compensated as prescribed by legislature, except that removed judges not entitled to such compensation;\n3) former justices or judges may be assigned by Chief Justice of Supreme Court.\"\n. See, Minutes of the Sub-Committee on Retirement and Post-Retirement, Jan. 25, 1968, SA-34-35, discussed supra.\n. Memorandum of Judiciary Committee dated February 8, 1968. SA-108.\n. It is true, as the Commonwealth Court in King, pointed out, that an undated memorandum was circulated to the delegates by the co-chairmen of the Committee on the Judiciary, Gustave G. Amsterdam and William Scranton, which sought to explain the revised Judiciary Article as follows:\n\"[T]he mandate that no compensation shall be paid to a judge removed from office under Section (18) or pursuant to Article VI, the impeachment proviso, is an exception to the grant of legislative discretion in the payment of retirement compensation.\u201d King, 129 Pa.Commw. at 449, A.2d at 327. See, SA-139.\nHowever, this undated, unofficial \"analysis\u201d by . individuals who did not draft the language, can hardly be viewed as dispositive. When viewed in context of the numerous passages in the official minutes which indicate that the sub-committee was undecided, and that a majority of the drafters wished to leave the matter of pensions entirely to the legislature, this single wisp of history to the contrary only buttresses the conclusion that the Committee and Sub-committee were hopelessly undecided on the issue.\n. Judge Bariys opinion in King is certainly entitled to great deference in view of the fact that he was a Delegate to the Convention and served on the Sub-Committee on Incompatible Activities of Judges, as co-chairman. However, the recollections and instincts of one delegate, thirty-two years later, whatever his stature, do not a Constitution make. It is the very purpose of recorded minutes, official records and the language of the final end-product, to guide this Court through the labyrinth of history.\n. Article 5, Section 2 of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1790 provided in relevant part:\n\"The judges of the supreme court and the presidents of the several courts of common pleas shall, at stated times, receive for their services an adequate compensation, to be fixed by law, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office ...\u201d\n. A host of decisions emanating from this Court have made explicit what has been implicit from time immemorial in this Commonwealth \u2014 that pension benefits are a type of \"deferred compensation\u201d within the meaning of Article V, Section 16(a), which requires that members of the judiciary receive adequate \"compensation\u201d as set by the legislature. See Goodheart v. Casey, 521 Pa. 316, 555 A.2d 1210 (1989); Klein v. Employees\u2019 Retirement System, 521 Pa, 330, 555 A.2d 1216 (1989); Catania v. Commonwealth State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 498 Pa. 684, 450 A.2d 1342 (1982); McKenna v. State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 495 Pa. 324, 433 A.2d 871 (1981); Wright v. Retirement Board of Allegheny County, 390 Pa. 75, 134 A.2d 231 (1957). As Chief Justice Nix noted in Klein, this Court has repeatedly \u201crecognized retirement benefits as part of the total compensation package, subject to the original contract of employment.\" Id. 521 Pa. at 351, 555 A.2d at 1227 n. 2, citing Catania, 498 Pa. at 705-708, 450 A.2d at 1345-47 (Nix, J., Opinion in Support of the Grant of Summary Judgment). Justice Flaherty has similarly stated in interpreting Section 16(a): \"Retirement benefits are not a gratuity; they are deferred compensation and should be viewed as such. To change the terms by which retirement benefits are calculated strike at the heart of the compensation package.\u201d McKenna, 495 Pa. at 337, 433 A.2d at 877 (Flaherty, J., concurring). See, also, opinion of Justice Larsen in Klein, holding that the \"unified judicial system\u201d established by Article V, as well as Section 16(a), require that judges performing similar functions be paid the \"same rate of compensation,\u201d and this included retirement benefits. Id. 521 Pa. at 340, 555 A.2d at 1221.\nHowever, this Court\u2019s sensible decisions holding that pension benefits are part of the adequate \"compensation\" See, Goodheart, mandated by Article V, Section 16(a), which the legislature may not diminish arbitrarily, does not compel a conclusion that pension benefits are necessarily \"compensation\" within the meaning of the quite distinct Section 16(b), relating to pension forfeiture. First, it must be underscored that Section 16(a) derives from the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1790, and has a well-marked history nearly as old as this Commonwealth. See, n. 15, above. Section 16(b), on the other hand, is an infant in terms of Constitutional history, and was added in 1967-68 with precise objectives recorded in the minutes and official records. To conclude that \u201ccompensation\" must include pension benefits for purposes of 16(b), simply because it is included in the adequate \u201ccompensation\" mandated by 16(a), is to whitewash over the Constitution and ignore the context and history of the language. Section 16(a) is a positive provision, which assures an adequate compensation established by the legislature, and prevents that compensation from being diminished while a judge is in office. Section 16(b) is a negative provision, at least in the third sentence applicable herein, and strips away remuneration otherwise owing a justice, judge or justice of the peace as a punitive measure. Thus, it can hardly be said that the two provisions can be read in pari materia.\nIndeed, because Section 16(b) is a negative provision which strips away rights, it would threaten to contradict and run afoul of our long line of cases treating pensions as a contractually guaranteed element of \u201ccompensation\u201d under Section 16(a), if it were to be loosely interpreted to diminish rights without strict constitutional safeguards not present in the language of Section 16(b).\n. Retirement benefits for state employees, including judges, were provided for in the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Code of 1959, 71 P.S. Sec. 1725-101 \u2014 1725-809, and in legislation creating the State Employees\u2019 Retirement System, 71 P.S. Sec. 1731 \u2014 1758.3. These provisions have since been repealed and replaced.\n. In each of the cases at bar, SERB authorized the return of such pension contributions, presumably pursuant to Section 16(b); however, there is nothing in the Constitution which deals with this critical issue.\n. Petitioner Glancey has requested that this divisibility approach be followed, if Section 16(b) relates to pension benefits at all. It is interesting to note that then-Justice, now Chief Justice Nix had suggested this approach in Miller v. Com., State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 498 Pa. 103, 445 A.2d 88 (1981) (Nix, J., concurring), in illustrating the problems inherent in the Public Employees Pension Forfeiture Act of 1978 to the extent that statute sought to apply retroactively to pensions already vested.\n. In response to the dissent, it is respectfully noted that the only issue addressed by the majority herein is whether the Constitution of Pennsylvania mandates the forfeiture of pensions of justices, judges and justices of the peace each time the disciplinary provisions of JIRB are invoked. Because we concluded that Article V, Section 16(b) of the Constitution is silent as to the issue of pension forfeitures, it naturally follows that the majority had no reason to address the separate issue of when pension benefits might cease with respect to the Appellants or any other public officials removed from office. This matter concerns interpretation of the Pension Forfeiture Act, an issue \u25a0 that is not before us today. Thus, when the dissent concludes that,\n\"[tjoday\u2019s holding by the majority, allow[s] all compensation to survive until the effective date of the order of removal or suspension ...\u201d (Nix, C.J., dissenting, p. 30.),\nthe dissent has unfortunately misconstrued the holding of the majority. As so aptly noted in the joining concurrence of Mr. Justice Papadakos, the Constitution of Pennsylvania simply does not address the forfeiture of pensions of justices, judges or justices of the peace. The mechanics of such pension forfeiture, if indeed a forfeiture is worked with respect to any particular Appellant, must be dictated by an interpretation of the precise statutory language of the Pension Forfeiture Act. Such a question is not before us today. It must be resolved if and when such an issue becomes ripe for consideration.",

For the reasons that follow, I would conclude that Article Y, \u00a7 16(b) of our Constitution, given its intended effect, allows for the termination of a judge\u2019s prospective pension benefits effective the date, as determined by the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, the jurist committed the act of misconduct while in office which was the predicate for removal.\nFrom the beginning of our civilization those who were favored to serve as judges were deemed to be members of society whose integrity could not be questioned and whose judgment was accepted as sound and above reproach. The grant of power to a judge recognizes that those who serve in that capacity, although sharing the failings of all humans, were individuals who were expected to withstand the temptations of life and, therefore, could properly judge others who possessed less resolve to meet that standard. This unusually high standard is reflected in our Canons of judicial ethics which demand more of a judge than merely obeying the existing law. The Canons of judicial behavior expressly provide that we avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Code of Jud. Conduct, Canon 2, Subd. (B). Those Canons expressly dictate that overt misbehavior may not be condoned.\nIn each instance before us today, the dereliction has been established and is not being challenged. Those issues have been resolved by our decisions in Matter of Cunningham, 517 Pa. 417, 538 A.2d 473 (1988) and In re: Glancey, 518 Pa. 276, 542 A.2d 1350 (1988). The situation is further exacerbated as the conduct in question is not related to the personal behavior of the jurist but rather concerns the jurist\u2019s behavior in the performance of his judicial duties. The only issue presented is the appropriate response to that errant behavior. Our response must, therefore, be appropriate to that behavior which caused damage to the integrity of the judicial process and its image. I do not believe that we can ignore the magnitude of the breach nor the irreparable damage it has cast upon the integrity of this system.\nFor the reasons that follow, I am constrained to conclude that the majority\u2019s result serves to compound the damage caused by the conduct it intends to sanction. The instant situation afforded the opportunity for this Court to reenforce its previously expressed intention to maintain the integrity of the jurists of this Commonwealth. Matter of Cunningham, 517 Pa. 417, 538 A.2d 473 (1988). To the contrary, today\u2019s decision signals to all that our previous posture, enunciated in In re: Glancey, 518 Pa. 276, 542 A.2d 1350 (1988), was merely an aberration and business as usual will prevail.\nIn recognition of the august nature of a jurist\u2019s position in our society, both our Constitution and General Assembly enacted requirements that public officers, including judges, take an oath prior to entering upon the responsibility of office. This required oath of office and an individual\u2019s inclusion in the State Retirement Plan independently operate to create a contractual relationship between the jurist involved and the State. Specifically, Article VI, Section 3 of the Pennsylvania Constitution requires that all public officers including members of the judiciary take a designated oath of office. The required oath is as follows:\n\u201cI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support, obey and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this Commonwealth and that I mil discharge my office with fidelity.\u201d\nPa.Const. Art. VI, \u00a7 3 (emphasis added).\nThe requirement that an oath of office be taken by members of the judiciary was codified by the Legislature pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3151 which reads as follows: \u00a7 3151. Oath of Office\nEach judicial officer shall, before entering on the duties of his office, take and subscribe the following oath or affirmation before a person authorized to administer oaths:\n\u201cI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support, obey and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this Commonwealth and that I will discharge the duties of my office with fidelity.\u201d\nAny person refusing to take the oath or affirmation shall forfeit his office. A judicial officer shall be sworn upon his appointment or election, and after each retention election, and thereafter need not be sworn in any matter referred to him.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3151 (emphasis added).\nAs the statute explicitly states, the taking of the oath is an prerequisite to \u201centering upon the duties\u201d of office. Com monwealth ex rel. Kelley v. Keiser, 340 Pa. 59, 69, 16 A.2d 307 (1940). It necessarily follows that the oath of office is also a precondition to receiving any compensation for the performance of those duties, as one clearly may not receive payment for services one has not performed. Thus, it is the very oath of office itself which enables a judge to commence his duties and accordingly earn that compensation due him, including the pension benefits payable to a jurist.\nIn addition to the statutory requirement imposed upon those assuming the esteemed and powerful position of judge that an oath of office be taken, the oath itself imposes additional obligations upon the jurist. The oath of office required to be taken mandates that a judge \u201cdischarge the duties ... of office with fidelity.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3151. Implicit in this language is the notion that compliance with this pledge is a predicate to receiving the benefits of office and conversely failing to abide by the oath must result in a simultaneous termination of a jurist\u2019s entitlement to the emoluments of office.\nThe relationship between a public employee and the State Pension Plan is necessarily contractual in nature containing various mutual obligations. \u201cIt is well established that retirement benefits are founded upon a contract theory of deferred compensation.\u201d McKenna v. State Employes\u2019 Retirement Board, 495 Pa. 324, 334, 433 A.2d 871, 876 (1981) (Nix, J., concurring) (citing Harvey v. Allegheny County Retirement Board, 392 Pa. 421, 141 A.2d 197 (1958); Baker v. Retirement Board of Allegheny County, 374 Pa. 165, 97 A.2d 231 (1953); McBride v. Allegheny County Retirement Board, 330 Pa. 402, 199 A. 130 (1938); Retirement Board of Allegheny County v. McGovern, 316 Pa. 161, 174 A. 400 (1934)). I agree with Judge Barry of the Commonwealth Court when he so aptly noted:\nWhat Glancey fails to recognize is that Sections 16 and 18 of Article V constitute \u201cterms and conditions\u201d upon which the receipt of retirement pay is premised. Put another way, at the time Glancey joined the system, that system provided that a judge could collect retirement pay unless he was removed from office under Section 18 of Article V.\nGlancey v. State Employes\u2019 Retirement Board, 126 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 457, 463, 560 A.2d 263, 266 (1989). Accordingly, once the jurist engaged in conduct which was sufficiently violative of his oath of office to warrant suspension or removal, that act of misconduct serves to instantaneously sever the jurist from that very system which provided him a process for entitlements to the emoluments of his office. Accordingly, I would hold that the Board must calculate the loss of the Appellant\u2019s prospective retirement benefits only up until that date determined by the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board to be the first instance of misconduct engaged in by each jurist.\nWhile the Order of the Board and its subsequent affirmance by the Commonwealth Court requiring the total loss of all state contributions to the pension funds of Appellants constitute an impermissible forfeiture, calculating the loss of prospective pension benefits from the date of misconduct effectuates the economic consequence of removal or suspension and is undeniably fair. Under this analysis there can be no risk of \u201cforfeiture\u201d as the moment the jurist engages in misconduct he simultaneously breaches his contractual obligation with the State and his entitlement to rights and privileges due him terminates instantly. Thus, it is the jurist\u2019s own affirmative conduct which precipitates the breach of contract and termination of his pension benefits, not the Constitution nor this Court. Accordingly, there is no loss or deprivation of any property interest in which the jurist had a reasonable expectation or right to possess. Clearly, once a jurist tarnishes the bench with his betrayal of the public trust, from that moment forward he can no longer realistically expect continued financial support from the very system offended by his actions. The jurist\u2019s entitlement to the financial emoluments of office ceased to exist once he engaged in \u201cmisconduct\u201d.\nThis conclusion is predicated upon my belief that the phrase \u201cno compensation\u201d as employed in Article V, Section 16(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution explicitly provides this Court with the authority to terminate the pension benefits of a removed or suspended jurist. Article V, Section 16(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution states:\nJustices, judges and justices of the peace shall be retired upon attaining the age of seventy years. Former and retired justices, judges and justices of the peace shall receive such compensation as provided by law. No compensation shall be paid to any justice, judge or justice of the peace who is suspended or removed from office under section eighteen of this article or under Article VI.\nPa.Const. Art. V, Section 16(b) (emphasis added).\nWhenever this Court is called upon to interpret a particular constitutional provision, we are guided by the basic principle that \u201c[constitutional provisions are not to be read in a strained or technical manner. Rather, they must be given the ordinary, natural interpretation the ratifying voter would give them.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Paulinski v. Isaac, 483 Pa. 467, 475, 397 A.2d 760, 765, cert. denied, 442 U.S. 918, 99 S.Ct. 2841, 61 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979). Where more than one interpretation is possible, it is appropriate to \u201cfavor a natural reading which avoids contradictions and difficulties in implementation, which completely conforms to the intent of the framers, and which reflects the views of the ratifying voter.\u201d Id., 483 Pa. at 477, 397 A.2d at 766. A constitution reflects the will of the people; thus, the people\u2019s natural understanding of the terms therein must be given full effect. Commonwealth v. Harmon, 469 Pa. 490, 366 A.2d 895 (1976); Berardocco v. Colden, 469 Pa. 452, 366 A.2d 574 (1976); Firing v. Kephart, 466 Pa. 560, 353 A.2d 833 (1976); Breslow v. School District of Baldwin Township, 408 Pa. 121, 182 A.2d 501 (1962).\nA natural reading of the last two sentences of this provision would require the word \u201ccompensation\u201d to carry the same meaning in both instances. \u201cCompensation\u201d is generally understood to refer not only to salary but also to retirement benefits. See Catania v. Commonwealth, State Employes\u2019 Retirement Board, 498 Pa. 684, 690, 708, 450 A.2d 1342, 1345, 1349 (1982); Bellomini v. Commonwealth, State Employes\u2019 Retirement Board, 498 Pa. 204, 209-10, 445 A.2d 737, 739 (1982). The choice of word \u201ccompensation\u201d in this context indicates the framers\u2019 intent to encompass salary and retirement benefits.\nWhile the plain meaning of \u201ccompensation\u201d as used in this context suggests the inclusion of retirement and pension benefits in addition to salary, a thorough analysis of Section 16 in its entirety, compels the same conclusion. Section 16(b) also states that \u201c[fjormer and retired justices, judges, and justices of the peace shall receive such compensation as shall be provided by law.\" Pa. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 16(b), (emphasis added). The only compensation to which a former or retired judge is entitled after he or she retires or leaves office is the accrued retirement benefits resulting from service as an active judge. Any additional compensation obtained from service as a senior judge is not included since that retired or former judge does not have a right to serve in senior service, but rather serves only at the pleasure of this Court. Additionally, the compensation received by senior judges does not accrue from service rendered as an active judge, but rather from the services rendered as a senior judge. Section 16(c) allows only former or retired justices or judges to be assigned to \u201ctemporary judicial service.\u201d Pa. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 16(c). Despite their explicit inclusion in Section 16(b), justices of the peace are not eligible for temporary judicial assignments under Section 16(c). The \u201ccompensation\u201d referred to in Section 16(b) for former or retired justices or judges may include remuneration for temporary judicial assignments, but it must also include retirement and pension plans, because justices of the peace are not authorized to perform temporary judicial service. Thus, to hold that \u201ccompensation\u201d does not include one\u2019s retirement or pension contribution would contradict Section 16(b)\u2019s mandate that former and retired justices of the peace receive \u201csuch compensation as shall be provided by law.\u201d Pa. Const. Art. Y, \u00a7 16(b) (emphasis added).\nWhile I believe that Section 16 itself operates to define \u201ccompensation\u201d to include pension benefits, an analysis of other constitutional provisions also supports such an interpretation. Preliminarily, it should be noted that the Constitution grants certain powers and outlines a specified procedure, in general, to deal with the disciplining of judges. First, the Constitution creates a Judicial Inquiry and Review Board (J.I.R.B.), Pa. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 18(a), and empowers it to investigate those jurists who have been charged with misconduct, Pa. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 18(d). Once the J.I.R.B. investigation warrants an appropriate punishment, the Board is authorized to recommend to this Court \u201cthe suspension, removal, discipline, or compulsory retirement of the justice or judge.\u201d Pa. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 18(g). The last remaining phase of the process, is for this Court to implement the recommendations of the J.I.R.B., implement any of the enumerated sanctions that are \u201cjust and proper\u201d, or reject the recommendations wholly. Pa. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 18(h). However, should an order for suspension from office or removal be issued, \u201cthe justice or judge shall be suspended or removed from office and his salary shall cease from the date of such order.\u201d Pa. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 18(h) (emphasis added).\nToday\u2019s holding by the majority, allowing all compensation to survive until the effective date of the order of removal or suspension, clearly disregards the fact that the Legislature chose to employ different terms at different times because they intended those words to convey different definitions. The explicit reference to the term \u201csalary\u201d in Section 18(h) further reassures us that the term \u201ccompensation\u201d as used in Section 16(b) was intended to have a separate and distinct meaning. This deliberate reference to the term \u201csalary\u201d in Section 18(h) above, unquestionably demonstrates that the drafters of the Constitution were well aware of the differences in meaning between \u201csalary\u201d and \u201ccompensation.\u201d Their selective use of the two words thus, was intentional, rather than inadvertent and we are bound to effectuate and oblige such intent. See, Commonwealth ex rel. Paulinski v. Isaac, supra; Commonwealth v. Harmon, supra. Therefore, while the language of Section 18(h) requires the termination of a jurist\u2019s \u201csalary\u201d effective the date of the Order of removal or suspension is issued, it does not prohibit the termination of pension benefits from occurring earlier. Clearly an employee is entitled to collect a wage while continuing employment; however, no entitlement exists on behalf of a removed or suspended jurist to collect pension benefits, an emolument of office provided in exchange for faithful service, once he engages in misconduct. If the term \u201ccompensation\u201d in Section 16(b) were intended to refer to salary only, Section 18(h) would be redundant. Clearly, the framers did not intend such a result as they understood that the two terms were not interchangeable.\nNext, those who fail to recognize that the concept of \u201ccompensation\u201d is a broad classification of which salary is merely a component or subsection are vulnerable to an unintended consequence resulting from their position. Article V, Section 16(a) referring to the \u201ccompensation\u201d of judges, states in relevant part: \u201c[Tjheir compensation shall not be diminished during their terms in office, unless by law applying generally to all salaried officers of the Commonwealth.\u201d Pa. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 16(a). If compensation merely refers to salary, then Section 16(a) solely protects against the diminution of salaries and leaves open the possibility for a future reduction in a jurist\u2019s overall benefits. Such an occurrence could legitimately occur under the latter interpretation.\nI disagree and believe it is highly significant that Section 16(a) employs the term \u201ccompensation\u201d rather than \u201csalary\u201d to assure that the value of the overall compensation package would not be diminished. This interpretation of the word compensation would result in a more legitimate and intended outcome, that protection against erosion extends beyond maintenance of a mere salary level, but rather to the entire compensation package including medical benefits and retirement funds.\nPrior to the 1968 Amendments, Section 26 of Article III (formerly Section 11) of the Pennsylvania Constitution prohibited the passage of legislation giving \u201cextra compensation\u201d to any public employee after services had been rendered. In Jameson v. City of Pittsburgh, 381 Pa. 366, 113 A.2d 454 (1955), and Koehnlein v. Retirement System for Employees of Allegheny County, 373 Pa. 535, 97 A.2d 88 (1953), this Court construed that language \u201cextra compensation\u201d to be violated by state statutes authorizing increases in retirement allowances to already retired public employees. Thus, it had already been determined and firmly established almost forty years ago by this Court that \u201ccompensation\u201d included retirement benefits. At the time of the 1967-68 Constitutional Convention therefore, when the provisions of Section 16 were being drafted, the term \u201ccompensation\u201d had previously been employed with reference to retirement benefits. Accordingly, any assertion that the term \u201ccompensation\u201d, as intended and employed in Section 16(b), is ambiguous cannot be plausible as it clearly disregards the historical and common understanding and usage of the term.\nThus, pursuant to this analysis, I believe a proper resolution of this matter would necessitate directing the Board to calculate the value of the appellants\u2019 pension plans as follows.\nThe retirement benefits of former Judge Glancey who took judicial office in January of 1969, vested in January of 1979. His misconduct occurred in December of 1985. Accordingly, the State Employes\u2019 Retirement Board would be directed to calculate former Judge Glancey\u2019s benefits up to the date of the misconduct.\nSimilarly, former Judge Porter originally took office in December of 1971, so his pension benefits vested as of December 1981. His misconduct, like Glancey\u2019s, occurred in December of 1985, and the S.E.R.B. would be directed to calculate pension benefits up to the date of that misconduct.\nFormer Judge King was also first appointed to the bench in December of 1971, and his pension rights vested in December of 1981. Former Judge King first breached his oath by committing misconduct in December of 1983. Accordingly, the Board would be directed to compute the value of his retirement benefits as of that date. Such a consequence is required at a minimum and the preservation of judicial integrity in this Commonwealth demands no less.\nFLAHERTY, J., joins in this concurring and dissenting opinion.\n. The effect of the majority\u2019s ruling today renders meaningless any economic distinction between a judge whose emoluments cease effective the date he retires in good standing and the Appellants herein who also receive their emoluments in full until the date of the order of suspension or removal. This is an affront to all jurists who retired after years of faithful and ethical service.\n. Former Judge Shiomos lost his pension benefits pursuant to the Public Employees Forfeiture Act, (\u201cAct 140\") P.S. 752, No. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 1-5, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1311-15. Judge Shiomos currently has a case pending before this Court challenging the constitutionality of \"Act 140\u201d. Shiomos v. State Employes\u2019 Retirement Board, No. 85 E.D. Appeal Docket, 1991. The resolution of this matter has been reserved for the appropriate time.\n. As this conclusion indicates, I expressly disagree with the Board\u2019s conclusion that the state\u2019s contribution prior to the misconduct should be disturbed.\n. Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s insistence that the course of action suggested in this dissent constitutes a \"forfeiture\u201d, we conclude that a jurist\u2019s entitlement to the emoluments of office automatically ceases upon the occurrence of his affirmative act of misconduct that was the predicate for the suspension or the removal. A forfeiture implies the taking of something to which a person was entitled. Once the oath is breached, there is no basis for entitlement.",
