Following a preliminary hearing on August 26, 1986, Appellant was held for trial on both charges. On October 9, 1986, the Commonwealth lodged a criminal information against Appellant charging him with rape, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121(1); involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3123(1) and (2); and a second count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3123(5).</p>

When she arrived downstairs, the prosecutrix testified that she saw Appellant, her mother’s boyfriend, at the door and let him into the house. She told Appellant that her mother was not at home but was expected soon and he could wait for her mother in the living room. Instead, Appellant followed the prosecutrix to her bedroom where, according to the prosecutrix, he raped her and then performed oral intercourse on her. Appellant then admonished her not to tell or else. The prosecutrix’s mother testified that she learned of the incident one month later when Appellant suggested that her daughter join them for group sex. It was the prosecutrix’s mother’s testimony that when she expressed surprise at the suggestion, Appellant related what had occurred a month earlier.

Appellant testified that he was asleep at the Atkin<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>son house when the incident occurred. It was also Appellant’s testimony that he called his wife, Leartta Knorr Shannon, who was in Pittsburgh from Michael Atkinson’s home during the relevant time period.

An evidentiary hearing was held on the ineffectiveness claim. The alibi witnesses were not present for the hearing. Appellant was denied post trial relief. Thereafter, Appellant was sentenced to a term of ten to twenty years imprisonment on the rape count; a concurrent term of five to twenty years imprisonment on the first involuntary deviate sexual intercourse count; and to ten years probation on the second involuntary deviate sexual intercourse count which was to commence following the term of imprisonment. A motion to modify sentence was denied. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

Hentosh was convicted of burglary, receiving stolen property and criminal conspiracy in connection with a coin collection and other items that were stolen from a person who had discussed his coin collection with Hentosh. Hentosh was engaged in the business of buying and selling gold and silver. In a memorandum in support of Hentosh’s request for a new trial submitted after the evidentiary hearing on remand, Hentosh specifically asserted that the testimony of one of his employees, Lori Morford, was critical to the defense in that her testimony would have impeached the testimony of the two admitted burglars. Additionally, Hentosh asserted that prior to trial he had requested his attorney to subpoena Officers Sherbondy and Pinkie whose testimony would have destroyed the credibility of a Commonwealth witness.

As Justice McDermott pointed out in <em>Sayko </em>“the corruption of a minor child, can only be committed against a minor child, hence the interest to be protected and the age of the victim are elements different from those of indecent assault and indecent exposure which offenses can be perpetrated against anyone, young or old.” <em><a href="/pa/511/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="511 Pa. 610" data-case-ids="1798723" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0610-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/511/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="511 Pa. 610" data-case-ids="1798723" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0610-01">511 Pa. at 613-614</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="511 Pa. 610" data-case-ids="1798723" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0610-01">515 A.2d at 896</a>.

Subsections (1) through (4) of § 3123 proscribe involuntary deviate sexual intercourse against anyone young or old. <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>Subsection § 3123(5), however, was enacted to protect a different <em>interest </em>— deviate <em>sexual intercourse against children </em>— and requires proof of an additional element — that the victim is less than 16 years of age. As with statutory rape, consent is not an issue nor a defense with regard to § 3123(5). Further evidence of the separateness of the offenses and the difference in the interest to be protected is found in 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9718 which requires a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for conviction of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse when the victim is under 16 years of age.</p>

The mandatory sentencing provisions of 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9718 required that Appellant be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of five years for his convictions of rape and “statutory” involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Judge O’Brien sentenced Appellant to ten to twenty years on the charge of rape, a concurrent term of five to twenty years on one charge of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and a consecutive term of ten to twenty years probation on the second charge of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Unlike the majority, I believe that the Appellant should serve the additional consecutive term of ten to twenty years probation lawfully imposed by Judge O’Brien.</p>
