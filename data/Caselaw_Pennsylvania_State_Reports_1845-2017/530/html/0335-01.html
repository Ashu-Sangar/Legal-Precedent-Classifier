This language merely allows a state to apportion seats between districts that are not strictly equal in population; it does not mandate it. Our Constitution requires that the overriding objective of reapportionment is equality of population, and in 1972 and 1981 this Court approved plans in which the overriding objective was equality of population. We see no reason now in 1992 to retreat from those earlier holdings.</p>

Const. Art. II § 17(e) (emphasis added). The Constitution does not state “if required.” Thus on its face the Constitution clearly establishes a termination date for the reapportionment plan.

Therefore, each Senator, whether in an odd- or even-numbered District, is on notice after a Federal Decennial Census that the prior reapportionment plan is no longer effective and the new districts may be drawn in a manner that separates the Senators’ districts from their residences. Senator Pecora’s and Senator Lewis’ appeals are similarly grounded in the fact that the Senators’ residences are no longer located within the senatorial districts that they represent. Their only difference is one of degree, i.e., Senator Pécora lives hundreds of miles away from his district, while Senator Lewis only lives in the neighboring district. However, the result is exactly the same. The districts in question are not slated for election until 1994 yet neither district has its duly elected senator residing within its borders.</p>

Appellant Lewis raises a residency issue as well in his appeal from the final plan, and alleges that it will be impossible for an incumbent senator to have resided in his district for a year before the election, and for all four years of his tenure (as mandated by the Constitution) if the Senatorial Districts are altered by the Reapportionment Commission. This issue is not yet ripe for review because no senator has suffered adverse consequences in the form of losing a seat for failure to satisfy the residency requirement. However, we would note that the constitutional residency requirements may conflict with the constitutional mandate of reapportioning the Commonwealth every ten years. In light of that conflict, it may be necessary that residency requirements be waived when the Commission reapportions the Commonwealth less than one year before an election. These issues and possible resolutions are for the Senate to decide. <em>See In re Jones, </em><a href="/pa/505/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="165" data-cite="505 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1788875" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0050-01">505 Pa. 50</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="166" data-cite="505 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1788875" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0050-01">476 A.2d 1287</a> (1984).

One distinction between the opinion of the Court and the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Marshall is that Mr. Justice Marshall characterized the right to cast an effective vote as fundamental. As a result, the deprivation of a fundamental right requires strict scrutiny without any showing of discriminatory purpose. This differs from the plurality’s decision that the only fundamental right is participation on equal footing with other voters. There is no constitutional right to equal representation for identifiable political groups, and, therefore, a deprivation of the right to equal representation based upon racial consideration must be accompanied by a discriminatory purpose in order to merit strict scrutiny.</p>
