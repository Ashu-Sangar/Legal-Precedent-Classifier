A hearing on the request was set for July 24, 1986, and was advertised in a local newspaper. It is undisputed, however, that the property was not posted with notice of the hearing as required by Section 908(1) of the Municipalities Planning Code. Following the hearing, the Board approved the request and granted permission for two signs, one measuring 320 square feet. Eight months later, on March 18, 1987, Motel Six began installing the signs.</p>

The court appeal was disposed of by the entry of a consent order remanding the matter to the Board “for the purpose of conducting a hearing de novo relative to the variance application____” In consenting to this order, the Board in effect determined that the property had not been properly posted and that Beecham had proven its allegation “that [it] had no notice, knowledge, or reason to believe” that the variance had been granted, and that, therefore, its appeal to the Board, though filed more than thirty days after the approval, was permitted under Section 915 of the Municipalities Planning Code, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L 805, No. 247, art.

The Board again granted the variance request and Beecham appealed to common pleas court. The court permitted Motel Six to intervene and without taking further evidence dismissed the appeal, finding that Motel Six had a vested right under <em>Petrosky v. Zoning Hearing Board of Upper Chichester Township, </em><a href="/pa/485/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="485 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1755399" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0501-01">485 Pa. 501</a>, <a href="/pa/485/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="485 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1755399" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0501-01">402 A.2d 1385</a> (1979), which the court considered controlling. On further appeal, Commonwealth Court reversed, finding that Motel Six did not meet all the requirements set out in <em>Petrosky </em>for establishing a vested right in a permit. Specifically, the court found the case for vested rights lacking with respect to the fourth factor, “the expiration without appeal of the period during which an appeal could have been taken from the issuance of the permit,” <a href="/pa/485/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="485 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1755399" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0501-01">485 Pa. at 507</a>, <a href="/pa/485/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="485 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1755399" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0501-01">402 A.2d at 1388</a>.</p>

No court has ever suggested that vested rights require not only the expiration of the appeal period but also <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>the certainty that no appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>might ever be pursued.” Appellant’s Brief at 16.

    <p id="b366-4" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[241,403,1164,726]]]'>The flaw in this argument is the premise that the period in which an appeal could be taken is thirty days and the corollary characterization of Beecham’s appeal as <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>As noted previously, the Municipalities Planning Code states that “[n]o person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the board later than 30 days after [approval] if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or limit the approval in any manner <em>unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge, or reason to believe that such approval had been given.” </em>(Emphasis added.) The statute authorizes an appeal beyond thirty days in the stated circumstances, and thus it cannot be said that such an appeal is taken after the time when it should have been.</p>

A significant fact overlooked by Motel Six is that in almost all of the cases where a claim of vested rights was upheld, the challenge to the use came from the municipality or other government body. Because the municipality could not be heard to complain of a lack of notice of its own officers or boards, the “period within which an appeal could have been taken” (by the municipality) in these cases was in fact thirty days. The absence of any appeal, in other words the existence of a decision that <em>as between the parties </em>was final, was a factor that weighed in favor of the landowner. Such is not the case here, where the challenge to the use was raised by one who was not chargeable with notice of the initial approval of the use. Assuming, as it <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>appears, that Motel Six was entirely innocent of any wrongdoing — in the terms of <em>Petrosky, </em>that it had been diligent in attempting to comply with the law, had acted in good faith, had spent substantial unrecoverable funds, and that the public health, safety, and welfare would not be adversely affected by the use — the fact remains, as Commonwealth Court observed, that “Beecham is equally innocent of wrongdoing.” <a href="/pa-commw/125/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="125 Pa.

Motel Six argues that Beecham’s appeal to common pleas court was untimely under 42 Pa.C.S. 5571(b) and that therefore the court had no jurisdiction to consider and remand the case to the Board. Even if this argument is correct, it ignores the fact that a separate appeal was filed with the Board and that this appeal was timely under section 915 of the Municipalities Planning Code, now section 914.1(a), because Beecham alleged and proved lack of notice. (Motel Six concedes that a party is permitted to file an “untimely” zoning appeal to the Board if it had no notice of the Board decision. Appellant’s Brief at 15.) Thus even if the consent order of remand was a nullity, the Board properly considered Beecham’s appeal, decided it was necessary to hold new hearings, and rendered a new decision granting the variance. The appeal from this decision was timely filed in common pleas court, which affirmed. It is from Commonwealth Court’s reversal of the common pleas court’s decision that this appeal is taken.</p>
