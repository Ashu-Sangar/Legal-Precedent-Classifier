On September 1, 1988, Appellee filed a petition to proceed with his action <em>in forma pauperis </em>and attached an affidavit in support of his petition in the form required by our Rule of Civil Procedure 240.</p>

Following review of the petition, affidavit and complaint, the Administrative Judge issued an order denying Appellee’s request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>because Appellee admitted that the claims he sought to bring in state court had already been litigated twice before in federal court.</p>

Any court system, including ours, is busy enough that it cannot afford the added burden of litigating baseless, frivolous or repetitive claims and then require public funds to be used to pick up the costs involved in litigating these matters. The unnecessary waste generated by the non-paying user of the system provides a rational basis for treating paying litigants differently than those who cannot pay court imposed fees and in permitting a court to weed out frivolous claims as soon as they are brought to the court’s attention. Our rules require that a complaint be prepared and filed before an affidavit to proceed in forma pauperis can be approved and it is entirely consistent with the spirit of the rule that a court review the complaint at the same time it reviews the sufficiency of the affidavit required under Rule 240(c)(3).</p>

Rule of Civil Procedure 126 specifically provides that “the rules shall be liberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or proceeding to which they are applicable.” In addition to this rule of liberal construction is the rule of interpretation that in ascertaining our intention in promulgating rules, courts are to be guided by the presumption that the Court intends to “favor the public interest as against any private interest.” Pa.

    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[203,1088,1154,1106]]]'>Both of these rules of construction affirm the conclusion that it is our policy in promulgating rules to favor the public interest in such a way that actions are determined as inexpensively as possible to the litigant and the public as soon as they are brought to the attention of the court. In my view, the trial court was duty bound to interpret Rule 240 in light of these considerations and I can find no error or abuse of discretion in the trial court’s summary dismissal of the affidavit and petition where the underlying complaint had been litigated twice before in federal court. Appellee himself admits that the issues he wishes to raise in this proceeding have already been litigated and, unless the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>is to be abandoned, there is no reason why a matter of this nature should be permitted to proceed at public expense. On its face, the complaint has no basis in law or fact and is frivolous. <em>Robinson v. Com., Pa.
