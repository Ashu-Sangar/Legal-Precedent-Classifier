The relevant facts are as follows. On November 27, 1978, Donald A. Rosmondo, Jr. enrolled in an Accidental Death and Dismemberment Group Policy with Life Insurance Company of America and authorized his employer to deduct from his salary the required premium. The face amount of the policy was $200,000.00 and the named beneficiary was his father, Donald A. Rosmondo. On May 5, 1979, Donald Rosmondo, Jr., died as the result of injuries received in an automobile accident.</p>

It is conceded by all parties that the applicable statute of limitations expired on May 5, 1985. Although a complaint was never filed, apparently there were subsequent telephone communications between Appellant’s counsel and the insurance companies regarding the basis of Appellant’s claim, <em>i.e., </em>a claim under an accidental death provision of a group policy insuring Donald Rosmondo, Jr. By letter to Appellant’s counsel, dated November 15, 1985, a regional claims director for one of the insurance companies confirmed a recent telephone conversation with Appellant’s counsel, forwarded a proof of loss form (without admitting liability) and noted the following: “Incidently [sic], the named beneficiary is Donald A. Rosmondo, father of the deceased. We are enclosing a photocopy of enrollment card. Proof of Loss form should of course be signed by the father.” As a result of the aforesaid letter, Appellant filed a motion to amend the caption on the writ to substitute “Donald A. Rosmondo, individually” for “Alice Rosmondo, individually.” On February 1, 1988, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, based on Pa.R.C.P. 1033<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> and their <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>discretionary powers, ordered that the caption be amended to read “Donald A. Rosmondo, individually, and Alice Rosmondo, Administratrix of the Estate of Donald Rosmondo, Jr.” On interlocutory appeal, pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1311 and 42 P.C.S. § 702(b), the Superior Court reversed the trial court’s order.

However, if it were intended that the initial filing be a notice of claim on behalf of the named insured of the policy against the insurance company, then the proposed amendment could fairly be termed a correction of a misdesignation (this was the view of the trial court). There are equities at play on both sides of this case including, <em>inter alia: </em>1) whether an insurance company, after receiving premium payments from the deceased, should reap a windfall because of an inadvertent mistake; 2) whether an insurance company should not be able to put its books and records in order by properly relying on the statutes of limitations to finalize transactions; 3) whether the lack of a complaint prejudiced the insurance company defendants in that notice of the <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>underlying claim was incomplete; and 4) does the fact that the alleged “new party” is a plaintiff rather than a defendant make a difference?</p>

They argue that by its own terms, Federal Rule 15(c) allows only those amendments which arise from conduct, transactions, or occurrences set forth in an original pleading. The essence of the “relate back” rule is that the original pleading filed within the statutory period sufficiently notifies the parties of the nature of the claims being made such that it would not be prejudicial or unfair to the opposing party to allow a later amendment. Professors Wright and Miller, noted authorities on federal procedure, explain that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b131-7" data-blocks='[["BL_131.7",131,[230,1974,1109,203]]]'>[a]s long as the defendant is fully apprised of a claim arising from specific conduct and has prepared to defend the action, his ability to protect himself will not be prejudicially affected if a new plaintiff is added____</blockquote>

      <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>Unlike Pennsylvania, of course, the Federal Courts require that civil action be commenced by filing a complaint. F.R.C.P. 3. Further, the federal system is a “notice” pleading jurisdiction, requiring only that a complaint contain a “short and plain statement” of the claim for relief. F.R.C.P. 8. The “relate back” rule is logical and fair in the federal system because a plaintiffs first pleading — a complaint filed within the statutory period — notifies the defendant of the nature and extent of the claims against it. Accordingly, a defendant in the federal courts is not prejudiced by a subsequent amendment which arises out of the same “conduct, transactions or occurrences” which were enumerated in the original complaint.</p>
    <p id="b132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[222,1024,1159,310]]]'>By contrast, Pennsylvania takes a different approach to pleadings. Here, an action may be commenced by filing a bare writ of summons. The writ provides no information except the names of the parties. A writ of summons fails to notify the defendant of the nature and extent of the claims being asserted.</p>
    <p id="b132-5" data-blocks='[["BL_132.5",132,[218,1353,1161,735]]]'>Accordingly, Appellees argue, even if Pennsylvania had a “relate back” rule similar to F.R.C.P. 15(c), it would, nevertheless, be inapplicable in the case at bar. Here, there is nothing to which Appellant’s proposed amendment can “relate back.” Her sole pleading, the writ, contains no “conduct, transactions or occurrences” to which her proposed substitution could refer. Hence, even if this Court were attracted to the “relate back” rule, it would, nevertheless, have to refuse Appellant’s proposed amendment. Defendants would be unfairly prejudiced were this Court to allow plaintiffs to amend writs of summons after the expiration of the statute of limitations so as to introduce new parties whose claims would be otherwise time-barred.

However, their arguments are unavailing here because the principles underlying Pa.R.C.P. 1033 must be examined to determine when or whether a pleading may be amended <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>after a statute of limitations deadline has passed. Technicalities must not be exalted over substance. As to the question of when a new party plaintiff, a substitute plaintiff, or a new cause of action may be added after the statute of limitations period has passed, I think that the governing principle, in keeping with modern notions of fairness and justice, is as follows. The test is prejudice. Will the defendants be prejudiced by the amendment? Generally, when a party will not be prejudiced by a proposed change, courts are inclined to deem the change one of name only, not of party, and will permit the amendment to allow the change. <em>Jacob’s Air Conditioning and Heating v.
