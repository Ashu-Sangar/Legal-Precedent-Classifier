Subsequent to the filing of post-trial motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial, trial counsel withdrew his appearance. Present counsel entered their appearance on behalf of appellant, and filed supplemental post-verdict motions, raising issues concerning after-discovered evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel. An evidentiary hearing was held before the trial court on November 17, November 20, and December 3, 1987. New counsel was then granted permission to litigate supplemental post-verdict motions <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Following argument to the trial court <em>en banc, </em>appellant’s post-verdict motions were denied in an opinion and order dated January 5,1989. On February 3, 1989, appellant was sentenced to a period of incarceration of not less than five (5) years nor more than ten (10) years. On November 27, 1989, the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. <a href="/citations/?q=397%20Pa.%20Super.%20648" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="397 Pa.

Appellant, separated from his wife for two years, lived in an apartment with two other men. His daughter, the victim, four years old at the time of the incident, lived with her mother. She frequently visited her father for several days at a time, and did so between November 11-16, 1985. She testified at trial that, one night during that visit, her father [appellant] woke her up, inserted his finger and his penis into her vagina, put Cheerios into her vagina, and cut her vaginal area with a plastic knife. She also testified that when she screamed her father pointed a gun at her. The victim’s mother, appellant’s estranged wife, testified that her daughter acted abnormally upon her return from her father’s home on November 16, 1985, and that on November 19, 1985, while bathing her daughter, she discovered a cut approximately one-inch long on her daughter’s vaginal area. When unable to reach the family doctor, she took her daughter to Delaware Valley Medical Center emergency room.</p>

One child testified that on either November 15 or 16, 1985, she and the victim had gone to sleep on the sofa bed, but when she awoke the next morning the victim was in appellant’s bed. She could not recall whether appellant was at home at the time. Appellant’s father testified to a recantation by the victim. No character witnesses were called on behalf of appellant.

Trial counsel testified at the post-trial hearing, that his theory of the case contemplated the use of character testimony, but that after contacting the witnesses given him by appellant, he concluded that he could not use character witnesses. (N.T. 11/17/87, p. 27). <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>Although his recollections were hazy, he stated that he contacted appellant’s employer and a co-worker, and concluded that the employer didn’t know appellant very well, and that the co-worker would not be helpful.

At the post-trial hearing, both appellant’s employer and co-worker stated that they had known appellant for approximately eight years, had socialized with him, and were familiar with his good reputation in the community. (N.T. 11/17/87, pp. 99, 101, 104, 106, 108, 109). Appellant’s wife’s mother and father both stated that they would have testified to appellant’s good reputation within the community and to their daughter’s bad reputation, and also would have told about their daughter’s conviction for the unauthorized use of their credit card.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Appellant testified that he gave counsel the names of several other witnesses, who were familiar with his reputation, and who would have testified on his behalf at trial. These potential witnesses testified that, when asked by appellant, they had agreed to testify at trial if needed, but they were never contacted by appellant’s attorney. At the post-trial hearing, counsel could not state with certainty that he contacted all of the names given him by appellant. In fact, trial counsel, by his own admission, did not contact any witnesses until the day before trial. (N.T. 11/20/87, p. 289). He then failed to inform his client of his decision to forego the use of character evidence and failed to respond to his client’s inquiries regarding the absence of witnesses, there<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>by breaching his duty to consult with his client on important decisions. His decision, therefore, was not a tactical one made after weighing all of the alternatives, but was based on the fact that he had failed to interview and prepare potential character witnesses, and consult with his client thereto.</p>
    <p id="b98-5" data-blocks='[["BL_98.4",98,[213,652,1162,796]]]'>Trial counsel’s failure to use appellant’s numerous relatives as character witnesses was based upon his perception of familial character evidence. He testified that, “[a]s a policy matter, I don’t ever recall ever putting on character evidence of family members. I think the jury just thinks it’s garbage.” Counsel admits that he never discussed with appellant the possibility of presenting character evidence from appellant’s family. (N.T. 11/17/87, p. 28). Counsel’s preconceived notions about familial character evidence led to his failure to even interview appellant’s relatives, and precluded him from assessing their credibility. Although familial character witnesses generally lack the credibility of unbiased non-familial witnesses, an attitude that they are <em>per se </em>worthless, is sufficient evidence of counsel’s incompetency.</p>

I generally agree that it would have been permissible to impeach her credibility as a witness with evidence of her conviction for unauthorized use of a credit card, at 442, n. 5, although I believe the proper means of doing so would have been in the course of cross-examining her, and not through questioning of her parents. Moreover, her parents and perhaps others might have been questioned as to her reputation for truth and veracity generally, but not as to specific acts. Beyond that, however, I fail to understand on what basis testimony as to her “bad character” would have been admissible.</p>
