In their determination of fair market value, appellees’ experts improperly utilized a replacement cost approach contingent upon the subject property’s use as a brewery and the value of the property for that use (ie ... the production of 3.5 million barrels of beer annually). The experts first calculated the cost to replace the existing facility, including machinery and equipment. They did this by applying an industry standard of $50 per barrel of beer, which they lowered to $48 per barrel. Then, in order to factor out the machinery and equipment, they estimated a one-third real estate to two-thirds machinery and equipment ratio, which left them with a figure of $16 per barrel of beer. They multiplied the $16 figure by 3.5 million barrels of beer, subtracted depreciation and added the cost of the land to <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>arrive at their estimated fair market value of $34 million.

They did so without any pretense of replicating the same physical characteristics of the actual real estate being assessed because their only aim was to value the property based on its use. The statutory language that sanctions the cost valuation approach does not permit a determination of fair market value that derives from a methodology that estimates the cost of a hypothetical, unspecific model that could vary completely in size, design and construction from that of the subject property. This misguided application of the cost valuation approach is clearly impermissible. The objective of a cost valuation approach is to estimate, as closely as possible, the cost to construct new the existing taxable real estate because that is, after all, the subject of the assessment — not the production process or use of the property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

It is not enough, however, to exclude an arbitrary amount for machinery and equipment. By valuing the subject property based on its productive capacity appellees’ experts indirectly <em>considered </em>the machinery and equipment. Section 5020-201(a) specifically states that machinery and equipment “shall not be considered or included as a part of the real estate____” The machinery and equipment exclusion clearly evidences a legislative intent and public policy to promote a favorable business climate in Pennsylvania by providing tax relief for Pennsylvania industries. <em>See Jones and Laughlin Tax Assessment Case </em>at 429, .<a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.2d%20856" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="175 A.2d 856">175 A.2d at 860</a>. In view of this public policy consideration, it is not sufficient only to exclude machinery and equipment from direct inclusion in the assessable real estate valuation. To give the exclusion proper effect, the assessed value of industrial real estate must not, in any way, reflect consideration of the value of the machinery and equipment. Otherwise, a subtle — but no less real — assessment of machinery and equipment will result.</p>

We note that, while value-in-use cannot be considered in tax assessment cases, it must be considered in condemnation cases because the Eminent Domain Code specifically defines fair market value so as to encompass value-in-use principles.

Appellees’ experts did not consider the reproduction cost valuation approach, which estimates the cost to construct, at current prices, an exact replica of the property being appraised. Appellant’s expert estimated the fair market value of the property using the reproduction cost approach to be $10.6 million. Additionally, appellees’ experts disregarded two conventional methods of determining replacement cost valuation that do not consider the property’s use. The first method, the unit-in-place method, is based upon cost estimates for major components of the property, and the second method, the engineering method, is based upon a very detailed breakdown of material and labor, with each item costed separately. All three methods, if considered, would have estimated the fair market value of the subject property without considering the property’s value-in-use.</p>
