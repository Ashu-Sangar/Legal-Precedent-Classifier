Furthermore, since 1982, the wife had received the economic benefit of receiving alimony pendente lite from her husband. Finally, a 60/40 division of marital property was deemed appropriate due in part to the “physical problems now which have manifested after the separation and which certainly will prove debilitating as the years go on, although (wife) has been working with it and has been taking trips out of the country, in spite of debilitating arthritis.” Masters Report at p. 14.</p>

We agree with husband that the issue of physical impairment and ability to earn an income is a factual one. On this record, we cannot conclude that insufficient evidence was presented to support the findings of the master as adopted by the trial court. In any event, both the master and the trial court indicated that wife’s physical impairment was considered in awarding 60% of the marital assets to her.
