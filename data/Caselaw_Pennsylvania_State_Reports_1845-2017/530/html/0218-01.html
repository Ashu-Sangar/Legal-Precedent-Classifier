A report is also filed by the intermediary who arranged the adoption, and an investigation is conducted to determine the suitability of the adoption. 23 Pa.C.S. § 2535.

The agency argues that it does not intend to consent to an adoption by the grandparents, and offers the bald assertion that the possibility exists for collusion between the grandparents and the natural parents.

      <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>The flaws in appellant’s argument on this point are readily apparent. First, as previously stated, it is clear from the Act that the court’s concern is not the will of the agency but the best interests of the child. Under 23 Pa.C.S. § 2535(b), once Reports of Intention to Adopt are filed, an investigation is conducted by a person designated by the court to ascertain whether the proposed placement is suitable for the emotional needs and welfare of the child. The Act directs the court, upon a hearing on a Petition for Adoption, to take testimony and, if necessary, to order an investigation to decide whether the granting of the Petition suits “the physical, mental, and emotional needs and welfare of the child.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 2724(b). The Act also permits the court, “whenever it is in the best interests of the child,” to appoint counsel or a guardian to represent a minor child. Thus, the Act clearly focuses on the needs of the child, reflecting the policies expressed at common law. <em>See, In re Hookey, </em><a href="/pa/419/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="419 Pa. 583" data-case-ids="1896901" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0583-01">419 Pa. 583</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=215%20A.2d%20860" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="215 A.2d 860">215 A.2d 860</a> (1966); <em>In re Stone, </em><a href="/pa/398/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="398 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1289119" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0190-01">398 Pa. 190</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.2d%20808" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="156 A.2d 808">156 A.2d 808</a> (1959). <em>See, e.g., In re Adoption of Jacono, </em><a href="/pa/426/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="426 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1908618" data-case-paths="/pa/426/0098-01">426 Pa. 98</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=231%20A.2d%20295" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="231 A.2d 295">231 A.2d 295</a> (1967). <em>See also, Matter of Adoption of Sturgeon, </em><a href="/pa-super/300/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="300 Pa.

The language of 23 Pa.C.S. § 2713(2) provides that “[t]he court, in its discretion, may dispense with consents other than that of the adoptee to a petition for adoption when ... the adoptee is under 18 years of age and has no parent living whose consent is required.” Under the facts of this case, the rights of the children’s natural, living parents have been terminated, so their consent is not required. Accordingly, it seems clear that if the court determines that the agency’s consent is being withheld unreasonably, the court may dispense with the requirement of § 2711(a)(5) that the agency consent to the adoption. The agency’s implicit assertion <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>that its opinion will somehow control the outcome of the adoption is therefore baseless.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Certainly there may be legitimate factors, such as health or infirmities, which might be construed against the grandparents. Nevertheless, they should be permitted to participate in the proceeding just as any other individual or individuals who seek to adopt a child. A child’s interests are best served when all those who demonstrate an interest in his or her welfare are allowed to be heard. Therefore, at the very least, the grandparents should have been welcomed by the agency to offer what information they could in relation to their grandchildren’s best interests. That the agency has taken the opposite position is regrettable; that the court sanctioned the agency’s actions, without a substantive justification, as the Superior Court determined, is completely unacceptable.

Clearly, the legislature intended that the consent of the natural parents would be sufficient to permit an adoption to occur. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 2501-2504 (voluntary relinquishment of parental rights permits an adoption to proceed).</p>
    <p id="b321-5" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[200,855,1155,791]]]'>The legislature has not made the participation of grandparents a factor in the adoption process, where the consent of parents has been given.

The parents of Melanie and Matthew were 25 and 34 years of age at the time they executed their consents to adoption. Significantly, too, the legislature has expressly provided that the <em>consent </em>of grandparents is not required when parents wish to relinquish their parental rights, even where the parents are under 18 years of age. 23 Pa.C.S. § 2501(b); 23 Pa.C.S. § 2502(b).

In 23 Pa.C.S. § 2521(a) it is provided that a decree terminating parental rights “shall extinguish the power or the right of the parent to object to or receive notice of adoption proceedings.” The legislature surely did not intend that a child’s other biological relatives would be free to participate in proceedings from which the natural parents were excluded. Such a scheme would defy logic and would jeopardize the smooth and efficient functioning of the adoption process. It would also provide an avenue for relatives to frustrate and circumvent decrees terminating parental <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>rights. Quite plainly, the legislature has established an adoption process that makes adoption dependent upon the actions of the parents alone, rather than upon the actions of other biological relatives. To permit biological relatives such as grandparents to participate in the adoption process, changes in the existing legislative policy would be required.</p>
    <p id="b322-5" data-blocks='[["BL_322.4",322,[219,640,1164,939]]]'>Allowing intervention in the name of the best interests of the children would inadequately take into account that the legislatively established adoption process was designed to fully safeguard the interests of proposed adoptees. Once parental rights have been terminated, the best interests of the child are, of course, paramount in any adoption proceeding. <em>In re D.J.Y., </em><a href="/pa/487/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="487 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1759142" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0125-01">487 Pa. 125</a>, 132 n.*, <a href="/pa/487/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="487 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1759142" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0125-01">408 A.2d 1387</a>, 1391 n.* (1979). Nevertheless, while the best interests govern the selection of an adoptive parent, it does not follow that intervention by persons not contemplated by the legislature should be allowed. If the “best interests” rationale is invoked to permit intervention by grandparents in adoption proceedings, conceivably the door may be open also to others, related or not, and thus the time-honored legislatively ordained plan of adoption may be seriously impaired. The legislative scheme, however, is quite clear, and serves good purpose; thus, I do not find basis for grandparents to intervene.</p>

This provision states that it is applicable where a “child has resided with his grandparents ... for a period of 12 months or more and is subsequently removed from the home by his parents____’’</p>

    <p id="b323-6" data-blocks='[["BL_323.7",323,[194,652,1155,476]]]'>The majority’s opinion has emotional appeal, but lacks judicial restraint. I sense an underlying struggle to understand what forces would lead parents to make a decision that would separate their children from siblings and other blood relatives. I do not pretend that I know or understand, either. I do understand, however, that the law permits parents to terminate their parental rights. I understand, too, that as a jurist I cannot allow empathy to displace the law.</p>

      <em>“A </em>child’s interests are best served when all those who demonstrate an interest in his or her welfare are allowed to be heard.” (Op. at 15) The majority touts “the best interests of the child” as if it were a battle cry. It is stirring, but empty of meaning when used so. The adoption proceeding is not a public forum where anyone, even a relative, may attempt to persuade the court that placement of the child should be with the applicant.</p>
    <p id="b323-8" data-blocks='[["BL_323.9",323,[193,1605,1154,574]]]'>I cannot conceive that the majority would allow an individual who was unrelated to the child to intervene in the proceeding even if such individual was financially and emotionally capable of taking care of the child. Understandably so, for adoption is not a bidding process — even if well-intentioned. Why then should it be that a relative of the child will be permitted to intervene. A person who is not a party to an action may not intervene if the action will not affect any legally enforceable interest of the person. Interest is more than concern; it is a right that is legally enforceable.</p>
