Appellant was arrested on February 7, 1984, and charged with two counts of homicide, robbery, criminal conspiracy, and numerous theft, burglary and related offenses. A jury of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County found him guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree and of all the related offenses. Following a separate sentencing proceeding conducted pursuant to the procedures for capital offenses in the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711, the jury sentenced appellant to death on both counts of murder. Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was formally sentenced to death on the two counts of first degree murder. On the conviction for criminal conspiracy, appellant was sentenced to not less than five nor more than ten years imprisonment; and on the <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>robbery and burglary convictions, terms of imprisonment of not less than ten years nor more than twenty years.

During the summer of 1983, appellant had been employed by Norman Owens, a general contractor, and had performed certain repair and construction work at the home of the Harts and also at a radio station owned by the Reverend Dr. Samuel B. Hart which was then managed by his son, Bradley. Bradley Hart had complained to Norman Owens about the quality of work done by appellant and his co-worker, Larue Owens (Norman Owens’s son), and had refused to pay the elder Owens the full amount agreed to for that work. Norman Owens explained to appellant that he had not been paid in full because of Bradley Hart’s dissatisfaction with appellant’s work, and that when he (Mr. Owens) got paid, appellant would get paid. In retribution for not receiving payment that he thought he deserved, appellant began harassing the Hart family.</p>

Appellant, accompanied by Larue Owens and Eric Mason, slashed and overturned furniture; ransacked closets; threw bleach, paint, baby oil, eggs, syrup and other items around the house; and drove a knife into a sofa cushion. Human excrement was also left in the house, the heat had been set at 90 degrees, and the stench of urine filled the air. Additionally, the faces of Bradley, Feme and <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>Lisa Hart (their daughter) had been completely blotted-out by yellow paint on family photographs.</p>

Upon closer inspection, Officer Mullin discovered that Mr. Mason was carrying a personal computer. He explained to Officer Mullin that he had been out jogging and found the computer in the trash. At that time, Mason was wearing a black karate outfit and sandals and showed no signs of physical exertion. Mason’s appearance led the officer to find the explanation implausible. Mason was taken to the police station where the computer was impounded, a receipt was issued, and Mason was released. On September 14, 1983, Mason was charged with burglary of the church.</p>

Appellant forced Hart to write him a check, and then he and Mason tied Bradley and Feme Hart up and made them sit on the couch while the two intraders watched television and talked. The two men decided to separate the Harts, taking Bradley Hart to the basement and Feme Hart to the second floor, where they taped their faces (eyes, nose and mouth) with adhesive duct tape. When Feme Hart was taken to the second floor, appellant also took the Harts’ seven month old daughter, Lisa, to the second floor and put her on a bed.</p>

Acting upon a statement from the mother of appellant's girlfriend, who had told police that appellant gave her daughter a camera, the police executed a search warrant for the residence of appellant’s girlfriend or fiancee, and discovered several of the items that had been stolen from the Harts, including a camera and case, video games and a television. On February 7, 1984, the appellant was arrested for the homicides. A search of his residence at the time of the arrest, pursuant to a warrant, disclosed other stolen items from the Harts’ residence and the knife used by the appellant to gain entry therein. After being advised of his constitutional rights, and executing written waivers of those rights, appellant confessed to the robbery of the Hart residence on January 30, 1984 and to killing Feme Hart. He named Eric Mason as his accomplice, stating that he left Mason downstairs with Bradley Hart. Appellant did not state that Eric Mason actually killed Mr. Hart.</p>

Two days of hearings followed to determine the appropriate penalty. The Commonwealth presented no additional evidence, but rested its case on the evidence that had been presented at the guilt phase of the proceedings. The Commonwealth argued that four aggravating circumstances were presented for each defendant, “the defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony;” “in the commission of the offense the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense;” “the offense was committed by means of torture;” and “the defendant has been convicted of another ... State offense, committed ... at the time of the offense at issue, for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable____” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6-8) and (10).

The confessions were substantially “interlocking,” that is, each defendant’s account of the events of January 30, 1984, substantially corroborated the account of the other. A significant point of departure in the respective accounts is, however, that appellant confessed to actually killing Feme Hart, but not Bradley Hart. Appellant stated only that Eric Mason was left in the basement with Bradley Hart, but Eric Mason, on the other hand, stated that when he went to the basement he could not go through with the killing of Bradley Hart because he was scared, thereby inculpating appellant as Mr. Hart’s actual killer.</p>

Not surprisingly, and with good reason, criminal defendants always wish to excise evidence of unpleasant and unpalatable circumstances surrounding a criminal offense from the Commonwealth’s presentation at trial. Of course, the court must assure itself that evidence of such circumstances has relevance to the case and is not offered solely to inflame the jury or arouse prejudice against the defendant. The court is not, however, required to sanitize the trial to eliminate all unpleasant facts from the jury’s consideration where those facts form part of the history and natural development of the events and offenses with which the defendant is charged. The court did not err, therefore, in admitting the evidence of Lisa Hart’s physical condition.</p>
