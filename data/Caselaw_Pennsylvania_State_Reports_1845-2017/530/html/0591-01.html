    <p id="b690-6" data-blocks='[["BL_690.5",690,[257,441,1159,464]]]'>In May of 1983, in a trial by jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, the appellant, Damon Jones, was convicted of two counts of murder of the first degree, six counts of aggravated assault, one count of criminal conspiracy, and one count of possession of an instrument of crime. In 1987, sentences of death were imposed with respect to the murder convictions and terms of imprisonment were imposed for the other offenses. The present direct appeal ensued. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b690-7" data-blocks='[["BL_690.6",690,[257,974,387,35]]]'>I. BACKGROUND</p>
    <p id="b690-8" data-blocks='[["BL_690.7",690,[254,1040,1160,258]]]'>Appellant’s convictions arose from a drug-related massacre in which two persons were killed and six others were seriously wounded in a courtyard at the Richard Allen Housing Project (Project) in the City of Philadelphia. The factual background is as follows.</p>
    <p id="b690-9" data-blocks='[["BL_690.8",690,[248,1322,1165,1009]],["BL_691.1",691,[217,295,1151,98]]]'>On August 25, 1982, Sylvester Williams confronted Ernest Wright and demanded that he stop selling drugs in the Project. Williams confiscated the sum of $200.00 from Wright. Later that day, Williams encountered Isaiah Givens and discussed the earlier confrontation with Wright. Givens told Williams that there would be no acts of reprisal from himself, appellant, or Portie Robertson. Nevertheless, on the following day, appellant, accompanied by Givens and Robertson, entered the courtyard of the Project. All three men were carrying handguns. At that time, Williams was near the steps of a building that fronted the courtyard. An unidentified man approached the well-armed trio, whereupon appellant announced, “This is not meant for you. Move.” Appellant, Givens, and Robertson then began to fire their weapons. In rapid succession they fired approximately twenty shots towards Williams. Numerous people were in the courtyard at the time, standing near Williams. Two of them, including one seven-year-old child, were killed and six others were seriously wounded. Williams was not <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>hit. Appellant, Givens, and Robertson fled but were soon apprehended by police.</p>
    <p id="b691-5" data-blocks='[["BL_691.4",691,[214,410,1155,251]]]'>Appellant, Givens, and Robertson were tried jointly for this crime and all were convicted. In accordance with the jury’s verdict in the penalty phase of trial, Givens and Robertson were sentenced to life imprisonment and appellant was sentenced to death.</p>
    <p id="b691-6" data-blocks='[["BL_691.5",691,[217,721,312,34]]]'>II. PRETRIAL</p>
    <p id="b691-7" data-blocks='[["BL_691.6",691,[215,782,1154,730]]]'>Appellant’s first contention is that a motion to sever his trial from that of his codefendants was erroneously denied. The record is silent as to the circumstances surrounding the denial of appellant’s motion for severance. The motion was not denied by the trial court, but rather by another judge. Appellant has not cited anything in the record indicating the grounds on which the motion rested. The trial court, in preparing its opinion for purposes of this appeal, expressed uncertainty as to the grounds asserted for severance. It speculated that appellant presented his motion to a calendar control judge in proceedings not transcribed, but acknowledged that appellant may have at some time during trial presented a renewed oral motion for severance.</p>
    <p id="b691-8" data-blocks='[["BL_691.7",691,[215,1539,1153,797]]]'>Nevertheless, appellant claims that severance would have spared him prejudice from testimony given by certain alibi witnesses who appeared on behalf of codefendant Givens. Numerous alibi witnesses testified that Givens was not in the courtyard at the time of the shootings. Three of these testified further, however, that they saw appellant and Robertson commit the shootings. Appellant claims therefore that his own defense, which was one of alibi, was inherently contradictory with Givens’ defense. While the record provides no basis to determine the grounds actually asserted for severance, we believe that if, as appellant infers, the motion for severance was based on the possibility that appellant’s defense might be prejudiced by conflicts with testimony presented by the codefendants, the motion was properly denied.</p>

Givens presented many witnesses in support of his defense of alibi, and, of these, only three testified that appellant was involved in the crime. Givens testified in support of his own alibi defense, and he did not, in any way, implicate appellant. Thus, the core of Givens’ defense was one of alibi, as was the core of appel<a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>lant’s defense. There is nothing inherently antagonistic about alibi defenses being used by multiple defendants.</p>

Even assuming that the conflict was made known, the testimony would not have so affected appellant’s defense as to render the decision not to sever the trials a manifest abuse of discretion.</p>
    <p id="b693-6" data-blocks='[["BL_693.5",693,[188,932,1154,311]]]'>If the severance motion had been granted the Commonwealth would likely have been able, if it desired, to introduce testimony against appellant from the same three witnesses in a separate trial. Hence, granting the motion to sever would not have insulated appellant from the testimony in question.</p>
    <p id="b693-7" data-blocks='[["BL_693.6",693,[188,1260,1154,417]]]'>Further, the testimony was of very doubtful significance, since the Commonwealth produced six or more of its own witnesses who testified that they saw appellant commit the shootings. Quite obviously, too, Givens’ alibi witnesses were not believed by the jury. If they had been believed, Givens would not have been found guilty. It is most unlikely, therefore, that their testimony played any role in appellant’s conviction.</p>

Much of the evidence pertained to all three defendants, rather than to just one. The testimony given by a few of Givens’ alibi witnesses, even if the adverse nature of it had been foreseen at the time the motion for severance was made, was not such as would have necessitated that the defendants be tried separately. Further, the trial was a very lengthy one, consuming more than two months. It was characterized by the trial court as one of the most time-consuming homicide trials ever conducted in Philadelphia. A record in excess of seven thousand pages was produced. To have conducted separate trials for the codefendants in this case would have placed a <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>heavy burden upon the judicial system as well as upon the public.

    <p id="b694-6" data-blocks='[["BL_694.5",694,[254,673,1161,366]]]'>Throughout this lengthy trial, the jury was sequestered. During sequestration, two of the jurors engaged in certain foolish pranks at the hotel where they were staying.

Appellant argues that jurors who engage in even brief episodes of foolish behavior are incapable of engaging in the sober and serious deliberations required of them. We do not agree. When jurors are sequestered during lengthy trials, frustration and boredom may from time to time cause certain unfortunate incidents to occur. Such incidents do not, however, indicate that the jurors are unable to listen to the testimony, and render a fair and impartial verdict. Incidents involving juror misconduct do not warrant the declaration of a mistrial unless there has <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>been prejudice to the accused. <em>Commonwealth v.

The jurors spent approximately ten minutes at the party. While there, each consumed an alcoholic beverage, and one unsuccessfully attempted to make a phone call to his girlfriend. The jurors then exited through the window and were lowered back to their room. The incident occurred during an off-duty dinner hour, and did not take place during deliberations.</p>
    <p id="b695-7" data-blocks='[["BL_695.6",695,[201,1468,1154,627]]]'>Immediately after this incident, the court conducted a hearing to determine whether the actions of the two jurors had tainted the trial in any manner. Testimony was received from the two jurors and from all of the persons who had been at the party in the tenth-floor hotel room. The jurors, as well as the persons who had been at the party, testified that there had been no discussion of the case. Indeed, the jurors expressly told others at the party that they could not discuss the case. Based on this testimony, and the fact that the incident did not occur during the course of deliberations, the court found that no prejudice arose. We agree.</p>

Very late one night, when the jurors were in their hotel rooms, the two jurors in question illicitly procured eight full cans of beer. One of them consumed beer from <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>four of these cans and the other consumed beer from two, after which one began playfully throwing empty beer cans at the other. The latter, in self-defense, deflected one of the cans. It bounced out of an open ninth-floor window and fell to the sidewalk below. A passerby on the sidewalk reported the incident. Within a short time the hotel manager, security guards, and police converged upon the ninth floor in an effort to arrest the persons responsible. Jostling matches erupted and profanities were exchanged by those involved. The court was contacted, and, after it rendered assurances that the matter would be remedied the following day, the police and security guards withdrew from the scene.</p>
    <p id="b696-5" data-blocks='[["BL_696.4",696,[234,1030,1163,950]]]'>The court conducted a corrective <em>voir dire </em>on the morning after this , incident.

Three other jurors testified that they saw the incident but that their observations had not prejudiced or biased them in any way. Further, the two jurors who were directly involved in the incident were rigorously questioned <em>in camera </em>as well as in open court and testified that the incident had not, to any extent, impaired their ability to proceed with a fair and impartial trial. It is indeed logical that the incident would have had no prejudicial effect on appellant’s case, since appellant had absolutely no connection with the incident.

Based upon Williams’ testimony regarding his confrontations with Wright and Givens on the day before the crime, there is clear support in the record for an inference that the crime was committed as an act of retaliation.

Appellant was the first one to enter the Project courtyard. He told a bystander, “This is not meant for you. Move.” He then immediately drew his gun and began shooting. Based upon this evidence, it is reasonable to infer that appellant was not a mere follower, but rather, that he was acting in a leadership role.

This was a matter that, without any assistance from the prosecution, Williams could himself have brought to the sentencing court’s attention. The mere promise to tell the court of Williams’ cooperation cannot be construed as a “deal” that would necessitate disclosure, let alone require that Williams’ testimony be stricken.

Appellant cites Pa.R.Crim.P. 305(B)(1)(c) as the specific provision requiring disclosure. However, this provision deals only with disclosure of a defendant’s prior criminal record, and, thus, is patently inapplicable. In Pa.R.Crim.P. 305(B)(1)(e), there is a requirement that “reports of polygraph examinations or other physical or mental examinations <em>of the defendant </em>” (emphasis added) be disclosed.

In discussing the penalty to be imposed, the prosecutor posed a rhetorical question to the jury, namely, “Will you get soft in the heart?” In asking the jury to find that aggravating circumstances were established by the evidence, the prosecutor stated, “I am asking you to do what you are duty-bound to do.” Finally, in apparent response to certain defense arguments that were designed to evoke pity from the jury, the prosecutor remarked, “I mean, are we into this new morality now or are we into ‘I’m going to make you feel sorry for doing what you got to do?’ ” None of these comments were of a highly inflammatory nature, and all were within the bounds of oratorical flair accorded a prosecutor during his summation in the penalty phase of trial.

The facts of this case, as heretofore described, clearly establish that appellant created a risk of death to others by firing a gun into the crowded courtyard, as is evidenced by his resulting convictions for six counts of aggravated assault. The record clearly establishes too that appellant had a prior conviction for murder in the first degree, such conviction having taken place in January of 1983 as a result of a killing committed in 1981.

Defense counsel did, however, argue to the jury that appellant’s age should be considered as a mitigating factor, but an objection was sustained when he expressed his belief that at the time of the offense appellant was nineteen years of age.

This claim is groundless. The record establishes that the jury was instructed only that evidence “relevant to” such an aggravating circumstance was introduced. To <em>no </em>extent was the jury instructed that the aggravating circumstance was proven. The court clearly informed the jury that its duty was to determine whether proof of the aggravating circumstance was established.</p>

This claim too is meritless. The . actual instruction given by the court was that the mitigating circumstance <em>as to which evidence was presented </em>was that of age. This instruction was certainly not prejudicial to appellant, since there had not in fact been evidence introduced as to <em>any </em>other mitigating circumstance. The court further instructed that, with reference to the factor of age, “[i]t would appear in intellectual honesty that there was little evidence, if any, presented at the hearing.” Again, the instruction accurately reflected the evidence, for there was not any evidence establishing appellant’s age at the time of the crime. The court nevertheless told the jurors to determine whether age was a mitigating factor, and told them it was permissible to form an opinion regarding appellant’s age on the basis of his behavior and physical appearance. At no point did the court state that the <em>only </em>mitigating factor that could be considered was age; hence, there is no basis for appellant’s assertion that “[a]ny other evidence of mitigation,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8), which was listed on the verdict slip as a possible mitigating circumstance, was foreclosed from consideration.</p>

Specifically, it is asserted that appellant’s mother could have been called as a witness to establish that appellant was nineteen years of age when he committed the present murders. While it is true that the record contains no evidence establishing appellant’s <em>exact </em>age at the time of the offense, there was testimony that appellant was youthful. A witness testified that appellant was too young to be served alcoholic beverages in a bar and that he was merely a “little boy.” While it was certainly dubious to characterize as a “little boy” a nineteen year-old male who, in 1981, had committed murder in the first degree, the fact that appellant was rather youthful was nevertheless fully brought to the jury’s attention. Also, the jury had observed appellant during this very lengthy trial, thereby obtaining firsthand a perception of his age. Significantly, too, the age of nineteen years is hardly so young as to provide counsel with a compelling reason to bring that exact age to the jury’s attention. As earlier discussed, counsel did argue youth as a mitigating factor, and the court instructed the jury accordingly. Under these circumstances, no prejudice could have arisen from the failure to establish appellant’s <em>exact </em>age.</p>

The record supplies grounds to infer, however, that appellant is referring to witnesses who could have provided limited testimony as to his character as a youth. However, counsel testified at an evidentiary hearing on ineffectiveness that the witnesses failed to make known their willingness to testify at the time of trial. Counsel further testified that, if character witnesses had been utilized, the prosecution on cross-examination or rebuttal would have introduced some very damag<a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>ing evidence of appellant’s bad character. Substantial evidence of appellant’s bad character was known by counsel to be in the hands of the prosecution. Counsel very reasonably decided to avoid the introduction of such evidence.

Examination of the record reveals, however, that counsel did argue for imposition of a life sentence. His primary argument was that appellant’s age should be regarded as a mitigating factor. Appellant contends that, in addition to this argument, there were a “myriad of arguments” that should have been presented. Again, this vaguely worded claim provides little basis for our review, since appellant has given virtually no indication of what such arguments might have been. The only one that has been specified is that counsel should have explained to the jury that life in prison is different from life outside prison, thereby emphasizing that a sentence of life imprisonment is a harsh sentence. However, the fact that life in prison is different from life outside prison is so inherently obvious that it is inconceivable that the jury would have needed to be so informed. Further, the closing argument given by counsel for one of the codefendants in this trial stressed that life imprisonment is indeed a harsh penalty. The jury was certainly cognizant, therefore, of the nature of such a penalty.</p>

It may be noted that, if a new trial were to be granted in this case, appellant would not be entitled to an instruction on "unreasonable belief’ manslaughter, though at the time of appellant’s trial such an <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>instruction was proper. See <em>Commonwealth v.

In addition to the issues raised by appellant's counsel, we have reviewed the issues presented in appellant’s <em>pro se </em>"addendum brief nunc pro tunc” and “reply brief nunc pro tunc.” Nearly all of the issues raised <em>pro se </em>have already been addressed, since they are mere repetitions of matters raised by counsel. The remainder are clearly lacking in merit. Of these, only a few warrant even brief discussion.</p>
      <p id="b717-6" data-blocks='[["BL_717.5",717,[281,797,1121,461]]]'>Appellant claims that it was error for the court, during its charge to the jury, to read from a portion of the bill of information alleging that “the named defendant, one of the three, did feloniously kill and slay [the victim]." Appellant asserts that, by reading this bill of information to the jury, the court effectively directed that appellant be found guilty. Such an assertion is groundless. To no extent did the court express an opinion as to the proper verdict. In fact, the court clearly instructed the jury that the bills of information were "merely formal written accusations” and that “the mere fact that the defendants in this case have been arrested and stand accused of criminal acts is in no way, shape, or form, quantitatively or qualitatively, to constitute any evidence against them.”</p>
      <p id="b717-7" data-blocks='[["BL_717.6",717,[281,1261,1119,231]]]'>Next, appellant challenges the court’s charge on transferred intent, alleging that the charge was lacking in clarity and that it should not have informed the jury that the principle of transferred intent "might be applicable to the case.” We have examined the charge and find no deficiency. Upon the facts presented, such an instruction was eminently proper.</p>
      <p id="b717-8" data-blocks='[["BL_717.7",717,[281,1495,1120,462]]]'>Appellant also claims unfair surprise from the prosecution’s use of a certain rebuttal witness. The witness was the eleven-year-old sister of the child who was killed in the shooting incident. She testified that she was present when the shootings occurred and that she saw appellant firing a gun. Her testimony was merely cumulative, however, for numerous other witnesses had already testified to appellant’s participation in the shootings. The witness never told police of her observations, and, likewise, never told the prosecution of what she had seen until the day that she testified. Clearly, the prosecution cannot be faulted for failing to disclose her availability as a witness in advance, since it was not known that she could testify to any relevant matter. See <em>Commonwealth v. Colson, </em><a href="/pa/507/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="507 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1792370" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0440-01">507 Pa. at 462</a>, <a href="/pa/507/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="507 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1792370" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0440-01">490 A.2d at 822</a>.</p>

However, because the hearing on ineffectiveness was conducted four years after trial, trial counsel’s recollection of the case was extremely weak. The hearing was adjourned so that counsel would have a month to review the case. Subsequently, counsel’s recollection remained poor, and counsel repeatedly testified that he did not remember details of the case. There is no reason to believe that, if a further continuance had been obtained, trial counsel would <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>have provided any testimony supportive of appellant’s claim. While appellant would have preferred that counsel testify in depth as to all of the ineffectiveness claims, he has not alleged any specific testimony that would likely have been elicited to advance his claims. We find no indication that appellant was prejudiced by the decision of post-trial motions counsel not to seek further testimony.</p>

    <p id="b718-9" data-blocks='[["BL_718.10",718,[246,1000,1161,526]]]'>I agree with the majority that under the facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court did not foreclose the jury from considering mitigation pursuant to Section 9711(e)(8). This possible mitigating circumstance was listed on the verdict form, and the trial court properly limited its instructions to mitigating circumstances as to which some evidence was presented. As there was no evidence of record to support mitigating circumstance 9711(e)(8), the trial court was not obligated to specifically instruct the jury as to this mitigating circumstance.</p>

As the jury is entitled to consider any evidence “of record” from whatever source derived, the duty of the trial court to instruct the jury on this mitigating circumstance was not solely contingent upon the lack of evidence <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>introduced by Jones, but also upon the lack of evidence from other potential sources.</p>
