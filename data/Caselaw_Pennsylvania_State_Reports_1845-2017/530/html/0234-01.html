In concluding that the procedure utilized by the trial judge was not defective, the majority relies upon <em>Commonwealth v. Frey, </em><a href="/pa/520/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="520 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1815634" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0338-01">520 Pa. 338</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="520 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1815634" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0338-01">554 A.2d 27</a> (1989). <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>However, on February 1, 1989, this Court adopted a rule, effective July 1, 1989, requiring a trial judge in a capital case to furnish to a jury a verdict slip listing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances which the trial judge determined was supported by some evidence. Pa.R.Crim.P. 357. Since appellant’s trial was conducted on June 22,1990, the trial court was required to comply with Rule 357. Clearly then, the trial court erred.</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[258,738,1163,689]]]'>Notwithstanding the trial court’s error, I must join the majority because the trial court error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Story, </em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">476 Pa. 391</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">383 A.2d 155</a> (1978). In this instance, the jury determined that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstances. Even though we do not know how many mitigating circumstances the jury found, the verdict may still be upheld. Assuming for the sake of argument that the jury determined that the evidence supported a finding of both mitigating circumstances, our proportionality review supports the sentence of death. Accordingly, in this instance, the alleged error is harmless. Therefore, for this reason, I join the majority opinion.</p>

Admittedly, it was within the discretion of the trial court whether to poll the jurors concerning the potentially prejudicial newspaper article published during the trial. However, the better practice would have been for the trial court to poll the jury in an innocuous manner directly after the newspaper article was brought to its attention. This would have resolved the question of potential prejudice immediately. Thus, it would have prevented the need for further attention by the trial court and counsel, as well as the need for this Court to dwell upon the question of whether the contents of the newspaper article were consistent with Crispell’s testimony at trial.</p>
