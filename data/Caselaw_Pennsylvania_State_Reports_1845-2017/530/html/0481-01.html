If certain conduct of judges and other <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>public officials is serious enough to warrant a surrendering of pension, it shall be enumerated explicitly in the Pension Forfeiture Act.

First, it must be underscored that Section 16(a) derives from the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1790, and has a well-marked history nearly as old as this Commonwealth. <em>See, </em>n. 15, above.

Section 16(a) is a <em>positive </em>provision, which assures an adequate compensation established by the legislature, and prevents that compensation from being diminished while a judge is in office. Section 16(b) is a <em>negative </em>provision, at least in the third sentence applicable herein, and strips away remuneration otherwise owing a justice, judge or justice of the peace as a punitive measure.

Because we concluded that Article V, Section 16(b) of the Constitution is silent as to the issue of pension forfeitures, it naturally follows that the majority had no reason to address the separate issue of when pension benefits might cease with respect to the Appellants or any other public officials removed from office.

For the reasons that follow, I would conclude that Article Y, § 16(b) of our Constitution, given its intended effect, <em>allows for the termination of a judge’s prospective pension benefits effective the date, as determined by the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, the jurist committed the act of misconduct while in office which was the predicate for removal.</em>

Section 16(b) also states that “[fjormer and retired justices, judges, and justices of the peace shall receive <em>such compensation as shall be provided by law." </em>Pa. Const. Art. V, § 16(b), (emphasis added). The only compensation to which a former or retired judge is <em>entitled </em>after he or she retires or leaves office is the accrued retirement benefits resulting from service as an active judge. Any additional compensation obtained from service as a senior judge is not included since that retired or former judge does not have a right to serve in senior service, but rather serves only at the pleasure of this Court. Additionally, the compensation received by senior judges does not accrue from service rendered as an active judge, but rather from the services rendered as a senior judge. Section 16(c) allows only former or retired justices or judges to be assigned to “temporary judicial service.” Pa. Const. Art. V, § 16(c). Despite their explicit inclusion in Section 16(b), justices of the peace are <em>not </em>eligible for temporary judicial assignments under Section 16(c). The “compensation” referred to in Section 16(b) for former or retired justices or judges may include remuneration for temporary judicial assignments, but it must also include retirement and pension plans, because justices of the peace are not authorized to perform temporary judicial <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>service. Thus, to hold that “compensation” does not include one’s retirement or pension contribution would contradict Section 16(b)’s mandate that former and retired justices of the peace receive “such compensation <em>as shall be provided by law.” </em>Pa. Const. Art. Y, § 16(b) (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[234,599,1165,1219]]]'>While I believe that Section 16 <em>itself </em>operates to define “compensation” to include pension benefits, an analysis of other constitutional provisions also supports such an interpretation. Preliminarily, it should be noted that the Constitution grants certain powers and outlines a specified procedure, in general, to deal with the disciplining of judges. First, the Constitution creates a Judicial Inquiry and Review Board (J.I.R.B.), Pa. Const. Art. V, § 18(a), and empowers it to investigate those jurists who have been charged with misconduct, Pa. Const. Art. V, § 18(d). Once the J.I.R.B. investigation warrants an appropriate punishment, the Board is authorized to recommend to this Court “the suspension, removal, discipline, or compulsory retirement of the justice or judge.” Pa. Const. Art. V, § 18(g). The last remaining phase of the process, is for this Court to implement the recommendations of the J.I.R.B., implement any of the enumerated sanctions that are “just and proper”, or reject the recommendations wholly. Pa. Const. Art. V, § 18(h). However, should an order for suspension from office or removal be issued, “the justice or judge shall be suspended or removed from office and his <em>salary shall cease </em>from the date of such order.” Pa. Const. Art. V, § 18(h) (emphasis added).</p>

The explicit reference to the term “salary” in Section 18(h) further reassures us that the term “compensation” as used in Section 16(b) was intended to have a separate and distinct meaning. This deliberate reference to the term “salary” in Section 18(h) above, unquestionably <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>demonstrates that the drafters of the Constitution were well aware of the differences in meaning between “salary” and “compensation.” Their selective use of the two words thus, was intentional, rather than inadvertent and we are bound to effectuate and oblige such intent. <em>See, Commonwealth ex rel. Paulinski v. Isaac, <a href="/pa/483/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="483 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1751157" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0467-01">supra;</a> Commonwealth v.

Clearly an employee is entitled to collect a wage while continuing employment; however, no entitlement exists on behalf of a removed or suspended jurist to collect pension benefits, an emolument of office provided in exchange for faithful service, once he engages in misconduct. If the term “compensation” in Section 16(b) were intended to refer to salary only, Section 18(h) would be redundant. Clearly, the framers did not intend such a result as they understood that the two terms were not interchangeable.</p>

Article V, Section 16(a) referring to the “compensation” of judges, states in relevant part: “[Tjheir compensation shall not be diminished during their terms in office, unless by law applying generally to all salaried officers of the Commonwealth.” Pa. Const. Art. V, § 16(a). If compensation merely refers to salary, then Section 16(a) solely protects against the diminution of salaries and leaves open the possibility for a future reduction in a jurist’s overall benefits. Such an occurrence could legitimately occur under the latter interpretation.</p>

Thus, it had already been determined and firmly established almost forty years ago by this Court that “compensation” included retirement benefits. At the time of the 1967-68 Constitutional Convention therefore, when the provisions of Section 16 were being drafted, the term “compensation” had previously been employed with reference to retirement benefits. Accordingly, any assertion that the term “compensation”, as intended and employed in Section 16(b), is ambiguous cannot be plausible as it clearly disregards the historical and common understanding and usage of the term.</p>
