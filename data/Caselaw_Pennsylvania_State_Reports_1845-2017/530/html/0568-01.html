McCracken was ferrying a passenger, Billy James Tincher, who was an employee of Phillips and Jordan, Inc., the owner of the helicopter, manufactured and sold by Hughes Helicopter, Inc., a division of the appellant, Summa Corporation. Hughes had incorporated an engine manufactured by the Avco Corporation into the helicopter. Both McCracken and Tincher lost their lives when the engine in the helicopter seized in mid-flight, causing the aircraft to crash. A subsequent investigation revealed that the accident had <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>occurred due to the failure of an oil pump which was a component of the engine manufactured by Avco.</p>

    <p id="b679-5" data-blocks='[["BL_679.5",679,[240,1174,1154,468]]]'>The Superior Court’s analysis in this case was a valiant and erudite effort to apply the principles the majority appeared to support in <em>Charles. </em>Even though the <em>Charles </em>majority emphasized that the responsibility of the settling tortfeasor should be defined by the terms of the settlement agreement, it quickly abandoned that principle at this first opportunity to address the issue when the unambiguous terms of the agreement would permit a settling tortfeasor to seek contribution from the non-settling tortfeasor.</p>
    <p id="b679-6" data-blocks='[["BL_679.6",679,[238,1661,1156,511]]]'>As I stated in my dissenting opinion, however, the majority in <em>Charles </em>rewrote the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act so as to render it meaningless and obliterated the legislated right of contribution which exists among joint tortfeasors. The examples that I used to demonstrate the consequences of the <em>Charles </em>majority’s analysis portended the harsh result that the majority now seeks to justify. Notably, the examples showed that in not one of the cases would the settling tortfeasor have a right to contribution.</p>

A right to contribution will never be upheld in a case involving a settlement <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>by one of the joint tortfeasors. Despite the explicit terms of the release agreed to by the Walton plaintiffs, no right to contribution can be enforced.</p>
    <p id="b680-4" data-blocks='[["BL_680.4",680,[245,472,1160,582]]]'>In perpetuating the analytical error made in <em>Charles, </em>the majority hides behind its “commitment to promoting the policies that fueled its decision” in that case. The majority stands by the policy of encouraging settlements, as if settlements would be discouraged by requiring plaintiffs to live up to their part of the bargain. In exchange for the payment of $922,355.00, the Walton plaintiffs agreed the claim against a non-settling tortfeasor would be reduced by the greater of (a) the amount of the consideration paid; or (b) the amount determined by the sum of the pro rata share of legal responsibility for which Avco was held liable.</p>
    <p id="b680-5" data-blocks='[["BL_680.5",680,[242,1077,1159,258]]]'>I would enforce the terms of the release and indemnity agreement. Avco satisfied its obligation to pay the stated consideration for the release. So, too, should the Walton plaintiffs satisfy their obligation. I find that to be a social policy equally worth promoting.</p>
