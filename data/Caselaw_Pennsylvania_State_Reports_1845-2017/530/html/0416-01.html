Despite Justice McDermott’s protestations that our holding today creates a roadblock in the resolution of the pressing problem of underage drinking, the burden placed upon the Commonwealth is minimal indeed. In this case, the beverage was not bottled. It was drawn from a keg and served in glasses to the investigators. The Commonwealth need only have preserved the evidence that its agents obtained or introduced evidence that demonstrated that the beverage served was identified as a beverage that contains the requisite percentage of alcohol by volume. We require no less in prosecutions for the possession or sale of drugs, even though an experienced police officer may be able to testify that the confiscated substance is in fact an illegal drug. Surely illegal drugs are no less a pressing problem than underage drinking.</p>

The fraternities had a beer party to which they admitted minors. The minors requested and were furnished what they believed to be beer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> By serving the beer to the minors, the fraternities violated the General Assembly’s ban. It is that simple.</p>

Because of its resolution of the sufficiency of the evidence question in favor of appellants, the majority did not address appellants’ second question, i.e., whether the investigators’ entry into the fraternities was illegal, thereby necessitating a suppression of evidence. Regarding this issue the suppression court found that the circumstances surrounding the officers entry into the fraternities were such that the fraternities could not have entertained a legitimate expectation of privacy. With this conclusion I agree.</p>

The undercover officers in this case and some of the minors who were served testified that what they were served, looked, smelled and tasted like beer. At some point in this process, a jury should be allowed to conclude that if something walks like a duck, sounds like a duck, flies like a duck, and swims like a duck, then it is a duck, without having an ornithologist explain to it the biological intricacies that qualify a certain species of winged fowl as a duck.</p>
