Urban, purchased real property in Barry Township from the Tax Claim Bureau of Schuylkill County. When the appellees surveyed the property in 1976, stakes were placed upon eleven (11) acres of ground that appellant, Mable Hepler, claims had been continuously owned, occupied and farmed by her since she succeeded to ownership of the property in 1947, and by preceding generations of her family since her grandfather acquired the property in the 1800s. When it became clear in 1978 that the boundary dispute could not be settled out of court, appellant instituted the within action to quiet title in <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County. There were two attorneys of record representing appellant, Attorney Kehler and Attorney Watkins. Appellee Anthony Urban, as an attorney, proceeded pro se.</p>
    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[258,527,1164,702]]]'>On May 4, 1979, following a failed attempt to have the case disposed of on the pleadings, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment which they have alleged was served upon Attorney Kehler. This attorney was allegedly in poor health and subsequently spent the month of June, 1979, in the hospital. The matter was listed for argument on July 23,1979.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At the call of the argument list on July 16, 1979, appellees presented a motion for judgment pro forma seeking the grant of their motion for summary judgment on the ground that appellant had not filed a brief in response to their motion for summary judgment as required by local rule. Appellees have alleged that their motion for judgment pro forma was served upon Attorney Kehler.</p>
    <p id="b468-6" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[256,1258,1161,265]]]'>Without considering the merits of appellees’ motion for summary judgment, the trial court granted the motion and dismissed appellant’s complaint with prejudice.

    <p id="b468-7" data-blocks='[["BL_468.6",468,[248,1551,1165,586]]]'>On January 14, 1980, Attorney Watkins filed a petition to strike or open judgment on behalf of appellant. This petition was granted following a hearing during which witnesses testified as to the merits of appellant’s quiet title claim. The trial court found that appellant’s petition had been promptly filed and that a meritorious defense could be shown. Moreover, the trial court excused appellant’s failure to respond and appear on the ground that the record did not show the required notice to have been given to her <em>prior </em>to the entry of the order granting appellees’ motion for summary judgment.</p>

      <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>Appellees filed an appeal to Superior Court which reversed, finding that the summary judgment order had become final thirty days after it had been entered and thus, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to strike the summary judgment. Additionally, Superior Court determined that lack of notice that summary judgment proceedings were pending prior to the entry of summary judgment would not justify opening or striking a final judgment in the absence of evidence of fraud.</p>
    <p id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[222,812,1154,782]]]'>This Court granted appellant’s first petition for allowance of appeal and reversed the order of the Superior Court. <em>Hepler v.

We determined that the order granting appellees’ motion for summary judgment was not a final order because there was no indication in the docket that notice of the entry of the order had been sent to appellant pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. Rule 236, Pa.R.A.P. Rules 108(b) and 301(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> We further noted in dicta that if, as alleged by appellant, she did not receive notice of the pending summary judgment proceedings prior to the entry of summary judgment, it would “be an extraordinary miscarriage of justice to permit the order to stand even if it had become final.” <a href="/pa/518/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="518 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1811559" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0482-01">518 Pa. at 485</a>, <a href="/pa/518/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="518 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1811559" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0482-01">544 A.2d at 923-24</a>.

The deputy prothonotary testified at this hearing that (1) there was no notation in the docket that notice had been sent to appellant or her attorneys of record that <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>the order granting appellees’ motion for summary judgment had been entered, but that (2) the letters “N.S.” which appear on the blueback attached to the trial court’s order mean that notice was sent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Contrary to the assertions of the trial court, there was no testimony taken at this hearing regarding whether appellant had been notified of the pending summary judgment proceedings prior to the entry of summary judgment. Opinion of the Court at 2 (Aug. 17, 1989). On the basis of the deputy prothonotary’s statement that “N.S.” meant that notice was sent, the trial court determined that it was error for summary judgment to have been stricken in the case. Appellant filed an appeal to Superior Court which affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[226,1027,1164,777]]]'>We granted appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal, and we now reverse. It is beyond question that a notation on a blueback is <em>not </em>a “notation in the <em>docket </em>that notice of entry of the order has been given.” Pa.R.A.P. Rule 108(b) (emphasis added). The docket is <em>not </em>the accumulation of papers filed in a case. The docket is the book which contains brief entries or descriptions regarding each paper that is filed or action that is taken in a case. Black’s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.) The docket herein did not contain a notation that notice of the entry of summary judgment had been sent to appellant or to her attorneys of record. This Court made such determination in 1988, and it was not subject to review by the trial court. Thus, it was unnecessary for the trial court to take testimony on this issue when we remanded the case.</p>

The allegations of record, however, support appellant’s contention and the initial determination of the trial court that she did not receive notice prior to the entry of summary judgment against her. Notice was given <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>to only one of her attorneys of record who appears to have become inactive in the case well before the motion for summary judgment was filed. Moreover, this attorney was in poor health during the relevant time period. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that appellant’s failure to appear could be excused.</p>
    <p id="b471-4" data-blocks='[["BL_471.4",471,[212,657,1155,523]]]'>This litigation is fourteen years old. The appellant is an 85 year old widow who stands to lose a large portion of her real property without ever having had a determination on the merits of her quiet title action. In the interests of justice, we will not remand the case for a hearing on whether appellant was properly notified prior to the entry of summary judgment. Rather, we remand the case to the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County for proceedings <em>on the merits of appellant’s claims </em>in her quiet title action.</p>
