(hereinafter “McKeesport”), was given the exclusive right, as a licensed importing distributor, to distribute All Brand’s products in Westmoreland, Greene, Washington and Fayette Counties in their entirety, and in a portion of Allegheny County. On sixteen different occasions in 1985, McKeesport sold All Brand’s products outside the geographical area for which McKeesport had been given exclusive distributing rights. This conduct was a violation of the agreement between the parties and constituted illegal conduct under the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. § 4-431(b), for which violation McKeesport was cited and fined.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The November 6 letter was sent by certified mail and notified McKeesport that its distributing rights agreement would be terminated for good cause within ninety days, on the basis of McKeesport’s Liquor Code violations. On January 30, 1986, McKeesport filed an action in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, seeking to enjoin the termination of its distributing rights under its agreement with All Brand. Following a hearing in the matter, McKeesport’s request for injunctive relief was denied. McKeesport filed an appeal to the Superior Court which reversed and remanded for further proceedings. <em>McKeesport Beer Distributors, Inc. v.

All Brand argues that the Legislature’s use of the disjunctive “or” regarding an importing distributor’s options when faced with a termination notice must be interpreted as permitting rectification of a claimed deficiency <em>or </em>challenge of the alleged cause, but not rectification of <em>both </em>a claimed deficiency and alleged cause. Thus, All Brand urges this Court to find that the only remedy <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>McKeesport had when faced with a notice of termination for good cause was to “challenge the alleged cause” within ninety days. Because McKeesport admitted that it had sold All Brand’s products outside its assigned geographical area and, thus, did not challenge the cause alleged by All Brand, All Brand argues that it is entitled to terminate its distributing rights agreement with McKeesport. We agree.</p>
    <p id="b345-4" data-blocks='[["BL_345.4",345,[193,686,1154,467]]]'>Clearly, the Legislature was setting forth two classes of conduct in utilizing the distinct terms “deficiency” and “good cause” in section 4-492(19) of the Liquor Code. “Deficiency” is not defined in the Liquor Code; in common usage and understanding, however, a deficiency is something that is insufficient or lacking in some respect. Under the plain language of section 4-492(19) of the Liquor Code, a deficiency is conduct or a condition that <em>can </em>be rectified. “Good cause” is defined in the Liquor Code as:</p>
    <blockquote id="Ael" data-blocks='[["BL_345.5",345,[235,1168,1110,255]]]'>the <em>failure </em>by any party to an agreement, without reasonable excuse or justification, <em>to comply </em>substantially <em>with an essential, </em>reasonable and commercially acceptable <em>requirement </em>imposed by the other party under the terms of an agreement.</blockquote>

Unlike such rectifiable deficiencies as inadequate warehousing, insufficient advertising and sales, tardy deliveries or rude salespersons, McKeesport’s violation of the Liquor Code could <em>not </em>be rectified by any subsequent action on the part of McKeesport to prevent further sales of All <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>Brand’s products outside McKeesport’s exclusive geographical area of distribution.
