Appellant argues that the existence of an agreement pursuant to which the original defendants would be partially reimbursed if Talin is found liable lends a bias to the original defendants’ interest in the case which is contrary to what would be perceived as their “normal” interest. Specifically, the additional defendant is arguing that the original defendants are no longer interested in defeating plaintiff’s claim; rather they are interested in actually fostering plaintiff’s case. Thus, instead of the defendants being allies against the plaintiff, the plaintiff and the original defendants are now allied against the additional defendant; and it is appellant’s position that such information should be conveyed to the jury.</p>

    <p id="b652-4" data-blocks='[["BL_652.4",652,[209,744,1162,641]]]'>A “settlement” has been defined as “an agreement by which parties having disputed matters between them reach or ascertain what is coming from one to the other ..., to fix or resolve conclusively; to make or arrange for final disposition.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1372 (6th ed. 1990). This Agreement, when viewed in its entirety, can hardly be described as a conclusive resolution or final disposition of the disputed matters between the plaintiffs and the original defendants. Rather, it is merely the first act in a two-act play, and matters between them will not be conclusively resolved or finally disposed until the final curtain has come down.</p>
    <p id="b652-5" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[206,1459,1161,419]]]'>We recognize that the drafters of the Agreement entitled it “Settlement Agreement and Release”: however, calling a thing something does not make it so. <em>See Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Co. v.

The inclusion of the reimbursement provisions in the Agreement certainly renders this instrument distinct from the type of agreements referred to in the statute because it changes the nature of the Agreement from a final resolution of matters between the parties to an ongoing relationship, thereby implicitly joining nominal adversaries in an alliance against the remaining defendant.

The credibility of a witness may be tested by evidence which tends to show that the witness had an interest in the outcome of the trial, that the witness’ testimony may be untruthful or that the witness may possess a bias which colors his testimony. <em>Commonwealth v. Butler, </em><a href="/pa/529/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="601 A.2d 268" data-case-ids="1831191" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0007-01">601 A.2d 268</a> (1991); <em>Grutski v.

In <em>Davis, </em>the defendant sought to impeach the credibility of a crucial prosecution witness by showing that his probationary status as a juvenile delinquent might subject him to undue pressure from the police with respect to his testimony. The prosecution sought a protective order to prevent any reference to the witness’ juvenile record. The <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>Supreme Court of the United States held that the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation of witnesses requires that the defendant be permitted to impeach the credibility of the prosecution witness by cross-examination directed at possible bias which resulted from the witness’ probationary status as a juvenile delinquent notwithstanding that such impeachment would conflict with the state’s interest in preserving the confidentiality of juvenile delinquents.</p>
    <p id="b656-4" data-blocks='[["BL_656.4",656,[237,731,1164,792]]]'>Just as the Supreme Court of the United States employed a balancing test to determine that the right of confrontation is paramount to the State’s policy of protecting a juvenile offender, so too must we balance the competing interests at play in this case. It is my view that the danger inherent in not allowing Talin to impeach the credibility of the original defendants by introducing the Agreement in evidence during cross-examination outweighs the administrative policy of encouraging settlements. By allowing Talin the opportunity to show that the original defendants stand to gain $50,000.00 if the Hatfields are successful in their suit against Talin, the jurors will be afforded a basis for determining whether the original defendants’ testimony is credible or biased. Such determination is necessary to ensure a fair and just trial.</p>

The settlement amount is not relevant to the issue of the credibility of the original defendants. The original defendants will not gain or lose anything with respect to the settlement amount regardless of how they testify at the trial. Introducing the dollar settlement amount could serve to unduly influence the jury and usurp their function, which is to independently <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>determine the amount of damages in the event that they find Talin liable to the Hatfields, based solely upon the facts in evidence.</p>
