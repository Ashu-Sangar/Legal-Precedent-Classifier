The government’s theory was that the salt was the property of an enemy (the original owner) and not an American because the contract of sale provided that the salt was to be paid for only after the American army arrived in Philadelphia, and then only on the condition that the salt was not destroyed. This meant, according to the government, that the salt was still the property of a British national when American troops arrived and that it was, therefore, forfeit. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania tried the case to a jury, which held for the owner of the salt.

As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit points out, the distinction between the practice in courts of Admiralty, which heard forfeiture actions without a jury, and the common law courts of Exchequer, in which forfeiture actions were heard with a jury, was well-known. Equally well-known was Parliament’s attempt to extend Admiralty’s jurisdiction in the colonies so as to reduce the number of jury trials in forfeitures. The reason for this statutory extension of jurisdiction of the Admiralty courts was that American juries were reluctant to find in favor of the crown in forfeiture cases.

    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[244,460,1152,418]]]'>The Court in <em>Bowers </em>was addressing the issue of forfeiture used in illegal alcohol distribution. The case is analogous to the case at bar in that the statute there was also directed towards the seizure of non-contraband items based on their alleged relationship to the contraband itself. Under the then extant forfeiture statute no jury trial was prescribed. The Court in addressing the question ruled thusly:</p>
    <blockquote id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[286,891,1110,254]]]'>“A jury trial can only be demanded where there is a disputed question of fact.

Thus, this Court has already ruled that a forfeiture proceeding can go forward without a jury, and the majority’s historical analysis is not sufficiently compelling to convince me that a jury trial is constitutionally required in all cases, especially since such a conclusion necessarily requires an overruling of longstanding precedent in this area.</p>
