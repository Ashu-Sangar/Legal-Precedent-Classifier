Manix (Mr. Ma-nix) was a part owner and manager of the Lancaster Battery Company, Inc. Appellant Lancaster Battery Company, Inc.

The manufacturing process involved extensive employee exposure to lead dust and fumes. Federal safety regulations require that employees in such working environments be tested on a regular basis for lead content in their blood. Appellee Joseph H. Martin, Sr. (Mr. Martin) was employed by LBC, and his blood was tested along with the other employees of LBC who were exposed to lead. Mr. Manix, who oversaw and administered the blood testing at LBC, willfully and intentionally withheld from Mr. Martin the results of Mr. Martin’s blood tests between January 1, 1982, and July, 1985. In addition, Mr. Manix intentionally altered blood test results before forwarding the results to Mr. Martin. Subsequently, Mr. Martin was diagnosed with chronic lead toxicity, lead neuropathy, hypertension, gout, and renal insufficiency. The severity of his condition would have been substantially reduced if his employer had not perpetrated a delay by failing to accurately report the elevated levels of lead in Mr. Martin’s blood.</p>

The Superior Court determined that the cases cited by the trial court to support its decision regarding the exclusivity issue were not applicable herein and found that the act of withholding blood test results from Mr. Martin thereby concealing his injury from him was not covered by the exclusivity provision of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. Thus, the Superior Court held that the appellees’ claim of alleged fraudulent misrepresentation was actionable at common law. Superior Court further determined that the appellees had pleaded facts sufficient to support an action for fraudulent misrepresentation.

In the case sub judice, it has been alleged that the fraudulent misrepresentation was made directly to the employee. Moreover, <em>Poyser </em>did not involve a claim for the <em>aggravation </em>of a work-related injury as is the case herein.</p>

He was tested by his employer to monitor the level of lead in his blood. His employer willfully and intentionally withheld the test results from him or gave altered blood test results to him. According to an attachment to the appellees’ complaint, the company policy was to closely monitor lead levels in employees’ blood and to report the results to the employees so that those with elevated levels of lead in their blood could transfer to non-lead areas at LBC. This course of action was not followed in Mr. Martin’s case. Had Mr. Martin been told about the elevated levels of lead in his blood when the tests first indicated such levels, he could have promptly reduced his exposure to lead and received timely and appropriate medical care. Consequently, the severity of his condition would have been substantially reduced.</p>

However, the. operative factor is not the intentions of the employer but whether the employee’s injury is “work-related”.

The exclusivity provision of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 481(a) states: “The liability of an employer under this act shall be exclusive and in place of <em>any and all </em>other liability to such employes----” (Emphasis added). This language could not be more clear and unambiguous in its limitation of employer liability. We have, until the present, consistently applied this provision in accordance with its plain meaning, thus limiting an employer’s liability in accordance with the legislature’s express mandate. <em>Poyser v. Newman &amp; Co., </em><a href="/pa/514/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="514 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1804606" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0032-01">514 Pa. 32</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="514 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1804606" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0032-01">522 A.2d 548</a> (1987) (even intentional wrongdoing by employers falls within the exclusivity provision of the Workmen’s Compensation Act). See also <em>Barber v.

The present case likewise falls clearly within the scope of immunity granted employers under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.
