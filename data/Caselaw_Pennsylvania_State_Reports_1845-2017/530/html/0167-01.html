Appellant’s wife was also an owner of this checking account and was named as Appellant’s co-conspirator in two instances. Following the entry of the guilty pleas and a pre-sentence investigation, Appellant was sentenced by the Honorable D. Richard Eckman, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, to a period of incarceration of one and one-half years to five years and was also sentenced to consecutive and concurrent terms of probation for seventeen years.

This view was adopted in a majority opinion authored by Judge Olszewski and joined by Judges Cirillo, Cavanaugh, Rowley, and Tamilia.
