The question is the meaning of the phrase “any elective office” in the third clause of the statute. The context of the phrase suggests that the most reasonable interpretation is “any elective office of any political party,” which is consistent with the thrust of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b475-7" data-blocks='[["BL_475.7",475,[227,1236,1157,1102]],["BL_476.1",476,[264,297,1157,148]]]'>The statute in question has an interesting history, set forth in detail in the Opinion in Support, of Affirmance in <em>Snyder v. Unemp. Comp. Bd. of Review, </em><a href="/pa/509/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="509 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1795297" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0438-01">509 Pa. 438</a>, <a href="/pa/509/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="509 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1795297" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0438-01">502 A.2d 1232</a> (1985). In 1977, by memorandum, this court prohibited partisan political activity by court personnel, including running for public office. In 1977, the legislature enacted the statute, then titled “court employees” rather than “constables,” applicable to employees of common pleas courts and district justices of the peace as well as constables. The 1985 case of <em>Snyder, <a href="/pa/509/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="509 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1795297" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0438-01">supra,</a> </em>held that the legislative attempt to authorize political activity by court employees was an unconstitutional infringement on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s exclusive constitutional mandate to administrate all courts and supervise all officers of the judicial branch. Following the <em>Snyder </em>decision, the legislature amended section 410 in 1989 to limit its effect to constables — eliminating reference to court employees — but did not change the operative language permitting partisan political activity. Thus the current language of section 410 developed, in a convoluted way, as a response to the original 1977 supreme court memorandum forbidding court em<a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>ployees from participating in partisan political activity such as “being committee-persons, working at the polls or running for public office.”</p>
    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[254,468,1168,1267]]]'>The activities listed in the 1977 memorandum as well as the activities specified in section 410 are, with one exception, uniform in being recognizably partisan political activities. The single exception occurs in the third clause of section 410, the language at issue in this case. If we interpret the third clause as suggested above — that constables may run for and hold any elective office <em>in a political party, </em>it has the effect of harmonizing the third clause with the remainder of section 410. It is reasonable to read the third clause of section 410 as permitting a constable to run for and hold any county, State, or national elective office in a political party, rather than any elective public office in government. <em>Ejusdem generis </em>expresses a rule of construction that a general expression used in a statute is limited to things similar to items specifically enumerated in the language preceding the general expression. <em>See, e.g., Summit House Condominium v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/514/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="514 Pa. 221" data-case-ids="1804496" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0221-01">514 Pa. 221</a>, 227, <a href="/pa/514/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="523 A.2d 333" data-case-ids="1804496,1804613" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0221-01,/pa/514/0220-01">523 A.2d 333</a>, 336 (1987); <em>Parker v. Hough, </em><a href="/pa/420/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="420 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="1898569" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0007-01">420 Pa. 7</a>, 13, <a href="/citations/?q=215%20A.2d%20667" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="215 A.2d 667">215 A.2d 667</a>, 670-71 (1966). This principle is applicable to the third clause of this statute, which is best understood as referring to elective offices <em>in political parties, </em>for the other three clauses specifically refer to partisan political activity. We believe this to be the most reasonable construction consistent with legislative intent.</p>

The first section of the statute, 65 P.S. § 401, states that its purpose is “to strengthen the faith and confidence of the people of the State in their government.” When section 410 was originally enacted, it purported to apply to all court employees; if we were to read the third clause of section 410 in isolation, it would have permitted the secretary of one magistrate to run for and hold a position as a magistrate in another district simultaneously. It would have permitted a magis<a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>trate to run for and hold the office of district attorney while retaining his position as magistrate, though this would violate 65 P.S. § 7. It would have permitted a constable to run for and hold the position of justice of the peace while retaining the office of constable, though this would violate 65 P.S. § 17. Such interpretations surely would not foster and sustain public confidence in the integrity of government. Moreover, such a reading of the third clause, in view of the preemption provision of section 412, would override the clearly expressed will of the people of the City of Coatesville, who made it plain in their home rule charter that it was impermissible for government officials to hold two offices simultaneously. This, again, would weaken, rather than nurture, public confidence in government.</p>
    <p id="b477-4" data-blocks='[["BL_477.4",477,[200,1108,1155,473]]]'>Therefore we interpret 65 P.S. § 410 to permit a constable to hold any elective office in a political party, not to hold any other governmental office. As 65 P.S. § 14, 53 P.S. § 36001, and section 203 of the Home Rule Charter of the City of Coatesville all prohibit a council member from simultaneously serving as a constable, the Commonwealth, rather than Mr. Legree, was entitled to judgment on the pleadings. We must reverse the order of the court of common pleas.</p>
