He and the store manager completed and signed a claim form which they stapled to the ticket. Lottery officials denied the claim because the ticket had been cut and security information printed on the ticket referred to computer files establishing that it was not a prize<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>winning ticket, and appellant was informed of this decision by certified mail. The ticket was submitted to revenue department investigators and the state police crime laboratory. A state police document examiner prepared a written report dated April 3, 1984, concluding that a foil portion of the ticket containing the $75,000 figure was “not an original integral part” of the ticket. Sometime after June 26, 1984, when the ticket was returned to the revenue department in Harrisburg, it was lost.</p>

A pretrial suppression motion was denied, but on the date scheduled for trial before a different judge, appellant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>again based on the fact that the Commonwealth had lost the lottery ticket. Following argument on the motion, the trial judge granted the motion in part, excluding testimony by the Commonwealth expert that the ticket had been altered. The Commonwealth certified that the order substantially handicapped the prosecution and filed an interlocutory appeal. The Superior Court reversed and remanded for trial. <em>Commonwealth v.

Dugger, </em><a href="/pa/506/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="506 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1790936" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0537-01">506 Pa. 537</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="506 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1790936" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0537-01">486 A.2d 382</a> (1985), applicable to adverse rulings on pretrial suppression motions, permitting Commonwealth appeals upon certification that the ruling substantially handicaps the prosecution, effectively putting the Commonwealth out of court. Appellant argues that the <em>Dugger </em>rule should not be extended to these circumstances, involving the grant of a motion <em>in limine </em>rather than a suppression motion. This precise argument was addressed and rejected in the companion case of <em>Commonwealth v. Cohen, </em><a href="/pa/529/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="529 Pa. 552" data-case-ids="1831181" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0552-01">529 Pa. 552</a>, <a href="/pa/529/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="529 Pa. 552" data-case-ids="1831181" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0552-01">605 A.2d 1212</a> (Pa.1992), holding that the Commonwealth may appeal a ruling such as the one in this case if it certifies that the order had the effect of terminating or substantially handicapping the prosecution. Superior Court, therefore, had jurisdiction of this appeal, and we must review its holding that the testimony of the Commonwealth expert, the state police document examiner, is admissible.</p>
    <p id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.4",607,[198,1456,1156,904]],["BL_608.1",608,[253,320,1157,98]]]'>Appellant’s position is essentially a restatement of the rationale of the trial court. In support of its prohibition of expert opinion testimony proffered by the Commonwealth, the trial court reasoned as follows. It was only after submitting the ticket to its expert for testing and evaluation that the Commonwealth lost the ticket, during a period when it was indisputably in the sole possession, custody, and control of the Commonwealth. Appellant never had the opportunity to have his own expert, or even his own counsel, examine the ticket. Appellant should not be obliged to accept the opinion of the prosecution expert, but should instead be permitted equal opportunity to conduct an expert examination. The Commonwealth alleged that the expert’s report was essential to the prosecution; the same opportunity is equally essential to the defense. Due process requires a full opportunity to defend against the charges. Since the defense had no means whatsoever to <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>test the conclusions of the expert, exclusion of his testimony is the only way to insure due process.</p>
    <p id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[250,435,1162,1210]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that the rationale of the Superior Court was correct. Superior Court relied on <em>Arizona v. Youngblood, </em><a href="/us/488/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="488 U.S. 51" data-case-ids="1495598" data-case-paths="/us/488/0051-01">488 U.S. 51</a>, 57, <a href="/br/92/383-394-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="109 S.

The Superior Court also relied on our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Hrynkow, </em><a href="/pa/457/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="457 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="477786" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0529-01">457 Pa. 529</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=330%20A.2d%20858" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="330 A.2d 858">330 A.2d 858</a> (1975), which permitted testimony regarding tests performed on the defendant’s lost clothing, where he had a right to inspect lab reports offered in evidence and to cross-examine the testimony, and held that the situation was not a denial of the defendant’s right to confrontation. Finally, the Superior Court stressed the fact that photocopies of the allegedly forged ticket are available to the defense, and such copies can be submitted to appellant’s own experts for independent evaluation.</p>
    <p id="b608-6" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[250,1663,1160,466]],["BL_609.1",609,[226,312,1153,847]]]'>We do not believe that <em>Arizona v. Youngblood, supra, </em>controls this case. The prosecutor in <em>Youngblood </em>did not attempt to make use of incriminating evidence denied to the defendant. Both prosecution and defense were denied the use of “evidence” which was unavailable because no tests were conducted on samples until the passage of time made such testing futile.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> There was no suggestion by the prosecutor that the missing evidence would have incriminated the defendant, and it was pure speculation by the defendant <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>that the evidence, if it existed, might have exonerated him. In this case, however, the prosecutor conducted an examination and is attempting to introduce the results of his examination as evidence against the defendant while denying to the defendant any possible benefit to be derived from an examination of the primary evidence in the case. It is one thing to conduct a trial in which neither side has evidence because the prosecution failed to take affirmative steps to preserve it, and it is quite another to conduct a trial in which the prosecution has evidence but the defense does not because the prosecution lost it. In the former, <em>Young-blood, </em>situation, due process is not violated unless there was bad faith by the prosecution; in the latter, <em>Deans, </em>situation, to permit the prosecution to use the evidence would deprive appellant of due process irrespective of good faith or bad faith on the part of the prosecution.</p>
    <p id="b609-5" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[226,1178,1153,794]]]'>We think, likewise, that reliance on <em>Commonwealth v. Hrynkow, supra, </em>is unwarranted. It, too, is fundamentally distinguishable from this case. We held in <em>Hrynkow </em>that a defendant was not denied the right to be confronted with the evidence against him when his clothing was lost before trial while the crime laboratory was being relocated, though the Commonwealth had scientifically analyzed the clothing and offered into evidence expert reports linking the defendant to the crime. The requirements of <em>Commonwealth v. Stafford, </em><a href="/pa/450/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="450 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="1947092" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0252-01">450 Pa. 252</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20590" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="299 A.2d 590">299 A.2d 590</a> (1973), and the right of confrontation were satisfied by Hrynkow’s inspection of the laboratory reports offered in evidence. The court limited its discussion to the appellant’s claim that his right of confrontation was denied, and thus did not address the due process implications of the unavailability of the evidence.</p>

Loss of evidence need not preclude expert reports or testimony in every case. Results of tests conducted on different types of evidence will produce differing degrees of probability, sometimes amounting <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>almost to a certainty. Chemical analyses of blood, breath, and narcotic substances produce consistent, highly reliable results. By contrast, psychiatric examination pertaining to the existence, nature, duration, causes, and effects of alleged mental disease or defect may produce opinions which are much more subjective and conclusions which are much more likely to be inconsistent or contradictory. The issue of the authenticity of the lottery ticket in this case appears to be at least somewhat subjective.</p>

If the alleged alteration had been a sloppy “cut-and-paste” job, there would have been no need for expert analysis, since the original ticket itself would have convinced a jury that a forgery had been committed. Moreover, a photocopy is not a sufficient substitute for the original ticket, inasmuch as the original was not a simple piece of paper, but was intricately constructed of multiple layers and foil portions. The trial court decision suppressing the opinion of the Commonwealth expert specifically permitted the Commonwealth to use photocopies, yet the Commonwealth declined to proceed to trial on that basis, certifying that the order substantially handicapped the prosecution. In our judgment, expert analysis of a photocopy cannot suffice to determine the authenticity of the original missing ticket, so the Commonwealth’s offer to permit defense experts to examine photocopies is of questionable value.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The appellant was charged three years after he presented an alleged forged lottery ticket. The Commonwealth, for whatever reason, could not produce the ticket he allegedly presented. The proof of forgery was not apparent on its face, and a photocopy did not disclose all the intricacies required for an expert opinion. The appellant was entitled to examine and test those intricacies and he could not without the original ticket: more need not be said.</p>

However, I disagree with the Majority that the Commonwealth should be permitted an absolute right of appeal from an adverse ruling on a motion <em>in limine </em>upon the bare allegation of the District Attorney that the prosecution is substantially handicapped by that ruling. I do so for the same reasons I expressed in my concurring opinion in <em>Commonwealth v.
