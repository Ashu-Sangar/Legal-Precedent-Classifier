For the reasons that follow we find that the Act was not violated and, therefore, vacate the order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[245,469,1164,999]]]'>On August 3, 1988, at approximately 12:45 a.m., Officer Frank Albert of the Millvale Borough Police Department was on patrol duty in uniform and in a marked police car. At that particular time he was patrolling that end of Mill-vale Township which borders Shaler Township. An intersection marks the border between these two jurisdictions. At that intersection, and within the boundaries of Shaler Township, is located a certain gas station. The record reflects that it was routine practice for the Millvale police, during the course of their usual patrol, to enter the township of Shaler at this particular intersection and circle around this gas station in order to return to Millvale for patrol <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On the night in question, Officer Albert had just turned onto the driveway leading to the gas station/mini-market when he heard a loud noise which he described as a “loud clang or bang” that sounded like an accident. Officer Albert testified that his original intention was to stop at the mini-market to buy himself a refreshment prior to his returning to Millvale.</p>
    <p id="b348-6" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[244,1487,1159,469]]]'>Upon hearing the noise, Officer Albert abandoned his initial intentions and proceeded to investigate what he believed might have been an accident. In so doing, he proceeded along Babcock Boulevard for a short distance and then turned left onto Geyer Road at which time he observed a vehicle ahead of him and noticed a stop sign lying on the road. He then radioed the Shaler Police Department and informed them of what he had observed and that he was going to assist them by stopping the vehicle.</p>

He proceeded to stop the vehicle just as it left Shaler Township and entered Reserve Township. When he approached the vehicle, Officer Albert observed that the driver, appellee, was exhibiting signs of intoxication. Officer Albert detained appellee and was subsequently joined at the scene by fellow officers from both Shaler and Reserve Townships. The information against appellee was ultimately filed by the Shaler Police Department.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Clarke of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Criminal Division. Upon conclusion of the trial, he was adjudged guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol and driving while operating privilege is suspended or revoked. Post-verdict motions were filed and argued following which appellee’s motion in arrest of judgment was granted.</p>

On appeal, the Superior Court agreed stating that the arresting officer was <em>not </em>on “official business” when he went outside his jurisdiction in order to purchase a bottle of soda pop. <a href="/citations/?q=400%20Pa.%20Super.%20622" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="400 Pa.

    <p id="b350-7" data-blocks='[["BL_350.6",350,[237,981,1162,992]]]'>This Court recently addressed subsection (5) of the Act in <em>Commonwealth v. Merchant, </em><a href="/pa/528/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="528 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1829790" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0161-01">528 Pa. 161</a>, <a href="/pa/528/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="528 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1829790" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0161-01">595 A.2d 1135</a> (1991). In <em>Merchant, </em>we held that the stop and detention of the appellee in a jurisdiction other than that of the arresting officers where the appellee had been observed by the arresting officers driving his car in an erratic manner was authorized under section (a)(5). On the facts in <em>Merchant </em>we concluded that the officers were on duty at the time and were travelling their usual route as part of their routine responsibilities. Similarly, we conclude, based upon the facts presented in the instant matter, that Officer Albert was on “official business" as he traveled toward his routine turnaround in Shaler Township. When he heard what he believed to be an automobile accident, he had an affirmative duty to proceed and investigate in order to make himself available to render assistance if need be. The fact that the occurrence was outside of his jurisdiction does not vitiate his duty to assist if needed; nor does it alter the fact that he continued to be on “official business.”</p>
