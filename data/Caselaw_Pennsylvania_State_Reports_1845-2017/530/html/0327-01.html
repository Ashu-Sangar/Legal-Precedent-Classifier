Our decision in <em>O’Connell </em>specifically addressed the situation where the arrestee had indicated some confusion over his <em>Miranda </em>rights as evidenced by a specific request to speak with counsel.

McFadden refused and was granted permission to make a telephone call to an undisclosed party. After McFadden completed the telephone call, the police recorded a refusal, and DOT issued a mandatory one-year suspension. On appeal, this Court reversed the license suspension. We held that McFadden could not have made a knowing and conscious refusal because he was not told that the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel was not applicable to requests for chemical testing.

The conduct of the police clearly misled Danforth into believing that he was entitled to counsel prior to performing a breathalyzer test.
