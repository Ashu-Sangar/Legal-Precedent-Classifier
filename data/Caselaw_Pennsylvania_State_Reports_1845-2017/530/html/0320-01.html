    <p class="author" id="b412-8" data-blocks='[["BL_412.8",412,[301,1141,355,42]]]'>LARSEN, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b412-9" data-blocks='[["BL_412.9",412,[256,1209,1161,572]]]'>This appeal involves the applicability of the “discovery rule” in medical malpractice actions, where the patient did not discover that he had sustained an actionable injury until more than two years after the alleged malpractice. Appellant William Hayward and his wife commenced this medical malpractice action against appellees Medical Center of Beaver County (hospital), Dr. Paul A. Pupi, Dr. Vincent D. Cuddy, and Coghlan, Cuddy and Pupi Associates seeking to recover damages resulting from the allegedly negligent removal of a portion of appellant’s lung on November 19, 1980.</p>
    <p id="b412-10" data-blocks='[["BL_412.10",412,[253,1815,1161,525]]]'>The facts giving rise to this action are as follows. On November 8, 1980, appellant was admitted to the hospital complaining of chest and back pain. Chest x-rays showed the presence of a mass in appellant’s right lung, and appellees Cuddy and Pupi were consulted regarding proper treatment. After consultation, the doctors performed exploratory surgery and removed a portion of appellant’s lung tissue for pathological analysis. Appellee doctors diagnosed the mass as a probable carcinoma and proceeded to remove that portion of the lung affected by the suspected tumor.</p>
    <p id="b413-3" data-blocks='[["BL_413.3",413,[201,321,1153,415]]]'>
      <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>Final pathological studies, however, disclosed that the mass was not a malignant tumor but was merely a blood clot. Appellee Cuddy informed appellant of this on November 21, 1980. At that time, appellant and several members of his family questioned appellee Cuddy regarding the necessity of the surgery in light of the misdiagnosis. Appellee Cuddy assured them that the surgery was necessary — regardless of the non-malignant nature of the mass.</p>
    <p id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[199,754,1154,1103]]]'>Immediately following surgery, appellant experienced shortness of breath. Appellant visited appellees Cuddy and Pupi for follow-up care on December 23, 1980 and February 21, 1981. On both occasions, appellant complained of progressive shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Appellee doctors told appellant that this condition was to be expected following the removal of a portion of the lung. Appellant’s condition progressively deteriorated and resulted in his hospitalization several times beginning in May of 1981. Eventually, appellant’s difficulty breathing caused him to terminate his employment in November of 1982. Around that time, appellant consulted a lung specialist, who explained to appellant that his shortness of breath was due to his decreased lung capacity, which resulted from the removal of part of his lung in 1980. On or about May 19, 1983, appellant consulted Dr. Michael Wald in connection with a Workmen’s Compensation claim. After examining appellant and reviewing his medical records, Dr. Wald told appellant that the November 1980 surgery performed by appellees Cuddy and Pupi was unnecessary and was a substantial factor in appellant’s disability.</p>

      <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>In support of summary judgment, appellees herein argue that this action is barred by the statute of limitations because it was commenced more than two years after appellant’s discovery of his injury. They allege that appellant knew of his breathing difficulty and knew that the 1980 surgery caused it since the days immediately following the surgery or, at the very latest, since November of 1982 when the lung specialist informed appellant that his shortness of breath was a result of the 1980 surgery. In addition, appellees argue that the fact that appellant’s lung may have been removed unnecessarily was reasonably ascertainable immediately following the surgery because appellant knew almost immediately that the operation was predicated on a misdiagnosis and because appellant even questioned the need for the surgery at the time that appellee Cuddy informed him of the misdiagnosis.</p>
    <p id="b416-4" data-blocks='[["BL_416.4",416,[238,1186,1159,792]]]'>Appellant, however, urges application of the “discovery rule” because he did not discover his injury until May 19, 1988 when Dr. Wald informed him that the 1980 surgery was unnecessary. Appellant also emphasizes that his injury was not reasonably ascertainable beforehand because appellee Cuddy specifically assured appellant that the removal of the lung was necessary — regardless of the benign nature of the mass. Appellant suggests that, given the nature of the medical field and its complexity, he could not be expected to know, until informed otherwise by Dr. Wald, that the ill effects he suffered were a result of wrongdoing and not merely the unexpected, inevitable or unforeseeable consequences of the medical treatment, and therefore, he acted reasonably in relying on his doctor’s assurance that the surgery was medically necessary.</p>
