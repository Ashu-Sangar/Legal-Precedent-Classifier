The Board had reversed a decision of a Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ) that granted the Fatal Claim Petition of Kathy J. Gibson (Claimant) following the death of her husband, Patrie Gibson (Decedent). Further, Appellant filed an Application for Supersedeas with this Court to stay the award of death benefits. By Order of October 1, 2003, this Court granted the Application for Supersedeas. Given the standard that we articulate today for the admission of lay opinion evidence of a technical or scientific nature in workers’ compensation proceedings, we now reverse the Order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Grier, Sr. (Mr. Grier), an employee of Appellant. Mr. Grier had worked at both the Pittsburgh and Bridgeville facilities during some of the same periods as Decedent over an interval of twelve to fourteen years. Mr. Grier testified that, when he worked at the Pittsburgh facility, he had seen a dark gray, heavy, cotton-type material that he believed was asbestos falling off the water piping that ran in and out of the furnace. (Grier Deposition dated February 25, 1998 at 18-19, 21-22.) He also testified that there was a dark gray material present at the Bridgeville facility that looked like it was sprayed on, which was also falling off the wall and laying on the ground. <em>Id. </em>at 29. He further stated that he did not have training or education concerning asbestos, that he would not be able to identify asbestos from other similar materials, and that he could not state with certainty that what he saw at the Pittsburgh and Bridgeville facilities was asbestos. <em>Id. </em>at 46-47.</p>

Dr. Laman opined that Decedent’s lung cancer was due to asbestos exposure to a substantial degree as well as to his long history of cigarette smoking. On cross-examination, however, Dr. Laman testified that: (1) there was nothing in the medical records that indicated any asbestos exposure; (2) he was unaware of the specifics of Decedent’s job or any particular asbestos exposures Decedent may have had; (3) his medical reports noted that he was “assuming” that Decedent had significant exposure to respirable asbestos materials because of his occupation; and (4) an individual could have interstitial fibrosis from causes other than asbestos exposure.

He testified that Decedent’s heavy cigarette smoking would relate to a significant and definite risk of lung cancer. Dr. Kaplan opined that there was no support for the assertion that work exposure to asbestos played any role in Claimant’s death, and his records showed no evidence of any asbestos-related diseases.</p>

Based on this credited evidence, the WCJ found that Decedent had longstanding and continuous exposure to asbestos while working for Appellant, and his asbestosis was a significant contributing factor to his lung cancer and death. Accordingly, the WCJ granted Claimant’s Fatal Claim Petition. Appellant appealed to the Board, which reversed the decision of the WCJ grounded on the premise that there was no substantial, competent evidence to support the finding that Claimant was exposed to asbestos while working for Appellant.</p>

Specifically, the court there held that a claimant is not required to provide scientific evidence of a hazardous level of exposure to a toxic substance in his workplace and that his failure to identify the dust to which he was exposed as asbestos was not fatal to a claim for benefits. In <em>WitcoKendall, </em>this testimony, in conjunction with other evidence, was sufficient for a finding of total disability from asbestos-related disease. Thus, the Majority opined that the testimony of Mr. Grier in the instant matter was sufficient evidence to support the determination of the WCJ that asbestos exposure was a significant contributing factor in the death of Decedent.</p>

    <p id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.6",607,[165,639,1159,1068]]]'>We begin with the touchstone of workers’ compensation jurisprudence, which holds that, in a claim petition proceeding, a claimant bears the burden of establishing a work-related injury and its causal effect on wage earning capacity. <em>Vista Int’l Hotel v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Bd. (Daniels), </em><a href="/pa/560/0012-02" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="560 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="95733,95826" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0012-02,/pa/560/0012-01">560 Pa. 12</a>, <a href="/a2d/742/0649-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="742 A.2d 649" data-case-ids="11500362,95733" data-case-paths="/a2d/742/0649-01,/pa/560/0012-02">742 A.2d 649</a>, 654 (1999). In the classic claim petition proceeding, the employee shoulders this burden in order to receive continuing medical and wage benefits. Within the context of a fatal claim petition, the surviving family member bears the responsibility to substantiate the elements necessary to merit the benefit award. Those elements encompass establishment of a work-related injury or occupational disease, impact on the earning capacity of the employee, and, in the case of a fatal claim petition, that this injury or disease was a substantial contributing cause in bringing about the death of that employee. <em>McCloskey v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Bd. (J.H.

Accordingly, to test whether the evidence relied upon is substantial evidence in support of a finding, the reviewing court should ascertain whether the evidence admitted is competent, and if it is competent, whether it is sufficient to support the administrative finding.

It argues that no reasonable mind could accept the testimony of Mr. Grier as supportive of long-term asbestos exposure. It challenges the reliance upon this lay opinion testimony by both the WCJ and the Commonwealth Court to effect an award of benefits. Appellant complains that the Commonwealth Court essentially eviscerated the substantial evidence standard of review by holding that the lay testimony of an ordinary worker, who had limited knowledge of Decedent’s working conditions, supports a finding of longstanding and continuous asbestos exposure. Thus, it contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the determination of the WCJ.</p>

In the instant matter, Claimant was required to show that Decedent was: (a) exposed to asbestos, which is an acknowledged workplace hazard within the Occupational Disease Act; (b) in the course of his employment; and (c) that asbestos-related disease formed a significant contributing cause of his death.

To establish this fact, Claimant presented Mr. Grier’s deposition testimony. Mr. Grier testified that when he was working in Appellant’s Pittsburgh steel plant between approximately 1981 and 1987 he saw Mr. Gibson on a daily basis. <em>See </em>R.R. 32a, 34a. He further stated that during this time he observed Mr. Gibson working with a dark gray, heavy, dusty, and cotton-type material on the water and steam pipes in the plant, which he believed was asbestos. <em>See <a href="/a2d/763/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="763 A.2d 555" data-case-ids="11171073" data-case-paths="/a2d/763/0555-01">id.</a> </em>at 39a-44a. Finally, Mr. Grier testified that after he started working at Appellants’ Bridge-ville steel plant in the late 1980s, Mr. Gibson joined his crew and again they worked around a dark gray and dusty insulation material that he believed to be asbestos. <em>See <a href="/a2d/763/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="763 A.2d 555" data-case-ids="11171073" data-case-paths="/a2d/763/0555-01">id.</a> </em>at 46a-51a.</p>

Moreover, I believe that Mr. Grier was competent to' testify that he believed that the materials contained asbestos because such a belief,was plainly a rational one based on his observations of the materials, which, as he explained, were dark gray, dusty, and used for insulation. <em>See Camp Construction Corp. v. Lumber Products Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/311/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="311 Pa.

While I acknowledge that Mr. Grier could not definitively identify the materials as asbestos based on his experiences and knowledge, I do not believe that such a fact renders his testimony incompetent and inadmissible, particularly in a workers’ compensation hearing where the rules of <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>evidence are relaxed. Rather, in my opinion, Mr. Grier’s inability to conclusively identify the materials as asbestos was simply an area for Appellant to explore on cross-examination and for the judge to weigh in assessing Mr. Grier’s credibility and ultimately, the sufficiency of the evidence presented.</p>
    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[172,588,1155,1392]]]'>I therefore disagree with the majority that Mr. Grier’s testimony was inadmissible. Nevertheless, like the majority, I would find that the evidence presented in the case, including the testimony of Mr. Grier, was insufficient to establish that Mr. Gibson was exposed to asbestos when he worked for Appellant. Indeed, the only two witnesses who offered testimony about Mr. Gibson’s possible exposure to asbestos were Mr. Grier and David Laman, M.D., and neither of those witnesses could conclusively testify that Mr. Gibson was exposed to asbestos materials while working for Appellant. Specifically, as noted above, Mr. Grier testified that Mr. Gibson worked with material that he thought contained asbestos, but he was unable to confirm whether the material actually contained asbestos. Similarly, although Dr. Laman opined that Mr. Gibson’s lung cancer was a result of his exposure to asbestos while working for Appellant, he admitted that he did not know for certain whether Mr. Gibson was indeed exposed to asbestos during such times. Under these circumstances, I must agree with the majority’s ultimate conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that Mr. Gibson was exposed to asbestos while working for Appellant. <em>See Pennsylvania Labor Relations Bd. v. Elk Motor Sales Co., </em><a href="/pa/388/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="388 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1272501" data-case-paths="/pa/388/0173-01">388 Pa. 173</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.2d%20501" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="130 A.2d 501">130 A.2d 501</a>, 505 (1957) (to constitute substantial evidence, the evidence must do more than “create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established”).</p>

I am not averse, however, to the Commonwealth Court’s approach of treating the exposure issue as a factual one, or to its flexible application of the substantial evidence standard in this regard. <em>See Gibson v. WCAB (Armco Stainless &amp; Alloy Products), </em>No. 1860 C.D. 2002, <em>op. </em>at_, <a href="/citations/?q=861%20A.2d%20944" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="861 A.2d 944">861 A.2d 944</a> (Pa.Cmwlth. May 8, 2003) <em>(en banc) </em>(observing that Commonwealth Court precedent holds “that the burden of proof for a claimant attempting to show asbestos exposure is not overly demanding, that scientific evidence to prove the existence of an asbestos hazard is not required under the Act, that a claimant’s failure to identify the dust to which he was exposed as asbestos is not fatal to a claim for benefits and that a claimant’s testimony alone can support a finding that asbestos exposure existed”). Such approach is consistent with prevalence of the use of asbestos in certain industries, as well as the inherent difficulties of proving the presence of asbestos, which most industries have long since remediated. <em>Cf. 77 </em>P.S. § 413 (permitting a presumption that an occupational disease arose during the course of employment if the disability occurred at or immediately after employment in an industry in which occupational disease is a hazard). That said, in those instances where the Commonwealth Court has accepted lay testimony on the issue of exposure, the evidence has been more positive than that presented here. <em>See, e.g., Gray v. WCAB (Pittsburgh Bd. of Ed.), </em><a href="/a2d/657/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="657 A.2d 77" data-case-ids="11927956" data-case-paths="/a2d/657/0077-01">657 A.2d 77</a>, 80-81 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995) (deeming the evidence sufficient where claimant’s testimony to chemical exposure was corroborated by a co-worker and an industrial hygienist); <em>Witco-Kendall Co. v.
