When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court must determine whether the evidence at trial, and all reasonable inferences derived therefrom, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, are sufficient to establish all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Bridges, </em><a href="/pa/563/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="563 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1366900" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0001-01">563 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/a2d/757/0859-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="757 A.2d 859" data-case-ids="11243658,1366900" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/0859-01,/pa/563/0001-01">757 A.2d 859</a>, 864 (2000). A person is guilty of first-degree murder where the Commonwealth proves that (1) a human being was unlawfully killed; (2) the person accused is responsible for the killing; and (3) the accused acted with specific intent to kill. 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(d); <em>Commonwealth v. Spotz, </em><a href="/pa/563/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="563 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="1366976" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0269-01">563 Pa. 269</a>, <a href="/a2d/759/1280-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="759 A.2d 1280" data-case-ids="11235770,11235819,1366970,1366976" data-case-paths="/a2d/759/1280-01,/a2d/759/1280-02,/pa/563/0268-01,/pa/563/0269-01">759 A.2d 1280</a>, 1283 (2000). An intentional killing is a “[k]illing by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(d). Moreover, the Crimes Code provides that a person who commits arson endangering persons is guilty of first-degree murder “if the <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>fire or explosion causes the death of any person and was set with the purpose of causing the death of another person.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 3301(a)(2). To prove the underlying arson in a murder prosecution, the Commonwealth must establish that (1) there was a fire of incendiary origin; (2) the accused deliberately caused the fire; and (3) the fire was the cause of death. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[175,754,1152,735]]]'>The evidence adduced at trial established the following facts. On August 24, 1985, at approximately 11:30 p.m., appellant was at a bar with a friend when his live-in girlfriend, Kathleen Schuler,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> angrily confronted him. Schuler testified that appellant was supposed to have attended an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting that night. When she instead found him at a bar, she told him to “get the fuck home with his kids because [she] was leaving him.” N.T. 10/3/00, at 101. Schuler then returned to her house—a row-home that she shared with appellant in the Oxford Circle section of Philadelphia—packed her clothes and left appellant’s two boys alone with a teenage babysitter, Dianne Carpenter. At 1:30 a.m., Carpenter, tired of waiting for appellant to arrive, returned to her home next-door and left the children, who were sleeping upstairs.</p>

Appellant told Dipple that Schuler wanted him out of the house and he persuaded her to accompany him to the Oxford Circle home so that she could take custody of their children. When the two arrived, appellant found a note from Schuler demanding that appellant leave her house. Appellant showed Dipple the note and pleaded with her to stay with him. Dipple declined and asked appellant to bring the children <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>downstairs. When appellant told Dipple to go upstairs instead, she refused because she was afraid that appellant would try to “come on” to her. N.T. 10/04/00, at 28. Finally, tired of appellant’s sexual advances, Dipple left the house, promising that she would return the next morning for her scheduled visitation with the children. Thereafter, appellant was the only adult in the house.</p>
    <p id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[283,693,1158,519]]]'>At approximately 8:57 a.m., police responded to reports of a fire at the Oxford Circle home. By the time the first officer arrived at the scene, the house was fully engulfed in flames. Appellant was standing outside, bare-chested. When police asked appellant for his name, he replied, “My name is mud. I should die for what I did.” N.T. 10/2/00, at 102. Appellant’s two children were subsequently found dead in their bedroom. A medical examiner concluded that they died from smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning, and may have been burned by the fire while they were still alive.</p>

He noted that the fire had three separate ignition points: a love seat, a sofa and a dining room table. Quinn testified that appellant’s claim to have been on the sofa when he noticed that the curtains were ablaze was not credible because, based upon the ignition points and the fire patterns, the sofa would have been fully consumed in flames before the curtains caught fire. Quinn further testified that a person on the sofa at the time the curtains initially ignited would have been “severely burned or a fatality.” <em>Id. </em>at 169-70. According to Quinn, the person who started the fire would in all likelihood have been the only person who could have had enough time to escape the burning home <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>without injury. <em>Id. </em>at 179.

Similarly, Robert Amoroso, who shared a cell with appellant at another jail facility, testified that, on one occasion, he heard appellant crying. Amoroso said that when he asked appellant what was wrong, appellant replied, “I burned my two babies up.” <em>Id. </em>at 185. Amoroso also testified that appellant conveyed his regret that he had not killed his wife instead, because she was amorously involved with another man and because he “was paying all the bills and she wasn’t taking care of the kids.” <em>Id. </em>at 186.</p>

This Court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the jury on issues of credibility. <em>Commonwealth v.

Here, the jury heard expert testimony from the fire marshal which raised the strong inference that appellant had intentionally started the fire, <em>ie., </em>the fire was intentionally set and appellant, who was the only adult present, escaped without injury even though he claimed to have been in the house well after the fire had spread. Additionally, the jury heard testimony that, as the fire still raged, appellant stated, “My name is mud. I should die for what I did.” Appellant’s argument concerning motive is unavailing in the context of a sufficiency challenge; although motive evidence may be relevant to guilt, the Commonwealth is not required to provide such evidence in order to prove its case. In any event, as to both motive and intent, the jury heard, among other evidence, testimony from fellow inmates that appellant had admitted to killing his children in a fire, and that he had done so to retaliate against his estranged wife and/or his girlfriend. In reaching its verdict, the jury was free to weigh and credit this evidence. Likewise, it was free to weigh and reject appellant’s own testimony that he did not start the fire and had attempted to extinguish it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Moreover, <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>appellant’s claim that he attempted to save his children after first escaping from the burning house, even if believed, would not necessarily undermine the conclusion that he set the fire and did so with the specific intent to kill his children.

Appellant identifies those unavailable wit<a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>nesses as two neighbors whose police statements on the night of the fire recounted that appellant had frantically attempted to extinguish the fire and tried to rescue his children. Appellant further claims that the Commonwealth acted in bad faith because the delay was based upon no new information other than a January 1999 police interview with another former wife,. Adrienne Sussman-Dougherty. Sussman-Dougherty had contacted Philadelphia homicide detectives and informed them that, several times during the course of her marriage to appellant, which lasted from 1991 to 1995, appellant had confessed to her that he had started the fire that killed his two sons. Appellant deems the police information from his ex-wife to be evidence of the Commonwealth’s bad faith in delaying his arrest because the Commonwealth determined that Suss-man-Dougherty’s testimony would be inadmissible at trial under the spousal communications privilege;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> and that the credibility of the statement allegedly was suspect. Appellant notes that the other information detailed in his warrant of arrest had been known to police all along and thus does not demonstrate good faith for the thirteen year delay in charging appellant with murder.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that, after a pre-trial investigation, appellant abandoned the motion to dismiss, and accordingly, the trial court never ruled upon the motion. In the alternative, the Commonwealth argues that appellant had good reason to abandon the issue because he was not prejudiced by the delay and the delay was not caused by bad faith on the part of the Commonwealth. In this regard, the Commonwealth notes that the testimony appellant alleges he would have introduced if the trial had occurred earlier was merely cumulative of evidence which was later presented at trial, <em>i.e., </em>other witnesses testified that appellant had attempted to rescue his children from the fire. Moreover, the Commonwealth contends that appellant’s claim is specula<a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>tive because he fails to show how the additional evidence would have aided his defense. Further, the Commonwealth argues that it did not act in bad faith because it did not intentionally delay appellant’s arrest to gain some tactical trial advantage, but rather, arrested him as soon as it had reason to believe (through Sussman-Dougherty’s account of appellant’s confessions) that he not only purposely set his house on fire, but did so with the specific intent to kill his children. As for the admissibility of Sussman-Dougherty’s accounts of appellant’s admissions to her, the Commonwealth notes that this account was used (and used properly) only to support a determination of probable cause to arrest appellant and, therefore, its admissibility or inadmissibility at trial is irrelevant to the question of bad faith.</p>
    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.4",326,[279,1117,1161,1113]]]'>We agree with the Commonwealth that this claim is unreviewable in its present form, even under this Court’s former practice of relaxing waiver principles upon direct capital appeal. The docket and record reflect that appellant indeed moved to dismiss the prosecution on the basis of prearrest delay.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Although appellant asserts that the trial court denied the motion, he cites to no support in the official record for that assertion, and this Court’s review has uncovered no such ruling. There is no indication in the trial court’s handwritten docket entries, or in the docket generated for purposes of appeal, that the motion was ever ruled upon. Instead, the only further record reference to the motion to dismiss is, as the Commonwealth notes, an in-chambers discussion of record on the first day of trial after the jury was selected, in which the trial court ruled upon various outstanding pre-trial issues. During that discussion, counsel for the Commonwealth noted that appellant had “raised the issue of prearrest delay, due process” but had “then waived it after investigating.” N.T. 10/2/00, at 31. Appellant’s trial counsel did not dispute the record representation that he had waived the pre-arrest delay claim.</p>

      <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>For purposes of determining whether this claim is reviewable, it is significant that this is a case where counsel specifically raised the issue of pre-trial delay, but then withdrew the motion, as opposed to a case where counsel made no such motion at all. Because counsel withdrew the motion, there is no record devoted to the issue. It is not clear from the existing record which considerations motivated counsel to abandon the claim. In an instance such as this, it is unrealistic and inaccurate to view the claim as a claim of trial court error. Counsel apparently investigated the issue and then made a judgment that the issue was not worth pursuing. Accordingly, the focus should be upon counsel’s reasons for electing not to pursue the issue, rather than upon some alleged “error” of the trial court in declining to grant the withdrawn motion. As this Court noted in <em>Freeman, supra, </em>we have routinely declined to apply the discretionary relaxed waiver doctrine “in many instances, often involving situations where the failure to raise a claim below might have fallen within the realm of defense trial strategy, or when the absence of a contemporaneous objection made it difficult to resolve the issue on the record presented.” <a href="/pa/573/0532-02" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="827 A.2d 385" data-case-ids="197204,197206,197235,9108637,9108680,9108745" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0532-02,/pa/573/0532-01,/pa/573/0531-01,/a2d/827/0385-01,/a2d/827/0385-02,/a2d/827/0385-03">827 A.2d at </a>400 n. 9 (collecting cases). <em>See also Commonwealth v.

However, the question of whether <em>Kelly </em>would require an adjustment in this Court’s approach to the sufficiency of a record to require a <em>Simmons </em>instruction is not implicated here, where no appropriate objection was registered.</p>
