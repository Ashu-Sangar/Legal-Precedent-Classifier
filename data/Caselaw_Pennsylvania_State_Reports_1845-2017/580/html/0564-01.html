In the remaining counts, Appellees alleged that the City’s extension of health and pension benefits to the Life Partners of employees was <em>ultra vires, </em>that the City cannot exempt real estate transfers between Life Partners from local taxation and that the City does not have the authority to prevent discrimination against Life Partners based on their status as such.</p>

Contrary to the trial court, the Commonwealth Court first held that “the City clearly was without authority to legislate in the field of domestic relations by defining and creating a new marital status” and that “the General Assembly, by the enactment of the Domestic Relations Code and other related statutes, and specifically, by Part II of the Domestic Relations Code <em>(ie., </em>the Marriage Law), preempted the field of the marital relationship between two people in Pennsylvania.” <em><a href="/a2d/809/0980-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="809 A.2d 980" data-case-ids="11429092" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0980-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/809/0980-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="809 A.2d 980" data-case-ids="11429092" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0980-01">at 990</a>.</p>
    <p id="b701-4" data-blocks='[["BL_701.4",701,[161,800,1155,990]]]'>In reaching these conclusions, the court began by quoting Article IX, Section 2 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides that a home rule municipality such as Philadelphia “may exercise any power or perform any function not denied by th[e] Constitution, by its home rule charter or by the General Assembly at any time.” Pa. Const, art. IX, § 2. The court then turned to the First Class Home Rule Charter Act of 1949 (the “Home Rule Act”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> in which the General Assembly gave Philadelphia “complete powers of legislation and administration <em>in relation to its municipal functions,” </em>53 P.S. § 13131 (emphasis added), but prohibited it from “exercising] powers contrary to, or in limitation or enlargement of, powers granted by acts of the General Assembly ... which are [applicable in every part of the Commonwealth.” <em><a href="/a2d/809/0980-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="809 A.2d 980" data-case-ids="11429092" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0980-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 13133.

In rejecting the <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>City’s argument that it had not created a new marital status, but rather, had merely extended its provision of certain rights and benefits to an additional class, the court noted the similarities between the parameters the City had set for “Life Partners” and those that have been set with respect to state-endorsed marriages. Among other things, it noted that just as the Marriage Law defines marriage as a civil contract between a man and a woman and prohibits the couple from being blood-related, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 1102, 1304, the Legislation requires Life Partners to be competent to contract and not blood-related in a way that would prohibit marriage. Phila. Code § 9—1106(2)(a)(i), (ii). Moreover, the court pointed out that the Legislation’s requirement that each Life Partner pledge that he or she is the “sole Life Partner” of the other, and that they “agree to share life’s common necessities and to be responsible for one another’s common welfare,” Phila. Code § 9-1106(2)(a)(v), is the equivalent of a couple’s vows in a standard marriage service, <em>i.e., </em>to “comfort,” “honor and keep,” and be “faithful.” The court also noted that the “Verification Statement” the Legislation required for the registration of a Life Partnership is akin to a marriage license,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and procedures for the termination of Life Partnerships are <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>akin to procedures set forth in the Divorce Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
      <em>See generally </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 3301. Given all these similarities, the court opined that a couple’s registration as a “Life Partnership” would succeed in creating a “mutual right of support,” which, just like the obligations of marriage, “would be capable of enforcement throughout the Commonwealth.” <a href="/a2d/809/0980-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="809 A.2d 980" data-case-ids="11429092" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0980-01">809 A.2d at 987</a>. Stating that it could “think of no reason for this multitude of similarities other than a thinly veiled attempt by the City to duplicate the institution of marriage for couples of the same sex,” the court concluded that the City had not merely exercised its home rule power to provide certain rights and benefits to an additional class, but rather, had improperly legislated in the preempted field of marriage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Phila. Code § 9—1106(2)(a)(i), (ii). Likewise, just as individuals seeking to marry typically vow to support one another emotionally and financially and to be monogamous, the Legislation requires Life Partners to agree to share in the “common necessities of life,” to be responsible for each other’s “common welfare,” and to be the “sole life partner” to each other. <em><a href="/pa/514/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="514 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="1804515" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0176-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 9-1106(2)(a)(iii), (v).

Prior to the amendments at issue, the Fair Practices Ordinance prohibited, among other things, discrimination based on race, color, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, ancestry, or handicap in both the employment setting as well as in places of “public accommodation, resort or amusement.” <em>See generally </em>Phila. Code § 9-1103 (“Unlawful Employment Practices”); <em><a href="/pa-d-c4th/48/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="48 Pa.

Thus, under the prior version of the ordinance, employers and places of public accommodation, resort or amusement were already prohibited from discriminating against individuals based on their sexual orientation, whether or not that sexual orientation also resulted in the individuals being members of Life Partnerships. While the amended ordinance now specifically provides that discrimination based on an individual’s membership in a registered Life Partnership is also prohibited, we are confident that any such discrimination was already prohibited as discrimination based on sexual orientation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Accordingly, we fail to see how the <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>City has materially increased the protection it affords to those in Life Partnerships by prohibiting discrimination based on an individual’s status as a Life Partner. This is particularly true when one recognizes that it is not just any individual in an adult, committed relationship with a member of the same sex who can take advantage of this new prohibition against discrimination against Life Partners, but rather, is only those who have officially <em>registered </em>as Life Partners with the City. <em>See </em>Phila.

Specifically, when read in conjunction with the registration requirements, the anti-discrimination provisions invite individuals who neither live nor work in the City to nevertheless register as Life Partners solely as a means to solidify their full rights to be free from discrimination on account of their Life Partner status when, if ever, they come into the City.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> While we recognize that the City generally has authority to enact anti-discrimination laws pursuant to its police powers, <em>see Western Pa.

While this, on its face, would appear to provide a rational basis on which to revise the real estate transfer tax exemption, it simply does not explain the change that the City actually made.

Moreover, while the City’s purported rationale suggests that a married couple’s financial interdependence is the reason for their right to the exemption, and that Life Partners, who are also financially interdependent, should therefore be entitled to the same, we know from the context of the marriage exemption that the reason for that exemption is not the couple’s financial interdependence, but rather, merely the fact of their marriage. Indeed, not only is there no requirement in subsection 19-1405(6) that individuals exempt from taxation pursuant to that subsection be financially interdependent, but in addition, certain of the relationships included in that subsection are not even ones that are typically associated with financial interdependence, <em>e.g., </em>brother and sister, and grandparent and grandchild.</p>

In addition, unlike the Commonwealth Court, we disagree with Appellees that the City has created a "mutual right of support” that mimics the right of support set forth in the domestic relations laws and that is necessarily "capable of enforcement throughout the Commonwealth.” <a href="/a2d/809/0980-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="809 A.2d 980" data-case-ids="11429092" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0980-01">809 A.2d at 987</a>. Preliminarily, we are skeptical that the sworn statement of Life Partners that they "agree to share in the common necessities of life and to be responsible for each other's common welfare,” Phila. Code § 9-1106(2)(a)(v), has the specificity required to constitute a judicially-enforceable promise. <em>See Weavertown Transport Leasing, Inc. v. Moran, </em><a href="/a2d/834/1169-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="834 A.2d 1169" data-case-ids="9084172" data-case-paths="/a2d/834/1169-01">834 A.2d 1169</a> (Pa.Super.2003) (to create an enforceable contract, parties must "delineate the terms of their bargain with sufficient clarity”); 17A Am.Jur.2d Contracts § 183 (2004) ("an agreement cannot be enforced if its terms are indefinite”). Moreover, even if such a statement were found to be judicially enforceable, we note that the Superior Court has specifically rejected the notion that a promise of support between two parties somehow converts the parties’ relationship into a marriage with all of its statutory rights and duties. <em>See Knauer v. Knauer, </em><a href="/pa-super/323/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="323 Pa.

We recognize that the Legislation’s employee benefits provisions require all employers in the City whose benefit plans are not governed by ERISA to offer benefits to Life Partners on the same basis that they offer benefits to dependents and thus, the benefits provisions concern more than just the City itself as an employer. However, according to the City, few private employers are affected by this requirement as most employers who are not covered by ERISA are public employers, and Appellees do not identify any private employers who are, in fact, affected. In any event, no affected employers, either public or private, have attempted to intervene in this action to challenge the benefits requirements as applied to them. Accordingly, there is no ripe controversy before this Court concerning the City’s authority to impose this requirement upon non-City entities, and we express no opinion on whether this would be permissible.</p>

The City argues that the Commonwealth Court erred in considering the previously exempted class as consisting only of those persons set forth in subsection 19-1405(6). According to the City, in considering whether constitutional uniformity principles were violated, the Commonwealth Court should have instead looked to the entirety of section 19-1405 and recognized that the City merely added an exemption for transfers between Life Partners to "twenty-six different categories of exemptions from the transfer tax, many of which concern transactions between unmarried, unrelated people....” City’s Brf. at 46. While this argument has some appeal, we note that the City clearly considered the exemption for transfers between Life Partners to be closely aligned with the exemptions set forth in subsection 19-1405(6) as it added the exemption for Life Partner transfers to that subsection rather than creating a new subsection. Indeed, such an assessment makes sense as the other twenty-six categories of transfers exempted from the transfer tax are obviously <em>sui generis. See, e.g., </em>Phila. Code § 19-1405(3) (transfers to a local government entity by way of a sheriff sale or tax claim bureau sale); <em>id. </em>§ 19-1405(13) (transfers from non-profit industrial development agencies or authorities under certain terms and conditions); <em>id. </em>§ 19-1405(14) (transfers by mortgagors to original grantors holding purchase monfey mortgages); <em>id. </em>§ 19-1405(16) (transfers to land or preservation conservancies); <em>id. </em>§ 19-1405(20) (leases for the production or extraction of coal, oil, natural gas or minerals). Thus, we do not believe that the Commonwealth Court erred in focusing its inquiry on whether Life Partners are similarly situated to the other individuals who are entitled to a transfer tax exemption under subsection 19-1405(6).</p>
