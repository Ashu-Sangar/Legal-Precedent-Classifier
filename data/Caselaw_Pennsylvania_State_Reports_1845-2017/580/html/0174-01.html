On appeal, the Commonwealth Court viewed the “personal animus” exception in Section 301(c) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 411(1), as an issue of subject matter jurisdiction, raised the exception <em>sua sponte, </em>and applied it to the facts.

In 1996, Claimant began her employment with the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (“Employer”) as a parole agent at the Graterford Prison. At that time, James Newton (“Newton”) also was employed by Employer, as a Regional Institutional Parole Manager. Beginning in October of 1997, while at work, Newton repeatedly requested to see Claimant socially and engaged her in unwelcome interactions. When Claimant rejected Newton’s advances, he gave her additional work. In February of 1998, Claimant informed her supervisor of Newton’s conduct and filed a grievance with her union. Newton’s conduct toward Claimant, however, continued. Claimant filed a complaint of sexual harassment against Newton with Employer’s Affirmative Action Officer on March 4, 1998, and an investigation took place. Shortly thereafter, Claimant’s relationships with other parole agents became problematic. On April 1, 1998, Claimant was instructed to report to work at Employer’s office located in South Philadelphia. Claimant did as she was instructed, but was given no desk or assignments. Claimant began to manifest symptoms of anxiety and consulted with a psychologist. The psychologist diagnosed Claimant as suffering from an acute stress disorder and advised her to stop work. Claimant remained out of work while Employer searched for an alternative position for her.</p>

Claimant reported to work, but again, was provided with no desk or assignments. Claimant <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>began to feel more depressed and anxious.

The court is to reconsider whether Claimant proved her claim with regard to Newton’s actions. Likewise, insofar as the Commonwealth Court’s application of the “personal animus” exception may have affected its review of the Claimant’s claim that she was entitled to compensation under the Act for certain actions that were taken by Employer after she reported Newton’s conduct, the Court’s is to reconsider that claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a>
