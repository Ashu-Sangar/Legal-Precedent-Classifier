On September 23, 1994, Patricia Gallie (Claimant) injured her back while working for Fichtel <em>&amp; </em>Sachs Industries (Employer). Pursuant to a notice of compensation payable, Employer began paying Claimant workers’ compensation benefits for her work-related injury. Claimant, thereafter, began treating with Dr. Denise Primavera, a chiropractor, who supplemented her chiropractic adjustments with ultrasound therapy. Dr. Primavera also referred Claimant to Patricia Alderfer, a massage therapist. Dr. Primavera recommended that Claimant alternate her treatments of adjustments and ultrasound with her massage therapy, resulting in Claimant’s receipt of one type of treatment or the other every two weeks.</p>

The Department assigned the UR to a URO by notice dated March 20, 2001. Thereafter, the URO reviewed the matter and issued its determination in a report mailed to the parties on May 18, 2001.

Specifically, Employer alleged that Claimant failed to file her petition within 30 days of her receipt of the URO report as required by Section 306(f.l)(6)(iv). As noted previously, this Section states:</p>

    <p id="b254-7" data-blocks='[["BL_254.7",254,[280,1478,1158,625]]]'>As to the timeliness issue, Claimant conceded at the hearing before the WCJ, that she received the URO report by regular mail on May 21, 2001. She stated she specifically remembered the date because she had a scheduled appointment with her massage therapist that day. Upon receiving the URO report, which, in substance, concluded that Employer or its insurer was not compelled to pay for massages, Claimant immediately called her massage therapist, who informed Claimant that she had not been paid for some prior treatments; would prefer to not see Claimant until the matter of payment was resolved; and, accordingly, cancelled the treatment scheduled for that date.</p>
    <p id="b254-8" data-blocks='[["BL_254.8",254,[280,2138,1154,96]],["BL_255.1",255,[165,313,1157,676]]]'>Claimant also testified that she “held onto” the URO report until her next appointment with her chiropractor, Dr. Primav<a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>era. She stated that she wanted to discuss the URO’s finding that Dr. Primavera’s use of ultrasound therapy was not reasonable or necessary, and she assumed that Dr. Primavera would want to challenge the URO report. Claimant testified initially that she believed her medical provider was responsible for seeking review of the report. Upon speaking to Dr. Primavera, however, she learned it was her responsibility. Accordingly, Claimant drafted a petition for review and personally mailed it at the post office. She testified she requested the postal clerk to date stamp the envelope by hand. While Claimant testified she mailed the petition on June 18, 2001, the envelope in which it was mailed was postmarked June 22, 2001.</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[163,1015,1159,952]]]'>The WCJ made several critical findings of fact regarding the testimony presented at the hearing. First, it accepted Claimant’s testimony that she received the URO on May 21, 2001. Additionally, in light of the June 22, 2001 postmark, the WCJ rejected Claimant’s testimony that she mailed her review petition on June 18, 2001, and instead found that the petition was mailed on June 22, 2001. The WCJ also noted that the Department received its copy of the URO report on May 24, 2001, three days after Claimant. The WCJ was therefore faced with the statutory construction issue which has led all the way to this Court. The Act at 306(f.l)(6)(iv) (quoted <em>supra.) </em>mandates the filing of the petition for review “within 30 days after receipt of the report.” If this language refers to receipt by Claimant, her June 22, 2001 filing was untimely, and her claim therefore unreviewable. Conversely, if the language refers to receipt by the Department, Claimant’s June 22, 2001 filing was timely and the WCJ was permitted and required to rule on its merits.</p>
    <p id="b255-6" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[163,1991,1155,365]],["BL_256.1",256,[302,320,1150,314]]]'>The WCJ held Section 306(f.l)(6)(iv) is ambiguous as to the commencement of the 30 days within which Claimant had to file her review petition. Applying rules of statutory construction, the WCJ determined that where, as here, a claimant and the Department receive notice of a URO report on different dates, the date of the latest receipt controls. Because the Department received the URO report on May 24, 2001, less <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>than 30 days before Claimant mailed her petition for review, the WCJ concluded that it was timely. The WCJ further found that Claimant’s ongoing ultrasound therapy and full body massage were reasonable and necessary. Thus, on March 29, 2002, the WCJ filed its decision and order sustaining Claimant’s petition for review of the URO report.</p>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.4",256,[300,662,1152,358]]]'>Employer then appealed to the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB) arguing that the WCJ erred by using the date of receipt by the Department to determine that Claimant timely filed her petition for review of the URO report. On April 30, 2003, the WCAB vacated the WCJ’s decision and dismissed Claimant’s petition as untimely. The WCAB reasoned:</p>

Under those circumstances, there is no basis for the [WCJ’s] conclusion that, when a claimant and the [Department] receive a utilization review determination on different dates, the date of the latest receipt controls. To the contrary, the thirty day period begins to run on the date of receipt by either “the provider, employer, employe or insurer,” depending upon who filed the petition for review.</blockquote>

We <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>believe that the provision clearly provides that the 30-day time period begins to run upon receipt of the URO’s findings by the provider, employer, employee or insurer, and not by the Department. Thus, if the provider, employer or insurer had chosen to appeal, each would have had 30 days from their receipt of the URO report to file a petition.</p>
    <p id="b260-4" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[294,656,1151,635]]]'>Our conclusion in this regard is confirmed by another factor. The Department has no mechanism to inform the public of the date it receives findings from a URO. Under the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of Section 306(f. 1)(6)(iv), such date would be crucial to any provider, employer, employee or insurer desiring to file a timely petition for review. To meet this need, the Department would have to develop a publicly accessible docketing system for URO reports. If this were the result intended by the Legislature, we believe that a clear indication of such intent would have been set forth in the Act. As it was not, we will not graft such language into the provision.</p>
    <p id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.5",260,[294,1325,1153,412]]]'>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that, the plain language of Section 306(f.l)(6)(iv) indicates that the time period for filing a petition for review of a URO report begins to run from the date the party seeking review receives such notice. Because the petition for review filed by Claimant was not filed within 30 days of her receipt of the URO report, it was untimely.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Thus, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed.</p>

Before the WCJ, Claimant also argued that Employer failed to comply with a Bureau regulation governing service of URO reports, found at 34 Pa.Code § 127.476, by not serving the URO report upon the attorneys for the parties, if known, by certified mail. Because Claimant was ultimately successful on her underlying challenge to the findings of the URO report before the WCJ, this claim was not addressed. However, in reversing the WCJ, the WCAB did address it. The WCAB found that because it is undisputed that Claimant actually received the URO report on May 21, 2001, she is not prejudiced by Employer's failure to comply with the regulation concerning service, and any error is harmless. <em>See </em>WCAB Opinion, filed 4/30/03, at 3.

By virtue of the character of the attorney-client relationship, individuals rely upon their lawyers to protect their interests that are within the scope of the retention. Indeed, in virtually all litigation contexts, service upon counsel is required—the utilization review process is no exception, since, as the majority observes, the Department’s regulations require service by certified mail of a determination upon claimants’ counsel, if known. <em>See </em>34 Pa.Code § 127.476(c), (e).
