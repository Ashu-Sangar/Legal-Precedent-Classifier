Schroeder (“Mrs. Schroeder”) consulted with G. William Jaquiss, M.D. (“Dr. Jaquiss”) about a growth in her left external ear canal. After excising the growth, Dr. Jaquiss recommended that Mrs. Schroeder undergo additional surgery. Donald B. Kamerer, M.D. (“Dr. Kamerer”) seconded Dr. Jaquiss’ opinion. Mrs. Schroeder accepted Dr. Jaquiss’ recommendation and executed a form entitled “Consent to Surgery or Other Procedure” for a “Lateral parodectomy with <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>nerve dissection; Radical excision external auditory canal lesion; without neck dissection.” Dr. Jaquiss performed a second operation on Mrs. Schroeder, assisted by Stephen Goldman, M.D. (“Dr. Goldman”).

Originally, the Act was an exception to the general rule of witness competency that was set forth in the Act of 1869, P.L. 30 and later, in the Act of May 23, 1887, P.L. 158. <em>See </em>former 28 P.S. § 322; George M.

    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[294,1022,1155,1104]]]'>The Dead Man’s Act itself does not address the circumstances by which a decedent’s representative waives the statute’s protection during the discovery process. The courts, however, have applied the doctrine of waiver to the Act in this context. <em>See, e.g., Perlis, </em><a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.2d%20156" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="195 A.2d 156">195 A.2d at 156</a>. The principle that presently controls was set forth in <em>Anderson v. Hughes, <a href="/pa/417/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="417 Pa. 87" data-case-ids="1894045" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0087-01">417 </a></em><a href="/pa/417/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="417 Pa. 87" data-case-ids="1894045" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0087-01">Pa. 87</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20789" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="208 A.2d 789">208 A.2d 789</a> (1965). It provides that when a decedent before he died or a decedents representative has required an adverse party to be deposed or to answer interrogatories, any objection based upon the Dead Man’s Act to the competency of such a party to testify at the trial is waived, even though the discovery is not offered in evidence. <em>Anderson, </em><a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20789" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="208 A.2d 789">208 A.2d at </a>791 (citing <em>Perlis, </em><a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.2d%20156" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="195 A.2d 156">195 A.2d at </a>156 and <em>Rosche v.

At the time this rule arose, the courts apparently viewed the taking of discovery as the functional equivalent of trial testimony, and in developing the rule, sought to prevent the unfairness that they perceived would ensue if a decedent’s representative could gain information from an adverse party through discovery and then repudiate the results, if what was learned proved to be unsatisfactory. <em>See Perlis, </em><a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.2d%20156" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="195 A.2d 156">195 A.2d at 158-59</a>.</p>

      <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>Turning to the instant case, it is this principle that Appellants argue was violated when the Superior Court held against them, and when it looked to Pa.R.C.P. 4016(b) to reach its decision. According to Appellants, the Superior Court should have realized that because the Dead Man’s Act is contrary to the general rule of witness competence, the Pennsylvania courts have limited the Act’s application by determining that it is waived if not raised on every occasion in which adverse testimony is elicited. Thus, once the Estate failed to appear at the depositions of adverse parties and raise the Act, the Act was waived, and no inquiry should have been made under Pa.R.C.P 4016(b) to determine whether or not an objection under the statute was preserved for trial. Appellants further contend that even if the Estate did not waive the Act by not appearing at the depositions, Pa.R.C. P. 4016(b) is inapt because it only applies to objections to a witness’ mental incapacity.</p>
    <p id="b517-4" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[167,1225,1151,736]]]'>The Estate counters that it followed the only instruction that relevant cases give to a decedent’s representative who seeks to avoid waiving the Act <em>i.e., </em>it refrained from conducting discovery of incompetent witnesses. The Estate further asserts that caselaw does not require the courts, as Appellants argue, to limit routinely the Dead Man’s Act’s application through the waiver doctrine, and that the courts could not have intended, as Appellants suggest, to obligate a party, who simply chooses to'benefit from the Act’s protection, to bear the burden of objecting to every deposition question and every interrogatory that may fall within the Act’s purview. Lastly, the Estate contends that under Pa.R.C.P. 4016(b), its Dead Man’s Act objections did not have to be made at the depositions taken of Appellants, Dr. Kamerer, and Dr. Goldman.</p>

The common law principle that we have heretofore articulated on waiver of the Dead Man’s Act in discovery is clear—a decedent’s representative waives the Act by taking the deposition of or requiring answers to interrogatories from an adverse party, whether or not he places the results of such discovery on the record. <em>Anderson v. Hughes, </em><a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20789" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="208 A.2d 789">208 A.2d at 791</a>. Therefore, because the Estate <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>refrained from engaging in such discovery, the <em>Anderson </em>waiver principle was not implicated. Moreover, the principle that has been in place has not required a decedent’s representative to present himself at the depositions of such parties just so he can raise the Act nor has the principle provided that the Act must be raised on every conceivable pretrial occasion when inquiries are made of an adverse party. <em><a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20789" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="208 A.2d 789">Id.</a> </em>Thus, we conclude that the Estate’s decision not to attend and raise the Act at the depositions of Mrs. Schroeder, Dr. Kamerer and Dr. Goldman did not amount to waiver under this principle.</p>
    <p id="b518-4" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[281,857,1157,852]]]'>We also agree that the rules of discovery did not otherwise require the Estate to raise the Dead Man’s Act when Mrs. Schroeder and the Estate’s co-defendants were deposed in order to preserve the objection for trial. In this regard, Rule 4016(b) applies, since it specifies what objections “are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of the deposition....” Pa.R.C.P. 4016(b). The Rule refers to “[objections to the competency of a witness ... .’’in general, and notwithstanding Appellants’ assertion to the contrary, includes no limitations on the objections to a witness’ competency it covers. Pa.R.C.P. 4016(b). Thus, inasmuch as the parties taking the depositions of Mrs. Schroeder and Drs. Kamerer and Goldman could not have “obviated or removed” any Dead Man’s Act objection the Estate would have made, under Pa.R.C.P. 4016(b), we conclude that the Estate did not waive the Act by not raising it at those depositions.</p>

We observe that the Superior Court’s determination that the trial court’s error prejudiced the Estate was limited to the informed consent claim that Mrs. Schroeder brought against the Estate, and did not include a determination as to whether the error also prejudiced the Estate with respect to Mrs. Schroeder’s negligence claim. Nevertheless, we conclude that the verdict in its entirety must be vacated because the jury found in Mrs. Schroeder's favor and against the Estate without making any distinction between the informed consent and negligence claims.</p>
