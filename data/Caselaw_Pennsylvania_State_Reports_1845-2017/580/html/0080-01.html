Whether the purpose is to give the intermediate court the opportunity to ensure the accuracy and consistency of judicial outcomes in cases where our discretionary review is not warranted or to ask the intermediate appellate court to review an issue, usually created by intervening circumstances, in a matter that we believe may merit our review, a GVR Order is not a direction to the intermediate appellate court that it must go in the opposite direction.

In summary, the unfunded grant applications under review bear a sufficiently close nexus to the Department’s decision-making (which entails either rejecting them, or, apparently, deciding not to review them at all) to fall within the Right to Know Act’s definition of public records, <em>see </em>65 P.S. § 66.1(2). <em>See generally North Hills News Record v.

Moreover, to permit the Department’s explanation that its decisions are predicated upon recommendations from legislators, as opposed to any competitive review process, to control the public’s right to access would subvert the Act’s salutary purposes. <em>See id. </em>at 692-94.</p>
