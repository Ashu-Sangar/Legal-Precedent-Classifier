In the first instance, the record establishes that Appellant plainly knew that Robles had a tattoo reading “Gambino,” as his trial counsel actually asked Robles about the tattoo during cross-examination. <em>See </em>N.T., 11/20/97, at 528-29 (testimony from Robles in response to question from defense counsel that he has a tattoo that says “Gambino”). As for Appellant’s contention regarding the fact that Robles was a member of the NLC and that members of the NLC had tattoos, the record clearly reflects that, at the very least, Appellant could have uncovered this evidence prior to trial with reasonable diligence. <em>See </em>Aff. of Iris Alvarez, attached to Appellant’s Mot. for Certificate of Materiality Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5961 <em>et seq., </em>3/20/01 (stating that, as Appellant’s then-girlfriend and Robles’ cousin, she possessed information that Robles was a member of the NLC and that members of the NLC had tattoos). Thus, it is clear that there was no <em>Brady </em>violation in connection with this information. <em>See Morris, </em><a href="/pa/573/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="822 A.2d 684" data-case-ids="197188,9131837" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0157-01,/a2d/822/0684-01">822 A.2d at 696</a>.</p>

Tr. Ct. Findings of Fact in Disposition of Def.’s Pretrial Omnibus Mot., 7/17/97, at 6. Accordingly, as with his claim regarding the tattoos, Appellant has completely failed to establish that the Commonwealth violated <em>Brady, </em>as the record shows that he was already well aware of the information allegedly withheld by the Commonwealth. <em>See Morris, </em><a href="/pa/573/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="822 A.2d 684" data-case-ids="197188,9131837" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0157-01,/a2d/822/0684-01">822 A.2d at 696</a>.</p>

Thus, Appellant has simply failed to show that the Commonwealth violated <em>Brady </em>and we therefore agree with the PCRA court that Appellant has, in turn, failed to satisfy any of the exceptions to the PCRA’s time restrictions based on his <em>Brady </em>claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

This claim is completely disingenuous, however, as Appellant’s counsel did in fact interview Robles <em>twice </em>prior to Appellant’s trial. <em>See </em>Tr. Ct. Op., 6/3/98, at 18. Moreover, Appellant does not address why he could not get the information contained in Robles’ affidavit from other sources. Instead, Appellant appears to argue that, even if this information had been available prior to the taking of the affidavit, the fact that Robles subsequently <em>admitted </em>to these alleged facts brings his claim within the scope of the after-discovered evidence exception. The after-discovered evidence <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>exception, however, focuses on newly discovered <em>facts, </em>not on a newly discovered or a newly willing source for previously known facts. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(ii). Thus, a witness’ admission of evidence previously available to a petitioner cannot resurrect an untimely PCRA claim as such a result would clearly run contrary to the plain language of the exception that “the <em>facts </em>upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner....” <em>See <a href="/pa/573/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="822 A.2d 684" data-case-ids="197188,9131837" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0157-01,/a2d/822/0684-01">id.</a> </em>(emphasis added).</p>

        <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>1. Robles was a member of the group called Nyte Life Clique ("NLC”), which enabled him to "run the streets,” <em>i.e., </em>engage in drug trafficking.</blockquote>

      <blockquote id="b727-11" data-blocks='[["BL_727.6",727,[193,1841,1120,68]]]'>5. Robles' relationship with law enforcement grew out of the fact that he ran the streets from 1994 to 2001.</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b727-12" data-blocks='[["BL_727.7",727,[190,1920,1123,430]]]'>6. Robles arranged for Appellant, who had been injured at the crime scene, to leave the hospital and come and stay with him for protection. Appellant’s PCRA petition, 9/12/03, Affidavit of George Robles. As a threshold issue, we note that Appellant fails to mention in his brief to this Court that Robles actually struck out two statements, numbered 3 and 5 above, in the affidavit and struck out the last portion of the statement numbered 1 above, <em>i.e., </em>that he engaged in drug trafficking. Thus, any of Appellant’s arguments that are based on those statements necessarily fail and we will review only those arguments offered by Appellant that are based on the statements in the affidavit that were not crossed out by Robles.</blockquote>

      <p id="b729-6" data-blocks='[["BL_729.5",729,[163,1691,1152,666]]]'>. In apparent support of his general allegation that the Commonwealth withheld information reflecting that Robles had an improper relationship with the police, Appellant seems to aver that the Commonwealth also withheld a letter Robles wrote to Officer Cabrera, evidence that Robles was paying off the police, as well as a material witness bail reduction report relating to Robles. However, given that Appellant has previously brought <em>Brady </em>claims, on direct appeal or in his first PCRA petition, based on these very pieces of evidence, it is abundantly clear that Appellant cannot now say that any of this evidence is "newly-discovered” or that he brought this claim within 60 days of the date the claim could have been presented. <em>See Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/572/0283-02" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="815 A.2d 563" data-case-ids="716536,9333238" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0283-02,/a2d/815/0563-01">815 A.2d at 573</a> (rejecting Appellant’s <em>Brady </em>claim based on bail report and "pay-off" evidence); <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/a2d/727/1089-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="727 A.2d 1089" data-case-ids="11633731,607174" data-case-paths="/a2d/727/1089-01,/pa/556/0216-01">727 A.2d at 1094-96</a> (rejecting Appellant’s <em>Brady </em>claim based on letter Robles wrote to Officer Cabrera). Thus, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that his petition fits within any of the timeliness exceptions based on a <em>Brady </em>claim relating to these particular pieces of evidence.</p>

      <p id="b730-7" data-blocks='[["BL_730.6",730,[280,1885,1156,464]]]'>. Within his argument that his petition fits within two of the exceptions to the timeliness requirements of the PCRA, Appellant argues that dismissing his petition would constitute a miscarriage of justice because the prosecution violated his fundamental constitutional rights, the PCRA court’s reasoning was incorrect, and the PCRA court was biased against him. This Court has held, however, that an allegation of miscarriage of justice may not be considered unless the Court has jurisdiction to review the appellant’s petition, and such jurisdiction does not exist when the appellant’s petition is untimely and fails to satisfy one of the exceptions to the PCRA timeliness requirements. <em>Commonwealth v.
