In this regard, Bottomer relied on provisions of the policy extending UIM coverage to resident relatives. The policy, however, also contained a household exclusion, which specified that coverage would not extend to a injury sustained in vehicle owned by the named insured or a relative, but which was not covered under the policy (it is undisputed that Bottomer’s automobile did not qualify as a covered vehicle under the policy terms).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Progressive denied coverage based on this exclusion, • and filed a declaratory judgment action naming Bottomer and her parents as defendants and seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a determination concerning the enforceability of the exclusionary provision.</p>

Goodheart, and the arbitration matters to the Honorable John W. Herron. Judge Herron agreed with Progressive’s position and dismissed Bottomer’s petition to compel arbitration without prejudice, with leave for her to refile upon resolution of the declaratory judgment proceedings. Judge Herron reasoned, primarily, that dismissal was appropriate pursuant to the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>as it applies to prior pending proceedings, since the parties, rights asserted, and relief sought were substantially the same. <em>See generally Virginia Mansions Condo.

Alternatively, Judge Herron indicated that his intention was that his order should be considered tantamount to a stay rather than a final disposition of Bottomer’s petition, since he had dismissed the petition without prejudice and with a specific proviso authorizing refilling in the event that Bottomer would prevail in the declaratory judgment action. In both regards, Judge Herron expressed a particularized concern regarding the duplicative expenditure of judicial resources if both proceedings were permitted to go forward concurrently, and the specter of coequal jurists potentially rendering disparate rulings.</p>

I write separately to emphasize the need for full review of the holding enunciated in this case, and to foreshadow what could become a concern as subsequent cases involving this paradigm develop.</p>

Presumably, we would be in a posture to decide the case <em>sub judice, </em>but for a procedural anomaly. In the declaratory judgment action, the trial court granted summary judgment for Appellant insurance company thwarting Appellee’s averred right to arbitrate her claims. Appellee failed to file a timely post-trial motion, thereby, precluding both additional review of the trial court’s disposition in the declaratory judgment case and Appellee’s opportunity to arbitrate this matter; thus, mooting the case.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[165,866,1154,741]]]'>It concerns me that after both a declaratory judgment and arbitration are initiated, one or the other could repeatedly be concluded prior to this Court having the opportunity to determine the propriety of the two cases proceeding simultaneously, perhaps impacting the second case; as happened here. If this scenario would repeat,'I would not necessarily find that the completion of one of the two cases mooted appellate review. Instead, I would recognize these as matters capable of repetition but generally'evading appellate review, and invoke the doctrine permitting examination of such cases. <em>See Legal Capital, L.L.C. v.
