Eleftheriou gave O’Donnell a handful of cash, and the two made arrangements to meet again later that evening. After closing the pizza shop, Eleftheriou met O’Donnell at a street corner and then accompanied her to the apartment. That evening, appellant and O’Donnell murdered Eleftheriou, dismembered his body, and stole from him some money and a credit card. The next day, appellant used the credit card to buy some articles of clothing for his children.</p>

Following the arrests, the police searched the apartment and recovered a chisel, a claw hammer, and a serrated knife— each having traces of human tissue and blood matching that of the victim—from the apartment basement where it was determined that the victim had been dismembered. In addition, the police found a pencil case containing the victim’s severed penis. At police headquarters, both appellant and O’Donnell <a id="p654" href="#p654" data-label="654" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*654</a>confessed separately, each claiming to be the sole killer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Each also stated that the other had assisted only in disposing of the body.</p>

At trial, the Commonwealth presented expert testimony from an assistant medical examiner that the initial blow to Eleftheriou’s head knocked him unconscious and that every blow thereafter was inflicted upon a head that was not moving. The expert further testified that red abrasions in the areas where the head and right arm were severed indicated that the victim’s heart was still beating when those body parts were severed. The expert concluded that, because the victim was a muscular man, one person acting alone could not have removed both the head and the arm in fifteen minutes, which was the amount of time it would have taken for the victim to bleed to death.</p>

On that same day, both appellant and O’Donnell waived their rights to a penalty phase jury, and the trial judge conducted and concluded a joint penalty phase hearing.

On December 15, 1998, the trial court granted a motion to stay execution, filed on appellant’s behalf by Attorney Fruchter. On April 19, 1999, the court appointed Ramy I. Djerassi, Esq., to represent appellant. Appellant filed a counseled amended petition for PCRA relief on December 22, 1999, in which he claimed that he was entitled to a new penalty phase hearing due to trial counsel’s ineffective assistance in failing to object to a defective jury waiver colloquy and in failing to present additional mitigation evidence. A supplemental amended petition was filed on March 28, 2000, which claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that trial counsel was ineffective for withdrawing a pre-trial severance motion and for not objecting to certain hearsay admitted at trial. Arguments were heard before the Honorable James A. Lineberger, but no evidentiary hearing was granted. On March 21, 2001, the PCRA court entered an order granting appellant a new penalty hearing based on his claim of counsel ineffec<a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>tiveness in failing to object to the jury waiver colloquy.

On its penalty phase cross-appeal, the Commonwealth claims that the PCRA court erred in awarding a new penalty hearing on appellant’s claim of counsel ineffectiveness for failing to object to the penalty phase jury waiver colloquy.

Where appellant there complained of a confrontation clause issue arising from the admission of O’Donnell’s confession at the joint trial, he now alleges that counsel should have preempted the problem entirely by seeking severance. Severance (along with redaction of the confession, exclusion of the confession, limiting charges, etc.) is one of several theoretical ways in which the underlying confrontation/ <em>Bruton </em>style issue may be addressed or remedied. Though the specific remedial precaution differs, the trial issue sought to be avoided is the same: <em>i.e., </em>the potential for spillover prejudice arising from admission of a non-testifying co-defendant’s confession in a joint trial. Thus, appellant’s litigation of the confrontation claim on direct appeal necessarily involved an issue that is also at the heart of appellant’s current underlying severance <em>argument—i.e., </em>that the admission of O’Donnell’s confession against her inculpated and thereby prejudiced appellant.

      <a id="p676" href="#p676" data-label="676" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*676</a>Moreover, as a general and practical matter, the fact that a claim is litigated through the lens of counsel ineffectiveness, rather than as a preserved claim of trial court error, makes it more difficult for the defendant to prevail. For example, an apparently meritorious but defaulted claim may fail to secure collateral relief if counsel had an objectively reasonable basis for failing to pursue the claim. In addition, assuming a claim of merit, the burden and standard of proof applicable in assessing prejudice differs. This Court addressed the difference in <em>Commonwealth v.

This standard is different from the harmless error analysis that is typically applied when determining whether the trial court erred in taking or failing to take certain action. The harmless error standard, as set forth by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Story, </em>476 Pa. [391,] 409, 383 A.2d [155,] 164 [ (Pa.1978) ] (citations omitted), states that “[w]henever there is a <em>‘reasonable </em>possibility’ that an error ‘might have contributed to the conviction,’ the error is not harmless.” This standard, which places the burden on the Commonwealth to show that the error did not contribute to the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt, is a lesser standard than the <em>Pierce </em>prejudice standard, which requires the defendant to show that counsel’s conduct had an actual adverse effect on the outcome of the proceedings. This distinction appropriately arises from the difference between a direct attack on error occurring at trial and a collateral attack on the stewardship of counsel. In a collateral attack, we first presume that counsel is effective, and that not every error by counsel can or will result in a constitutional violation of a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Pierce, supra.</em>

The four corners of that same colloquy likewise do not definitively reveal that appellant’s waiver of his right to a penalty phase jury was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.

We have no doubt that, even before the decision in <em>O’Donnell </em>was issued, counsel was obliged, at a minimum, to apprise his client of the nature and importance of the jury trial right at issue; the manner in which a penalty phase jury operates, including the role of mitigating and aggravating circumstances and the requirement of jury unanimity; and the relative advantages and disadvantages in choosing a jury trial versus a bench trial, both as a general matter and in light of the circumstances of the particular case.</p>

On such a record, we cannot assess whether appellant’s waiver was in fact knowing, voluntary and intelligent—except to the extent we are guided by the presumption that counsel was both competent and speaking truthfully. But, on this collateral attack, counsel’s competence is the very question at issue. Resolution of the question depends in large part upon the substance of the private communications between appellant and trial counsel. Since the trial court disposed of this ineffectiveness claim without holding an evidentiary hearing— albeit it did so in appellant’s favor—neither appellant nor his trial counsel were heard from on the issue.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> It may be that counsel made clear to appellant in private the very points that this Court determined essential to a valid jury waiver colloquy in <em>O’Donnell, </em>in which case the ineffectiveness claim should fail.

On the other hand, it may be that appellant ceded this important right without having been apprised by his attorney of its importance, its nature and contours, and its strategic advantages—including the fact that to secure a successful result before a jury at the penalty phase, appellant needed only to convince one of twelve jurors that any mitigating circumstance(s) that the juror might find outweighed the single aggravating circumstance which was alleged and proven.</p>

Appellant argues that his mother, his father, and his brother were available and willing to testify to appellant’s good character; his family history of alcohol abuse; his parents’ divorce; his history of abusing alcohol, marijuana, and heroin; O’Donnell’s “terrible influence” on him; and his extreme mental or emotional disturbance.

Appellant devotes the bulk of his Brief of Cross-Appellee to a separate argument that, in these "extraordinary circumstances,” he should be entitled to the benefit of relaxed waiver. Thus, rather than evaluate his claim under the test for counsel ineffectiveness, appellant submits that he should be treated as if his collateral review situation were identical to O'Donnell’s situation on direct review. Not to afford him identical treatment, appellant argues, would introduce an element of arbitrariness into capital sentencing and would deny him due process and equal protection. However, appellant did not claim that he was entitled to the benefit of relaxed waiver below, instead, he raised and prevailed upon this claim as a preserved and cognizable claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness. Nor did appellant ever raise the distinct claim below that a failure to treat him identically to O'Donnell would be arbitrary and would violate equal protection and due process. We will not resurrect the relaxed waiver rule on this collateral appeal to rule upon a different and distinct constitutional claim than the claim pursued below. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
