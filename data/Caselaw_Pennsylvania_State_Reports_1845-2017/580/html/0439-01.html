As he was shot, Lamb fell against one of his friends, Jeffrey Rahming (“Rahming”). When Appellant turned to flee, he tripped over Edward Jackson (“Jackson”), who had dived onto the floor during the shooting; while they were on the floor together, Jackson was able to view Appellant’s face before he scrambled to his feet and ran outside. Jackson and Rahming provided police with descriptions of what they had witnessed, and in March of 1982, police conducted a lineup with Appellant. Although Rahming identified Appellant as the perpetrator, Jackson did not. Appellant was charged with Lamb’s murder; however, at the initial preliminary hearing, Rahming failed to identify Appellant, and the charges were dismissed.</p>

Jackson described the circumstances surrounding the shooting; acknowledged that he told police that he could identify the perpetrator; stated that, although he recognized Appellant in the lineup, he selected another individual because Appellant had threatened him; and explained that he told police of the reason for his actions at the lineup one week before the trial. Jackson then identified Appellant as the individual who shot Lamb. During his testimony, Rahming began by acknowledging his prior criminal record; he then related his observations of Lamb’s killing, which he had given to police the day of the incident, and identified Appellant as having committed the crime. Like Jackson, Rahming said that Appellant had threatened him and, as a result, although he had identified Appellant at the lineup, he declined to implicate him at the preliminary hearing. Gainer testified to Appellant’s admission and to having related it to Officer Fleming. In addition, both Gainer and his girlfriend, Linda Blakney, indicated that they had received telephone calls from Appellant entreating Gainer not to testify against him, which Blakney interpreted as threatening. Appellant did not testify during the guilt phase, and the sole defense witness was Steven Whitfield, Appellant’s fellow prison inmate, who claimed that he had been in the bar at the time of Lamb’s killing and had seen the perpetrator, who was not Appellant.</p>

The jury returned a verdict of death, finding both aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. On direct appeal, new counsel was appointed, raising, <em>inter alia, </em>issues related to after-discovered evidence in the nature of a recantation by Rahming; trial counsel’s ineffectiveness in failing to present evidence that Appellant believed that the victim had killed Appellant’s adopted brother; and the trial court’s penalty-phase instructions, which purportedly did not explain that unanimity was not required in the finding of mitigating circumstances pursuant to the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Mills v.

The petition set forth numerous claims of error, including, with respect to the guilt phase of the trial, allegations that trial and appellate counsel were ineffective in failing to challenge the admission of hearsay evidence that improperly bolstered the testimony of Jackson, Rahming, and Gainer, and that the Commonwealth had used perjured testimony and withheld exculpatory and discoverable evidence involving threats and coercion by the police in relation to these same witnesses. As to the penalty phase claims, Appellant averred that: trial counsel had failed to investigate and present certain mitigating evidence, namely, parental and other abuse during childhood and the existence of mental health problems; trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the court’s <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>exclusion of relevant mitigating evidence bearing upon Appellant’s motive for the killing; the aggravating circumstances concerning creation of a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense and significant history of felony convictions involving the threat or use of violence are unconstitutionally vague; the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that, if Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment, he would not be eligible for parole; and the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that unanimity was not required in the finding of mitigating circumstances. In addition, the petition contained a general allegation of ineffectiveness on the part of trial and appellate counsel and asserted that the cumulative effect of each of the asserted errors denied Appellant a fair trial.</p>

Regarding the exculpatory evidence claim, the proofs expanded beyond the allegation in the PCRA petition to include both nondisclosure of a criminal conviction on the part of Jackson and mental health diagnoses for Jackson and Rahming. In this regard, PCRA counsel, relying upon a 1981 pre-sentence investigation for Jackson, elicited that he had been convicted for impersonating a public servant (a police officer), <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 4912,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> had suffered two fractured skulls, and had been diagnosed as easily confused and as having a weak memory. Appellant also offered expert testimony regarding Jackson’s mental health from a psychiatrist, Julie Kessel, M.D., who reviewed the 1981 psychological evaluation and <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>opined that Jackson would have difficulty recalling events accurately and “confabulates.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Rahming testified, recanting his identification of Appellant as the perpetrator of the homicide,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and acknowledging that he had been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia; further, contrary to his trial testimony, Rahming admitted to having ingested alcohol, marijuana, and psychotropic medication at the time that he witnessed the shooting. Rahming also claimed that: a detective had offered him cocaine in exchange for his signed statement implicating Appellant; someone in the District Attorney’s Office had given him money to sign the statement; and a detective from the District Attorney’s Office had taken him to a hospital following his testimony at trial, where he was admitted for a psychiatric evaluation. As with Jackson, Appellant introduced expert testimony from Dr. Kessel, who reviewed Rahming’s mental health records and concluded that the psychiatric hospitalization following his testimony at trial suggests that he may not have been able to differentiate reality from delusion.</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[293,1355,1151,419]]]'>Appellant also presented witnesses who claimed that: Gainer had admitted to having testified falsely at Appellant’s trial; Officer Fleming was aware of a gambling business run by Gainer’s father; and Gainer provided information in exchange for police protection of his father’s business. In this same vein, Appellant called witnesses who indicated that Officer Fleming harassed and threatened Jackson, Rahming, and Gainer to incriminate Appellant.</p>

When questioned as to whether he had ever given money to Gainer, Officer Fleming admitted to having occasionally made interest-free loans to Gainer. The assistant district attorney who prosecuted Appellant ac<a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>knowledged that she would have disclosed Jackson’s conviction for impersonating a public servant had she been aware of it,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> and asserted that she did not have access to probation records, which would have revealed the existence of mental health issues concerning Jackson and Rahming. <em>See generally </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 703(A) (providing for the confidentiality of presentence reports and related psychological and psychiatric reports). Moreover, she did not recall that Rahming had been taken to a hospital following his testimony for purposes of a psychiatric admission, although she noted that Rahming was homeless and had at one point lived in a shelter. The remaining guilt-phase issue developed during the hearings was the alleged existence of an alibi for Appellant, for which Appellant presented testimony from a former employer, who stated that he had checked a calendar in his shop, which he no longer had in his possession, to determine that Appellant had been working on the day of the homicide.</p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[168,1226,1152,511]]]'>In his testimony concerning various guilt-phase issues, trial counsel stated that, during his conversations with Appellant, there was never any mention of a potential alibi; rather, their discussions centered solely upon challenging the identification testimony. Trial counsel testified that, had he been aware of Jackson’s prior record, he would have used it to impeach him and, similarly, had he been aware of the mental health histories of Jackson and Rahming, he would have attempted to use such information to challenge the credibility of their identifications.</p>

Appellant also presented expert testimony from two psychiatrists, Richard Dudley, M.D., and Dr. Kessel, and a neuropsychologist, Barry Crown, Ph.D., each of whom examined Appellant and reviewed 1975 psychological and psychiatric evaluations of him, together <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>with affidavits from friends and family members. Dr. Dudley concluded that Appellant suffered from serious cognitive deficits and a delusional disorder, which he characterized as an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, and which he determined was present at the time he committed the offense. Dr. Dudley noted that evidence of Appellant’s cognitive deficits was indicated in Appellant’s school records, and the 1975 mental health evaluation of Appellant prior to the offense would have raised concerns, warranting further investigation. Dr. Kessel reached similar conclusions, although she acknowledged that Appellant “was absolutely unrevealing of overt pathology” and desperately wanted to appear mentally well during her examination. According to Dr. Crown, neuropsychological testing revealed that Appellant had brain damage and a borderline IQ, which he described as a substantial impairment.</p>
    <p id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[281,1168,1155,726]]]'>Responding to such evidence, trial counsel conceded that he did not interview witnesses or family members in preparation for the penalty phase or secure Appellant’s school or probation records, explaining that his reason for such decision was that Appellant was not interested in mitigation and was adamant in this regard. Furthermore, trial counsel emphasized that he had discussed the statutory mitigating circumstances with Appellant and the need to call upon family members, and that the trial court had similarly questioned Appellant concerning such evidence. Although noting that Appellant did not appear to be mentally impaired, trial counsel acknowledged that, had he been aware of the psychological report in Appellant’s probation records, it would have prompted further investigation.</p>

In its opinion pursuant to Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925, addressing the hearsay claim of improper bolstering, the court noted that such evidence related to the prior consistent statements of Jackson, Rahming, and Gainer. Portraying Appellant’s defense as centered upon the credibility of those witnesses, the court determined that the admission of their prior <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>consistent statements during direct examination was proper. Concerning the claim of perjured testimony and recantation by Rahming, the court observed that Rahming had recanted prior to Appellant’s direct appeal, that this Court had rejected such claim, and that Rahming’s most recent recantation was inconsistent with the earlier version. The court thus determined that Appellant was not eligible for relief, since this issue had been previously litigated. Describing the evidence concerning Jackson’s purported perjury as in the form of unsubstantiated hearsay, the court found that the claim was not cognizable. The court did not discuss this allegation as it related to Gainer. The court next addressed Appellant’s alibi claim, finding that such evidence lacked any credibility, since an individual with an alibi would have informed his lawyer of it at some point between 1981 and the time of Appellant’s trial, 1988.</p>
    <p id="b579-5" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[158,1176,1164,1172]],["BL_580.1",580,[294,315,1149,150]]]'>As to the penalty phase, and in particular the claim that trial counsel failed to present mitigating evidence, the court found that Appellant’s allegation concerning the mental health evidence was without merit, reasoning that there was no evidence to establish that Appellant suffered from the alleged mental disturbances at the time of the murder or that such evidence was available to trial counsel. Furthermore, the court indicated (erroneously) that Appellant had not produced any evidence to show that a mental health professional or any doctor had examined him prior to the commission of the murder. Thus, the court reasoned, the opinion testimony of Drs. Dudley and Crown was unconvincing, as it was unsupported by pre-existing medical evidence and, instead, was premised upon interviews of Appellant and affidavits from his friends and family members. The court also stated (also erroneously) that Dr. Dudley never examined Appellant; observed that given Appellant’s strategy of denying commission of the killing, the mitigation evidence would have weakened the evidence presented; and concluded that Appellant had failed to demonstrate that such evidence would have led the jury to find one or more mitigating circumstances that would have equaled or outweighed the aggravating circumstances. <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>The court did not otherwise address the mitigating evidence surrounding Appellant’s purported abuse during childhood or the opinions of Dr. Kessel.</p>

As to the challenges involving the aggravating circumstances of a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence and knowingly creating a grave risk of death to another, the court ruled that these circumstances were not unconstitutionally vague. The court rejected Appellant’s assertion that he was entitled to an instruction that life imprisonment in Pennsylvania means life without the possibility of parole, as Appellant’s case predated the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Simmons v. South Carolina, </em><a href="/us/512/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="512 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="39205" data-case-paths="/us/512/0154-01">512 U.S. 154</a>, <a href="/us/512/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="512 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="39205" data-case-paths="/us/512/0154-01">114 S.Ct. 2187</a>, <a href="/us/512/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="512 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="39205" data-case-paths="/us/512/0154-01">129 L.Ed.2d 133</a> (1994), which required the instruction where future dangerousness was at issue. Moreover, the court found that, even if such instruction was required at the time of Appellant’s trial, future dangerousness had not been placed before the jury.

The Majority’s analysis leaves the impression that, if the Court were in agreement with the substance of the <em>Frey </em>decision, reconsideration of the previously litigated claim would be appropriate upon PCRA review.

The PCRA contains no such exception to the previous litigation bar for the very reason that decisions of lower federal courts do not bind this Court. Thus, for PCRA previous litigation purposes, it would not matter if a majority of this Court evolved to feel that the <em>Frey </em>Court articulated a “better” view of the <em>Mills </em>question: the point is that final decisions of issues cannot be subject to relitigation every time a court somewhere renders a decision which may be helpful to the defendant.

The Majority expands upon the procedural rule found in the <em>Crawley </em>footnote, as it directs that “a trial court should conduct an on-the-record colloquy informing [the defendant] of the right to present such proof, its importance, and, after ensuring that he understands the importance and the risks associated with a waiver, whether he wishes to forego the presentation of mitigating evidence.” Slip op. at 934-35 n. 20. Respectfully, I think that the question of whether or when the trial court should be deemed obliged to conduct such a colloquy <em>sua sponte, </em>as well as the question of the specific contours of the inquiry, should be reached only in a case actually posing such issues with adversarial presentations; or failing that, in connection with the more thorough evaluation which would be available in the formal rule-making arena.

The Supreme Court’s holding on <em>Mills </em>retroactivity proves the error inherent in this Court's former relaxed waiver practice, to the extent that relaxed waiver permitted entirely new procedural rules of constitutional dimension in capital cases, which were not themselves entitled to retroactive application, to operate retroactively in trials in which the relevant objection was never timely raised. <em>See Commonwealth v. Freeman, </em><a href="/pa/573/0532-02" class="citation" data-index="155" data-cite="573 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="197204,197206" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0532-02,/pa/573/0532-01">573 Pa. 532</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0532-02" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="827 A.2d 385" data-case-ids="197204,197206,197235,9108637,9108680,9108745" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0532-02,/pa/573/0532-01,/pa/573/0531-01,/a2d/827/0385-01,/a2d/827/0385-02,/a2d/827/0385-03">827 A.2d 385</a>, 395-96 (2003). Such is apparently what occurred in this case, as this Court entertained a waived <em>Mills </em>claim on direct review. In my view, the Supreme Court having definitively rejected the retroactive application of <em>Mills, </em>that case cannot fairly form the basis for any successful collateral attack—whether previously litigated or not—upon a conviction secured before the case was decided, where the defendant did not raise the <em>Mills </em>objection at trial.
