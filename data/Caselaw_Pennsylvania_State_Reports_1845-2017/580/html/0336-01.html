Finally, “in light of [its] <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>decision to award the license to [Allegheny],” the court reversed the Board’s award of a license to HTA.</p>

Nevertheless, according to HTA, and pursuant to the reasoning of the Opinion in Support of Reversal’s reasoning, the court was not permitted to review the propriety of the grant of licenses to HTA and Pappan’s. Section 464 of the Liquor Code, however, provides that when an appeal is taken to the common pleas court, the court “shall hear the appeal <em>de novo” </em>and “shall either sustain or over-rule the action of the [B]oard and <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>either order or deny the issuance of a new license.. .to the applicant.”</p>

In my view, this logic is flawed as the trial court was required to review the entire adjudication of the Board in order to adjudicate the propriety of the Board’s denial of Allegheny and Nilo’s license applications. Otherwise .the right to appeal would be a right with no remedy, which is inconsistent with basic jurisprudence.</p>

However, such “remedy” would not provide Allegheny and Nilo with the statutory remedy afforded them by the legislature through the Liquor Code as disappointed applicants. To the contrary, as noted previously, the legislative policy set forth in the Code envisions the common pleas court, a local court of record, as having <em>de novo </em>review and making <em>de novo </em>findings regarding decisions of the Board. Further, the legislature mandated in the Liquor Code that the common pleas court be able to effect a remedy in accordance with such findings. 47 P.S. § 4-464. The “remedy” of an appeal to the Commonwealth Court is hollow compared to Allegheny and Nilo’s remedy by way of the Liquor Code, as that court cannot conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the Board’s decision. <em>See </em>Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. § 704. As the legislature has clearly provided a denied applicant the right to <em>de novo </em>review and the common pleas court is permitted to act upon its findings by rendering a disposition of the Board’s adjudication, in my view, it is the view expressed in the Opinion in Support of Reversal, that would alter the jurisdictional scheme set forth by the legislature in the Liquor Code.</p>

In those cases, <em>Application of El Rancho Grande, </em>and <em>Application of Family Style Restaurant, Inc., </em>the appellants were not licensees who were denied a license and had a separate, independent, appeal right pursuant to Section 464 of the Code as did the appellees here. To the contrary, the entities seeking to appeal the grant of the issued licenses in <em>El Rancho </em>and <em>Family Style Restaurant </em>were merely other license holders who sought to establish that the grant of the subject license by the Board would have a negative substantial effect on their businesses. <em>See El Rancho, supra, </em>(individual tavern owners sought to appeal the <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>grant of a new license challenging the necessity of such license in the resort area where they conducted their businesses); <em>see also Family Style Restaurant, supra, </em>(where tavern owners association sought to challenge the award of a new license to a licensee in the same area they conducted their businesses).</p>

The grant of licenses to HTA and Pappan’s and the concomitant denial to the three disappointed applicants are the opposite sides of the same coin. To characterize this one transaction as both a refusal to grant and a grant, and to require two disparate appeals, as the Opinion in Support of Reversal would mandate, leads to a construction of the Liquor Code that both defies logic and violates the core principle of statutory construction prohibiting absurd results. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.1922(1) (the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.)</p>
