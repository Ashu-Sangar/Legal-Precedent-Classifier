Respondent, the District Attorney of Bucks County (“District Attorney”), originally moved to disqualify Counsel from representing Mr. Power on June 30, 2004 and filed a supporting brief with the Honorable Kenneth G. Biehn, Supervising Judge of the Grand Jury, on July 21, 2004. The District Attorney argued that not only was there great potential for conflicts of interest, but that the integrity and effective functioning of the grand jury could be compromised by multiple representation by a single law firm. The Supervising Judge took the matter under advisement, wisely preferring to delay a determination until it became clear whether developments in the case would necessitate the disqualification of Counsel. On September 16, 2004, the date Mr. Power was scheduled to <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>testify before the grand jury, an extensive hearing was held to discuss the disqualification motion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

N.T. 09/16/04, at 16.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> In the District Attorney’s opinion, given the nature of the investigation, Counsel could not adequately represent Mr. Power’s interests because this particular investigation requires secrecy and Counsel could not adequately inform his client of how best to proceed when Counsel has information from the testimony of another client, which he cannot share with this client. The District Attorney questioned how Counsel could separate what they know about one witness’s testimony from another’s. Furthermore, the District Attorney stated that, should one witness choose to cooperate with the investigation and testify against the other witnesses, all of whom are represented by the same counsel, a clear and definite conflict of interest would arise. At the hearing, the Supervising Judge commented that a conflict is further apparent because Counsel is also representing the corporation, and the corporation is paying the attorney fees for all employees, including Mr. Power. <em>Id. </em>at 16-19. The Supervising Judge noted that if Mr. Power were sworn to secrecy, counsel would have significant difficulty providing legal advice to Mr. Adelson if some of Mr. Power’s testimony is conflicting.</p>

      <em>Id. </em>at 22. Counsel further stated that disqualification would jeopardize Mr. Power’s right to counsel of his choice. Counsel then called Mr. Power, who testified that it was his choice to retain current counsel, even though his employer is paying the attorney fees, and that even if he had to pay his own fees, he would maintain current counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 25, 28, 32-33. On cross-examination, Mr. Power admitted that he did not independently choose his counsel, but learned of Counsel through his employer. Co-counsel Mark B. Sheppard testified that, in his opinion, after interviewing both Mr. Power and Mr. Adelson, their testimony is not conflicting. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 43.</p>

On September 21, 2004, the disqualification order was reduced to writing. In an October 4, 2004 opinion supporting the order, the Supervising Judge stated that in this instance, the accumulation of evidence added up to a real likelihood of conflict of interest, and that mere separate representation of upper-level employees by present Counsel and lower-level Voicenet employees by other counsel, as proposed by Counsel, would not obviate that conflict. Furthermore, the Supervising Judge found that the potential for compromising the integrity of the grand jury was significant; that the grand jury cannot effectively function if counsel is privy to the testimony of multiple witnesses; and that the potential for conflict was heightened by the fact that all counsel fees are being paid by one entity, thereby giving rise to divided loyalty by present Counsel. <em>See Wood v.

I fail to see how the Supervising Judge, who is in an infinitely better position than this Court to assess the probability of conflict arising, abused his discretion in finding such a probability here. Notwithstanding this Court’s unusual appellate jurisdiction over grand jury matters, this Court’s appellate task is not to micromanage the grand jury, much less is it to second-guess the discretionary decisions of the Supervising Judge. This Court’s <em>per curiam </em>order identifies no partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill will on this record. The Supervising Judge indicated an awareness of, and applied, the governing law. Nor does this Court’s order explain how his decision is “manifestly unreasonable.” To the contrary, the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court’s finding that the likelihood of conflict here is not imaginary or unlikely. Counsel represent the corporation Voicenet, all of its high-level employees, and all of its low-level employees. Voicenet is paying all attorney fees for representation of all employees. Although Counsel <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>have asserted that they have not yet advised anyone to exercise Fifth Amendment rights or to seek other immunity, and have represented that all witnesses will both tell the truth and testify consistently with one another, the reality is always present that the grand jury may find that one or more of the employees, officers, or the corporation itself engaged in criminal activity, and one or all may be indicted. There are many things that may be disclosed to the grand jury that the witness would otherwise not reveal—even to counsel. And a witness may ultimately decide that he or she is no longer on the same legal footing as his or her comrades. If a witness such as Mr. Power were represented by separate counsel, that counsel could assure that he will be correctly advised as to his legal rights independent of the corporation and the other witnesses.</p>

Mr. Power is free to retain any other counsel of his choosing in the grand jury investigation if he so desires.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Recourse to present Counsel in any other legal matters is not restricted by the court's order. Furthermore, present Counsel are not suspended from the practice of law, formally disciplined, or precluded from representing any other clients in unrelated litigation. The degree of infringement resulting from the Supervising Judge’s order is the minimum necessary to protect the Commonwealth’s interest, while at the same time reducing the extent of attorney-choice harm which is sought to be prevented. As the Commonwealth’s interests may reasonably be said to outweigh petitioners’ interests, the Supervising Judge properly disqualified Counsel from representing Mr. Power before the investigating grand jury.</p>

    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[166,496,1151,635]]]'>Finally, I note that the Court’s <em>per curiam </em>reversal in this case is particularly troubling because no basis for the summary action is included. This Court has made a general practice of summarily reversing only where there is directly controlling authority, and we usually cite to that authority in our <em>per curiam </em>orders. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the reversal is supported only by a bald citation to <em>Pirillo v. Takiff, </em><a href="/pa/462/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="462 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="485195" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0511-01">462 Pa. 511</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="462 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="485195" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0511-01">341 A.2d 896</a> (1975) and a conclusion that the Commonwealth has failed to meet its burden of proof under <em>Pirillo. </em>But a citation to <em>Pirillo </em>does not clarify the reasons for reversal, and instead, will leave the Supervising Judge to wonder where he went astray.</p>

But,, in <em>Pirillo, </em>this Court affirmed a supervising judge’s order disqualifying counsel. The attorney and his associate in <em>Pirillo </em>were disqualified from representing twelve policemen subpoenaed to testify before an investigating grand jury investigating official corruption, where each witness would likely be called to testify against one or more of the others. This Court reasoned that the rights asserted by the petitioners in Pirillo—the witnesses’ right to counsel of their choosing; the attorneys’ right to practice their profession; and the right to freedom of speech, assembly, and petition as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments—are not only subject to curtailment, but were far outweighed by the interests of the state—to discover past and continuing criminal acts which seriously affect or injure the public and with which normal law enforcement is unable to cope. <em>Id. </em>at 905. In short, the unexplained citation to <em>Pirillo </em>provides no guidance whatsoever to the trial court or the District Attorney. This Court’s order will only serve to prolong litigation in this matter until an “actual” conflict of interest appears as opposed to the statutory requirement of merely a likelihood of a conflict of interest. This <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>determination is best left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.</p>
