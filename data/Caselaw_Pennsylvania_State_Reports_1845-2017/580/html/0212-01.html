The trial court also justified precluding Appellees from introducing evidence regarding whether the Media Defendants acted with actual malice in publishing the Article. It reasoned that “the neutral reportage privilege does offer broader protection than the actual malice standard, and under the neutral reportage privilege the evidence offered was irrelevant.” <em>Id. </em>at 8. The trial court noted that in the event that an appellate court determined that the neutral reportage privilege was not viable, then Appellees “would be entitled to a new trial due to [the trial court’s] exclusion of their evidence on the issue of actual malice.” <em>Id. </em>at 8-9.</p>

First, the U.S. Supreme Court has, pursuant to the actual malice standard, provided considerable protection to defendants in defamation actions filed by public officials and public figures. The actual malice standard goes so far as to forbid imposition of liability even in those instances where the defendant negligently publishes false, defamatory statements about a public figure or public official. Yet, the high Court has not declared that the media, because of their special role in our democracy, enjoy a blanket immunity from suit. In fact, it has most clearly stated that the First Amendment does not confer this type of protection upon the media. A primary reason for rejecting such a sweeping privilege for the media is the concern that such a privilege would essentially obliterate the states’ power to provide protection, via defamation actions, to a person’s reputation; the high Court has explicitly stated that it places value on a person’s right to protect his reputation. Finally, in no case has the high Court declared that a defendant will be immune from suit even where a public official-plaintiff could prove that a defendant published with actual malice.</p>

Yet, our role in these matters is not to champion what we perceive to be good public policy.

Here, the article concerned the acrimonious fallout from a special meeting of the Parkesburg Borough Council, and it reported defamatory comments that Glenn, an elected borough councilman, made concerning the elected council president and the borough mayor. Absent some special circumstance (such as editorial adoption or apparent approval of the contents of the reported comments), the purpose for which a newspaper reports and disseminates such information is not the same defamatory purpose existing in the mind of the elected official/speaker. The very fact that, in response to official government proceedings such as the council meeting here, an elected public official would act in <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>such a scurrilous manner as to call a fellow councilman and the local mayor “queers” and “child molesters,” accuse the council president of inappropriate sexual overtures, falsely accuse the mayor and council president of having a homosexual affair and conspiring against him, etc., is not only newsworthy, but a matter of importance to voters.

Absent a privilege, the newspaper may be forced to sanitize the report or resort to vagaries—highly subjective changes which inevitably will operate to mislead the public as to the seriousness or rashness of the accusations. Moreover, by forcing newspapers to recharacterize what actually occurred, the absence of a privilege essentially requires the substitution of editorial opinion for accurate transcription. Such a transformation of the actual event inevitably alters its context and content. In addition to being inaccurate, news reports altered for fear of litigation would be of far lesser value to the general public in learning of and passing upon the appropriateness of the public behavior of their elected officials. Such a stilted reporting regime would contravene the United States Supreme Court’s seminal statement that “debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and ... may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.” <em>New York Times v.
