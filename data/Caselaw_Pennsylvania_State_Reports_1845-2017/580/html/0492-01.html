Appellant also asserted an entitlement to discovery and an evidentiary hearing regarding witness participation in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office witness security program. Furthermore, he charged that all of his prior counsel were ineffective for failing to litigate the claims that he raised in the post-conviction proceedings; he was entitled to relief from his conviction and sentence because of the cumulative effect of the alleged errors; and he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.

According to Appellant, it is clear from the record that at least one juror was empaneled in his trial proceedings who would vote for death in every first-degree murder case. <em>See </em>N.T. May 24, 1993, at 99 (reflecting the response of the venireperson ultimately seated as Juror 3 to death qualification questioning by the district attorney, to the effect that she would impose a death sentence “[i]f I thought they did it”). Furthermore, Appellant complains that his trial counsel should have attempted to rehabilitate prospective jurors who expressed opposition to the death penalty. In particular, Appellant observes that venireperson 14 from panel 3 was stricken for cause without any questioning by, or objection from, defense counsel after the juror indicated that she had difficulty with the death penalty but could follow the law. <em>See </em>N.T. May 25, 1993, at 70-71. Appellant posits that the exclusion of this potential juror occurred under circumstances identical to those addressed by the Third Circuit in <em>Szuchon v.

Appellant contends that this alleged approach was consistent with an asserted policy and practice of the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office to exclude minorities from juries, as evidenced by a 1987 training videotape prepared by that office, in which a prosecutor explicitly advocated discriminatory peremptory challenges. <em>See generally Commonwealth v.

According to Appellant, however, those requirements (which were the basis of the PCRA court’s dismissal of the <em>Batson </em>claim) are unduly burdensome and inconsistent with the federal case law, as such information is not necessary to the determination of a <em>Batson </em>violation. Appellant’s position is that what is significant under <em>Batson </em>is not the final composition of the empaneled jury or how many jurors the defense struck, but rather, whether the evidence arguably demonstrates a prosecutor improperly used any preemptory strike to exclude a juror on a prohibited basis. Appellant includes allegations of, and arguments concerning, layered ineffectiveness of counsel within his presentation.</p>

Further, the Commonwealth catalogs the substantial omissions in the data upon which Appellant relies, including the failure to identify the race or ethnicity of at least sixteen venirepersons who either served on the jury or were stricken by the Commonwealth or the defense. Given such deficits, the Commonwealth urges that Appellant’s claim that the district attorney struck eighty percent of Latino venirepersons must be regarded as unsubstantiated. The Commonwealth highlights that the prosecutor did accept at least one Hispanic juror, who was removed by Appellant himself via his own peremptory challenge; according to the Commonwealth, the prosecutor’s acceptance of this venireperson substantially undermines Appellant’s present claim of discriminatory conduct. Additionally, the Commonwealth questions the sufficiency of Appellant’s proffer to establish that the four stricken venirepersons in question were in fact of Latino ethnicity. In this regard, for example, the Commonwealth notes that one of these jurors identified himself as “White” on his juror questionnaire.

In particular, the Third Circuit criticized the requirement that the defendant present a record of the race of jurors who served and the race of jurors acceptable to the Commonwealth who were stricken by the defense. <em>See Holloway, </em><a href="/f3d/355/0707-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="355 F.3d 707" data-case-ids="9062246" data-case-paths="/f3d/355/0707-01">355 F.3d at 728</a> (“The final composition of the jury (or even the composition of the jury at the time the <em>Batson </em>objection is raised) offers no reliable indication of whether the prosecutor intentionally discriminated in excluding a member of the defendant’s race”; further, “defense strikes are irrelevant to the determination of whether <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>the prosecutor has engaged in discrimination [—][i]nstead, the focus properly falls on the prosecutor’s actions, looking primarily at whether there is a pattern of strikes and whether the prosecutor’s questions and statements support or refute an inference of discrimination.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Greater difficulties arise, however, in cases such as the present one, in which there simply was no <em>Batson </em>objection raised during the <em>voir dire </em>process to trigger the requisite, contemporaneous inquiry. In such circumstances, where the record was not appropriately focused and channeled at trial, and, concomitantly, the trial court has not been asked to make the necessary findings that would be generate the deference undergirding the <em>Batson </em>burden-shifting construct, it is exponentially more difficult to perform a reasoned assessment concerning the presence or absence of purposeful discrimination. <em>See generally Basemore, </em><a href="/pa/560/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="560 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="95802" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0258-01">560 Pa. at 279</a>, <a href="/a2d/744/0717-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="744 A.2d 717" data-case-ids="11490920,95802" data-case-paths="/a2d/744/0717-01,/pa/560/0258-01">744 A.2d at 729</a> (“Absent a timely objection and preservation of a trial record, there will most often be no proof of the race of venirepersons; <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>the prosecutor will have had no reason to provide race-neutral explanations; the trial judge will have had no evidence to weigh nor occasion to make an assessment; and, ultimately, there will be nothing available to review on appeal.”); <em>McCrory v.

First, he contends that trial counsel ineffectively failed to investigate, develop and present a voluntary manslaughter defense, by virtue of evidence that Appellant shot and killed the victim in a misguided attempt to prevent his co-defendant from being beaten and perhaps killed by the victim. Appellant relies on an affidavit from his co-defendant, which comports with his own penalty-phase testimony that the killing resulted from his having come to the co-defendant’s aid after an attack by the victim. Appellant acknowledges that the evidence at trial established that, at the time of the shooting, the victim was not acting as an aggressor, but asserts that this merely reflects the “unreasonableness” aspect of an available unreasonable belief voluntary manslaughter defense. Alternatively, Appellant argues that his capacity to make a reasonable assessment of the situation was seriously compromised by his long-term and contemporaneous use of cocaine, borderline personality disorder, and history of childhood abuse and neglect. Second, Appellant asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate, develop, and present a voluntary intoxication defense, since it was known throughout the course of the criminal <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>proceedings that at the time of Appellant’s offense, he was under the influence of cocaine. Third, Appellant contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate, develop, and present a diminished capacity defense. Appellant includes layering averments and argumentation in his presentation of the three sub-parts of this claim; in particular, although he acknowledges that a claim of ineffectiveness for failing to pursue a diminished capacity defense was raised on direct appeal, Appellant claims that direct appeal counsel was ineffective for limiting the basis for the claim to Appellant’s history of drug use and for failing to reference to his impaired mental health condition.</p>

Indeed, the jurors’ additional decision-making function upon their finding of both aggravating and mitigating circumstances was also emphasized by the trial court immediately before and after counsel’s remarks. <em>See id. </em>at 32, 56.

Mr. Justice Saylor notes that he agrees with that criticism and would reconsider this Court’s <em>Batson </em>precedent on this collateral attack, while acknowledging that a majority of this Court does not deem that issue to be properly before us. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 86 n. 12. I do not dispute that the Third Circuit panel’s unwillingness to respect this Court’s decisions counsels in favor of our reexamining that precedent in an appropriate case. Respectfully, however, I do not believe that this is an appropriate case for <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>such a reexamination. The U.S. Supreme Court has not outlawed a legitimate role for the States in adopting reasonable procedural restrictions upon the litigation of federal constitutional claims. In my view, in the absence of specific adversarial presentations on the question of whether this Court’s existing procedural decisions amount to an unconstitutional burden on the substantive litigation of preserved <em>Batson </em>claims under U .S. Supreme Court authority—the only authority which binds this Court—it is better not to pass upon the question of the propriety of this Court’s precedent on this collateral attack, which involves a defaulted <em>Batson </em>claim raised only through the guise of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.4",661,[169,1004,1154,1349]]]'>Second, I do not agree with the Majority’s discussion of appellant’s claim that his previous counsel were ineffective for failing to allege that he was incompetent to stand trial. Notwithstanding the Majority’s initial, global disclaimer that it analyzes appellant’s underlying defaulted claims only to determine the viability of his layered, “derivative” claims of counsel ineffectiveness, Majority op. at 79, the Majority’s analysis of the competency claim does not make clear whether it is being deemed reviewable as a never-waivable due process claim, or as a derivative claim of counsel ineffectiveness, or both. In any event, I do not agree with the Majority Opinion to the extent that it may be read to suggest that the trial court has a <em>sua sponte </em>obligation to conduct a competency hearing for a counseled defendant, where the defendant’s lawyer makes no such request. I also do not agree with appellant’s claim— which the Majority states but does not directly address—that competency claims cannot be waived for purposes of PCRA review. I have addressed these points at length in my Concurring Opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Santiago, </em><a href="/a2d/855/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="232" data-cite="855 A.2d 682" data-case-ids="12254641,1370929" data-case-paths="/a2d/855/0682-01,/pa/579/0046-01">855 A.2d 682</a> (Pa.2004) (Castille, J. concurring). For the reasons set forth in that Concurrence, I would make plain that appellant’s claim is reviewable only as a layered claim of counsel ineffectiveness; and that claim is meritless because appellant has utterly failed in his burden to allege any factual predicate upon which his previous lawyers could have based a claim of incompetence.</p>

      <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>Third, I respectfully disagree with the Majority’s statement that it “disapproves” of a part of the prosecutor’s closing argument at the penalty phase. Majority op. at 95. Since the remark was not objected to at trial, the question is not whether this Court would “approve” or “disapprove” of the remark if we had been presiding at trial and an objection had been raised. Indeed, if this was the direct appeal and a contemporaneous objection had been raised, our task would not be to approve or disapprove the remark. Instead, it would be to review the trial court’s discretionary response to the objection if one had been asserted. The only issue , upon collateral review is whether appellant’s direct appeal counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to claim that appellant’s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the remark. In my view, given the role of closing argument, the existence of cautionary charges, the overall tenor of the remarks, and the controlling presumption that trial counsel was competent, the notion that appellate counsel was required to pursue this claim borders on the frivolous. I do not join in the Majority’s hindsight sanction of the trial prosecutor.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.4",662,[277,1396,1158,738]]]'>Finally, I realize that it is easier to dispose of claims of counsel ineffectiveness—particularly in cases where counsel choose to burden this Court with prolix briefs raising dozens of claims and sub-claims of error, few of which have any real substance—as if the pleading of ineffectiveness is a mere conduit by which we proceed to review the defaulted, underlying claim as if it had been preserved. There is a danger in this approach, which this case has revealed. In my view, it is inappropriate to employ collateral review to opine upon, and indeed purport to modify, the underlying law that would be at issue if these were preserved claims of trial court error. Collateral review is not the place for such a practice. The focus must still be upon counsel’s performance, and I would not lose sight of that fact.</p>

As Mr. Justice Saylor properly recognizes in the text of the Opinion: “A majority of this Court is of the view that it would represent <em>dictum </em>to undertake in this case to reconsider the validity of the <em>Spence </em>requirements in light of the Third Circuit’s <em>Holloway </em>decision.” Op. at 86. Nevertheless, in a footnote of the same Opinion, Mr. Justice Saylor explains that he “is of a contrary view” and would prefer to undertake a reconsideration of our time-honored procedural requirements for establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case under <em>Bat-son. <a href="/pa/534/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="236" data-cite="534 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="1839654,1839660" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0233-01,/pa/534/0233-02">Id.</a> </em>at 86 n. 12. As Mr. Justice Saylor acknowledges, however, the Commonwealth in this case has neither specifically addressed nor defended the validity of the <em>Spence </em>requirements before this Court. Therefore, absent an adequate presentation of adversarial arguments, we should at least temporarily delay the reconsideration of our precedent. Because the decisions of the Third Circuit regarding federal law are merely persuasive authority for this Court to contemplate and weigh, <em>see Hall v. Pa.
