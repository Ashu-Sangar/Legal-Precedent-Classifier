    <p id="b368-5" data-blocks='[["BL_368.4",368,[296,452,1151,539]]]'>Rossi’s driving privileges were suspended for 15 days, effective August 31, 1999, for a March 11, 1999 speeding violation. An additional 15-day suspension, effective September 15,1999, was added for a June 22, 1999 stop sign violation. On November 18, 1999, she was stopped and charged with violating § 1543(a) for driving while her operating privileges were suspended or revoked. On February 16, 2000, a district justice convicted her of violating § 1543(a). Following her conviction, the Bureau notified Rossi her driving privilege would be suspended for one year pursuant to § 1543(c)(1).</p>
    <p id="b368-6" data-blocks='[["BL_368.5",368,[294,1033,1153,923]]]'>Rossi appealed her § 1543(a) conviction and subsequent license suspension under § 1543(c)(1) to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 1550(a). At the hearing, Rossi testified she surrendered her license prior to August 31, 1999, and did not operate a vehicle from August 31, 1999, through September 30, 1999. She believed her operating privileges were automatically restored following the expiration of the 30-day period of suspension. The Bureau asserted Rossi’s privileges were still suspended on November 18, 1999, because she had not complied with its administrative process and paid a $ 25 restoration fee. The trial court reversed Rossi’s summary conviction for § 1543(a), reasoning that § 1543(c) applies only to violations which occur when a motorist’s license is within the original term of suspension. Since Rossi was cited after the term of suspension ended, the court determined she was not subject to § 1543(c)(1), despite her failure to restore her license.</p>

Both interpreted § 1543(c)(1) prior to its 1994 amendment, and held that suspension or revocation must end on the date stated without further action from the individual under suspension. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court determined Rossi could not be penalized under § 1543(c)(1) because her operating privileges were restored by operation of law when her suspension ended September 30,1999.</p>

    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.4",370,[286,432,1155,525]]]'>One must first look to what the legislature actually said before evaluating what it meant to say; only if the former is unclear does the latter become relevant. However, the post-amendment language here is not so clear as to avoid the need for clarification. First, there is the basic grammar of the amendment which, as phrased, modifies “person,” not privilege. However, the prior language also referenced the person, not privilege, and no one can seriously contend the section refers to suspension of the person him or her self, rather than suspension of the person’s operating privileges.</p>
    <p id="b370-5" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[284,989,1157,524]]]'>The placement of the phrase is also problematic, for it comes after the requirement of suspension on the date of violation, and begins with “and” rather than “or”; one could easily read it as creating an additional element of the offense. That is, it may be read to mean the Department must still show a suspension on the date of violation, and also show that the person (privilege) had not been restored. However, read this way, the amendment is surplusage; obviously, if the privileges were suspended on the date of violation, by definition the privileges could not have been restored.</p>
    <p id="b370-6" data-blocks='[["BL_370.6",370,[281,1546,1158,795]]]'>The interpretation of the amendment as mere surplusage is counter to the very basic proposition that the legislature did not add it to perform a meaningless act. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1). While it would have been better to place the amendment before the words “date of violation” rather than after, this is not fatal to understanding the amendment’s purpose. Clearly the amendment recognizes the need to take affirmative steps pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 1960 and 75 Pa.C.S. § 1783 to restore one’s operating privileges, and states that the failure to do so makes the operator subject to the penalties of § 1543(c). The Commonwealth Court’s suggestion that the amendment’s purpose, purportedly unknown but specifically not meant to address its case law on restoration, is in error. Indeed, we must conclude it could have been for no other purpose.</p>
