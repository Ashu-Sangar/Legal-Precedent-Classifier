Each of the allegations is attributed to the complaint, not to Gibson, although both Bochetto and Gibson granted interviews to the author of the article. None of the comments attributed to Gibson relates in any way to the substantive allegations of the malpractice complaint against Bochetto. Rather, Gibson’s comments related to his claimed success rate in legal malpractice actions and his claim that most of his clients are referred to him by other attorneys. Gibson also remarked that “the lawyers that yell the loudest about being sued are usually the most guilty,” an intemperate and gratuitous comment unbecoming a legal professional for sure, but one which merely expressed Gibson’s opinion about the defendants in his cases generally, did not relate specifically to Bochetto, and did not touch upon the substance of the legal malpractice complaint.

After filing a brief in the case, the public defender called a press conference at which he related the contents of the brief. The brief contained statements about state police officers who had been involved in the investigation of the murder, and at <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>least two newspapers published the substance of the public defender’s remarks. The police officers then sued the public defender, claiming that his comments had defamed them. The trial court, ruling on the public defender’s preliminary objections, found that the public defender was a “high public official” and, therefore, entitled to absolute immunity for comments made in his official capacity, whether defamatory or not. Because the court found the public defender’s remarks to be closely related to his official duties, the court found that the remarks were entitled to protection. The court also held that the public defender was absolutely privileged to repeat matters which were of public record.</p>
    <p id="b384-5" data-blocks='[["BL_384.4",384,[295,966,1152,520]]]'>The Superior Court, by a 4-3 vote, reversed, with the majority finding that the public defender was not entitled to the absolute immunity applicable to a “high public official” but, rather, that his privilege was the qualified privilege extended to any attorney to publish information relative to a judicial proceeding. Therefore, the majority held, the police officers were entitled to the opportunity to prove that the public defender’s comments were known by him to be false or were made in reckless disregard of the truth in order to defeat the qualified privilege.</p>

The newspapers presumably could have asked the Prothonotary to permit them to see the brief, or they might have asked [the public defender] to give them a copy, which he might have done without making any comment. As I understand the majority’s reasoning, both of these hypothetical situations would be considered prohibited republication.

But the focus should be upon substance. Where the alleged defamatory aspect of the “contact” consists only of what is contained within the four corners of.a record judicial pleading, I see no principled distinction, for defamation purposes, between the filed public complaint and the copy of it provided to the press. Here, Gibson did not make any published comments about the contents of the malpractice complaint he filed; he merely provided a copy of a public record to the reporter. As the <em>Barto </em>dissent similarly recognized, the reporter could just as easily have secured a copy of the malpractice complaint at the courthouse.
