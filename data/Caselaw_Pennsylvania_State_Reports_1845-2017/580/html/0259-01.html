This Commonwealth grants Pennsylvania drivers the privilege of operating motor vehicles here and in our sister states without requiring separate licensure elsewhere. Along with that privilege comes the concomitant responsibility to abide by the rules of the road. The Commonwealth has a compelling interest in protecting its citizens, and the citizens of our sister states, from the dangers posed by Pennsylvania-licensed intoxicated drivers. <em>See McCafferty, </em><a href="/a2d/758/1155-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="758 A.2d 1155" data-case-ids="11196913,11196965,1366942,1366957" data-case-paths="/a2d/758/1155-01,/a2d/758/1155-02,/pa/563/0145-01,/pa/563/0146-01">758 A.2d at 1161</a>; <em>Occhibone v.

PennDOT argues that requiring it to provide extrinsic evidence that the reporting state’s conviction report was originally generated from the licensing authority of that state adds nothing to the truth-determining process or the administration of justice under the Compact, and ignores the presumption in law that public officials have faithfully performed their duties. <em>See Albert v.

The conviction report here is a “certification of Indiana abstract of court record” which, PennDOT notes, is the form by which an Indiana court certifies a driver’s conviction to the Indiana BMV. Above the judge’s signature line, the form specifies that “[t]his abstract is a certification of record to the Commissioner of the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles as prescribed by Indiana Code 9-25-6-8.” Thus, PennDOT notes, the form exists to satisfy the requirement under Indiana law that courts certify convictions for traffic offenses such as OWI to the Indiana BMV. Penn-DOT further notes that Indiana law imposes no requirement upon Indiana courts to provide these reports to a sister state’s licensing authority, in addition to forwarding them to the Indiana BMV. Instead, the duty to forward conviction reports falls only upon the Indiana BMV. From these facts, and applying the presumption that public officials faithfully discharge their duties, PennDOT argues, the courts below should have presumed that “the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, the recipient of the certification of court abstract under Indiana law and the entity with the statutory duty to report [appellee’s] OWI conviction to [PennDOT], is the entity [which] forwarded that conviction report.” Brief for Appellant, 27-28.

PennDOT notes that there is nothing in the Compact which requires that the conviction report itself state that it has been forwarded by the licensing authority; rather, “Commonwealth Court’s strict and unreasonable construction of Article III of the Compact in essence amounts to a unilateral judicial amendment to the Compact which ... imposes additional duties upon the other party states without their consent.” Brief for Appellant, 31.</p>

In so doing, the cases ignore the admonition in Article IX that the Compact “shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof,” one of which, as set forth in Article I, is to promote compliance with the laws relating to the operation of motor vehicles in each of the party states.

We reiterate our conclusion from <em>McCafferty </em>that the provisions of Article III are clearly mandatory where PennDOT is acting as the convicting state reporting that Pennsylvania conviction to the sister state which licensed the driver. <em>McCafferty, </em><a href="/a2d/758/1155-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="758 A.2d 1155" data-case-ids="11196913,11196965,1366942,1366957" data-case-paths="/a2d/758/1155-01,/a2d/758/1155-02,/pa/563/0145-01,/pa/563/0146-01">758 A.2d at 1164</a>. For that matter, the provisions of Article IV are mandatory upon PennDOT when it is acting as the home state in receipt of a report of an out-of-state conviction. But there is. nothing in the plain language of Article III—much less in the overall structure and purpose of the Compact—which - suggests that Article III serves as some form of <em>sub silentio </em>restriction upon PennDOT’s powers where it is in the opposite posture, <em>i.e., </em>when it is called upon under Article IV to act after receipt of a conviction report from a sister Compact state. In that <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>instance, the statute directs PennDOT to determine if “suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle” is required. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1581 (Art. rV(a)). In making this evaluation, PennDOT is directed to focus upon the “conduct reported” pursuant to Article III and to give it “the same effect” as it would have if the conduct had occurred in the home state.</p>
    <p id="b405-5" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[163,690,1156,1433]]]'>There is nothing in Article TV which obliges PennDOT to reject, or precludes it from relying upon, a sister state’s report of conviction because of a perceived defect in proof of the origin of the reporting state’s certification. Consistently with the purpose of the Compact, PennDOT should be deemed free to proceed with a substantive analysis of the matter. In this regard, it is significant that the type of report relied upon by PennDOT in this and like cases was not some mere rumor or unproved accusation: it was a court abstract originating from the convicting court. <em>See Harrington, </em><a href="/pa/563/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="563 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="1366907" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0565-01">763 A.2d at 393</a> (noting significance of administrative interpretations and assurances which guard against arbitrary and erroneous suspensions). The court abstract in this case was the very document that was forwarded to the Indiana licensing authority as proof of appellee’s conviction. A licensing authority does not generally possess first-hand knowledge of a conviction: it must rely upon such proof of conviction from the court which rendered the conviction. Thus, even in a situation where there was affirmative “proof’ that it was the licensing authority of the reporting state which forwarded the court abstract, or a report of the abstract, the fact that the authority forwarded the actual proof would add little of substance. To require PennDOT to ignore all such abstracts from sister states unless they also contain a rubber stamp from the out-of-state licensing authority would elevate a pointless form (and one which is not specifically required in Article IV) over substance, and defeat the salutary purposes of the Compact.</p>

Challenges may always be raised as to the accuracy or reliability of a particular court abstract or other report of conviction. The driver facing suspension, having been the subject of the out of state conviction, is in a solid position to recognize and litigate any actual substantive deficiency. But, the notion that, for purposes of PennDOT’s duty under Article IV, the essence of the report is the entity which forwards it, rather than its substance, is absurd. In rejecting a due process challenge to an allegedly defective Article III notice in <em>McCafferty, </em>this Court noted that: “[t]he due process clause does not create a right to be deliberately obtuse as to the nature of a proceeding. Appellees here knew exactly what was happening to them and why.” <a href="/a2d/758/1155-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="758 A.2d 1155" data-case-ids="11196913,11196965,1366942,1366957" data-case-paths="/a2d/758/1155-01,/a2d/758/1155-02,/pa/563/0145-01,/pa/563/0146-01">758 A.2d at 1163</a>. Similarly, in discharging its administrative duty under Article IV, PennDOT should not be required to be deliberately obtuse when it is in receipt of a report of an out-of-state conviction. It can determine what happened and proceed accordingly.</p>
