Because there were so many signatures involved, if the Candidates did not commit' “significant resources” toward attempting to resolve as much as possible by stipulation, the result would be that “Candidates, merely by being obstreperous, could remain on the ballot through the device of delaying the Court’s proceedings through Election Day.” <em>Id. </em>at 5.

They argue that the signature requirements, although strict, are not burdensome when a candidate, is running for a state position, but rise to the level of being too burdensome when, as here, more than 25,000 are required. They fail to note that they can request signature support from every registered voter of the Commonwealth while trying to gain the necessary signatures, while those running for a state office may gather only signatures of registered voters within their district. Instead of providing any support for their contention, Candidates merely repeat that our current case law imposes an <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>onerous burden.

Section 976 of the Election Code, 25 P.S. § 2936, authorizes the Secretary of the Commonwealth to disregard any signature that appears not to be genuine when determining if the Nomination Papers contain the sufficient number of signatures. Significantly, although the Secretary rejected 4,936 signatures, he accepted the Candidates’ Nomination Papers because he concluded that 25,697 signatures appeared facially valid. Reply to the Order of Court filed by Secretary of the Commonwealth, August 24, 2004, at 2. In light of the acceptance of the Nomination Papers, the actions of the Secretary did not directly harm the Candidates. Had the Secretary rejected the Nomination Papers, the Candidates would clearly have been entitled to seek judicial relief. Section 976 of the Election Code provides that a refusal of the Secretary to receive and file a Nomination Papers may be reviewed by the court upon an application to compel its acceptance as of the date when it was presented.</p>

Moreover, it may be presumed that the General Assembly does not intend to violate the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions; does not intend an absurd or unreasonable result or one impossible of execution; and that it intends the entire statute to be effective and certain. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1)—(3).
