During the course of the robbery, Appellant ordered Willis to lie face-down on the ground; Willis complied.

Appellant and his accomplices then retreated to their automobiles; as they did, Appellant, along with his co-conspirators, fired multiple shots into the crowd of people gathered outside the club.

Furthermore, where, as in the matter <em>sub judice </em>“the judge who presided at trial ruled on the weight claim below, an appellate court’s role is not to consider the underlying question of whether the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.

The jury’s guilty verdicts on the two homicide charges were not so contrary to the evidence as to shock the conscience; in fact, the weight of the evidence supported, rather than contradicted, the jury’s verdict. Furthermore, Appellant cannot prevail on his claim merely because he believes that of all the evidence presented at trial, his statement was the most truthful.

R.E. 602 (“A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.”).

Furthermore, the jury declined to find the existence of any mitigating circumstance. Considering the clearly damaging effect that this statement would have had on Appellants case in mitigation, and that the jury ultimately failed to find any mitigating circumstance, we cannot conclude that the prejudicial effect of this error was so insignificant that the error was harmless.</p>

Thus, <em>Freeman </em>states that the relaxed waiver doctrine is still applicable to those matters in which the appellant's brief was filed prior to our disposition of <em>Freeman </em>or within 30 days of <em>Freeman </em>being handed down. As Appellant’s brief was filed prior to our disposition of <em>Freeman, </em>he is entitled to the benefits of the relaxed waiver doctrine.</p>
