I noted my dissent to this Order, consistent with my belief that, in determining that the candidates’ nomination papers were defective, the Commonwealth Court misconstrued relevant statutory authority, thereby assessing the candidates’ submissions according to a standard that was more stringent than that which has been prescribed by the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Specifically, it is my position that the Commonwealth Court incorrectly construed the term “qualified elector,” as used in the Pennsyl<a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>vania Election Code,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to subsume a requirement of actual voter registration.</p>

In devising a protocol for this substantial undertaking, the Commonwealth Court determined, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Election Code requires that each signator on a nomination paper seeking ballot access for representatives of independent political bodies must be a registered voter in Pennsylvania. <em>See In re Nomination Paper of Nader, </em>No. 568 M.D.2004 (Pa.Cmwlth.Sept.20, 2004) <em>(per curiam </em>order). In other words, the court implemented a registration standard to guide its signature review. As of the commencement of the review process, the candidates challenged this registration standard on the basis that it was not supported by the Election Code and concurrently sought this Court’s review of this challenge under an exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Via <em>per curiam </em>Order dated October 1, 2004, this Court declined to invoke its extraordinary jurisdiction, and at such time, I filed a concurring and dissenting statement expressing the view that the candidates’ challenge to the registration standard appeared to have substantial merit. <em>See In re Nomination Papers of Nader, </em>171 MM <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>2004 (Pa. October 1, 2004) (concurring and dissenting statement). Accordingly, I also indicated that I would direct the Commonwealth Court to separately review whether the objectors satisfied their burden with respect to each signature, assuming that voter registration was not required. My aim in this respect was to preserve the opportunity for meaningful appellate review of the objections to the candidates’ nomination papers should this Court at such juncture determine that a “qualified elector,” as used in the Election Code, need not be a registered voter. The signature review process went forward, nevertheless, with the registration standard in place.</p>

In the latter context, a significant governmental objective is to provide a reasonable means by which prospective candidates unconnected with the major parties may have an influence on the democratic process, while at the same time ensuring that only persons satisfying the requisite age, citizenship, and residency requirements participate in placing such a candidate on the ballot. This interest is sufficiently served by requiring signers and circulators of nominating papers to be qualified electors, even if they are not registered to vote. Notably, as well, and in contrast, for major political parties both the signer and the affiant must be registered and enrolled electors of the political party designated in the petition, in addition to having qualified elector status, <em>see </em>25 P.S. §§ 2868, 2869; the prerequisite that the individual be registered as a party member in this context prevents those outside the party from interfering in intra-party affairs. Section 951 of the Election Code, however, pertaining to independent political bodies, contains no analog to this requirement, thus also supporting the position that the requirement simply does not exist for signers and affiants relative to nomination papers for an independent political body.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The reason is that, in reaching its conclusion, Aukamp cited to the same constitutional provision as Sullivan—namely, Section 1 of Article VIII of the Constitution of 1874—and directly contradicted <em>Sullivan’s </em>interpretation of that provision by stating that the laws regarding voter registration modify an elector’s constitutional “qualification” to vote. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.2d%20400" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="8 A.2d 400">id.</a> </em>As between the two decisions, however, <em>Sullivan </em>is, in my view, the better reasoned. In particular, the <em>Sullivan </em>Court closely analyzed the constitutional text, including its grammatical structure, and supported its position by drawing an apt analogy to the practice of law, as quoted above. <em>Aukamp’s </em>analysis, by contrast, is superficial, as it merely states in a conclusory manner that the Constitution “prescribes as a qualification” that the elector must be registered, and opines that any other interpretation might result in a referendum for the grant of a liquor license on the demand of persons not qualified to vote.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> In such circumstances, and particularly as <em>Sullivan </em>is much <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>closer in context to the present scenario, it is my position, again, that it should have been followed here.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

In this regard, the Commonwealth Court suggested that, even if the registration standard had not been interposed, only 1,470 of the signatures presented by the candidates would need to be re-validated. <em>See In re Nomination Paper of Nader, </em>568 M.D. 2004, <a href="/a2d/865/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="865 A.2d 8" data-case-ids="9032699" data-case-paths="/a2d/865/0008-01">865 A.2d 8</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202389814" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2004 WL 2389814">2004 WL 2389814</a> (Pa.Cmwlth. Oct. 13, 2004) (consolidated findings, opinion, and order), at 73. For reasons that are unclear from its opinion, however, the Commonwealth Court counted only the 1,470 signatures stricken because the signer had registered to vote after signing the petition, but failed to include a separate grouping of 7,506 signatures which were invalidated solely due to the lack of registration. Since the signatures in this latter category also were not stricken for any reason independent of non-registration, <em>see id. </em>at 43-73, it is evident that they would also have to be counted to assess the sufficiency of the nomination papers in the absence of a registration standard. Accordingly, and because the candidates’ deficiency was less than 7,000 signatures under the Commonwealth Court’s reasoning (as 18,818 signatures had been expressly found valid), the elimination of the registration standard would plainly result in a number greater than the 25,697 needed for ballot access.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

Further, I recognize that at least one of the. candidates’ arguments made in the pre-hearing setting appears to have assumed the validity of a registration standard. Indeed, the candidates’ latter argument gave rise to a statement by a majority of this Court in its September 29, 2004, opinion to the effect that registration was indeed a prerequisite to qualified elector status. <em>See Nader, </em><a href="/pa/580/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="580 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="1100730" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0022-01">580 Pa. at 47-50</a>, <a href="/pa/580/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="858 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="1100730,9163615" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0022-01,/a2d/858/1167-01">858 A.2d at 1182-83</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

First, candidates for political bodies bear a representative relationship to the body of qualified electors that nominate them; indeed, here, several individual signers who anticipated that their signatures would be stricken sought to intervene in the process and raise the same argument pertaining to the correct construction of the term “qualified elector.” In such circumstances, strict application <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>of waiver principles, particularly as concerns implementation of the controlling law guiding resolution of an election controversy, would seem to me to be unduly harsh and in tension with legislative policies favoring ballot access. In the latter regard, by virtue of their timely filing and appropriate certifications, the candidates enjoyed the benefit of having presumptively valid nomination papers, subject only to challenges by objectors who bore the burden of proof with respect to invalidity. It is therefore troubling to me that such presumption should be disturbed, and disenfranchisement should occur, on grounds other than a definitive determination that controlling law was properly applied in. reviewing the objections, particularly when a challenge to the legal standard in question was in fact raised by the time that the signature review process had commenced and was capable of being addressed on the merits by the Commonwealth Court within a short time thereafter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> In this regard, I would note that the origins of the doctrine of waiver are rooted in prudential concerns, and it is questionable whether that doctrine is appropriately applied to support the application of a signature review standard at odds with legislative intent.</p>

Certainly a state has a legitimate interest in confining third party candidacies, within constitutional limitations, so as not to permit them to unduly distort or skew the election process. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v.

The distinction between a "qualified elector” and a "registered elector" has been recognized by at least one federal court in Pennsylvania. <em>See Morrill v. Weaver, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/224/0882-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="224 F. Supp. 2d 882" data-case-ids="11425588" data-case-paths="/f-supp-2d/224/0882-01">224 F.Supp.2d 882</a>, 896-97 &amp; n. 16 (E.D.Pa.2002) (predicting that this Court will construe the term "qualified elector” as used in Section 951 to exclude a registration requirement, and finding that inclusion of such a requirement as to petition circulators would render the statute unconstitutional).</p>

The objectors forward a similar argument, contending that an interpretation of “qualified elector” which does not presuppose status as a registered voter would make it difficult for them to carry their burden of proving signature invalidity. The candidates disagree, and list other public databases besides voter registration rolls (e.g., driver's license and tax records) through which they claim it would be possible to determine qualified elector status. In this regard, I would simply observe that it is not the courts’ function to facilitate objections to ballot access; rather, we are charged with fairly implementing legislative intent according to the framework chosen by the Legislature. In my view, the hurdles to objections arising from the General Assembly's having chosen qualified elector status as opposed to registration as the litmus for nomination papers for independent political bodies are simply consequent to the legislative design and attendant policy choices.</p>

It is also worth observing that the Voter Registration Law—which, as noted, makes an express distinction between a qualified elector and a registered elector—did not exist when <em>Aukamp </em>was decided. That law specifies that nothing in the Election Code may be deemed inconsistent with it. <em>See </em>25 Pa.C.S. § 1106(c). An interpretation of the Election Code under which the term "qualified elector” means "registered elector” would arguably be inconsistent with the Voter Registration Law, and thereby contravene legislative intent.</p>

In the consolidated findings, opinion and order, the Commonwealth Court also indicated that the signatures under review were primarily the result of widespread, systemic fraudulent conduct on the part the individuals gathering them. <em>See id. </em>at 73-92 (stating that "this signature gathering process was the most deceitful and fraudulent exercise ever perpetrated upon this Court”). A review of the tables and exhibits <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>attached to the order, however, suggest that the problem was of a more limited scale (for example, 687 signatures out of 51,273 reviewed—or approximately 1.3% of the signatures—were rejected on the basis of having been forged). Moreover, the Commonwealth Court cited no evidence that the candidates were specifically aware of fraud or misrepresentation at the time of their submissions, and the candidates note— and the objectors do not dispute—that when they became aware of any fraudulent conduct connected with specific signatures, they voluntarily withdrew those signatures from consideration. Finally, the Commonwealth Court’s disposition is expressly predicated on a tallying of signatures as to which the objectors were unable to meet their burden of proof (i.e., valid signatures), which is also the subject of my assessment here.</p>

I do not regard this statement on the part of a majority of this Court as controlling here, because the Commonwealth Court’s registration standard was not squarely before the Court at that juncture, and therefore, the statement represents <em>dictum. </em>Moreover, there was no express consideration of the statutory and constitutional text, nor the relevant authorities in connection with the statement.</p>
