This Court granted the petition, which raises three questions: (1) whether a drawee bank obtains “possession” of any property, as defined by Pa.R.C.P. 3101, of a customer who physically provides the drawee bank’s teller with cash and checks, in exchange for the issuance of a bank cashier’s check, when those funds are never deposited into the customer’s account at the drawee bank; (2) whether a garnishee bank, which receives “possession” of the property of a judgment debtor after being served with a writ <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>of execution, has a duty under Pa.R.C.P. 3111(c) “restraining [it] from paying any debt” to that judgment debtor in exchange for that property, even if that “debt” arises during a transaction with a brief duration akin to that of a sales transaction; and (3) whether the public policy underlying Pennsylvania garnishment law requires a garnishee bank, on notice of a judgment order against a depositor by Writ of Execution and whose accounts are thereby held, to refrain from engaging in transactions with that judgment debtor which permit the judgment debtor to avoid the garnishment of its assets, and thereby the debtor’s obligation to pay its judgment creditor, to the financial benefit of the garnishee bank.</p>

(Herzog Brothers), is a wholesale distributor of motor fuel products. On June 5, 1996, in an unrelated action, appellant, Witco Corporation (Witco), obtained a default judgment against Herzog Brothers in the amount of $509,216.52 plus costs in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. On July 5, 1996, in an effort to collect the judgment, Witco served a writ of execution upon National City Bank of Pennsylvania (Bank) as potential garnishee. In response to interrogatories from Witco, the Bank indicated that it held and had frozen $1,379.52 in a checking account belonging to Herzog Brothers.</p>

As to each purchase of a cashier’s check, Herzog presented his personal checks or cash to the Bank at the teller windows whereupon the Bank would issue “official checks” drawn on the Bank and payable to various designees specified by Herzog. The aggregate value of these checks exceeds $6,000,000. During the same time period, the Bank made fourteen payments to itself totaling $22,718.86 from <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>funds presented to the Bank’s tellers by Herzog in the form of personal checks or cash.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Bank’s own internal policy required that all funds used for the issuance of “official checks” in an amount in excess of $3,000 first be deposited into an account at the Bank. The Bank also customarily placed a hold on funds from foreign bank checks in order to verify that the accounts on which the checks were drawn contained sufficient funds to cover the checks.

Finding that Pennsylvania law dictates that interrogatories in aid of execution be treated as though they were a complaint and the garnishee’s answers to the interrogatories as an answer to the complaint (Pa.R.C.P. 3145(a)), and that the parties had conducted discovery in aid of execution, the district court treated Witco’s motion and the Bank’s response as cross-motions for summary judgment, noting that the parties agreed that there existed no genuine issues of material fact. The district court then denied Witco’s motion for summary judgment and granted the Bank’s motion. Ruling on the narrow issue of whether the Bank came into possession, as that term is defined in Pa.R.C.P. 3101(b), of the Herzog Brothers’ property during the cashier’s check transactions, the district court likened the transactions to any sales transaction where the purchaser tenders full payment at the time of the sale. Because Gary Herzog never deposited his cash or personal checks in the Bank as part of the cashier’s check <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>purchases, the court found as a matter of law that the Bank never came into possession of Herzog Brothers’ property. Witco appealed to the Third Circuit, which determined that the district court’s decision raised significant questions of Pennsylvania law not previously decided by this Court and, in turn, certified those questions to this Court for resolution.</p>

The Bank argues that this Court should adopt the district court’s reasoning that the cashier’s check purchases amounted to nothing more than sales transactions in which Herzog Brothers purchased a series of checks from the Bank, but the Bank did not acquire custody or control of any Herzog Brothers property. Witco, on the other hand, urges a plain language interpretation of Rule 3101, conferring on the word “possession” its common and approved usage in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. 103(a) (‘Words and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage”). We agree with Witco that a plain language approach is required in this instance.</p>

Indeed, pursuant to its ordinary business policies, the Bank had the power to hold the checks Gary Herzog presented until it determined that sufficient funds existed in the banks upon which the checks were drawn before making the funds available to Herzog Brothers. In addition, the Bank’s internal policy provided that funds for a cashier’s check in excess of $3,000 were to be deposited into an account with the Bank prior to issuance of the cashier’s check. That the Bank chose in the case of this particular customer/ judgment <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>debtor not to follow its usual practices, and thereby declined to hold the checks or require that the funds be deposited in a Herzog Brothers’ account, does not negate that the Bank had those powers over the funds—powers which derived from the fact that they were in possession of the funds, if only for a brief time. Thus, applying the common and approved definition of the term “possession,” we conclude that the Bank was in possession of the checks and cash once Herzog handed them over to the Bank’s tellers, for purposes of Rule 3101(b), notwithstanding that Herzog did not formally deposit the funds into Herzog Brothers’ account with the Bank.</p>

In this case, the Bank fulfilled that obligation by issuing the cashiers checks. The act of issuing the cashiers checks, according to Witco, constituted the payment of a debt to Herzog Brothers, an act prohibited by Rule 3111(c). In the alternative, Witco argues that the issuance of the cashiers checks to third parties identified by Gary Herzog amounted to a payment of debts for the account of Herzog Brothers in violation of Rule 3111(c).</p>

There, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals discussed the obligations of a garnishee bank after it has been served with a writ of garnishment. Subsequent to being served with a writ garnishment, the garnishee bank in that case continued to honor checks drawn on a loan manager account belonging to the judgment debtor where the account maintained a zero balance and was funded through a line of credit the debtor maintained with the bank. Whenever checks drawn on the account were presented to the bank, the bank immediately funded the account in the amount of the check presented and then disbursed the funds to the payee. The transfer of funds from the line of credit to the loan manager account and then <a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>payment to the payee were instantaneous; the funds remained in the loan manager account for only a brief time. On these facts, the bank maintained that it never had possession of funds belonging to the judgment debtor due to the brief duration of the transactions. The Eight Circuit disagreed, holding that: “the proceeds from [the debtorj’s line of credit transferred into the loan manager account became money or credits belonging to [the debtor] for the brief period of time between the transfer of the proceeds to the account and disbursement of the proceeds to the payee.” . <em><a href="/f3d/332/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="332 F.3d 513" data-case-ids="9114789,9121205" data-case-paths="/f3d/332/0513-01,/br/294/0513-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/332/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="332 F.3d 513" data-case-ids="9114789,9121205" data-case-paths="/f3d/332/0513-01,/br/294/0513-01">at 518</a>.</p>
    <p id="b764-4" data-blocks='[["BL_764.4",764,[285,855,1151,1110]]]'>The Bank counters that Herzog Brothers’ ongoing purchases of cashier’s checks were merely over-the-counter exchanges in which the Bank served as a financial intermediary. In the Bank’s view, Gary Herzog provided the funds to the Bank’s tellers in exchange for the cashier’s checks without any intention of depositing the funds or of giving the funds to the Bank to hold. Nor did Herzog Brothers intend that the funds be used to pay a debt on its behalf. The Bank argues that Witco’s characterization of these exchanges of funds for cashier’s check as giving rise to a debt is untenable and not supported by authority. Further, the Bank submits that this characterization would turn every purchase and sale transaction into a debt subject to garnishment. The Bank also argues that, had it acted as Witco claims it should have by seizing the cash and checks Gary Herzog presented to the Bank’s tellers and turning those funds over to Witco, its conduct would have been actionable, unethical, legally and constitutionally questionable and commercially unreasonable. Finally, the Bank distinguishes <em>Southwestern Glass </em>on the basis that the funds in question here were never actually deposited in an account belonging to Herzog Brothers.</p>
    <p id="b764-5" data-blocks='[["BL_764.5",764,[285,1989,1151,362]],["BL_765.1",765,[158,306,1153,954]]]'>We do not accept the Bank’s characterization of the cashier’s check transactions with its judgment debtor customer in this case as akin to other innocent purchases and sales transactions. What obviously separates the situation <em>sub judice </em>from other everyday sales transactions is that the Bank maintained a banking relationship with Herzog Brothers and had been served with a writ of execution precisely because of <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>that banking relationship. The nature of the relationship renders the Bank’s conduct in waiving its usual policy and issuing no-delay cashier’s checks in exchange for cash and personal checks tendered by its apparently-preferred customer suspect. Even if it was not the Bank’s specific intent, it appears that the Bank engaged with Herzog Brothers in transactions patently calculated to thwart the garnishment process. It is undisputed that the Bank was aware of the judgment against Herzog Brothers and had been served with a writ of execution. Nevertheless, over the course of thirteen months, the Bank processed more than $6 million in cash and checks exchanged for at least 131 of the Bank’s cashier’s checks—without any consideration for its lawfully imposed duty as garnishee. In light of these facts, we reject the notion that the conduct at issue amounted to a series of simple, innocent sales transactions having nothing to do with the Bank’s relationship with its customer as an account holder whose account was subject to garnishment.</p>
    <p id="b765-4" data-blocks='[["BL_765.4",765,[159,1285,1155,1066]]]'>We should note, however, that we do not accept Witco’s broad argument that the presentation of the cash and checks to the Bank’s tellers gave rise to a debt owed by the Bank to Herzog Brothers. This strained interpretation of the word “debt” could conceivably capture any wholesale or retail sales transaction. In any case, there is no need to concern ourselves with the issue because it seems crystal clear that, when the Bank converted Herzog Brothers’ cash and checks into cashier’s checks and made those cashier’s checks payable to third parties or to the Bank itself at Herzog Brothers’ direction, the Bank was paying debts on account of Herzog Brothers. The Bank’s conduct implicates and runs afoul of Rule 3111(c). This is particularly true in the case of checks used by Herzog Brothers to fund the cashier’s checks where the checks were drawn on foreign banks. In those instances, the Bank issued the cashier’s checks with no knowledge of whether sufficient funds existed to cover the checks in the foreign banks; therefore, the Bank was essentially advancing bank funds to Herzog Brothers and then using those funds to pay debts on behalf of Herzog Brothers.</p>

      <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>We agree with Witco, however, that the Eighth Circuit’s reasoning in <em>Southwestern Glass, </em>to the effect that the duration of the transaction is not pertinent, is persuasive and should apply to similar situations arising under Pennsylvania law. Although the funds in <em>Southwestern Glass </em>were actually deposited into an account managed by the debtor, the deposit and subsequent disbursement of the funds took place within a very brief time period. In fact, the deposits were made at the moment when a check drawn on the account was presented to the bank. Therefore, the deposit and disbursal were practically simultaneous, much like the transactions at issue here. The Bank is correct that the funds in this case were never technically deposited into Herzog Brothers’ account at the Bank. However, the Bank did take possession of Herzog Brothers’ property, albeit briefly, and, like the bank in <em>Southwestern Glass, </em>this brief possession obligated the Bank to hold the funds for Witco in accordance with Rule 3111(c).

The Bank posits that, in this case, Herzog Brothers could have purchased money orders at a convenience store and accomplished the same result with no questions arising as to whether the convenience store should have issued the money orders and that requiring the convenience store to cease all contact, including sales transactions, goes beyond the purpose of the garnishment rules. The Bank thus posits that its activities in this case are indistinguishable from those of a convenience store selling money orders to anonymous customers. Therefore, in the Bank’s view, neither the garnishment rules themselves nor public policy should be construed to prohibit the sales of cashier’s checks that occurred here.</p>

Witco argues that the Bank’s conduct clearly violated both the letter and spirit of the garnishment rules, ultimately permitting Herzog Brothers to avoid execution of the lawfully obtained judgment against it. The Bank here clearly provided Herzog Brothers with all the benefits of a bank account while assisting Herzog Brothers in avoiding the seizure of their assets, which was required pursuant to the writ of execution. Witco asserts that if this Court permits this type of activity in garnishment cases, the ability of creditors to collect judgments will be severely diminished. Witco is correct.</p>

Again, Herzog Brothers and the Bank enjoyed an ongoing commercial banking relationship that predated Witco’s garnishment proceedings. The Bank was served with a writ of execution relative to Herzog Brothers precisely because of its status as Herzog Brothers’ banker. Therefore, the Bank was fully aware of the judgment against Herzog Brothers and of its obligation to safeguard Herzog Brothers’ assets currently in the Bank’s possession and those that subsequently came into the Bank’s possession. The Bank failed to do so, instead acquiescing in a course of conduct that treated Herzog Brothers differently than other customers, and essentially allowed Herzog Brothers to exchange its assets without exposing them to garnishment. The Bank thus permitted Herzog Brothers to continue a banking relationship without requiring them to actually deposit money into any of Herzog Brothers’ garnished accounts. This arrangement benefited the Bank as well as Herzog Brothers, to the tune of over $22,000 in little more than a year. <em>See </em>note 1 <em>supra.</em>

In assessing and weighing such considerations, this Court will not turn a blind eye to the obvious effects of the conduct at issue. It is plain that the Bank and Herzog Brothers engaged in an extended course of conduct that permitted Herzog Brothers to avoid garnishment of its assets. Whether it was the Bank’s and/or Herzog Brothers’ deliberate intent to subvert the writ of execution and subsequent garnishment obligation matters less than the fact that such was clearly the result. By using cashier’s checks instead of checks drawn on its own accounts, Herzog Brothers successfully processed more than $6 million dollars of its funds and used those funds to pay its obligations to creditors other than Witco without depositing one penny of those funds into its accounts with the Bank. The Bank permitted this conduct and even derived its own financial benefit, making the Bank a player in this activity, not an innocent bystander. Were this Court to sanction this type of conduct on grounds of “public policy,” we would, as Witco argues, be <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>placing a stranglehold on judgment creditors in their efforts to collect judgments. In addition, we would be giving carte blanche to judgment debtors who are sharp enough in their business dealings to devise creative methods to avoid collection of valid judgments obtained lawfully against them. Such a course is clearly not within the spirit or intent of the. garnishment rules, and we will not allow conduct that so eviscerates that spirit and intent, under the guise of enforcing some other public policy.</p>

At the time of these challenged transactions, before a National City bank issued a cashier’s check, National City’s policies required that all funds to be used toward the issuance of a cashier’s check in excess of $3,000 first be deposited into an account at the bank and that a hold be put on all funds derived from foreign bank checks to verify that those accounts contained a sufficient balance to cover those funds. However, when a purchaser buys a cashier’s check in Pennsylvania, the law governing such a transaction does not require the bank to deposit the purchaser’s funds into an account at the bank prior to the bank issuing a cashier’s check nor does the law require a bank to hold funds derived from foreign checks in such scenarios. Moreover, National City’s decision to waive its internal policies was not illegal and, therefore, was a choice that the bank was free to make. As such, the fact that National City waived its internal policies in dealing with Herzog Brothers is irrelevant to an analysis of the questions posed by the Third Circuit.</p>

As such, a cashier’s check is the bank’s obligation rather than the purchaser’s personal obligation. Douglas J.

In fact, if a bank wrongfully refuses to pay a cashier’s check that it issued, then the bank exposes itself to liability in the form of expenses, loss of interest, and even consequential damages. 13 <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>Pa.C.S. § 3411.

Consequently, when a purchaser conveys his or her funds to bank for a cashier’s check, in exchange for the funds paid, the purchaser receives a unique product, <em>i.e., </em>a check that the bank is obligated to pay, assuring payees of these checks of the availability of the funds represented on the checks. <em>See, id. </em>at 101.</p>

While it is true that a bank exercises dominion over the funds that a purchaser of a cashier’s check conveys to the bank, this is simply because, upon receipt of the funds, the bank obtains unfettered ownership of the funds.

This result is not only absurd, <em>see, </em>Pa.R.C.P. 128(a); it is tantamount to authorizing fraudulent inducement. Moreover, a garnishee has a “general duty to act with reasonable care and to take no steps that would unfairly prejudice the judgment debtor. In addition, the garnishee must act in good faith and exercise a high degree of care to protect the rights of all parties.” <em>See generally </em>13 <em>Standard Pennsylvania Practice 2d </em>at 77:39 (explaining garnishees’ general duties owed to defendants)(footnotes omitted). If a garnishee bank conducted business with a defendant in the manner forwarded by the Majority, then the bank most certainly would be breaching these general duties.

Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 3111(c), a garnishee bank that receives “possession” of a defendant’s property would be restrained from paying a debt to or on the account of the debtor with that property. For the reasons stated above, however, a bank does not come into possession of a defendant purchaser’s property, as contemplated by Pa. R.C.P. 3101(b), by engaging in the sale of a cashier’s check. Therefore, because a garnishee bank never takes possession of a defendant’s property when the bank sells a cashier’s check to the defendant, a garnishee bank cannot possibly pay a debt to or for the account of the defendant with the defendant’s property as a result of such a transaction.

These laws contemplate that in order for a writ of garnishment to capture funds or property of a defendant being held by a third-party garnishee, the garnishee must either owe a debt to the defendant or actually possess the property of the defendant. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 3101(b). These laws do not, however, suggest that a writ of garnishment should capture a defendant’s funds when the defendant engages in the purchase of a cashier’s check, a transaction akin to that of other sales transactions. Accordingly, because our laws governing garnishment do not contemplate the garnishment of funds exchanged in such scenarios, the public policy of this Commonwealth is not offended by such an exchange and, therefore, does not require a garnishee from refraining from engaging in such transactions, regardless of whether the garnishee profits from such transactions.</p>

Witco and the Majority rely on <em>Southwestern Glass </em>for the proposition that no matter how briefly a garnishee bank possesses a judgment debtor's funds, the instant the funds come into the bank’s possession, the bank is obligated to hold the funds for the judgment creditor. As the Majority relates, in <em>Southwestern Glass, </em>the garnishee bank extended a line of credit to the judgment debtor and allowed the judgment debtor to draw checks on this line of credit. <em><a href="/f3d/332/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="332 F.3d 513" data-case-ids="9114789,9121205" data-case-paths="/f3d/332/0513-01,/br/294/0513-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/332/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="332 F.3d 513" data-case-ids="9114789,9121205" data-case-paths="/f3d/332/0513-01,/br/294/0513-01">at 517</a>. However, this arrangement required the funds to flow through an account <em>managed by the judgment debtor. <a href="/f3d/332/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="332 F.3d 513" data-case-ids="9114789,9121205" data-case-paths="/f3d/332/0513-01,/br/294/0513-01">Id.</a> </em>While the funds remained in the line of credit, they were not subject to garnishment; however, the instant that the funds were transferred into the judgment debtor's account, the judgment debtor obtained an ownership interest in the funds. <em><a href="/f3d/332/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="332 F.3d 513" data-case-ids="9114789,9121205" data-case-paths="/f3d/332/0513-01,/br/294/0513-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/332/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="332 F.3d 513" data-case-ids="9114789,9121205" data-case-paths="/f3d/332/0513-01,/br/294/0513-01">at 518</a>. Although the transferred funds only briefly passed through the judgment debtor's account, the Eighth Circuit determined that for the brief time that the funds were in the <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>judgment debtor's account, the funds belonged to the judgment debtor, and therefore, the judgment creditor’s writ of garnishment captured these funds.</p>
      <p id="AO7" data-blocks='[["BL_774.2",774,[309,2107,1123,231]]]'>In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>the funds conveyed by Herzog Brothers were never deposited into a personal account. Rather, the bank issued the cashier's checks immediately upon receipt of Herzog Brothers' funds. Therefore, the bank never possessed these funds as contemplated by Pa.R.C.P. 3101(b), and the funds, consequently, could not be captured by Witco's writ of garnishment.</p>
