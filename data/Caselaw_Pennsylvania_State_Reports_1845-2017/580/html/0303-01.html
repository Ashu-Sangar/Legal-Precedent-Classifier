As the two men walked together, appellant heatedly questioned Sims about a stolen gun. Sims replied, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” Appellant nevertheless proceeded to punch Sims several times. As Sims recoiled from the blows, appellant pulled a weapon, possibly a “TEC-9” handgun, from underneath his shirt and shouted, “I’ll show you what sorry is.” Sims pleaded, “no please, please don’t, just please don’t” as appellant aimed the weapon and pulled the trigger. But appellant’s first attempt to fire the weapon failed—perhaps because he had not deactivated the safety mechanism. On a second attempt, however, appellant fired several rounds at Sims as he attempted to flee, fatally wounding him. The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds; Sims had sustained eleven shots to the back, hip, thigh, and arms.</p>
    <p id="b437-5" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[166,1272,1153,410]]]'>Three eyewitnesses testified at appellant’s trial that they saw appellant, or someone resembling appellant, commit the murder. Luis Castillo, who lived with his family on Randolph Street, testified that he saw the shooting from his second-floor bedroom window, but did not recognize the shooter, whom he described as a “Puerto Rican male.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> N.T. 9/10/99, at 38-48.

Antonio testified that he saw appellant, whom he recognized from the neighborhood, fire multiple shots at Sims after a brief argument and a physical altercation. Zlatnik likewise testified that she saw appellant shoot Sims multiple times with “some type of machine gun.” N.T. 9/10/99, at 67-83. She further testified that appellant looked at her “real hard” as he walked away from the scene of the shooting. <em>Id. </em>at 73. In a statement to police on the night of the murder, she described the shooter as <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>a nineteen- to twenty-year-old, light complexioned, Hispanic male, with a nose-ring, gold medallion, and a baseball cap. Several months later, police presented Antonio, and later, Zlatnik, with a photographic array which had been compiled based upon Zlatnik’s crime-scene description of the shooter. Both witnesses identified appellant’s photograph as that of the shooter.</p>
    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[284,694,1156,732]]]'>This evidence, and all reasonable inferences derived therefrom, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, supports appellant’s first-degree murder conviction. Sims was unlawfully killed, as there is nothing on this record to support that the use of deadly force against him was legally justified. The eyewitness testimony identified appellant as the person who deliberately shot the victim. The evidence that appellant stated, “I’ll show you what sorry is,” as he drew his weapon, unsuccessfully attempted to fire it and then, after another attempt, shot Sims multiple times, establishes that the killing was deliberate. Finally, the fact that appellant shot the victim in vital body parts independently warranted the jury finding of a specific intent to kill.</p>
    <p id="b438-6" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[282,1463,1155,580]]]'>Appellant claims, however, that the evidence was “insufficient” to support the convictions because the only evidence linking him to the murder is what he deems the “highly inconsistent” testimony of Antonio Castillo and Zlatnik. Appellant contends that the witnesses’ testimony is “tainted” by the fact that they failed to implicate appellant in the murder until months later after they themselves had been charged with serious crimes. Appellant further argues that numerous inconsistencies as to whether they witnessed the murder while in their car, on the steps, or in the house, rendered their testimony unreliable.</p>

The <em>Farquharson </em>Court indeed noted that “where evidence offered to support a verdict of guilt is so unreliable and/or contradictory as to make any verdict based thereon pure conjecture, a jury may not be permitted to return such a finding.” <a href="/pa/467/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="467 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1717363" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0050-01">354 A.2d at </a>550 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

But differences in the accounts of Antonio Castillo and Zlatnik that were contradictory are not sufficient to render their testimony mere conjecture or render it unreliable. While their testimony differed somewhat on the question of whether they were near a car or in front of the house when they saw the shooting, it was consistent as to the crucial events surrounding the shooting itself, <em>i.e., </em>that appellant shot Sims multiple times after a brief argument and a physical altercation during which Sims had pleaded in vain for mercy.

Appellant further argues that his trial counsel should have objected to both references to appellant’s “reputation.” The Commonwealth counters that the prosecutor’s emphasis on Castillo’s fear of appellant was a fair response to defense counsel’s suggestion in his opening and closing arguments that Castillo’s belated identification of appellant was not credible. The Commonwealth also argues that counsel cannot be deemed ineffective because he made “tactical use” of Castillo’s explanation of why he delayed in identifying appellant.

The plea to such an external irrelevancy was so direct that it culminated in the prosecutor inviting the jury to sentence this appellant to death so as to “scare straight” others who might be considering murder. There was no role for such an argument here. The prosecutor’s improper comments effectively invited jurors to ignore their sworn duty to decide the matter exclusively upon the facts presented concerning the weighing of specific statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <em>See LaCava, </em><a href="/a2d/666/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="666 A.2d 221" data-case-ids="12043856,458423" data-case-paths="/a2d/666/0221-01,/pa/542/0160-01">666 A.2d at 237</a>; <em>see also Chambers, </em><a href="/pa/528/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="528 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1829794" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0558-01">599 A.2d at 644</a> (“[I]f a penalty of death is meted out by a jury, it must be because the jury was satisfied that the substantive law of the Commonwealth requires its imposition.... ”).</p>

We also recognize that there are many things that occur in the course of a trial which are beyond the control or anticipation of counsel and the trial judge—such as witnesses, jurors or spectators acting inappropriately. But one aspect of a trial which is far more subject to rational control is the behavior of attorneys—officers of this <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>Court whose professionalism is absolutely indispensable to the fair administration of justice in this Commonwealth. Lawyers have an obligation to be aware of, and to abide by, the law governing the conduct of the matters in which they are involved. This Court’s unambiguous directive in <em>Hall </em>was not aimed at the conduct of witnesses, or police officers, or jurors, or court staff, or judges: it was aimed directly at counsel. Moreover, it concerned a matter and stage of trial over which counsel have unique, indeed premeditated control: <em>i.e., </em>what it is they intend to say to the jury. When this Court issues a directive concerning what is permissible at that stage, we expect officers of the Court to abide by that directive. In light of our explicit directive in <em>Hall, </em>which was but the last in a series of decisions expressing grave concern over this very type of argument, we are dismayed, to say the least, by the government lawyer’s use of such prohibited rhetoric in this case.</p>

But we have little confidence that such a charge was adequate to remove the prejudice resulting from the prosecutor’s decision to employ an inherently prejudicial argument that had specifically been deemed off-limits. The jury in this case ultimately found two aggravating circumstances and two mitigating circumstances, and thus was required to weigh the competing factors to determine which ones predominated. In such an instance, the fact that the prosecutor had argued that a collateral external effect of a death verdict would be to send a message to others which might prevent future crimes—a factor which does not exist as a proper statutory aggravating circumstance—may well have played a role, direct or indirect, in at least one juror’s balancing process. <em>See LaCava, </em><a href="/a2d/666/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="666 A.2d 221" data-case-ids="12043856,458423" data-case-paths="/a2d/666/0221-01,/pa/542/0160-01">666 A.2d at 237</a> (relief warranted in context of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to object where prosecutor’s argument went beyond single aggravating circumstance at issue to inject improper additional basis for returning verdict of death; since both aggravating and mitigating circumstances were found by jury, improper argument <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>“could have impermissibly shifted the balance in favor of a death sentence.”). In this regard, it is also significant that the trial court’s cautionary charge could be read as having inadvertently validated the prosecutor’s non-record-based assumptions that a verdict of death indeed would send a message both to the community at large or other prisoners. In instructing the jury, the court did not question the accuracy or legitimacy of those assumptions, but instead directed that the jury should not base its verdict upon them. On such a record, we conclude that the ability of the sentencing jury to weigh the evidence objectively was fatally compromised and, accordingly, appellant is entitled to a new sentencing proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.4",458,[278,965,1161,1374]]]'>More importantly, we conclude here, as we did in <em>Chambers </em>when confronted with a similar challenge to this Court’s directives concerning what comprises appropriate argument in the penalty phase of a capital trial, that penalty phase arguments requesting that the jury send a message with its verdict are prejudicial <em>per se. </em>We reach this conclusion in part because of the inherently prejudicial nature of the remarks, and in part as a matter of our supervisory authority over Pennsylvania attorneys. We do not reach the conclusion lightly. The inappropriate argument at issue here is similar to that at issue in <em>Chambers. </em>The argument goes to the very core of the penalty phase jury’s task, injecting an improper external element in favor of death. As this Court has made clear in the decisions culminating in <em>Chambers </em>and <em>LaCava, </em>it is essential that arguments made in favor of the ultimate penalty be confined to those statutory aggravating circumstances which are specifically charged and which thereby serve as the only appropriate basis for a verdict of death. Given the critical balancing process required of the penalty phase jury, the important individual role of jurors in this assessment, the inherently prejudicial nature of the argument, and the fact that the content of a lawyer’s argument is easily within his control, we will no longer proceed with case-by-case assessments in this area. Such arguments are to be avoided and the peril of defiance is to fall upon the party who would flout the rule.</p>
