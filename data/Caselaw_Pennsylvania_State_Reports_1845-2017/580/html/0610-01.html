The Commonwealth Court held that PSERS correctly interpreted the statute to permit the purchase of credit for prior part-time service that would not have entitled the employees to membership in PSERS at the time the service was rendered. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the Commonwealth Court, and accordingly, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b741-4" data-blocks='[["BL_741.4",741,[160,641,1154,1486]]]'>The parties stipulated to the relevant facts. PSERS is an independent administrative board of the Commonwealth that manages the pension retirement system for Pennsylvania’s public school employees. The Public School Employee’s Retirement Board (“Board”) is the governing body of PSERS. Prior to 1975, only full-time school employees were entitled to membership in PSERS. In 1975, our General Assembly adopted a new Public School Employees’ Retirement Code mandating PSERS membership status for certain part-time employees. Specifically, the 1975 Retirement Code required that, in addition to all full-time employees, all per diem employees working 80 or more days or hourly employees working 500 hours or more in a given fiscal year must be enrolled as active PSERS “members” for that year. <em>See </em>24 Pa.C.S. § 8301(a). The 1975 Retirement Code also permitted PSERS members to purchase credit toward their retirement, which would increase their retirement benefits, for certain part-time service rendered prior to the enactment of the 1975 Retirement Code. <em>See </em>24 Pa.C.S. § 8303(c). From 1975 through 1998, PSERS construed the Code as allowing its active members to purchase credit for prior part-time school service only for those years in which the members had worked 80 or more days or 500 or more <em>hours—i.e., </em>only for years in which they had qualified as “members” of the system. In 1992, consistently with this policy/interpretation, PSERS directed that school districts not report non-qualifying service, which PSERS defined as service involving fewer than 80 days or 500 hours in a given year.</p>
    <p id="b741-5" data-blocks='[["BL_741.5",741,[160,2152,1154,202]],["BL_742.1",742,[285,316,1154,310]]]'>On January 29, 1999, PSERS issued a Policy Statement which effectively reversed its practice of limiting purchase of credit for previous school service to years in which the employee had worked more than 80 days or 500 hours. PSERS <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>announced in its Policy Statement that active PSERS members could henceforth purchase credit for previous school service irrespective of whether that service met the 80 day/500 hour threshold in a given year. It is this change in policy, and the question of its legitimacy as a matter of statutory interpretation of the Code, which is the crux of this action.</p>
    <p id="b742-5" data-blocks='[["BL_742.4",742,[281,653,1157,1269]]]'>On March 23, 1999, appellant Pennsylvania School Boards Association, Inc. (“PSBA”)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> filed a petition for review in the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. PSBA claimed that the 1999 PSERS Policy Statement contravened both the clear meaning and intent of Section 8303(c) of the Retirement Code as well as the historical interpretation of the provision. PSBA sought to bar implementation of the policy, arguing that employee purchases of such previous part-time school service would financially burden its member school districts. The claim for injunctive relief was ultimately dropped, and a scheduled preliminary injunction hearing was canceled, based upon a stipulation between the parties, pursuant to which PSERS would process purchase requests for those members who needed the disputed time to qualify for “30 and out” early retirement incentives or for disability purposes. The parties further agreed that these applications would not be affected by any later court decision on the merits of the dispute. PSERS also agreed to accept but not process other applications to purchase the contested credit, subject to the resolution of this litigation. Thus, PSBA’s request for declaratory relief alone is at issue. The Pennsylvania State Education Association and the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers were permitted to intervene in the matter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

On May 17, 2000, the Commonwealth Court, in a published opinion, denied the motion to strike PSERS as a party, but ruled that PSBA indeed lacked standing to assert that the Board owed PSBA a fiduciary duty. <em>Pennsylvania School Boards Association, Inc. v.

PSERS I). </em>Concluding that the Retirement Code expressly limits those standing in a fiduciary relationship with PSERS to “the members of the system,” and that PSBA is not a member of the system, the Commonwealth Court sustained the Board’s preliminary objection on the issue of fiduciary duty and struck the paragraphs of PSBA’s petition alleging a breach of fiduciary duty.</p>

PSERS argued that the Code broadly defines “previous school service” as any service by a school employee, whether full- or part-time, regardless of whether the school employee was a member of PSERS at the time the service was rendered, and regardless of any minimum of hours or days worked in a given service year. The Commonwealth Court, in a second published opinion, agreed with PSERS’s interpretation of Section 8303(c), basing its view upon a plain meaning reading of the statute. The panel noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that if the General Assembly had intended to limit the purchase of part-time service to service which, when rendered, would have qualified an employee for membership in PSERS <em>(i.e., </em>80 days or 500 hours in a given year), the legislation easily could have included language making that intention clear: “It could have said ‘previous school service <em>as a member’ </em>in Section 8303(c), or it could have defined ‘previous school service’ as ‘school service rendered as a member’ in Section 8102. It did neither.” <em>Pennsylvania School Boards Association, Inc. v.

As further evidence of this supposed legislative intent to exclude years of part-time service involving less than 80 days or 500 hours, PSBA notes that the Retirement Code nowhere expressly permits the purchase of credit for years in which an employee worked fewer than 80 days or 500 hours. PSBA also points to the heading of Section 8803, which refers to “creditable” prior service, and argues that such creditable service can only mean the same 80 days/500 hours of service in a given year which would trigger mandatory “membership” in the system for that year under Section 8301(a)(2).</p>

The language of Section 8303(c) plainly provides that Class T-C members may purchase credit for “previous school service or creditable nonschool service” and that Class T-D members may purchase credit for “previous school service.” The General Assembly obviously considered when “creditable” prior service should be required, yet did not include that word <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>as a modifier of previous school service—which it certainly and easily could have done had it intended to so limit purchases of credit by PSERS members.

In the case <em>sub judice, </em>judicial insertion of the word “creditable” to modify and qualify the previous school service made eligible for purchase credit in Section 8303(c), or importation of a non-textual 80 day/500 hour minimum yearly threshold, would dramatically alter the scope and operation of the statute, and indeed, would conflict with the purpose and intent of the statute as revealed by its plain language.</p>

PSBA’s claim that the Retirement Code’s limitation of PSERS “membership” to those school employees who work at least 80 days or 500 hours in a fiscal year should be construed to apply to the balance of the Code is belied by the very text of the statute, which distinguishes between PSERS membership and school employee status. As the Commonwealth Court aptly noted, under the Code, “school employee” and PSERS “member” are not synonymous terms. <em>PSBA v.

PSBAs argument that the 80 day/500 hour limitation applicable to a “member” should be construed to apply throughout the Retirement Code would render meaningless the specific and broader definition of school employee set forth by the General Assembly.

In addition, PSBA posits that there will be greatly increased costs to public school entities due to processing claims for previous service that was non-qualifying at the time it was rendered, especially because some school districts may not have maintained the records necessary to determine the amount of service previously performed by part-time employees. PSBA also argues that the PSERS interpretation can lead to an abuse of the Retirement System by employees who opt to work 80 or more days or 500 or more hours in only one year solely in order to purchase credit for many years of past service that did not meet the 80 days/500 hours threshold.</p>

This Court has not hesitated to overturn even longstanding and consistent administrative interpretations of a statute in circumstances where, in our first encounter with the interpretation, we found it to be inconsistent with the meaning of the statute. <em>See <a href="/pa/573/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="822 A.2d 676" data-case-ids="197219,9131720" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0143-01,/a2d/822/0676-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/573/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="822 A.2d 676" data-case-ids="197219,9131720" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0143-01,/a2d/822/0676-01">at 681-82</a> (declining to follow administrative regulation first adopted in 1976).

Accordingly, we hold that the Commonwealth Court properly interpreted Section 8303(c) to permit PSERS active members to purchase credit for previous years of school service, even if that previous school service fell short of the 80 days/500 hours yearly threshold which would have been required for mandatory PSERS membership.</p>

The <em>PSBA v.

PSBA did not allege that the Board breached its fiduciary duty to PSERS members nor that PSBA is a member of the system.

      <blockquote id="b747-6" data-blocks='[["BL_747.6",747,[221,1298,1092,1015]]]'>(a) Computation of credited service.—In computing credited school service of a member for the determination of benefits, a full-time salaried school employee shall receive one year of credit for each school year or the corresponding fraction thereof, in accordance with the proportion of the full school year for which the required regular member contributions have been made, or for which such contributions otherwise required for such service were not made solely by reason of any provision of this part relating to the limitations under IRC 401(a)(17) or 415(b). A per diem or hourly school employee shall receive one year of credited service for each nonoverlapping period of 12 consecutive months in which he is employed and for which contributions are made, or would have been made but for such limitations under the IRC, for at least 180 full-day sessions or 1,100 hours of employment. If such member was employed and contributions were made for less than 180 full-day sessions or 1,100 hours, he shall be credited with a fractional portion of a year determined by the ratio of the number of full-day sessions or hours of service actually rendered to 180 full-day sessions or 1,100 hours, as the case may be. A part-time salaried employee shall be credited with the fractional portion of the year which corresponds to the service actually rendered in relation to the service required as a comparable full-time salaried employee. In no case shall a member receive more than one year of credited service for any 12 consecutive months or a member who has elected multiple service receive an aggregate in the two systems of more than one year of credited service for any 12 consecutive months.</blockquote>

Like the Retirement Code provisions at issue here, the SERS Code has a threshold a state employee must meet in order to be eligible for membership in that system. Section 5301 of the SERS Code requires that a state employee work in excess of 100 days or 750 hours in a 12-month period to qualify for membership. 71 P.S. § 5301. Sections 5303 and 5504 of the SERS Code contain the same distinction between "previous state service" and "creditable nonstate service” that Section 8303(c) makes with regard to “previous school service” and “creditable nonschool service.” The SERS Board interprets the SERS Code to <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>allow state employees, once they qualify for membership, to purchase credit for past service that did not meet the 100 day/750 hour threshold necessary for "membership” in the system. The marked similarity between the two statutory schemes and the fact that the administrative board of each retirement system interprets the language of its Code in the same manner is further proof of the propriety of our plain language construction.</p>

It is notable, as revealed in the intervenor brief of the Pennsylvania State Education Association, that there are equitable factors which cut against the financial equities argued by PSBA. Intervenor focuses upon what it deems to be the "human impact” of a statutory policy permitting the purchase of credit for previous school service. Intervenor notes that, while a school year consists of 180 working days during a 12-month period, many school employees work in excess of 180 days yet still receive credit for but one year of service; the excess days cannot be “banked” for use in a year when an employee works fewer than 180 days. Moreover, intervenor notes that, during the course of a school employee's career, there are numerous reasons why a member may not reach the 180 day mark, including illness, and these reasons will sometimes compel an employee to retire at the end of a school year while shy of the minimum number of years required for full retirement benefits. When this happens, a member could be denied full retirement benefits if he cannot purchase credit for retirement for previous service. Providing such members with a method to recoup their fractional years of service may permit them to reach a milestone necessary for full retirement benefits, which is a fitting end to the careers of dedicated, long-term school employees with short gaps in their service history. We offer no view upon the comparative merits of this “policy” argument or PSBA’s "policy" argument. The fact that such arguments can be mustered on either side corroborates that this was and is a matter for legislative balance and determination. In the absence of textual ambiguity, this Court’s duty is to construe the statute as is.</p>
