At this hearing, the Commonwealth presented, <em>inter alia, </em>the testimony of Veronique N. Valliere (“Valliere”), a psychologist who is a member of this Commonwealth’s State Sexual Offenders Assessment Board (“Board”). At the outset of her testimony, Valliere stated that she based her opinion on “all the police reports, criminal complaints, prior evidence gathering ... [as <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>well as Appellee’s] past criminal behavior and past behavioral history.” N.T., 6/19/2001, at 36.

In forming this opinion, she stated that Appellee has an antisocial personality disorder. N.T., 6/19/2000., at 39-40. She highlighted that this was a violent crime in that Appellee dragged the victim off of the street and sexually assaulted her even after encountering “significant resistance” from the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 40. Valliere commented that Appellee’s assault on the victim included his forceful attempts to assault the victim anally, orally, and vaginally. <em>Id. </em>at 40-41. Valliere also noted that Appellee had a prior criminal history of assaults against women, noting that he had “a prior conviction for an attempted rape,” <em>id. </em>at 39, and stating that the conviction for this crime was for indecent assault. <em>Id. </em>at 54.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The Superior Court concluded that Valliere’s testimony, however, was insufficient to sustain the trial court’s finding that Appellant was an SVP. It stated it was “compelled” to find that the evidence was insufficient since “Valliere’s testimony was almost entirely dependent upon the original warrant and charging document in this case, and their unproven allegations, rather than the actual basis of the guilty plea.” Super. Ct. slip. op. at 9. It opined that by relying on the charging document and the affidavit for probable cause, Valliere introduced facts that had not been proven at the guilty plea nor stipulated to by Appellee. For example, Appellee’s statement at the guilty plea did not intimate that the sexual assault was violent, whereas Valliere noted that the victim had been forcibly removed from the street and that Appellee had tried to anally and orally rape the victim prior to successfully raping her vaginally. <em>Id.</em>

There are multiple steps in this process. After a defendant is <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>convicted of an offense specified in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>, the trial court orders the Board to prepare an assessment of the defendant. In preparing this assessment, the Board is to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the facts of the current offense, the defendant’s prior offense history, and characteristics of the defendant. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.4(b). This assessment is then forwarded to the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b736-5" data-blocks='[["BL_736.4",736,[286,696,1152,943]]]'>The Commonwealth may then praecipe to convene a hearing to determine whether the defendant is an SVP. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.4(e)(1). These SVP hearings are not perfunctory affairs in which the parties and the judge merely review the trial or guilty plea colloquy proceedings. Rather, they are evidence gathering mechanisms. Section 9795.4 specifically states that the district attorney and the defendant “shall be given notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard, the right to call witnesses, the right to call expert witnesses and the right to cross-examine witnesses.” 42 Pa.C.S. 9795.4(e)(2). Additionally, the defendant is granted the right to counsel. <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth bears the burden of proof at this hearing, and it must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is an SVP. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.4(e)(3). As this is a question of law, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In making this determination, it refused to credit Fallers testimony as it was predicated on facts that were not contained in Appellees guilty plea. While we are uncertain as to the precise thrust of the Superior Courts rationale, it appears that the Superior Court found the evidence to be insufficient because Vallieres testimony was somehow inadmissible due its reliance on the affidavit for probable cause and the charging documents. A defendant such as Appellee may, of course, raise a challenge to the admissibility of evidence adduced by the Commonwealth at an <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>SVP hearing; an appellate court may ultimately find such a challenge to be meritorious and that the defendant is entitled to a new SVP hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Yet, a challenge to the admissibility of evidence is separate from a sufficiency claim. Indeed, it is improper for a court, when reviewing a sufficiency challenge, to eliminate from its consideration any evidence which it deems to be inadmissible. This court has stated with great precision that in addressing sufficiency of the evidence claims,</p>
    <blockquote id="b737-5" data-blocks='[["BL_737.4",737,[201,761,1112,419]]]'>we are called upon to consider all of the testimony that was presented to the jury during the trial, <em>without consideration as to the admissibility of that evidence. </em>The question of sufficiency is not assessed upon a diminished record. Where improperly admitted evidence has been allowed to be considered by the jury, its subsequent deletion does not justify a finding of insufficient evidence. The remedy in such a case is the grant of a new trial.</blockquote>
