Judge Kelley denied appellants’ motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that appellants had failed to establish each criterion for a preliminary injunction, and specifically, did not demonstrate a clear right to relief. On February 7, 2001, the Commonwealth filed preliminary objections to appellants’ Complaint in Equity asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellants had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The declaratory judgment action and the Commonwealth’s preliminary objections were considered by an <em>en banc </em>panel of the Commonwealth Court.

The panel majority found that there was an absence of express language in Section 6111(b) prohibiting the Pennsylvania State Police from retaining the information on the application/record of sale of handguns. Rather, the panel majority found that Section 6111(b)(1.1)(v), which requires the destruction of applications/records of sale within 72 hours, only applied to “firearms which exceed the barrel and related lengths set forth in Section 6102,” <em>i.e. </em>what are more commonly known as long guns (rifles and shotguns), not handguns. Therefore, the panel majority held that appellants were “unable to state a claim that the Commonwealth’s maintenance of a database of handgun sales is a violation of Section 6111(b) of the Firearms Act.” <em>See <a href="/a2d/790/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="790 A.2d 350" data-case-ids="9391091" data-case-paths="/a2d/790/0350-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/790/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="790 A.2d 350" data-case-ids="9391091" data-case-paths="/a2d/790/0350-01">at 359</a>.

The database maintained by the Pennsylvania State Police is an official record and, as noted by the Commonwealth Court, does appear to resemble a “registry.” <em>See Allegheny County Sportsmen’s League v.

However, Section 6111.4 only prohibits a registry of <em>ownership </em>and, therefore, the dispositive issue is what is being registered by the Pennsylvania State Police— <em>i.e., </em>whether the database is a record of firearm ownership or of something else. The Firearms Act does not define ownership, but the common definition is: “the state of fact of being an owner; legal right of possession.” <em>Webster’s New World Dictionary </em>(2nd College Edition), p. 1016 (1986). Additionally, the term “own” is defined as “to possess; hold as personal property.” <em>Id., </em>at p. 1015.

    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[298,440,1151,787]]]'>It is undisputed that the database at issue is not a registry of ownership, but rather, merely reflects the applications/records of sale for handgun purchases that occur in Pennsylvania. The database does not maintain a record of all firearms owned by Pennsylvanians, which would include long guns, or firearms that are owned by Pennsylvanians, but not purchased in the Commonwealth. Additionally, the database of handgun sales does not include handguns that are transferred between spouses, parents and children, and grandparents and grandchildren. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 6111(c). Nor is the database a survey of existing ownership. The database maintained by the Commonwealth merely contains information regarding the sales of handguns in the Commonwealth. Such a database does not amount to a “registry of firearm ownership” as prohibited by the Firearms Act.</p>

In their view, the fact that the database is not a complete registry of firearm ownership does not change its essential nature as a registry of firearm ownership and it therefore should be deemed prohibited by Section 6111.4. Additionally, appellants argue that a person who purchases a handgun automatically becomes its owner, and therefore the application/record of sale retained by the Pennsylvania State Police and placed in its database creates a registry defined by ownership. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellant, at 22. However, as noted, the limited nature of the Pennsylvania State Police’s database makes it clear that the database does not purport to track the owners of handguns, but merely records the last reported purchases of handguns. Although, in many cases, a purchaser becomes and remains the owner, there are instances where a purchaser does not maintain possession. For example, a man may purchase a handgun and fill out the application/registration of sale, which is then forwarded to the Pennsylvania State Police and placed in the database. That man could have purchased the handgun as a <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>gift for his wife or child and may legally transfer the handgun to his spouse or child without any obligation to correct or update the information on the application/record of sale. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 6111(c). In,that instance, the owner, <em>i.e. </em>the person in control of the handgun, is the spouse or child, and that person is not included in the Pennsylvania State Police’s database, which only retains a record of the purchase.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Accordingly, we remain no less persuaded that the database maintained by the Pennsylvania State Police is merely a record of handgun <em>sales </em>and does not qualify as a “registry of firearm <em>ovmership” </em>as prohibited by Section 6111.4.</p>

Appellants further rely on Judge Friedman’s opinion below, which opined that “section 6111.1(b)(1.1)(v) of the Firearms Act specifically states that the retention of the ‘record of sale ... is precluded by 6111.4.’ Thus the statute itself makes clear that the record of ‘sale’ is the record of ‘ownership.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 363 n. 4 (citing 18 Pa.C.S. § 6111(b)(1.1)(v)).</p>

Rather than Section 6111(b)(1.1)(v) stating that the retention of a “record of sale <em>... is </em>precluded by Section 6111.4,” the actual language of Section 6111.4 states that “no information on the application/record of sale provided pursuant to this <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>subsection shall be retained <em>as </em>precluded by section 6111.4 (relating to registration of firearms) by the Pennsylvania State Police either through retention of the application/record of sale or by entering the information on the computer.” <em>See </em>Brief of Amici, at 19-20 (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. § 6111(b)(1.1)(v) (emphasis added)).</p>
    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[286,647,1159,1006]]]'>The Amici’s argument has force. The language in Section 6111(b)(1.1)(v) does not prohibit the retention of the applications/records of sale in all circumstances. Rather, it prohibits the retention of the applications/records of sale in a manner that would be precluded by Section 6111.4, <em>i.e., </em>in a registry of firearm ownership. Thus, the applications/records of sale cannot be used to establish a registry of firearm ownership, <em>i. e., </em>a registry that tracks individuals who have possession and control over firearms. For the reasons above stated, since we have concluded that the database is not a registry of firearm ownership, the Pennsylvania State Police are not precluded from maintaining the applications/records of sale for the database of handgun sales. The Pennsylvania State Polices creation and maintenance of such a database of handgun sales does not violate Section 6111.4 of the Firearms Act. Accordingly, appellants have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and the Commonwealth Court correctly sustained the Commonwealth’s preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer.</p>

But, in citing this excerpt, appellants omit citations and references to another part of the Firearms Act. When examining this portion of the Commonwealth Court’s opinion in its entirety, it becomes clear' that, rather than making factual determinations regarding the Pennsylvania State Police’s use of the database, the Commonwealth Court was merely interpreting the Firearms Act by considering the effect of another statute, to wit 18 Pa.C.S. § 6111.1(b)(4), on the statute at issue.</p>

In noting the purpose of the database of handgun <em>sales—i.e. </em>to, at least in part, comply with Section 6111.4 of the Firearms Act—and the legislative history behind the Firearms Act, the Commonwealth Court was merely interpreting the statutory provisions before them by utilizing settled rules of statutory construction.
