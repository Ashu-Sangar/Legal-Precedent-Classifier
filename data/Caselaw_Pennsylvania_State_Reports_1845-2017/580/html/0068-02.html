We agree with that conclusion. Appellant failed to develop a record supporting his assertions as to the existence of taint that prompted this court in this first place to order the remand for a new competency hearing.

The trial court admitted the expert testimony in order to develop a full record for this court’s consideration of all the claims. Dr. Arnold T. Shienvold, Ph.D., BCFE, testified as an expert witness for Appellant.

(H.T.l pp. 62-87). As a licensed psychologist, he informed the court of the various studies regarding the susceptibility of children to suggestion <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>and how that susceptibility can lead the child to believe fictional events occurred simply through the implanting of false memories by repetitive interviews.

Dr. Shienvold offered his opinion, after reading the prior trial testimony of A.D. and L.D., the official reports of the interviews of the children, and observing the children testify at the evidentiary hearing, that there was taint present in the trial testimony of A.D. and L.D. and that their testimonial competency was affected by taint.

It was his belief that the majority view found human memory to be accurate while the minority view subscribed to the 'belief that human memory is inaccurate. Dr. Brown offered that even within the minority view, many psychologists believed that inaccuracies in recalling events faded over time, and the accurate memories remained. In Dr. Brown’s view, only the exposure to false and misleading information supplied to the witness by suggestive interview techniques could create a potential for taint. In his review of the same reports and testimony relied upon by Dr. Shienvold, he found no evidence of taint that would impact the competency of A.D. and L.D. (H.T.2 p. 115).</p>

C.S.A. § 5985.1.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Because this issue required a resolution of the allegation of taint, we had withheld disposition of this evidentiary claim of error. Appellant challenged the trial court’s determination of admissibility, asserting that should he prove that the children’s testimony was tainted, their statements admitted under the hearsay exception would be rendered inadmissible for failing to meet the requirements for trustworthiness established in <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em><a href="/us/497/0805-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="497 U.S. 805" data-case-ids="6219632" data-case-paths="/us/497/0805-01">497 U.S. 805</a>, <a href="/us/497/0805-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="497 U.S. 805" data-case-ids="6219632" data-case-paths="/us/497/0805-01">110 S.Ct. 3139</a>, <a href="/us/497/0805-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="497 U.S. 805" data-case-ids="6219632" data-case-paths="/us/497/0805-01">111 L.Ed.2d 638</a> (1990). Appellant focused on the improper manner in which the children were interrogated about the abuse and the possibility that the memories of the children were distorted by the overlay of false memories. Having concluded that there is no evidence of taint, we have no reason for further inquiry as to the impact of taint on the reliability of the hearsay statements admitted at the trial.</p>

Our conclusion that Appellant had presented <em>some evidence </em>sufficient to warrant exploration of taint was based on the fact of the children's age (they were ages six and three at the time of the assaults), and Appellant’s assertions that, if he had been given the opportunity, he could establish that the children were subjected to extensive, repetitive interviews conducted by various authority figures, present evidence of possible vilification of Appellant by persons conducting the interviews, and demonstrate that the children were subject to abnormal influence by their mother because the mother suffered from paranoia over her own sexual victimization as a child, and because the assaults occurred during a period of marital discord between Appellant and the mother. <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>
