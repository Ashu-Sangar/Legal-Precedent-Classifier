We note that in his caption to his Petition for Allowance of Appeal ("PAA”) to this Court, John Warehime indicated that both he and the “Independent Directors Committee” were petitioners. After grant of allocatur in this matter, the caption read that this was an appeal of "John A. Warehime and Independent Directors Committee". Such a caption is incorrect. Our review of the extensive docket in this matter reveals that the Independent Directors Committee was not named as a defendant in Michael Warehime’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Nor can we find any evidence that the Independent Directors Committee was ever joined as a third party defendant or that it filed a request for and was granted leave to intervene. Accordingly, since the Independent Directors Committee is not a party to this action, it will not be included in the caption as an appellant.</p>

In brief, Alan Warehime (“Alan”) was the chairman and chief executive officer (“CEO”) of HFC from 1956 to 1989. Alan was the father of three children: John Warehime (“John”), Michael Warehime (“Michael”), and Sally Warehime (“Sally”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">3</a> In 1988, Alan created two voting trusts, one with his children and the other with his five grandchildren. Alan was designated as the sole voting trustee for both trusts. By their terms, both trusts were due to expire in 1998, ten years after their creation.</p>

John gained further control over HFC when, upon Alan’s death in 1990, he became the voting trustee of both trusts and <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>acquired control over the majority of the voting shares of the corporation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[169,430,1153,517]]]'>Following John becoming the voting trustee of the voting trusts, several other family members expressed unhappiness over the way John was running HFC; boardroom disagreements escalated. In 1994, John eliminated cumulative voting rights, thus effectively preventing anyone other than himself from electing any members of the board. Promptly after the elimination of cumulative voting rights, John removed Michael, Sally, and an independent director from the Board; he replaced them with three hand-picked directors of his own choosing.</p>
    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[169,970,1152,360]]]'>The removal of Michael and Sally did not, however, end the internecine disputes. Various actions were filed against John and HFC by Michael, Sally, and other shareholders. Michael and Sally also made it known that they were interested in removing John as the chairman of the board of HFC as soon as John lost control of the majority of HFC’s voting stock upon the expiration of the voting trusts in 1998.</p>

The Plan proposed issuing 10,000 shares of Class C stock to HFC’s 401k plan. These Class C shares would normally be nonvoting. Yet, in the event that there was disagreement among members of the Warehime family regarding election of members of the Board or other related matters, a complex change in the voting power of each class of shares would take place. If such a dispute were to occur within five years of the creation of the Class C stock, the Class C shares would be entitled to 35 votes a piece. Critically, these Class C shares were to be voted by three of HFC’s directors, individuals whom John had appoint<a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>ed to the Board. The Class A stock, which is normally nonvoting, would in the event of a dispute be entitled to l/10th of a vote a piece. The Class B stock would retain its same voting power of one vote per share.</p>
    <p id="b334-5" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[292,526,1156,624]]]'>The net effect of this Plan was that in the event of a dispute among Warehime family members, a majority of the Class B shareholders would not be able to determine the outcome of a vote for a period of five years after the Plan was created. Rather, John, John’s children, and John’s hand picked directors would be in control of 50.06% of the vote. Accordingly, the Plan created just enough votes to ensure that John, John’s children, and the directors hand-picked by John would retain control over the corporation for years after the voting trusts expired. On February 13, 1997, notice was sent to HFC shareholders, informing them that there would be a vote on the Plan on February 24, 1997.</p>

Michael requested that the trial court enjoin the convening of the February 24, 1997 shareholder meeting or, in the alternative, enjoin John from voting the voting trust shares in favor of the Plan.</p>
    <p id="b334-7" data-blocks='[["BL_334.6",334,[284,1558,1158,777]]]'>The trial court held a hearing. Following the hearing, the trial court denied Michael’s request for preliminary injunctive relief. As the cornerstone for its opinion, the trial court stated that the impending expiration of the voting trusts introduced what the court deemed to be “instability” into HFC. Tr. ct. slip op., dated 6/24/1997, at 4. In the trial court’s view, this “instability” was due to the fact that upon the expiration of the voting trusts, John would no longer have control over the corporation and that other shareholders could band together and vote to remove John and all of John’s handpicked members of the Board and replace them with a yet undetermined management. <em>Id. </em>The trial court found that this anticipated instability interfered with HFC’s ability to raise equity capital and threatened HFC’s corporate good health. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9.</p>

      <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>The trial court opined that the Plan prevented such instability and thus was a positive good. Furthermore, it determined that the Plan did not present a conflict of interest between John’s private interests and his duties as voting trustee. <em>Id. </em>at 34. Rather, the Plan reflected a good faith effort to serve the best interests of HFC since it assured stability in the governance structure of HFC for a five-year period. <em>See id. </em>at 41-42. Accordingly, on June 24, 1997, the request for a preliminary injunction was denied. The following day, John convened a meeting and voted all of his shares as well as all of the trust shares in favor of the Plan, and the Plan was therefore adopted.</p>

At the close of his brief, Michael requests that we provide “plain and meaningful” relief and bring to an end not only the litigation in the matter <em>sub judice, </em>but in all matters relating to the recent troubles at HFC. He claims that the type of relief he desires was granted by the Court of Common Pleas of York County in a matter captioned <em>Warehime v. Schaier, </em>No. 99-SU-03860-07 on October 10, 2000. Michael notes that the trial court’s order in <em>Warehime. v. Schaier </em>was stayed by this court on October 11, 2000 and that the stay remains in effect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">8</a> He now requests that we “approve” of the relief that the <em>Warehime v. Schaier </em>trial court granted.</p>

Since the Superior Court neither set forth nor applied the preliminary injunction standard, we could simply reverse at this juncture and remand for the Superior Court to apply the proper standard. In the interests of judicial economy, we choose not to follow this course. Litigation in this preliminary injunction matter commenced more than seven years ago. A remand would further protract this process. Furthermore, as the question of the application of the proper standard of review is purely a question of law, it is one which we are quite capable of resolving in the first instance.</p>
