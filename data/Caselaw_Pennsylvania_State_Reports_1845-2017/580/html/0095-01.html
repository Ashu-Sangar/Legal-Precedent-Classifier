The men blocked the girls’ path and Dennis demanded that Williams give him her earrings. The girls turned and ran. Dennis followed Williams and grabbed her in the street.

In <em>Tilley, </em>however, we determined that because <em>Powers </em>was not decided until 1991, after Tilley’s trial, and because he failed to challenge “the Commonwealth’s use of peremptory challenges at trial and again on appeal[,]” he was not entitled to retroactive application of <em>Powers.

The current jurisdictional problem is that the Commonwealth originally filed a request for certification, but the PCRA court never ruled on that request because it vacated the Discovery Order and granted reconsideration. The court later reinstated the Discovery Order, but the Commonwealth never took any action to reintroduce or reinstate its request for certification.

Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1311(b) provides that where the trial court fails to act on a Petition for Permission to Appeal within thirty days of it being filed, it shall be deemed denied. Because the Commonwealth effectively filed a Petition for Permission to Appeal on June 28, 2001, and because the PCRA court did not grant or deny that Petition by July 28, 2001, the Commonwealth submits that it was deemed denied, allowing the Commonwealth to file a Petition for Review in this Court.

It is important to note, as well, that the Commonwealth was the party seeking reconsideration in the PCRA court, so the decision of the PCRA court to grant reconsideration inured to its requested benefit. The Commonwealth has provided no authority to support its position that reinstatement of the Discovery Order somehow reinstated the Petition for Permission to Appeal.
