I respectfully differ with the majority's approach to the penalty-phase claims in two respects. First, the majority expresses some reservation concerning whether the evidence of a traumatic, abused childhood would be perceived as a mitigating circumstance. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 295-98, 860 A.2d at 98-99. I would note, however, that given the requirement of unanimity attached to the imposition of the death penalty, it will require that only a single juror give weight to such life-history mitigation to render it a potentially dispositive factor in a capital sentencing determination. Additionally, the United States Supreme Court has fairly consistently recognized a likelihood that life-history mitigation on the order of that which was withheld from the jurors in this case by virtue of trial counsel's dereliction will carry substantial weight. <em>See, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, </em><a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">539 U.S. 510</a>, 534-35, <a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">123 S.Ct. 2527</a>, 2542, <a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">156 L.Ed.2d 471</a> (2003) ("The [life-history] <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>mitigating evidence counsel failed to discover and present in this case is powerful.”). Accordingly, while I do not discount the possibility that there may be a strategic reason in some cases not to present such information to a sentencing jury, I do not view the reason that the majority hypothesizes <em>(i.e., </em>that some potential juror might not see this type of evidence as mitigating) as a sufficient one.</p>
      <p id="AIs" data-blocks='[["BL_429.2",429,[202,1445,1120,903]]]'>Second, I disagree with the majority’s characterization of this Court's recent decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/577/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="577 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="91719" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0473-01">577 Pa. 473</a>, <a href="/pa/577/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="846 A.2d 105" data-case-ids="91641,91719,9252174,9252208" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0472-01,/pa/577/0473-01,/a2d/846/0105-01,/a2d/846/0105-02">846 A.2d 105</a> (2004). <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 300 n. 8, 860 A.2d at 100 n. 8 (summarizing <em>Williams </em>along the lines of "no relief due, where PCRA court did not find witnesses credible concerning appellant’s claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to investigate, develop, and present significant mitigating evidence”). In my view, the <em>Williams </em>court's holding is a good deal more complex, since the court was confronted with a PCRA court’s failure to expressly consider the potential impact of life-history mitigation that the defendant’s trial counsel had failed to develop at the penalty phase of trial pursuant to the appropriate provision of the death-penalty statute. <em>See Williams, </em><a href="/pa/577/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="577 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="91719" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0473-01">577 Pa. at 485-86</a>, <a href="/pa/577/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="846 A.2d 105" data-case-ids="91641,91719,9252174,9252208" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0472-01,/pa/577/0473-01,/a2d/846/0105-01,/a2d/846/0105-02">846 A.2d at 113</a> (“It is unclear whether the [PCRA] court specifically considered the (e)(8) mitigator.”). In light of this deficiency, the <em>Williams </em>majority undertook to perform the necessary analysis on its own. <em>See id. </em>at 486-89, <a href="/pa/577/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="846 A.2d 105" data-case-ids="91641,91719,9252174,9252208" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0472-01,/pa/577/0473-01,/a2d/846/0105-01,/a2d/846/0105-02">846 A.2d at 114-15</a>. Moreover, this Court separately recognized (despite contrary suggestions by the PCRA court) that the life-history evidence was, in fact, substantially mitigating. <em>See id. </em>at 485-86, <a href="/pa/577/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="846 A.2d 105" data-case-ids="91641,91719,9252174,9252208" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0472-01,/pa/577/0473-01,/a2d/846/0105-01,/a2d/846/0105-02">846 A.2d at 113</a>. The relevant facet of the <em>Williams </em>decision, therefore, does not represent a straightforward application of general principles of deference applied by appellate courts to fact-finding determinations made by courts of original jurisdiction, as the present majority suggests.</p>

The majority approves the PCRA court's summary dismissal of this claim, stating that the evidence does not tend to prove Moore's innocence of first-degree murder, but "only attempts to smear the Commonwealth's case.” Majority Opinion at 290, 860 A.2d at 95. In the context of the underlying facts of this case, however, any doubt that Moore personally shot the victim could undermine the position that he harbored a specific intent to kill.</p>
