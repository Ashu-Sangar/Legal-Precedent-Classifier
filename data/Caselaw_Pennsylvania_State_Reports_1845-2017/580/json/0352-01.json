Whether the Superior Court departed from its own precedent in Brown v. Candelora, 708 A.2d 104 (Pa.Super.1998), by concluding that the amount of restitution was subject to garnishment when it failed to consider the fair rental value of the judgment debtor\u2019s decade-long possession of a valuable commercial property?\nWe also request the parties to brief the following issue:\nWhether Pennsylvania should permit a breaching party to bring a restitution claim pursuant to section 374 of the Second Restatement of Contracts?",
