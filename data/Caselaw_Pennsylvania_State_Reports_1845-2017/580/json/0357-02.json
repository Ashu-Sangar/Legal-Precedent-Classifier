The order of the Commonwealth Court is REVERSED. See Coretsky v. Board of Commissioners of Butler Township, 520 Pa. 513, 555 A.2d 72, 74 (1989) (when Board fails to cite to statute or ordinance to explain why application was denied, the application is deemed approved as filed), and 53 P.S. \u00a7 10508(3) (same).

See 53 P.S. \u00a7 10508. As the Commonwealth Court dissent observed, however, the stipulation upon which the Plumstead Township Board of Supervisors relied in the present matter is not material to Petitioner\u2019s application for a lot line change and, thus, cannot serve a basis for denying that application pursuant to Section 508.",
