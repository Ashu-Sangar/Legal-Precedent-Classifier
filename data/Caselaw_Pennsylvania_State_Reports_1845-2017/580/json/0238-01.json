        "text": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThe Department of Transportation appeals from the reversal of Angela Lynn Rossi\u2019s driver\u2019s license suspension. Rossi\u2019s license was suspended pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(c)(1), based on a finding she drove while her operating privileges were suspended for a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(a).\nRossi\u2019s driving privileges were suspended for 15 days, effective August 31, 1999, for a March 11, 1999 speeding violation. An additional 15-day suspension, effective September 15,1999, was added for a June 22, 1999 stop sign violation. On November 18, 1999, she was stopped and charged with violating \u00a7 1543(a) for driving while her operating privileges were suspended or revoked. On February 16, 2000, a district justice convicted her of violating \u00a7 1543(a). Following her conviction, the Bureau notified Rossi her driving privilege would be suspended for one year pursuant to \u00a7 1543(c)(1).\nRossi appealed her \u00a7 1543(a) conviction and subsequent license suspension under \u00a7 1543(c)(1) to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1550(a). At the hearing, Rossi testified she surrendered her license prior to August 31, 1999, and did not operate a vehicle from August 31, 1999, through September 30, 1999. She believed her operating privileges were automatically restored following the expiration of the 30-day period of suspension. The Bureau asserted Rossi\u2019s privileges were still suspended on November 18, 1999, because she had not complied with its administrative process and paid a $ 25 restoration fee. The trial court reversed Rossi\u2019s summary conviction for \u00a7 1543(a), reasoning that \u00a7 1543(c) applies only to violations which occur when a motorist\u2019s license is within the original term of suspension. Since Rossi was cited after the term of suspension ended, the court determined she was not subject to \u00a7 1543(c)(1), despite her failure to restore her license.\nOn appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed, holding the 1994 amendment to \u00a7 1543(c)(1) by the General Assembly accomplished nothing to alter the law as set forth in Caruso v. PennDOT, 125 Pa.Cmwlth. 54, 557 A.2d 54 (1989), and PennDOT v. Manuel, 119 Pa.Cmwlth. 264, 546 A.2d 1336 (1988). Both interpreted \u00a7 1543(c)(1) prior to its 1994 amendment, and held that suspension or revocation must end on the date stated without further action from the individual under suspension. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court determined Rossi could not be penalized under \u00a7 1543(c)(1) because her operating privileges were restored by operation of law when her suspension ended September 30,1999.\nPrior to 1994, \u00a7 1543(c) read:\n1543. Driving while operating privilege is suspended or revoked\n* * *\n(c) Suspension or revocation of operating privilege.\u2014Upon receiving a certified record of the conviction of any person under this section, the department shall suspend or revoke that person\u2019s operating privilege as follows:\n(1) If the department\u2019s records show that the person was under suspension, recall or cancellation on the date of violation, the department shall suspend the person\u2019s operating privilege for an additional one-year period.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(c)(1) (1987). The amendment added the phrase \u201cand had not been restored,\u201d such that \u00a7 1543(c)(1) now provides, \u201c[i]f the department\u2019s records show that the person was under suspension, recall or cancellation on the date of violation, and had not been restored, the department shall suspend the person\u2019s operating privilege for an additional one-year period.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(c)(1)(emphasis added).\nThe Commonwealth Court recognized \u00a7 1543\u2019s amended language, but refused to give it effect: \u201c[w]e do not know why this phrase was inserted into the statute but it was not put there to change the effect of anything we said in Manuel or Caruso.\u201d Rossi v. PennDOT, 798 A.2d 801, 802 (Pa. Cmwlth.2002). We cannot agree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s analysis.\nOne must first look to what the legislature actually said before evaluating what it meant to say; only if the former is unclear does the latter become relevant. However, the post-amendment language here is not so clear as to avoid the need for clarification. First, there is the basic grammar of the amendment which, as phrased, modifies \u201cperson,\u201d not privilege. However, the prior language also referenced the person, not privilege, and no one can seriously contend the section refers to suspension of the person him or her self, rather than suspension of the person\u2019s operating privileges.\nThe placement of the phrase is also problematic, for it comes after the requirement of suspension on the date of violation, and begins with \u201cand\u201d rather than \u201cor\u201d; one could easily read it as creating an additional element of the offense. That is, it may be read to mean the Department must still show a suspension on the date of violation, and also show that the person (privilege) had not been restored. However, read this way, the amendment is surplusage; obviously, if the privileges were suspended on the date of violation, by definition the privileges could not have been restored.\nThe interpretation of the amendment as mere surplusage is counter to the very basic proposition that the legislature did not add it to perform a meaningless act. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1). While it would have been better to place the amendment before the words \u201cdate of violation\u201d rather than after, this is not fatal to understanding the amendment\u2019s purpose. Clearly the amendment recognizes the need to take affirmative steps pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1960 and 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1783 to restore one\u2019s operating privileges, and states that the failure to do so makes the operator subject to the penalties of \u00a7 1543(c). The Commonwealth Court\u2019s suggestion that the amendment\u2019s purpose, purportedly unknown but specifically not meant to address its case law on restoration, is in error. Indeed, we must conclude it could have been for no other purpose.\nIt is well settled that a court analyzing a statute must presume the General Assembly did not intend to perform a useless act. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1); St. Joseph Lead Co. v. Potter Township, 398 Pa. 361, 157 A.2d 638, 642 (1959). Furthermore, \u00a7 1922(2) of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(2), states the General Assembly intends the entire statute to be certain and effective. Therefore, individual statutory provisions must be construed with reference to the entire statute of which they are a part, and the entire statute is presumed to be certain and effective, not superfluous and without import. Ieropoli v. AC & S Corp., 577 Pa. 138, 842 A.2d 919, 929 (2004); Commonwealth v. Gilmour Manufacturing Co., 573 Pa. 143, 822 A.2d 676, 679 (2003).\nThe legislature has mandated that certain administrative requirements be satisfied before an individual\u2019s driving privileges can be restored. Specifically, \u00a7 1960 of the Vehicle Code provides:\nThe department shall charge a fee of $ 25 or, if section 1786(d) (relating to required financial responsibility) applies, a fee of $ 50 to restore a person\u2019s operating privilege or the registration of a vehicle following a suspension or revocation.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1960 (emphasis added). In some instances, a driver seeking restoration must provide the Bureau with proof of current financial responsibility pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1783:\nWhenever the department suspends or revokes the operating privilege of any person or the registration of any vehicle pursuant to section 1532 (relating to revocation or suspension of operating privilege), 1542 (relating to revocation of habitual offender\u2019s license), 1772 (relating to suspension for nonpayment of judgments), 1784 (relating to proof of financial responsibility following violation) or 1785 (relating to proof of financial responsibility following accident), or upon receiving the record of a conviction or forfeiture of bail, the department shall not restore the operating privilege or the applicable registration until the person furnishes proof of financial responsibility.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1783 (emphasis added).\nIf a driver\u2019s operating privileges are restored automatically by operation of law once the time-certain suspension period passes, then administrative restoration provisions such as \u00a7 1960 and \u00a7 1783 are rendered meaningless. Adding language that adds only lip service to a meaningless restoration procedure could not have been the General Assembly\u2019s intent. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a); Berger v. Rinaldi, 438 Pa.Super. 78, 651 A.2d 553, 557 (1994) (legislature is presumed not to have intended its statutes to contain mere surplusage).\nTherefore, we hold the Commonwealth Court erred in adhering to the pre-amendment decisions in Manuel and Caruso. In light of the language added, \u00a7 1543(c)(1) requires an individual to complete the proper administrative steps after a statutory suspension has ended before being entitled to drive without restriction. Since Rossi failed to take these administrative steps to allow PennDOT to restore her driving privileges, it was proper for the Bureau to impose an additional one-year suspension for her violation of \u00a7 1543(c)(1).\nOrder reversed; jurisdiction relinquished.\nFormer Justice LAMB did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. Section 1543(a) states:\n1543. Driving while operating privilege is suspended or revoked (a) Offense defined.\u2014Except as provided in subsection (b), any person who drives a motor vehicle on any highway or trafficway of this Commonwealth after the commencement of a suspension, revocation or cancellation of the operating privilege and before the operating privilege has been restored is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $ 200.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(a).",
