        "text": "OPINION\nChief Justice CAPPY.\nIn this case, Kim Heath (\u201cClaimant\u201d) filed a claim petition under Pennsylvania\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 77 P.S. \u00a7 1 et seq., alleging that she sustained a work-related psychic injury that was caused by sexual harassment by a supervisor and acts of retaliation by her employer. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court viewed the \u201cpersonal animus\u201d exception in Section 301(c) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1), as an issue of subject matter jurisdiction, raised the exception sua sponte, and applied it to the facts. We conclude that in doing so, the Commonwealth Court erred. Accordingly, we vacate the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order and remand this case to the Commonwealth Court to reconsider the merits of Claimant\u2019s appeal from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board\u2019s (\u201cBoard\u201d) decision.\n. In 1996, Claimant began her employment with the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (\u201cEmployer\u201d) as a parole agent at the Graterford Prison. At that time, James Newton (\u201cNewton\u201d) also was employed by Employer, as a Regional Institutional Parole Manager. Beginning in October of 1997, while at work, Newton repeatedly requested to see Claimant socially and engaged her in unwelcome interactions. When Claimant rejected Newton\u2019s advances, he gave her additional work. In February of 1998, Claimant informed her supervisor of Newton\u2019s conduct and filed a grievance with her union. Newton\u2019s conduct toward Claimant, however, continued. Claimant filed a complaint of sexual harassment against Newton with Employer\u2019s Affirmative Action Officer on March 4, 1998, and an investigation took place. Shortly thereafter, Claimant\u2019s relationships with other parole agents became problematic. On April 1, 1998, Claimant was instructed to report to work at Employer\u2019s office located in South Philadelphia. Claimant did as she was instructed, but was given no desk or assignments. Claimant began to manifest symptoms of anxiety and consulted with a psychologist. The psychologist diagnosed Claimant as suffering from an acute stress disorder and advised her to stop work. Claimant remained out of work while Employer searched for an alternative position for her.\nOn June 24, 1998, Claimant filed a claim petition under the Act, alleging that as of May 1, 1998, while in the course of her employment, she sustained a disabling psychic injury in the form of stress anxiety, which was caused by Newton\u2019s sexual harassment and Employer\u2019s retaliation. Employer filed an answer, denying Claimant\u2019s allegations.\nIn November of 1998, Employer informed Claimant that a position at its Chester , facility was available and asked her to sign a release of all claims. As Claimant would not agree to the release, the position was not given to her. In January of 1999, Employer advised Claimant that she risked termination, if she did not return to work. Claimant reported to work, but again, was provided with no desk or assignments. Claimant began to feel more depressed and anxious. On February 5, 1999, Claimant\u2019s treating psychologist informed Employer that Claimant could not work due to her medical condition. On March 3, 1999, Employer advised Claimant that she had to return to work or apply for disability retirement or tender her resignation. Claimant rejected all three options. On April 16, 1999, Employer terminated Claimant\u2019s employment.\nFollowing several hearings, on March 6, 2001, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge (\u201cWCJ\u201d) granted Claimant\u2019s claim petition, determining that Claimant satisfied her burden of proving that she was disabled by a work-related psychic illness that arose out of the abnormal working conditions that were created by Newton\u2019s conduct toward her and by the actions Employer took after she lodged complaints about his behavior.\nEmployer appealed to the Board, challenging the WCJ\u2019s findings of fact, legal conclusions, and an evidentiary ruling; objecting to the competency of Claimant\u2019s experts; asserting that Claimant failed to prove the existence of abnormal working conditions or to provide objective, corroborating evidence of her descriptions of the workplace; questioning the WCJ\u2019s authority to find sexual harassment; and raising the doctrine of collateral estoppel. In a decision and order dated February 25, 2002, the Board reversed the WCJ\u2019s order granting Claimant\u2019s claim petition. Applying the principle that the recovery of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for a psychic injury depends on the presence of objective evidence that such an injury is other than a subjective reaction to normal working conditions, see Davis v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Swarthmore Borough), 561 Pa. 462, 751 A.2d 168, 174 (2000), the Board concluded that Claimant\u2019s testimony that her interactions with Newton were out of the ordinary and constituted incidents of harassment was uncorroborated and that the conditions of employment in which Claimant found herself after she complained about Newton were not abnormal.\nClaimant filed an appeal in the Commonwealth Court. In a published opinion, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board\u2019s order. Heath v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole), 811 A.2d 90 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002). Following a recitation of the facts, the Commonwealth Court referred to Section 301(c) of the Act and observed that under that portion of the provision that is commonly known as the \u201cpersonal animus\u201d exception, injuries that arise from personal conduct at the workplace are not compensable. Id. at 96. The Commonwealth Court went on to state that even though Employer did not argue the exception, it could be considered. Id. According to the court, because the exception addressed subject matter jurisdiction, it could be raised by the court\u2019s own motion. Id. Further, if applicable, the exception would provide the court with an alternative ground upon which to affirm the Board\u2019s order. Id. The court then stated that even if it accepted Claimant\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment on the part of Newton as true and there was corroborative evidence to support them, it believed, as did the Superior Court in Schweitzer v. Rockwell International, 402 Pa.Super. 34, 586 A.2d 383, 385 (1990), that \u201cwhen a co-employee or third party sexually harasses an employee, any resulting mental injury is not compensable under the Act because Section 301(c)(1) operates to remove any claim for that injury from the purview of the [Act].\u201d Id. at 97. Turning next to Claimant\u2019s allegations regarding the other injury-producing conditions that Employer imposed upon her, the Commonwealth Court agreed with the Board that either the conditions were not abnormal or that Claimant failed to prove that the conditions actually existed. Id. at 97-\nThis court granted review. Heath v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole), 573 Pa. 700, 825 A.2d 1263 (2003). In cases brought under the Act, we must affirm the adjudication below, unless we find that an error of law was committed, that constitutional rights were violated, that a practice or procedure of a Commonwealth agency was not followed or that any necessary finding of fact was not supported by substantial evidence of record. 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704; Volterano v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co.), 536 Pa.335, 639 A.2d 453, 455-56 (1994).\nClaimant raises a threshold issue that we first consider. Claimant contends that the \u201cpersonal animus\u201d exception in Section 301(c) of the Act can play no role in this case. It is Claimant\u2019s position that the exception is not a question of subject matter jurisdiction; that the Commonwealth Court erred by raising it; and that Employer waived it. Employer counters without discussion that the exception plainly implicates the Commonwealth Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 763.\nWe begin with the well-established principle that subject matter jurisdiction is a question that is not waivable and may be raised by a court on its own motion. In re Adoption of N.M.B., 564 Pa. 117, 764 A.2d 1042, 1045 n. 1 (2000). Therefore, we have no quarrel with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s asking sua sponte whether the \u201cpersonal animus\u201d exception implicated its subject matter jurisdiction. Rather, we disagree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the exception is indeed jurisdictional.\nAs we have stated, jurisdiction of the subject matter is conferred by the Commonwealth\u2019s Constitution and laws. Strank v. Mercy Hospital of Johnstown, 376 Pa. 305, 102 A.2d 170, 172 (1954). We have explained that \u201cthe test for determining whether a court has jurisdiction of the subject matter is the competency of the court to determine controversies of the general class to which the case presented for its consideration belongs.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). In other words, we determine whether \u201cthe court had power to enter upon the inquiry, not whether it might ultimately decide that it was unable to grant the relief sought in the particular case.\u201d Id.\nIn Section 301(c), the Act provides definitions, including the definition for an \u201cinjury arising in the course of [an employee\u2019s] employment\u201d for which an employee may be awarded benefits under the Act. 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1). Since Section 301(c)\u2019s enactment, the \u201cpersonal animus\u201d exception has been contained therein, and excepts from that definition \u201can injury caused by an act of a third person intended to injure the employe because of reasons personal to him, and hot directed against him as an employe or because of his employment[.]\u201d See Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, No. 338, art. Ill, \u00a7 301(c).\nIn Keyes v. New York, O. & W. Ry. Co., 265 Pa. 105, 108 A. 406 (1919), where the employer alleged the \u201cpersonal animus\u201d exception in its answer to the claim petition, we determined the exception\u2019s nature. It is an affirmative defense, which the party who is defending against a claim brought under the Act has the burden of proving. We stated:\nThe case turns on the burden of proof as to that fact [whether the injury was caused by an act of a third person intended to injure the employee because of reasons personal to the third party and not directed against him as an employee or because of his employment]; the lower court held it was upon the claimants, while the compensation board held it was upon the defendant. We agree with the latter. The general rule is one of liability for violent injury suffered by an employe in the course of his employment, as this undoubtedly was; the exception is that the employer is not liable for \u201can injury caused by an act of a third person intended to injure the employe because of reasons personal to him.\u201d The burden of proving the exception rests upon the party interposing it as a defense, for as to that issue he holds the affirmative. The burden of proof of a particular allegation rests upon the side to whose case it is necessary, and that is the defendant here.\nId. at 406. (citations omitted). Moreover, we have viewed the exception as a means by which an employer may rebut the presumption that an injury that occurred on his premises is work-related. See Kohler v. McCrory Stores, 532 Pa. 130, 615 A.2d 27, 30 (1992).\nIn light of these principles, we conclude that the \u201cpersonal animus\u201d exception in Section 301(c) of the Act does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction. The instant controversy is clearly one of a general class that a WCJ, the Board, and the Commonwealth Court are empowered to decide. That is, a WCJ and the Board are authorized by the Act to determine whether or not an employee who alleges that he was injured during the course of his employment is entitled to compensation. 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 701, 710. In turn, the Commonwealth Court is authorized to hear an appeal from such a determination. 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704; 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 763(a)(1). Whether the \u201cpersonal animus\u201d exception applies and removes an employee\u2019s alleged injury from Section 301(c)\u2019s definition of a compensable injury under the Act goes only to whether the compensation a claimant seeks will ultimately be granted; it has nothing whatsoever to do with whether a WCJ, the Board, or the Commonwealth Court on appeal is empowered to decide his claim for workers\u2019 compensation. See Strank, 102 A.2d at 172.\nAs the \u201cpersonal animus\u201d exception is not jurisdictional, it is not an issue for a court to raise sua sponte. See id. Rather, as Keyes teaches, the party defending against the claim for workers compensation is to raise the exception. See Keyes, 108 A. at 406. In this case, however, that party, i.e., Employer, did not do so. In Rox Coal Co. v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Snizaski), 570 Pa. 60, 807 A.2d 906 (2002), we held that waiver principles will be applied in a workers\u2019 compensation setting and ruled that another statutory exception to the definition of compensable injury in Section 301(c) was waived by a party\u2019s failure to raise it. Thus, Employer\u2019s failure to raise the \u201cpersonal animus\u201d exception means that the issue was waived. Id. at 911-14. It necessarily follows that the exception should have played no part in the Commonwealth Court\u2019s review in the present case.\nFor these reasons, we vacate the Commonwealth\u2019s Court\u2019s order and remand this case for the court to reconsider the merits of Claimant\u2019s appeal from the Board\u2019s decision. The court is to reconsider whether Claimant proved her claim with regard to Newton\u2019s actions. Likewise, insofar as the Commonwealth Court\u2019s application of the \u201cpersonal animus\u201d exception may have affected its review of the Claimant\u2019s claim that she was entitled to compensation under the Act for certain actions that were taken by Employer after she reported Newton\u2019s conduct, the Court\u2019s is to reconsider that claim.\nFormer Justice LAMB did not participate in the decision of this case.\nThis appeal was reassigned to this author.\n. The relevant statutory language is:\n411. \u201cInjury,\u201d \"personal injury,\u201d and \"injury arising in the course of his employment\u201d defined\n(1) The terms \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d as used in this act, shall be construed to mean an injury to an employe, regardless of his previous physical condition, arising in the course of his employment and related thereto, and such disease or infection as naturally results from the injury or is aggravated, reactivated or accelerated by the injury; .... The term injury arising in the course of his employment, as used in this article, shall not include an injury caused by an act of a third person intended to injure the employe because of reasons personal to him, and not directed against him as an employe or because of his employment^]\n77 P.S. 411(1) (emphasis added).\n. The issue we address in this appeal raises a question of law. Accordingly, our standard of review is de novo, and to the extent necessary, the scope of our review is plenary as this court may j-eview the entire record in making its decision. See Buffalo Township v. Jones, 571 Pa. at 644 n. 4, 813 A.2d 659 (2002).\n. In light of our disposition, we do not address and express no opinion on the meaning or application of the \"personal animus\u201d exception in these circumstances. See Rox Coal, 807 A.2d at 914 (refusing to address the substance of employer\u2019s contention regarding the meaning and application of certain amendments to a Section 301(c) exception inasmuch as the exception was waived).",
