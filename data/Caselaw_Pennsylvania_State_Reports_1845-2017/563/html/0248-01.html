The Commonwealth was represented during the expungement hearing by the Montgomery County district attorney’s office. The resulting order stated:</p>

The court issued a rule directing the District Attorney and the Pennsylvania State Police to show cause why the petition to compel expungement should not be granted.

The Pennsylvania State Police then filed a document titled “Memorandum of Law of the Pennsylvania State Police in Opposition to Petition to Compel Expungement”.</p>

The act states “[njotice of expungement shall promptly be submitted to the central repository which shall notify all criminal justice agencies which have received the criminal history record information to be expunged.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 9122(d). Thus, as the Act does not require notification of the State Police until after an expungement order has been entered, standing does not derive from the statute. Furthermore, since the statute defines and describes expungement, we are not convinced by the State Police’s assertion that compliance with the expungement order would cause it to fail in its statutory mandate to provide complete and accurate records.</p>

As Superior Court noted, “this appeal concerns a proceeding to compel compliance with an expungement order already entered.” 723 A.2d at 220. The court further noted that “[the State Police] is not seeking to enter or litigate the original petition.” <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the court remanded for a determination of the very same subject-matter of the original expungement order, stating: “If [the State Police] proves that [Appellant] is not entitled to expungement under the law, it cannot be forced to expunge that which the law directs it to keep.” <em>Id. </em>at 221. The argument advanced by the State Police before this Court is that Appellant was not eligible for statutory expungement, and therefore the underlying order was illegally entered.
