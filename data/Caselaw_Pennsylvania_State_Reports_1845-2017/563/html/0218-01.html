Amid the traffic at the tollbooth, Agent Ronald Paret of the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General and Officer Kirk Schwartz of the Delaware Water Gap Police Department approached the bus and requested that the driver pull to the side of the road after paying the toll. Both officers were wearing attire indicating that they were law enforcement officials. After paying the toll, the bus driver pulled over.</p>

A review revealed one “quick turn” ticket from Cleveland to New York City and back, which indicated that the purchaser spent only about eight hours in New York. Agent Paret then boarded the bus, accompanied by Officer Schwartz. Officer Schwartz secured the bathroom on the bus, which revealed nothing, while Agent Paret approached Appellee, who had the other half of the quick turn ticket. Agent Paret asked Appellee for identification to which Appellee responded that he had none. Agent Paret then asked Appellee if he had any bags. Appellee stated that he did not.</p>

Traditionally, this Court has recognized three categories of encounters between citizens and the police. These categories include (1) a mere encounter, (2) an investigative detention, and (3) custodial detentions. The first of these, a “mere encounter” (or request for information), which need not be supported by any level of suspicion, but carries no official compulsion to stop or to respond. The second, an “investigative detention” must be supported by reasonable suspicion; it subjects a suspect to a stop and a period of detention, but does not involve such coercive conditions as to constitute the functional equivalent of an arrest. Finally, an arrest or “custodial detention” must be supported by probable cause. <em>Commonwealth v. Mendenhall, </em><a href="/pa/552/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="552 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="559298" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0484-01">552 Pa. 484</a>, <a href="/a2d/715/1117-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="715 A.2d 1117" data-case-ids="11710107,559298" data-case-paths="/a2d/715/1117-01,/pa/552/0484-01">715 A.2d 1117</a> (1998).</p>

In that case, a border patrol agent boarded a bus to check immigration status of passengers. As the agent walked off the bus, he squeezed soft-<a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>sided luggage placed in the overhead storage compartment and detected a brick-like substance. The passenger, at the agent’s request, consented to a search of the bag. The material turned out to be drugs. The issue certified to the United States Supreme Court was whether the agent's tactile manipulation of the passenger’s bag, <em>without consent, </em>was an unreasonable search. The Supreme Court held that it was, rejecting the government's contention that the passenger had lost any expectation of privacy in the bag because it was exposed to the public. Unlike the matter before us now, there was no argument in <em>Bond </em>that the defendant’s consent to the search was a basis for admitting the evidence, and there was no argument that <em>Florida v. Bostick </em>was inapplicable.</p>

First, its initial focus is upon the officers’ subjective purpose for the stop (drug interdiction); whereas, the United States Supreme Court has maintained that such motivations are generally irrelevant to the determination of whether a seizure has occurred. <em>See Ohio v. Robinette, </em><a href="/us/519/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="519 U.S. 33" data-case-ids="11594631" data-case-paths="/us/519/0033-01">519 U.S. 33</a>, 38, <a href="/us/519/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="519 U.S. 33" data-case-ids="11594631" data-case-paths="/us/519/0033-01">117 S.Ct. 417</a>, 420, <a href="/us/519/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="519 U.S. 33" data-case-ids="11594631" data-case-paths="/us/519/0033-01">136 L.Ed.2d 347</a> (1996)(citing <em>Whren v.

Additionally, the majority’s assessment hinges upon the vehicle stop alone, without a totality assessment concerning its impact upon a reasonable passenger’s perceptions. It is unclear, however, whether federal jurisprudence would always foreclose an encounter which entails the stopping of a vehicle on a consensual basis, even where the police have the ability to communicate with the driver to obtain his consent without employing coercive means. <em>See generally Hernandez-Zuniga, </em><a href="/f3d/215/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="215 F.3d 483" data-case-ids="11212680" data-case-paths="/f3d/215/0483-01">215 F.3d at 488-89</a> (holding that a warrantless stop of a bus was reasonable, in light of the bus company's consent to random stops). Indeed, the majority’s approach seems tantamount to application of a <em>per se </em>rule, which has been eschewed by the United States Supreme Court in the Fourth Amendment context. <em>See, e.g., Bostick, </em><a href="/us/501/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="501 U.S. 429" data-case-ids="1108039" data-case-paths="/us/501/0429-01">501 U.S. at 437-38</a>, <a href="/us/501/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="501 U.S. 429" data-case-ids="1108039" data-case-paths="/us/501/0429-01">111 S.Ct. at 2388</a>; <em>see also Robinette, </em><a href="/us/519/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="519 U.S. 33" data-case-ids="11594631" data-case-paths="/us/519/0033-01">519 U.S. at 39</a>, <a href="/us/519/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="519 U.S. 33" data-case-ids="11594631" data-case-paths="/us/519/0033-01">117 S.Ct. at 421</a>.</p>
