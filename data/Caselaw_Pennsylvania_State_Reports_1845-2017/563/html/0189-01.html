According to Judge Avellino, the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. §§ 551-555, “distinguishes between an adjudication and a valid adjudication,” and it is only the latter that a dissatisfied taxpayer must appeal.

The Commonwealth Court also opined that the City was in no position to complain that Taxpayers had been dilatory in filing their appeals, as the City “took no action to correct the tax exemption ordinance until two years after <em>MacDonald, Illig </em>was filed...." This is incorrect. On July 9, 1990, the City amended the pertinent ordinance to provide for a three-year exemption commencing in the tax year immediately following the year in which the initial certificate of occupancy for the property is issued. Phila. Code § 19 — 1303(3)(D)(2)(a) n.138. The revised ordinance was to take effect on January 1, 1992, and to govern applications for exemption filed on or after that date. Thus, the City’s decision to amend the ordinance preceded not only the Commonwealth Court’s February 14, 1992, decision in <em>MacDonald, Illig, </em>but the trial court’s December 4, 1990, decision in that case as well. The reason for the Commonwealth Court’s misstatement of fact is unclear; in its earlier decision quashing the City’s appeal from Judge Avellino's order remanding the cases to the Board, the Commonwealth Court acknowledged that City Council had amended the ordinance in 1990, with such amendment to take effect in 1992. <em>See Nine Penn Center, </em><a href="/a2d/669/1047-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="669 A.2d 1047" data-case-ids="11338625" data-case-paths="/a2d/669/1047-01">669 A.2d at </a>1048 n. 1.</p>
