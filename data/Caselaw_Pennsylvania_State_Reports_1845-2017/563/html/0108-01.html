Appellants also contend that the conference committee, when reconciling differences between the two houses, has historically been restricted to addressing only the differences between the two chambers' versions of the same bill. Appellants argue that this limitation is logically applicable to <em>all </em>action taken after a bill’s passage by both chambers and that any changes made at this point in the process must be "confined to either provisions that were actually in one or the other chambers’ version of the legislation, or a compromise between them— not new material.” Appellants AFL-CIO, et al. Brief at 46-47. Thus, Appellants maintain that the Senate Rules Committee acted unconstitutionally by making changes to S.B. 801 that were outside the scope of the amendments proposed and adopted by the House because no entity, whether a conference committee or a standing committee of a chamber, is constitutionally empowered to add different material to a bill after it has initially been passed by both houses.

    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[217,844,1156,1223]]]'>Appellants alleged in their Petition that during the legislative process, Senate Bill 801 was amended by the Senate Committee on Rules and Executive Nominations, reported to the full Senate, and returned to the full House of Representatives after it had been both passed unanimously by the full Senate and amended and passed unanimously by the full House. Appellants claimed in Count I that this process was unconstitutional because Article III, Section 5 of the Constitution prohibits the originating chamber of a bill from amending it after it has been amended by the other chamber, and requires instead, a straight “up-or-down vote” on the other chamber’s amendments or an action by conference committee for reconciling differences between the two passed versions of the bill. The Commonwealth Court held to the contrary and granted appellees’ preliminary objections to Count I, finding that Article III, Section 5 does not prohibit the originating chamber from amending its own bill once it has been amended by the other chamber and returned. <em>Pennsylvania AFL-CIO v.

In its analysis, the court observed that no Pennsylvania court has interpreted Article III, Section 5, and recognized that the language in this particular constitutional provision is susceptible to more than one interpretation. <em><a href="/a2d/691/1023-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="691 A.2d 1023" data-case-ids="11916572" data-case-paths="/a2d/691/1023-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/691/1023-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="691 A.2d 1023" data-case-ids="11916572" data-case-paths="/a2d/691/1023-01">at 1038</a>.</p>

Majority Opinion at 920-21, 924.

    <p id="b322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_322.4",322,[221,584,1156,1000]]]'>I believe that the majority misapplies the standard to be used in deciding preliminary objections. The standard is not, as the majority suggests, whether the law under consideration is clear and free from doubt; it is whether it is clear and free from doubt that the well-pleaded facts fail to establish that the pleader has a right to the legal relief he seeks. We clarified this very point in <em>Firing v. Kephart, </em>in which the plaintiff, a justice of the peace who was mandatorily retired, filed a complaint against Commonwealth officials, alleging that under Article V, Section 16(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution, he was entitled to a continuation of his pay. Defendants filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, which the Commonwealth Court sustained. On appeal, plaintiff argued that inasmuch as the Constitution itself is not completely clear and free from doubt on the issue, the preliminary objections should not have been granted. Concluding that plaintiffs argument “misconceiv[ed] the function of preliminary objections in our jurisprudence”, <a href="/pa/466/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="466 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="1714961" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0560-01">353 A.2d at 834</a>, this court affirmed the Commonwealth Court and stated:</p>

The role of the court in ruling on preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer is to determine whether or not the facts pleaded are legally sufficient to permit the action to continue. This is so whether the legal determination to be made is relatively simple or relatively difficult.... There was no factual dispute in this case, only a dispute over the interpretation of the Constitution,, and the ruling on appellees’ preliminary objections was clearly the appropriate juncture for the <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>Commonwealth Court to interpret the pertinent provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution and determine the merits of appellant’s claim. Our task on appeal is to determine whether the court’s interpretation was correct.</blockquote>

    <p id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.6",323,[217,572,1153,527]]]'>Likewise, in this case, the fact that the proper interpretation of Article III, Section 5 is less than straightforward does not mean that appellees’ preliminary objections should not have been granted. Appellees met their burden, showing that the facts alleged in the Petition do not state a cause of action under Article III, Section 5 for which relief may be granted. In my view, therefore, the Commonwealth Court was correct to grant the preliminary objections, and I would affirm the court’s decision in this regard. Accordingly, as to appellants’ Article III, Section 5 claim, I concur only in the result.</p>
