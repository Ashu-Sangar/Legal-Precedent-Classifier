First, we consider whether to adopt a “mature minor doctrine” which would be an affirmative defense to the parental duty to provide care to a minor. Secondly, we consider whether Shannon Nixon had a right to refuse medical care pursuant to her privacy rights under the constitutions of the United States and this Commonwealth. For the reasons that follow, we choose not to adopt a “mature minor doctrine” as a criminal defense and further, we find that Shannon Nixon’s constitutional right to privacy did not relieve her parents from fulfilling their statutory obligations. Therefore, we affirm the order of the Superior Court, which, in turn, affirmed the order and judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County.</p>

Dennis and Lorie Nixon, Appellants, were the parents of the victim, Shannon Nixon. Shannon Nixon was sixteen years old at the time of her death. In mid-June 1997, it became obvious to Appellants that Shannon was not feeling well. Appellants began to pray for their daughter’s health. They also took her to their place of worship where Shannon was “anointed”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Shannon initially <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>reported feeling somewhat better, but then her condition deteriorated. She became increasingly weak and fell into a coma. After a few hours in a comatose state, Shannon Nixon died. An autopsy determined that Shannon died from diabetes acidosis, which was a treatable, though not curable, condition.</p>

This duty to care for those who are legally incapacitated arose under the sovereign’s duty of <em>parens patriae, </em>and following independence was assumed by the individual states. <em>See Commonwealth v. Baldwin, </em><a href="/citations/?q=54%20Watts%201" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="54 Watts 1">54 Watts 1</a> (Pa.1832).

As the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[258,527,1115,1053]]]'>It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder. And it is in recognition of this that these decisions have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter. But the family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest, as against a claim or religious liberty. And neither rights of religion nor rights of parenthood are beyond limitation. Acting to guard the general interest in youth’s well being, the state as parens patriae may restrict the parent’s control by requiring school attendance, regulating or prohibiting the child’s labor, and in many other ways. Its authority is not nullified merely because the parent grounds his claim to control the child’s course of conduct on religion or conscience. Thus, he cannot claim freedom from compulsory vaccination for the child more than for himself on religious grounds. The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter ill health or death.</blockquote>

Indeed, the same statutes that inform the majority’s rejection of the doctrine lead me to the opposite result. I agree with the legislature’s willingness to make appropriate exceptions to the rule of minor incapacity in the first place and with the policies reflected in the exceptions the legislature has seen fit to enact. By their terms, the exceptions fall into two broad categories: those that are premised on a specific medical condition that ought to be treated and those that focus on a minor’s status. With regard to the latter, the legislature has decided, for example, that turning eighteen, marrying, becoming a parent or graduating from high school are indicative of one’s readiness to make health care decisions on one’s own. 35 P.S. § 10101.</p>

If this had been the case, then the better course of action would have been the dismissal of this appeal as improvidently granted, rather than the issuance of an opinion containing dicta.

Because I conclude that the mature minor doctrine does not apply in this case as a matter of fact, I decline to address appellants’ contention that the doctrine provides them with an "affirmative defense” to the charges the Commonwealth brought against them. Because I would find that under the common law, a mature minor may consent to or refuse medical treatment, I would not reach, and I express no opinion on, the privacy issue appellants raise under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. <em>P.J.S. v.
