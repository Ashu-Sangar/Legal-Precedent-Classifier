This is a direct appeal of this verdict. As explained below, this was a second trial for Sattazahn regarding the murder of Boyer. The initial trial resulted in a conviction for first-degree murder and the imposition of a life sentence, which the Superior Court reversed on appeal, ordering a new trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm both the verdict of guilt, and the sentence of death on retrial.</p>

At closing, Sattazahn and <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>Hammer confronted Boyer in the parking lot. Hammer carried a .41 caliber revolver and Sattazahn had a .22 caliber Ruger semiautomatic pistol. With these guns drawn, the pair attempted to rob Boyer of the bank deposit bag with the day’s receipts, but Boyer threw the bag toward the restaurant and then again toward the roof of the restaurant. While Sattazahn told Boyer to get the bag, Boyer did not comply and began to run away. Both Sattazahn and Hammer fired shots and Boyer fell to the ground.

Sattazahn presented as mitigating circumstances his lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and his age at the time of the crime. The jury deliberated without reaching a decision on death or life and without making any findings regarding aggravating or mitigating factors. After three and one-half hours, the judge dismissed the jury as hung, and entered a mandatory life sentence.

Hammer’s testimony was confirmed by an autopsy that revealed that Boyer suffered two gunshot wounds in the lower back and one each in the left shoulder, the lower face and the back of the head. All wounds were consistent with being caused by a .22 caliber bullet, the caliber gun that Hammer attributed to Sattazahn, and which a gun shop owner testified that Sattazahn purchased. Moreover, the .22 and the two slugs recovered from Boyer’s body, and the five cartridges found at the scene, were identified as being fired from Sattazahn’s gun.</p>

Through counsel’s cross-examination of Hammer, the jury heard that Hammer was allowed to plead to third-degree murder in exchange for his testimony against Sattazahn, even though the Commonwealth was at the time seeking the death penalty against Hammer for the murder of Boyer. (N.T. at 331). Thus, Hammer was able to avoid the imposition of the death penalty for his part in the murder because he had agreed to testify against Sattazahn. Additionally, due to Hammer’s checkered criminal past for felony burglary, he faced potential jail time of 240 years, but because of the guilty plea and testimony against Sattazahn, he could be paroled for all of his crimes in nineteen years. (N.T. at 228-333). The jury heard more than sufficient evidence to raise bias and we therefore reject Sattazahn’s claim that he is entitled to a new trial on this issue.</p>

We reject Sattazahn’s argument because again the record does not support his claim. While the trial court did sustain an objection to showing the witness one police report, ultimately defense counsel was successful in showing Hammer another police report after which Hammer testified that he had lied to police. (N.T. at 337-338, 341). Therefore, we agree with the Commonwealth that at best, the impeachment; of Hammer with the police report about which he now complains would have been cumulative evidence. Moreover, any error did not prejudice Sattazahn given that the jury heard ample evidence that Hammer lied to police regarding his involvement with several burglaries.

After argument, instructions from the judge and deliberation, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of life imprisonment. When Bullington was granted a new trial on appeal, the state notified him of its intention to seek again the death penalty. Because the first sentencing jury, by choosing life, impliedly decided that the prosecution had not proved its case for death, the result was that the jury “acquitted” the defendant of the death penalty.

We disagree. As we stated in <em>Martorano, </em>an order for a new trial wipes the slate clean. The criminal history of Sattazahn changed since the original trial in May of 1991. At the time of the retrial, he had a significant history of felony convictions that involve the threat of violence to the person. The fact that the offenses occurred after the instant murder is irrelevant under the law. <em>E.g., Commonwealth v.

On February 14, 1992, the court sentenced Sattazahn for the burglaries and robbery, as well as sentencing him to life in prison for first-degree murder. He was also ordered to serve consecutive sentences on the remaining convictions from trial that had not merged. Sattazahn filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court. Shortly thereafter, on March 17, 1992, Sattazahn entered a guilty plea to third degree murder in Schuylkill County for a murder he committed on December 26, 1987. On April 1, 1992, Sattazahn entered a guilty plea for burglary charges in Lebanon County. On appeal, the Superior Court found there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction on the conspiracies to commit third degree murder and aggravated assault, thereby arresting judgment and dismissing those charges.</p>

Nevertheless, I am troubled by the chilling effect that such a rule places upon the right of appeal guaranteed by our state Constitution. In my view, the ends of justice would be better served if, in our supervisory role respecting the administration of capital cases in Pennsylvania, we were to require that such a defendant, if convicted upon retrial, must receive the life sentence originally imposed. Such a requirement would be consistent with the legislative intent that if even a single juror decides against the death penalty, the penalty will not be imposed. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>
