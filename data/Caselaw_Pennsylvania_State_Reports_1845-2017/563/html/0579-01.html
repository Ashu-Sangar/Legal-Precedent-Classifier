When Ramsey failed to pull over, Beebe began to follow him; the parties dispute whether the pursuit involved a high speed chase. Ramsey ultimately lost control of his vehicle, struck several curbs and a tree, and flipped over. Although Ramsey was rushed to the hospital, his injuries proved to be fatal.</p>

For example, in <em>Dickens, </em>an innocent third party was injured when her car was struck by a motorist who was fleeing an officer. The injured third party sued the motorist as well as the officer and municipality. This court found that the officer and municipality were immune from suit because the Tort Claims Act precludes governmental liability for the criminal or negligent acts of a third party. <em>Dickens, </em><a href="/pa/531/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="531 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1834343" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0127-01">611 A.2d at 695</a>. The following year, the Commonwealth Court in <em>Hawks </em>addressed a negligence claim brought by a driver for injuries she suffered while she tried to elude police officers. In light of <em>Dickens’ </em>holding precluding recovery by innocent third parties, the court in <em>Hawks </em>held that it would be inconsistent to allow the fleeing suspect to collect damages due to her own criminal actions. The court in <em>Tyree, </em>which also involved injuries to a fleeing driver, followed the reasoning in <em>Hawks </em>in rejecting the plaintiffs claim.</p>

This amendment did not become effective until after the July 15,1995 accident at issue. Appellees argued that the legislature, in taking the affirmative step of adding language to preclude liability to persons evading the police, indicated that previous cases interpreting the vehicle liability exception were wrongly decided. In other <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>words, contrary to the holdings in <em>Hawks </em>and <em>Tyree, </em>prior to the amendment, the legislature intended that claims by drivers fleeing apprehension could fall within the vehicle liability exception.

As the amendment was not in effect at the time of the incident, the court found that Appellees’ claim would not be a fruitless exercise. The Commonwealth Court also found that the trial court’s decision was inconsistent with this court’s holding in <em>Jones v.

In <em>Jones, </em>as in <em>Dickens, </em>an innocent third party was injured as a result of a police chase. The court in <em>Jones </em>overruled <em>Dickens </em>and held that a governmental agency was not immune from liability when its own negligence, along with the fleeing suspect’s negligence, causes harm to an innocent third party. <em>Jones, </em><a href="/a2d/700/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="700 A.2d 417" data-case-ids="11899323,17401" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/0417-01,/pa/549/0046-01">700 A.2d at 420</a>.

As to the first factor, regarding the relationship between the parties, a law enforcement officer is a protector of all members of the public. The officer’s relationship to the fleeing suspect must be viewed in light of the broader relationship to the safety of the community he or she serves. Any duty of protection the officer has is lessened as soon as the driver flees rather than complying with a request to stop. The second factor weighs against imposing a duty, as the social utility of a police officer’s attempt to apprehend a person suspected of violating the law is beyond dispute. Turning to the third factor, it is evident that there is a risk of injury to the fleeing driver, and it is foreseeable that drivers who refuse to pull over when alerted to do so may be injured in their attempt to elude an officer. Fourth, the consequences of imposing a duty upon officers are burdensome, as that may prevent the apprehension of dangerous criminals and further encourage flight. Finally, the public has a preeminent interest in ensuring that roadways remain safe from dangerous drivers and criminals and that police officers are empowered to enforce the law.
