Bowling (“Officer Bowling”) was hired by the Township of Sugarloaf (“Township”) as a part-time, probationary police officer. No formal contract of hire was entered into by Officer Bowling and the Township; there was also apparently no mutual understanding regarding the term of Officer Bowling’s probationary period. On August 14, 1996, approximately thirteen months after Office Bowling was first hired, the Township communicated that it intended to extend Officer Bowling’s probationary period, ostensibly for the purpose of giving the Township additional time to review Officer Bowling’s work performance. On December 4, 1996, the Township informed Officer Bowling that his probationary period had terminated and that the Township would not hire him as a full-time police officer.</p>

The trial court also rejected Officer Bowling’s claim that the issue of whether this matter was arbitrable was to be first decided by the arbitrator, and not by the trial court. The trial court concluded that notwithstanding this court’s decision in <em>Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v.

The Commonwealth Court held that the trial court had failed to address the issue of whether Officer Bowling was a member of the Township’s police force. It therefore vacated the trial court’s order and remanded the matter to the trial court for a determination of this question. The Commonwealth Court then went beyond the jurisdictional issue which was before it and addressed the substantive issue which was not. The court expressed the opinion that “absent <em>specific </em>language in the collective bargaining agreement itself to [the effect that a probationary officer is covered under a collective bargaining agreement], a probationary officer is <em>not </em>subject to the protections of a collective bargaining agreement.” Commw.

The central goal of the legislature in crafting this act was to return these critical labor forces to a state of stability. To ensure that resolution of labor disputes was both swift and certain, involvement by the judiciary in the resolution of Act 111 disputes is most severely circumscribed. As detailed more fully in our decision in <em>Pennsylvania State Police v.

As <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>sagaciously recognized by the legislature, disputes involving police and firefighting personnel are to be resolved swiftly in order to prevent labor unrest, and arbitration is the nimble mechanism which can meet this timeliness challenge.

Furthermore, our judges would be forced to grapple with the interpretation of labor agreements to discern the intent of the parties. Even with respect to the limited issue of an employee’s probationary status, there will be instances in which the collective bargaining agreement must be reviewed to determine whether language therein refutes the at-will status of a probationary employee and grants such employee access to the agreement’s grievance resolution procedure. <em>Upper Makefield, </em><a href="/a2d/753/0803-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="753 A.2d 803" data-case-ids="11213247,225997" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0803-01,/pa/562/0113-01">753 A.2d 803</a>, 806, 2000 Pa.

Thus, before the mandates of Act 111 arbitration come into play, the first order of business must be to establish whether an employee such as Officer Bowling may, under the circumstances, be deemed a permanent police officer.</p>

Through that one-year probationary period, his termination fell solely under the ambit of the Police Tenure Act which provides that policemen appointed for a probationary period of one year or less are employees at will and not afforded any of the protections reserved for non-probationary officers. 53 P.S. § 812.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Thus, as a probationary officer, <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>Bowling does not have access to the grievance procedure of the permanent officers.</p>

Here, however, Officer Bowling’s probationary term was extended beyond the initial one-year period. The question, therefore, is whether, at some point between the expiration of the initial one-year probationary period and his termination, Officer Bowling was no longer considered probationary and therefore entitled to the protection of the Police Tenure Act, Act 111, or the CBA. Until this question is decided — and decided in favor of Bowling — no pertinent contract or legislation permits, let alone compels, these parties to arbitrate.</p>

I would therefore affirm the Commonwealth Court and remand to the trial court for that threshold determination. Only pursuant to a finding that Officer Bowling was no longer a probationary employee pursuant to § 812, would this matter then fall under the ambit of an arbitrator.</p>
