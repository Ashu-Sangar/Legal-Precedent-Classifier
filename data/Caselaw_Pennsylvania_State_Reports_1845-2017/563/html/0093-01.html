They separated in March of 1981, when Husband moved out of the marital residence. On April 22, 1981, they signed a “Separation and Property Settlement Agreement”, which states in the introduction that “the parties ... have been living separate and apart, and further, have decided to settle and finally determine for all times their mutual property rights, matters of alimony, support and inheritance.” Pursuant to the Agreement, the parties, <em>inter alia, </em>relinquished their inchoate intestate rights to each other’s estate; agreed that Wife would have “general custody” of the children, with Husband to have “reasonable and proper visitation and/or partial custody”; and set Husband’s support obligations for the children.</p>

Wife would provide for the maintenance of the 160 Colonial Village Drive residence and pay the insurance for the property. Husband would pay monthly mortgage payments on the 160 Colonial Village Drive residence. The approximate balance of the mortgage was $11,000.00. Wife would deed to Husband, by general warranty deed, her right, title and interest to certain properties located in the Borough of Plum, Allegheny County. They also agreed to offer for sale their interest in a property located at 217 Stroschein Road in the Borough of Monroeville, Allegheny County, and invest the proceeds in an account for their children’s education.</p>

Further, the parties intended that the Agreement was a full and complete settlement and release of any claims. Also, the parties released any claims to assets owned individually in the name of the other party. The parties acknowledged that they were fully aware, after inquiry, of the property and assets owned by the other party. Husband made a disclosure of his “Partnership Dissolution Agreement” and future salary with Penn Landscape and Cement Work. The parties would not contract or incur any debt or liability against the other party. In addition, Husband agreed to pay child support for their four minor children and the medical insurance premiums for the children and Wife unless she remarried or the parties divorced. Husband agreed to maintain insurance policies on his life and to name the parties’ children as beneficiaries. Husband would claim the parties’ children as dependents for income tax purposes.</p>

Wife filed a Complaint for Divorce on September 2, 1993, asserting claims for equitable distribution, alimony and counsel fees. Husband filed an Answer and Counterclaim, in which he raised the Agreement as a defense to Wife’s claims. The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (trial court) held ten days of hearings, from September 1994 through June 1996, on the validity of the Agreement. On April 30, 1997, the trial court issued an Order and Trial Memorandum in which it determined that the Agreement was a valid and enforceable post-nuptial agreement.</p>

      <em>Discussion</em>

    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.7",295,[221,503,1154,582]]]'>The basic issue raised in this case is whether the Agreement is a postnuptial agreement or a separation agreement. The answer “depend[s] upon the intent of the parties as gathered from all of the facts. Where they desire to settle and determine their respective property rights finally and for all time it should be construed as a postnuptial agreement.” <em>Makowski v. Makowski, </em><a href="/pa-super/163/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="163 Pa.

A significant consequence of this distinction is that a separation agreement terminates by the subsequent reconciliation of the parties. <em>In re Ray’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/304/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="304 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1132419" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0421-01">304 Pa. 421</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.%2064" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="156 A. 64">156 A. 64</a> (1931).</p>

      <em>Ray’s Estate </em>involved W.S. Ray, a man who was married twice and had three children by his first wife and one daughter by his second wife. On September 29, 1928, he and his second wife, Laura, who were living apart, signed a document captioned “Separation Agreement,” wherein Laura accepted the terms of an irrevocable trust, in which her husband set apart $85,000.00 for the support of her and their daughter. The agreement provided that it was a release of all claims against her husband, as though the marriage had never taken place. One week later the parties resumed cohabitation. Ray died testate on July 18, 1929, leaving Laura and his four children to survive him. Laura elected to take against his will. The three children from his first marriage filed a responsive petition. The Dauphin County Orphan’s Court determined that the separation agreement was in effect at the time of her husband’s death, thus precluding her from taking against the will. On appeal to this Court, Laura argued that the reconciliation abrogated the agreement and restored her statutory rights in her husband’s estate. We affirmed the decision of the Orphan’s Court.</p>
    <p id="b296-3" data-blocks='[["BL_296.3",296,[217,266,1157,1231]]]'>
      <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>This Court first looked at the language of the agreement, which stated that Ray and his wife were already “living separate and apart from each other; and it is the desire of both parties to finally and for all time settle and determine their property rights, or rights of support and maintenance, of the party of the second part [the wife] by the party of the first part [the husband], all dower rights or rights in lieu thereof, together with any and all other existing rights between the said parties, growing out of the marriage relation.” The Court placed great importance on the fact that Ray transferred $85,000.00 to the trustee for the benefit of his wife and daughter. The words of the agreement, combined with the Ray’s complete execution of the terms relating to the creation and funding of the trust, indicated that the agreement accomplished its purpose of settling for all time the parties’ property rights. The irrevocable nature of the trust and the fact that Ray completely executed his part of the agreement at once supported this conclusion. The Court noted that the provisions of a separation agreement are usually executory in nature. Such was not the case in <em>Ray’s Estate </em>because the husband’s obligations to his wife terminated upon establishment of the trust. However, the Court cited 30 Corpus Juris, 1058, § 833 for the following proposition:</p>
    <blockquote id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[257,1524,1111,358]]]'>A distinction exists between a simple separation agreement containing executory provisions only and a separation agreement making a division and allotment of property and property interests between parties. The question whether a deed is a separation deed or a postnuptial settlement depends on the intention of the parties to be gathered form the terms of the deed.</blockquote>

    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[221,488,1158,830]]]'>Although <em>Ray’s Estate </em>does not set forth a complete list of factors to be considered when determining whether an agreement is a property settlement agreement or a separation agreement, it provides a useful framework for analysis. Here, as in <em>Ray’s Estate, </em>the terms of the Agreement itself,-as noted by the trial court, support the determination that the parties intended to settle their property rights for all time. A further consideration in <em>Ray’s Estate </em>was that Husband created an irrevocable trust and funded it with $85,000. In the instant matter, Wife admits that she and Husband executed the deeds to the properties at 156 Colonial Drive, 160 Colonial Drive and the Plum Borough properties. Although they dispute whether deeds were ever delivered, Husband presented testimony that delivery was effectuated. With regard to the issue of whether the provisions of the Agreement were executed, the trial court noted:</p>

    <p id="b299-4" data-blocks='[["BL_299.5",299,[247,451,1153,638]]]'>The <em>Ray’s Estate </em>Court noted that upon signing the agreement, Ray changed his will to omit his wife and their daughter. Based on this, it concluded that from the date of signing to the day he died, Ray considered the agreement as a postnuptial property settlement agreement rather than a separation agreement to be terminated upon cohabitation. In the instant matter, Husband did not sign a new will until September of 1983, two years after the parties reconciled. Accordingly, while the new will in this case does not indicate Husband’s intent on the day he signed the Agreement, it demonstrates that early in the period of reconciliation he considered the Agreement to remain in effect.</p>

    <p id="b300-5" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[216,1054,1153,450]]]'>Based on this language, the Superior Court concluded that it was the intent of the parties that the Agreement would only be effective during the period of separation. However, a careful reading of the provision in question reveals that it in no way requires the parties to live “separate and apart.” It merely allows them to do so if they wish. Accordingly, the Superior Court ignored the plain language of the Agreement and added a provision that the parties simply did not include or intend.</p>
    <p id="b300-6" data-blocks='[["BL_300.6",300,[210,1532,1155,778]],["BL_301.1",301,[239,256,1151,407]]]'>The Superior Court bolstered its analysis by analogizing the instant matter to <em>Carosone. </em>In <em>Carosone, </em>the parties executed a marital settlement agreement on July 9, 1986, which provided that a temporary reconciliation by the parties would not void the agreement. In December of 1986, they reconciled and lived together until the spring of 1993. When the husband filed for divorce, the trial court determined that the agreement was valid, and accordingly his wife could not assert economic claims against him. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed because it determined that the clear purpose of the provision regarding temporary reconciliation was that the agreement would remain binding in the event of a short reconciliation, but would be void if the parties reconciled over a long period of time. The Superior Court in the instant matter recognized that the parties did not provide for a <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>temporary reconciliation. Nevertheless, it noted that, as in <em>Carosone, </em>the parties shared a long reconciliation that was inconsistent with the Agreement. However, finding such inconsistency was error because, as noted, the Agreement did not require the parties to live “separate and apart.” Its plain language merely gave them the right to do so. Accordingly, the Superior Court erred in interpreting this provision as meaning that the Agreement was contingent on separation.</p>

The Court relied on <em>Commonwealth ex. rel. DiValerio v. DiValerio, </em><a href="/pa-super/169/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="169 Pa.

However, we agree with Husband that nothing precluded either party from providing financial assistance beyond what was provided for in the Agreement. The Superior Court also considered the resumption of a sexual relationship, Husband’s purchase of gifts for Wife and the maintenance of a joint checking account as indications that the parties abandoned the Agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Husband notes that although the parties purchased gifts for each other, once they resumed cohabitation each purchased separate gifts for members of <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>their respective families. Also, evidence at trial established that Wife opened the checking account in her name, and that although Husband’s name was later placed on the account, only Wife used it. Furthermore, Husband paid Wife child support, by check, in the bi-weekly amounts set forth in the Agreement; Husband paid his own medical bills, Wife paid the household bills from her personal checking account, and Wife obtained certificates of deposit and savings bonds in her own name. The Superior Court failed to consider these matter when addressing the issue of abandonment of the Agreement.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[217,811,1155,792]]]'>The Superior Court also noted that “a written contract must be construed as a whole, and the parties’ intentions must be ascertained from the entire instrument.” <em>Carosone, </em><a href="/a2d/688/0733-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="688 A.2d 733" data-case-ids="7357783,947338" data-case-paths="/a2d/688/0733-01,/pa-super/455/0450-01">688 A.2d at 735</a>. Nevertheless, the Superior Court ignored the provisions of the Agreement that the trial court considered when determining the intent of the parties, including the fact that the Agreement states that the parties “have decided to settle and finally determine for all times their mutual property rights, matters of alimony, support and inheritance.” In light of the waiver of inchoate intestate rights in Paragraph 1 and the statement in Paragraph 10 that the Agreement is a “full and complete settlement and release of any and all claims,” the Superior Court erred in focusing primarily on the “separate and apart” provision of Paragraph 2, which it erroneously interpreted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The 1983 agreement specifically provides that Wife "discharges any marital interest or the right to seek a marital election against the property or assets of either Joseph Vaccarello, Jr., Inc. or Raymar Equipment Corporation... .The within release is given for the purpose, and with the understanding that Sara J. Vaccarello will have an interest in either of the aforesaid corporations....” Husband asserts that at trial, Wife’s witness, Attorney Ament, testified that the unexecuted agreement was business-related only and did not support a theory of abandonment of the 1981 Agreement.</p>

Although not raised in the appellate briefs, counsel for Husband suggested at oral argument that a unique reason existed for including in Paragraph 2 that “It shall be lawful for the Husband and the Wife at all times hereafter to live separate and apart from each other.” The parties signed the Agreement on April 22, 1981, less than a year after the effective date of the new Divorce Code, Act of April 2, 1980, P.L. 63, § 101 et seq., 23 P.S. § 101 <em>et seq. </em>(effective July 1, 1980). Uncertain as to whether Husband's leaving the marital residence would subject him to a claim of desertion if the Divorce Code had been determined to be unconstitutional, they included the "separate and apart” language. This bolsters Husband's position that it was not the parties’ intent for the Agreement to be dependent upon separation.</p>

Also, the agreement included terms delineating the custodial rights of the parties with respect to their then-minor children and provided that Joseph would have reasonable visitation privileges.
