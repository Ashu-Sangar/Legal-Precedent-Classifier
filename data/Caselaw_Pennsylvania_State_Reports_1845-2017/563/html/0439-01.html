Accordingly, the legislature has determined that it is not unfair to defendants that they may be sued twenty years after an accident occurred and not have a limitation defense available to them. Therefore, when a guardian files the minor’s action soon after the cause of action accrues and then decides voluntarily to discontinue that lawsuit, the defendant cannot claim prejudice merely because the suit can be refiled many years later with no limitation defense available to him or her. He or she may be in no worse a position, with respect to the passage of time, than if no minor’s action had been filed but the child institutes his or her own action when he or she is no longer a minor.</p>
