In 1990, Block began offering its Rapid Refund program whereby its taxpayer customers could receive speedier refunds using one of three services: (1) electronic filing of the tax return for a fee; (2) electronic filing for a fee with direct deposit of the taxpayer’s refund by the IRS to the taxpayer’s bank account; or (3) electronic filing for a fee with a RAL arranged by Block with a lender such as Mellon Bank. The third option involving the RALs is the service at issue.</p>

Between 1990 and 1993, more than 600,000 Pennsylvania residents participated in the <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>RAL program. Specifically, Block customers who filed their returns electronically and met the lender’s eligibility requirements were informed of the availability of loans in the amount of their anticipated refunds from Mellon Bank. If the customer was interested in the loan, Block would simultaneously transmit the taxpayer’s income tax return information to the IRS and Mellon Bank. Within a few days of the transmittal, the taxpayer, if approved, would receive a check in the amount of the loan minus a bank transaction fee. The taxpayer could also elect to have Block’s tax preparation and electronic filing fees withheld by the lender from the RAL check so that the taxpayer would not have to advance any money. When the taxpayer’s actual tax refund was ready, usually within a matter of weeks, the IRS would deposit the refund check into an account with Mellon Bank to repay the loan. In exchange for the RAL, the taxpayer paid to Mellon Bank a fiat rate finance charge of $29.00 or $35.00, which Block employees presented to the taxpayer as a flat dollar amount rather than as a percentage interest rate on the short term loan.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Since the RAL is secured by the tax refund, and the tax refund is paid directly into a proprietary account at Mellon Bank, the lender bank takes on few risks with the program. Block did not disclose to its RAL customers that it received a payment from Mellon Bank for each loan, shared in the profits of the RALs in other ways, or that the taxpayer’s endorsement on the back of the loan proceeds check constituted a signature on a loan agreement printed on the reverse of the check.</p>

Appellees claim, and the Superior Court found, that they produced sufficient evidence to establish that an agency relationship existed between Block and the taxpayers who participated in the Rapid Refund program and secured RALs. They further claim that Block breached its fiduciary duty to those taxpayers by failing to disclose the true nature of the program as a loan program and to inform them that Block received a percentage <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>of the finance charge paid to Mellon Bank and indirectly benefited from the loans in other ways. Appellees note that Block holds itself out to the public as “America’s tax team” and encourages consumer trust by utilizing slogans such as “Do what millions of Americans do, trust H <em>&amp; </em>R Block” and that Block’s success in the field of tax return preparation is due to the image of trustworthiness Block has created. Appellees claim that Block exploited this relationship with their clients by steering them into loans with exorbitant rates of interest carrying little practical value other than a quick refund for their clients, but which further profited Block financially.</p>
    <p id="b565-5" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[220,911,1155,734]]]'>Block denies that it had an agency relationship with its customers, arguing that appellees did not exercise the requisite substantial control over Block’s preparation and electronic filing of the tax returns and that Block did not have the legal authority to bind appellees to the RAL agreements.

The pleadings here do not establish an agency relationship. With specific respect to the RALs, there is no showing that appellees intended Block to act on their behalf in securing the RALs. To the contrary, Block offered appellees the opportunity to file their tax returns electronically with the <em>three </em>options set forth above, only one of which involved RALs. Appellees were not required to apply for an RAL in order to have their returns prepared by Block or filed electronically through Block. It was appellees alone who decided to take advantage of that particular option. Block was neither authorized to, nor did it in fact, act on its <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>customers’ behalf in this regard. If a customer elected to apply for an RAL, Block simply facilitated the loan process by presenting appellees to Mellon Bank as viable loan candidates. Block neither applied for the loan on behalf of appellees nor determined that appellees should apply; appellees undertook that procedure themselves. The RAL program was merely another distinct and separate service offered by Block to its customers. Furthermore, it was a distinct service that Block’s customers were fully aware came at a higher price, just as one would expect for an advance of money. Simply introducing appellees to a lender willing to provide a loan is not sufficient to create an agency relationship. Therefore, we hold that, as a matter of law, Block was not acting as appellees’ agent in the RAL transactions, such that they were subject to a heightened, fiduciary duty.</p>
    <p id="b568-5" data-blocks='[["BL_568.4",568,[236,1124,1162,1177]]]'>We are aware that here, as in <em>Green, </em>Block could be said to have played an “integral part” in arranging the RALs. In our view, however, “integral” or not, Block’s mere facilitation of the its customers’ desire to pursue the loans, as one of the multiple services offered by Block, is not sufficient to establish an agency relationship under Pennsylvania law. The special relationship arising from an agency agreement, with its concomitant heightened duty, cannot arise from any and all actions, no matter how trivial, arguably undertaken on another’s behalf. Rather, the action must be a matter of consequence or trust, such as the ability to actually bind the principal or alter the principal’s legal relations. Indeed, implicit in the long-standing Pennsylvania requirement that the principal manifest an intention that the agent act on the principal’s behalf is the notion that the agent has authority to alter the principal’s relationships with third parties, such as binding the principal to a contract. Notably, the Restatement, which we have cited with approval in this area in the past, specifically recognizes as much. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>§ 12 (“An agent or apparent agent holds a power to alter the legal relations between the principal and third persons and between the principal and himself.”).</p>

    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[236,373,1157,1650]]]'>I believe that Appellees met their burden of establishing that an agency relationship existed. Here, the Superior Court found that Appellees “established that they visited the [¶] <em>&amp; </em>R] Block offices in response to media promotions of the Rapid Refund Program to engage [¶] &amp; R] Block to achieve two results: 1) to complete and file their tax returns, and 2) to obtain a refund of any overpayment of taxes they had made to the Internal Revenue Service [“IRS”].” <em>Basile v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em><a href="/a2d/729/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="729 A.2d 574" data-case-ids="11620834" data-case-paths="/a2d/729/0574-01">729 A.2d 574</a>, 581 (Pa.Super.1999) (citing Deposition of Laura Calvin, 11/18/93, at 103-04; Deposition of Sandra Basile, 11/17/93, at 33-35). Appellees remained at the office while H &amp; R Block employees completed the tax forms. After completion, the H &amp; R Block employees requested that Appellees sign the tax returns before H &amp; R Block sent the returns to the IRS and the state Department of Revenue. Calvin Deposition, <em>supra, </em>at 104-05; Basile Deposition, <em>supra, </em>at 39-40. These facts indicate that: (1) Appellees manifested that H &amp; R Block, through its employees, compute their taxes and complete and send their tax forms, thereby “rendering service but retaining control of the manner of doing it;” (2) H <em>&amp; </em>R Block, through its employees, accepted the undertaking of completing and sending Appellees’ tax forms; and (3) Appellees remained in control, that is, they had to sign their own forms and the H &amp; R Block employees completed the forms pursuant to information given to them by Appellees. <em>See Reid, </em><a href="/pa/503/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="503 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1785930" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0458-01">503 Pa. at 462-63</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="503 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1785930" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0458-01">469 A.2d at 1033</a>. For these reasons, I believe that an agency relationship existed between Appellees and H <em>&amp; </em>R Block with respect to the computation of their taxes and the completion and submission of their tax returns to the taxing authority. What remains is to determine whether agency extended to the Rapid Refund portion of the transaction. I believe it does.</p>

The taxpayer could choose between (1) an electronic filing of the tax return for a fee; (2) an electronic <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>filing of the tax return for a fee with an electronic direct deposit by the IRS of the tax return to the taxpayer’s bank account; or 3) an electronic tax return filing for a fee with a refund anticipation loan arranged by H &amp; R Block with a lending institution such as Mellon Bank, called a “Rapid Refund.” The Rapid Refund enabled the taxpayer to receive her “refund” within a few days, instead of the typical four-to six weeks it would take for the taxing authority’s refund check to arrive. Customers who chose the H &amp; R Block Rapid Refund option were given an application which they completed and submitted to Mellon Bank. Once the bank approved the application, it issued a check to the taxpayer in an amount equal to the taxpayer’s anticipated refund less transaction fees. The taxpayer would then sign over the entire amount of the check from the taxing authority which would arrive a few weeks later.</p>
    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[192,1096,1154,876]]]'>H &amp; R Block essentially contends that its relationship with the taxpayer is concluded once the tax return is filed, and that once the tax preparer offers her the application for the Rapid Refund, the taxpayer’s relationship is a creditor/debtor one with Mellon Bank. I disagree as I believe that H &amp; R Block’s role in facilitating the Rapid Refund for the taxpayer is as the taxpayer’s agent as all three elements of agency exist. Here, (1) the taxpayer manifested her consent to the tax preparer that she wished to participate or take advantage of H &amp; R Block’s Rapid Refund program when it was offered; (2) the preparer facilitated the process of obtaining a Rapid Refund by offering an application; and (3) the preparer consented to act on the taxpayer’s need by matching the taxpayer to a source for the early refund, here, Mellon Bank. <em>See Reid, </em><a href="/pa/503/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="503 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1785930" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0458-01">503 Pa. at 462-63</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="503 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1785930" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0458-01">469 A.2d at 1033</a>. Accordingly, I also believe an agency relationship existed between Appellees and H <em>&amp; </em>R Block for purposes of the Rapid Refund Program.</p>

Furthermore, the Restatement (Second) of Agency § 389 states that: “Unless otherwise agreed, an agent is subject to a duty not to deal with his principal as an adverse party in a transaction connected with his agency without the principal’s knowledge.” Restatement (Second) of Agency .§ 389 (1958). Finally, the fiduciary duty an agent owes his principal also includes a duty of disclosure, that is, the agent must disclose all relevant information pertaining to the parties’ performances within the scope of the agency relationship. <em>Matter of Estate of Evasew, </em><a href="/pa/526/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="526 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1825970" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0098-01">526 Pa. 98</a>, 104-05, <a href="/pa/526/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="526 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1825970" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0098-01">584 A.2d 910</a>, 912-13 (1990).

    <p id="b574-6" data-blocks='[["BL_574.6",574,[234,1203,1156,872]]]'>As H &amp; R Block was the agent through which the Rapid Refund was facilitated, it had a duty to disclose the nature of its relationship with Mellon Bank in respect to the Rapid Refund Program. As the majority noted, “Block did not disclose to its [refund application loan] customers that it received a payment from Mellon Bank for each loan, shared in the profits of the [refund application loans] in other ways, or that the taxpayer’s endorsement on the back of the loan proceeds check constituted a signature on a loan agreement printed on the reverse of the check.” Maj. Op. 563 Pa. at 366, 761 A.2d at 1119. I believe that this is a gross violation of H &amp; R Block’s fiduciary duty to Appellees. Since I believe that the evidence creates the inference that an agency relationship existed between H <em>&amp; </em>R Block and Appellees for the entire tax return “package” offered and further, that H &amp; R Block violated the fiduciary duty it owed to Appellees, I respectfully dissent.</p>

Like the majority, I would not be inclined to conclude, extrinsic of an existing, underlying agency relationship, that a separate agency role is necessarily undertaken by one who merely facilitates a lending transaction. Nevertheless, I join that portion of Mr. Justice Nigro’s analysis which concludes, as did the Superior Court, that an agency relationship existed between Block and Appellees for the purposes of preparing Appellees’ tax returns, filing them with the IRS, and obtaining refunds. Indeed, I note that H <em>&amp; </em>R Block conceded as much, at least for purposes of Maryland law, in <em>Green v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em><a href="/md/355/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="355 Md. 488" data-case-ids="865619" data-case-paths="/md/355/0488-01">355 Md. 488</a>, <a href="/md/355/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="355 Md. 488" data-case-ids="865619" data-case-paths="/md/355/0488-01">735 A.2d 1039</a>, 1049 (1999). I also believe that the fiduciary duties associated with such relationship may be viewed as sufficiently broad to compel disclosure of aspects of self-interest in a related loan transaction. Thus, I would affirm the order of the Superior Court remanding “for disposition of questions of fact concerning the extent to which Block’s failure to disclose the nature of the Rapid Refund program and its participation in the profits generated by the RALs constituted a violation of Block’s duty as an agent.” <em>Basile v.
