After completing a run down the mountain, appellee was skiing towards the lift through an area at the base of the mountain where several ski trails converge when she was struck by an unidentified skier descending the slope behind her. As a result, appellee injured her right knee and her back.</p>

Appellant, in turn, filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted on June 2, 1998. The Honorable Conrad B. Capuzzi held that, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Skier’s Responsibility Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 7102(c) (the “Act”), appellee had assumed the risk of <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>colliding with another skier. In addition, the court noted that appellee had admitted that she was aware that she could get hurt while skiing and yet had signed a Release Agreement releasing appellant from all liability for injury, prior to her entering the ski facility.</p>
    <p id="b701-4" data-blocks='[["BL_701.5",701,[189,556,1154,844]]]'>On February 25, 1999, a split panel of the Superior Court reversed the grant of summary judgment and remanded the case for trial. The panel majority concluded that it could not determine as a matter of law: (1) that appellee’s injury was caused by an occurrence inherent in the sport of skiing; (2) that appellee’s experience or knowledge caused her to recognize the risk of being hit by an errant skier while she was at the base of the slope and that she willingly accepted that particular risk; or (3) that appellee’s action in skiing towards the ski lift at the bottom of the slope constituted “downhill skiing” for purposes of the assumption of the risk provision in the Act. The panel majority also concluded that the Release Agreement appellee had signed applied only to the rental ski equipment and injuries related to that equipment, not to the danger posed by another skier, and thus could not bar her claim. 727 A.2d at 137-38.</p>
    <p id="b701-5" data-blocks='[["BL_701.6",701,[189,1451,1153,851]]]'>Judge Cirillo dissented. In his view, the term “downhill skiing” employed in the Act applies to all activities related to the sport and “it is an inherent part of downhill skiing that one empties into a basin at the bottom of a ski slope with the intent to turn around and approach the ski lift and return to the top of the slope to complete another run.” <em>Id. </em>at 139. In addition, the dissent noted that the ski lift ticket appellee had purchased stated, in pertinent part, that “There are inherent and other risks in the sport of skiing ... [which] include, but are not limited to ... collisions with ... other skiers.” The ticket also advised that any person not agreeing to “voluntarily assume the risk of these injuries” should not purchase a ticket. In light of these undisputed facts, the dissent would have held that there was no issue for the jury: reasonable minds could not differ as to the conclusion that appellee assumed the risk of the skiing injury she suffered. <em>Id.</em>

The Restatement Second of Torts, § 496A, summarizes the general principle of assumption of the risk as follows: “A plaintiff who voluntarily assumes a risk of harm arising from the negligent or reckless conduct of the defendant cannot recover for such harm.” In practice, the doctrine was more complicated. The comment to the Restatement notes that the doctrine has been used by the courts “in at least four different senses, and the distinctions seldom have been made clear.” <em><a href="/pa/533/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="533 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="1837500" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0151-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 496A comment C.

    <blockquote id="b703-9" data-blocks='[["BL_703.10",703,[231,1878,1111,420]]]'>1. In its simplest form, assumption of risk means that the plaintiff has given his express consent to relieve the defendant of an obligation to exercise care for his protection, and agrees to take his chances as to injury from a known or possible risk. The result is that the defendant, who would otherwise be under a duty to exercise such care, is relieved of that responsibility, and is no longer under any duty to protect the plaintiff....</blockquote>

      <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>2. A second, and closely related, meaning is that the plaintiff has entered voluntarily into some relation with the defendant which he knows to involve the risk, and so is regarded as tacitly or impliedly agreeing to relieve the defendant of responsibility, and to take his own chances. Thus a spectator entering a baseball park may be regarded as consenting that the players may proceed with the game without taking precautions to protect him from being hit by the ball. Again the legal result is that the defendant is relieved of his duty to the plaintiff....</blockquote>

In a third type of situation the plaintiff, aware of a risk created by the negligence of the defendant, proceeds or continues voluntarily to encounter it. For example, an independent contractor who finds that he has been furnished by his employer with a machine which is in dangerous condition, and that the employer, after notice, has failed to repair it or to substitute another, may continue to work with the machine. He may not be negligent in doing so, since his decision may be an entirely reasonable one, because the risk is relatively slight in comparison with the utility of his own conduct; and he may even act with unusual caution because he is aware of the danger. The same policy of the common law which denies recovery to one who expressly consents to accept a risk will, however, prevent his recovery in such a case....</blockquote>

To be distinguished from these three situations is the fourth, in which the plaintiffs conduct in voluntarily encountering a known risk is itself unreasonable, and amounts to contributory negligence. There is thus negligence on the part of both plaintiff and defendant; and the plaintiff is barred from recovery, not only by his implied consent to accept the risk, but also by the policy of the law which refuses to allow him to impose upon the defendant a loss for which his own negligence was in part responsible....</blockquote>

The defendants argued that Jones failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, citing the “universal rule” that batted balls in baseball stadiums do not present an unreasonable risk of harm and, thus, do not provide a basis for negligence liability. The Court in <em>Jones </em>noted that although we had yet to consider the liability of a baseball stadium operator for injuries caused by a batted ball, there were “settled principles which apply to all cases involving a <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>place of amusement for which admission is charged.” <a href="/pa/483/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="483 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="1751280" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0075-01">483 Pa. at 81</a>, <a href="/pa/483/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="483 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="1751280" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0075-01">394 A.2d at 549</a>.

      <em>Jones </em>summarized this approach as amounting to a “no-duty” rule upon the part of the defendant, so long as the injury suffered arose from a risk that was “common, frequent and expected” in the theatre, amusement park, sports facility, etc. Persons patronizing those facilities could be charged with anticipating such inherent risks. The Court emphasized, however, that the “no-duty” rule “in no way affect[s] the duty of theatres, amusement parks and sports facilities to protect patrons from foreseeably dangerous conditions not inherent in the amusement activity.” <em><a href="/pa/483/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="483 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="1751280" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0075-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/483/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="483 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="1751280" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0075-01">at 85</a>, <a href="/pa/483/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="483 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="1751280" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0075-01">394 A.2d at 551</a>.

      <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>In light of these principles, ours is a two-part inquiry. First, this Court must determine whether appellee was engaged in the sport of downhill siding at the time of her injury. If that answer is affirmative, we must then determine whether the risk of being hit from behind by another skier while skiing towards the ski lift at the base of the slope is one of the “inherent risks” of downhill skiing, which appellee must be deemed to have assumed under the Act. If so, then summary judgment was appropriate because, as a matter of law, appellee cannot recover for her injuries.</p>
    <p id="b708-4" data-blocks='[["BL_708.4",708,[234,806,1157,952]]]'>Appellee claims that the Act does not apply because, at the time of the collision, she “was not in the process of skiing downhill,” but rather was propelling herself towards the ski lift at the base of the mountain following a downhill run. In order to accept this argument, this Court would have to interpret the Act, as well as the sport of downhill skiing, in an extremely narrow, hypertechnical and unrealistic manner. This we decline to do. The Act specifically acknowledges that there are risks inherent in “the <em>sport </em>of downhill skiing.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 7102(c) (emphasis added). Obviously, the sport of downhill skiing encompasses more than merely siding down a hill. It includes those other activities directly and necessarily incident to the act of downhill skiing. Such activities include boarding the ski lift, riding the lift up the mountain, alighting from the lift, skiing from the lift to the trail and, after a run is completed, skiing towards the ski lift to start another run or skiing toward the base lodge or other facility at the end of the day.</p>
    <p id="b708-5" data-blocks='[["BL_708.5",708,[234,1783,1152,523]]]'>At the time of the unfortunate but all-too-common collision here, appellee was skiing through an area at the bottom of the mountain where a number of trails converged and towards the ski lift so that she could return to the top of the mountain for another run. She collided not with some alien or unexpected object in the sport, but with another downhill skier coming down the very same hill after her. Although appellee may not have been siding on a “downhill” plane at the time of the collision, she was no less engaged in the sport of downhill skiing than at any other point in the process.</p>
    <p id="b709-3" data-blocks='[["BL_709.4",709,[201,268,1157,686]]]'>
      <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>To accept appellee’s argument that one who is not at the precise moment skiing “down” a hill is not engaged in the sport of downhill skiing would require an entirely artificial and unrealistic view of the activity. Under appellee’s theory, a skier who has temporarily stopped in the middle of a slope would no longer, be engaged in the sport of downhill skiing. Such a tortured and artificial interpretation of the Act and the sport would defy common sense and lead to absurd results. Therefore, we conclude as a matter of law that the facts viewed in the light most favorable to appellee show that she was engaged in the sport of downhill skiing at the time of the collision and, thus, the Act, which preserves the doctrine of assumption of the risk, applies.</p>
    <p id="b709-4" data-blocks='[["BL_709.5",709,[197,980,1159,1335]],["BL_710.1",710,[223,274,1149,144]]]'>It is equally clear that the risk of colliding with another skier at the base of a ski slope is one of the “common, frequent and expected” risks “inherent” in downhill skiing. 42 Pa.C.S. § 7102(c)(1). Indeed, other skiers are as much a part of the risk in downhill skiing, if not more so, than the snow and ice, elevation, contour, speed and weather conditions. As anyone who has ever undertaken the sport of skiing is painfully aware, it is a sport in which it is common for the participants to lose control. The instant collision occurred in an area of the mountain where several trails converge. Skiers, including appellee, were skiing through this area, while others, including the skier who collided with her, entered the area at the end of their own downhill runs: in appellee’s words, she was struck “by someone who was coming down the hill, coming down the slope.” R.R. at 506. The fact that appellee was at the base of the downhill trail she had just negotiated did little to lessen the ever-present danger that another downhill skier, coming down the mountain on the very same trail just behind her, was going faster than she was, or intended to ski farther than she just had, and could then lose control and collide with her. As the undisputed facts here amply demonstrate, the point at which the “downhill” portion of a particular ski run ends depends upon the speed, control and judgment of the skier. The possibility that one skier may collide with another in this common area at the base of the slope is one of the common <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>risks of the sport of downhill skiing. As such, we hold, appellant had no duty to protect appellee against this inherent risk.</p>
