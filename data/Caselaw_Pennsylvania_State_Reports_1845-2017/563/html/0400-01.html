    <p id="b600-8" data-blocks='[["BL_600.7",600,[245,665,1153,302]]]'>This is an appeal by allowance from an order of Superior Court which reversed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of York County denying injunctive relief in a dispute over control of Hanover Foods Corporation (HFC), a consumer food products company. The background of the case is as follows.</p>
    <p id="b600-9" data-blocks='[["BL_600.8",600,[242,1003,1154,571]]]'>Alan Warehime, the father of John A. Warehime, Michael Warehime, and Sally Warehime Yelland, was chairman and chief executive officer of HFC from 1956 to 1989. In 1988, two voting trusts were established by the Warehimes. A majority of the voting stock of HFC was placed into the trusts. One trust, containing 199,496 shares of Class B voting stock, was established by Alan Warehime and his three children. The other trust, containing 15,025 Class B shares, was established by Alan Warehime and five of his grandchildren. Alan Warehime served as the sole voting trustee for both trusts.</p>
    <p id="b600-10" data-blocks='[["BL_600.9",600,[239,1610,1154,309]]]'>In 1989, by appointment of Alan Warehime, John Warehime became chairman and chief executive officer of HFC. Alan Warehime continued to serve as voting trustee for the trusts, however, until his death in 1990. Thereafter, John Warehime, who had been designated by Alan Warehime as successor trustee, filled that role.</p>
    <p id="b600-11" data-blocks='[["BL_600.10",600,[239,1948,1152,367]],["BL_601.1",601,[191,262,1153,415]]]'>Both of the trusts were designed to expire in 1998, ten years after their creation. Anticipating this, during the 1990s Michael Warehime and Sally Warehime Yelland made it known that they were not satisfied to have John Warehime running HFC. Michael Warehime, who controls another consumer food products company, Snyder’s of Hanover, expressed an interest in becoming chairman of HFC. He and the other plaintiffs in <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>this action did not, however, develop any plans for the future of HFC; nor did they identify the management that they intended to install. Uncertainty over the course that HFC would take after expiration of the trusts caused instability within the company and cast uncertainty over its operations, with the result that relations with the company’s customers and suppliers were adversely affected and it became impossible for HFC to raise needed equity capital.</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[193,701,1153,249]]]'>In 1994, John Warehime voted all of the voting trust shares in favor of a proposal to eliminate cumulative voting in the election of HFC’s directors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The proposal was adopted and, as a result, John Warehime was able to exercise the voting trust shares to elect all of the board members.</p>
    <p id="b601-6" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[191,981,1155,843]]]'>In 1996, a body known as the “Independent Directors Committee” was formed by several members of the board. It was formed for the purpose of considering strategic alternatives for HFC in light of the impending expiration of the voting trusts and the dissention among members of the Warehime family. The family had not been able to set aside their differences to plan for the future of HFC. John Warehime, Michael Warehime, and Sally Warehime Yelland had engaged in very little communication with each other in recent years. The decision to form the committee was made solely by board members without advice or input from counsel or John Warehime. The committee’s independence was reflected in the trial court’s findings that the board rejected proposals made by John Warehime on numerous occasions and that the board would only continue to support John Warehime as chairman of HFC if he continued.to perform well.</p>
    <p id="b601-7" data-blocks='[["BL_601.6",601,[192,1849,1154,308]],["BL_602.1",602,[242,260,1151,201]]]'>The committee commissioned various consulting firms to conduct a review of HFC. The review determined that HFC was equal or superior to its competition but that it would need approximately $30 million in new capital to sustain its competitive position. Uncertainty over HFC’s future, arising from the impending 1998 expiration of the voting trusts, would <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>make it difficult to raise this capital. The review cautioned that if uncertainty over the company’s future persisted there would be a deterioration in HFC’s business prospects and that the long-term interests of the company would be harmed.</p>
    <p id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[242,485,1151,411]]]'>In light of this situation, the committee considered various strategic alternatives. These included doing nothing and allow the voting trust to expire, with the result that HFC’s prospects would meanwhile deteriorate. Also considered was the possibility of selling the company. The option that the committee decided upon, however, was to recommend adoption of amendments to HFC’s articles of incorporation to provide a stable governance structure.</p>
    <p id="b602-6" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[236,921,1158,1157]]]'>The proposed amendments permitted the issuance of 10,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to the HFC 401(k) plan, provided that the majority of the trustees of that plan are “disinterested directors” as defined in the Business Corporation Law, 15 Pa.C.S. § 1715(e). The amendments also provided a method for resolution of disputes among members of the Warehime family as to the management of HFC. Specifically, the amendments provided that in the event of a dispute among family members regarding the election of directors or other related matters during the five years after the issuance of the stock, the Series C would be entitled to 35 votes per share, and, if there is no such dispute, the Series C shares would remain non-voting. Thus, the amendments place directors serving as fiduciaries of the 401(k) plan in a position to resolve disputes over the management of HFC through exercise of their voting rights in Class C shares. John Warehime has no voting rights with regard to those shares. Because John Warehime as voting trustee of the Class B shares has control over election of the board of directors, however, the amendments have the effect of prolonging the period in which directors elected by him will have a measure of control over the company.</p>
    <p id="b602-7" data-blocks='[["BL_602.6",602,[230,2102,1157,202]],["BL_603.1",603,[191,257,1151,205]]]'>The shareholders of HFC were given formal notice of the proposed amendments. Soon thereafter, Michael Warehime and several other shareholders filed an action seeking a •preliminary injunction to prohibit John Warehime from voting <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>shares in the trusts in favor of the amendments. They alleged that the amendments would, in effect, allow John Warehime to extend his control of HFC beyond the termination of the voting trusts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b603-4" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[191,496,1155,855]]]'>After a hearing, the trial court determined that the proposed amendments did not present a conflict of interest between the private interests of John Warehime and his duties as trustee of the voting trusts, that the purpose of the amendments was not to advance the personal interests of John Warehime, and that the amendments reflected a good faith effort to serve the best interests of HFC and its shareholders, including the beneficiaries of the voting trusts, since the amendments assured stability in the governance structure of HFC for a five-year period that would permit needed capital to be raised and allow the company to grow and prosper. Accordingly, on June 24, 1997, the request for a preliminary injunction was denied. The following day, John Warehime convened a meeting and voted all of the trust shares in favor of the proposed amendments; the amendments were, therefore, adopted.</p>
    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.6",603,[191,1402,1155,473]]]'>Michael Warehime took an appeal to Superior Court. Superior Court held that the trial court erred in refusing to grant an injunction against John Warehime voting the trust shares in favor of the amendments and that by voting in favor of those amendments John Warehime breached his duty of loyalty to the trust beneficiaries. <em>Warehime v. Warehime, </em><a href="/a2d/722/1060-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="722 A.2d 1060" data-case-ids="11782283" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/1060-01">722 A.2d 1060</a>, 1071 (Pa.Super.1998). The court stated that it was irrelevant that his actions were undertaken in good faith to benefit HFC, and that:</p>

The adoption of these amendments, while taken for the stated reasons of preserving the integrity of HFC’s value and ability to function profitably, will, nonetheless, serve to perpetuate the control of the company by John Warehime for at least another five years and preclude the other shareholders, including the beneficiaries of the trust, from the ability and opportunity to make any meaningful decision concerning the management of HFC.</blockquote>

In short, Superior Court held that a voting trustee’s actions must be measured against a standard of conduct requiring more than good faith, i.e., a standard of absolute loyalty that bars the trustee from taking any actions that extend his influence over the corporation beyond the expiration of the trusts, irrespective of whether the actions are undertaken in good faith for the benefit the company and its shareholder beneficiaries. We do not agree that the standard of good faith was inapplicable. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>

If the parties had intended to limit the trustee’s authority to vote the shares in any manner, they would have included a provision setting forth the subjects on which the trustee had unrestricted voting rights and those on which the trustee did not have such rights. For example, they could have included a provision that the trustee not vote trust shares in favor of any proposal that would dilute the voting strength of shares held in trust, as occurred here through creation of the Class C shares. Instead, they granted the trustee broad power to vote “at any and all meetings of the <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>stockholders of the Corporation, for whatsoever purpose called or held,” subject only to requirements that the trustee “use his best judgment in voting upon the stock held by him” and carry out his duties in “good faith.” Such is the agreement that the parties made for themselves.</p>
    <p id="b606-5" data-blocks='[["BL_606.4",606,[243,525,1154,681]]]'>The agreement, therefore, placed the trustee in the foreseeable position of having to take actions that would benefit HFC and its shareholders while being dilutive of the voting strength of the existing trust shares.

Even under contractarian theory, however, in order for general principles regarding fiduciary duty to be overridden, there must be a sufficient meeting of the minds concerning the action of the fiduciary, which I find lacking in the trust instruments at issue. While these instruments effectively conveyed a broad array of powers,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> I find an inherent ambiguity between the <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>provisions limiting the effectiveness of the trusts to a fixed, ten-year term, and the utilization by the trustee of the trusts’ authority to unilaterally establish an ongoing structure of corporate governance that undermines control of a corporation by majority vote of its shareholders beyond the agreed-upon time for expiration, particularly when such action is taken in contemplation of the impending termination. Therefore, I disagree with the majority that, in such circumstances, the voting trustee’s obligations should be deemed limited by the written agreements. Rather, consistent with the general legal proposition advanced by Mr. Justice Nigro and the Superior Court majority, I would hold that, at least in the absence of express, unambiguous, contrary provisions within the voting trust instruments (or statutory prescription), the prevailing common-law standard of fiduciary conduct should control in such circumstances.</p>

Given significant stock ownership by close corporation management, the potential for conflicts of interest between director shareholders and non-director shareholders, or even among director shareholders themselves, over a given decision (business or distributional) is pervasive. While in the public issue corporation we might still talk about the best interests of the corporation, if for no other reason than as a shorthand for the lowest common denominator of shareholder interest, in the paradigmatic close corporation no discernable corporate interest exists apart from the individual interests of the shareholders at any given point in time.

The same commentator has argued that the general response of the judiciary to problems of inherent conflicts of interest has been to effectuate an inappropriate dilution of fiduciary obligations. <em>See id. </em>at 1692. In the commentator’s estimation, in many jurisdictions, the duty of undivided loyalty has inappropriately yielded to a less exacting weighing formulation, balancing the controlling interests against those of the minority, or a mere requirement of adherence to a standard of good faith or the business judgment rule on the part of the controlling interests. <em>See id. </em>at 1713-17.</p>

Indeed, if this were to be made the rule, the operations of a corporation having a structure and composition such as Hanover Foods Corporation (“HFC”) would be substantially impeded, since the controlling interests could rarely satisfy a standard of pure, selfless disinterestedness.

In such circumstances, the conflict of interest confronting the trustee is simply too great and cannot be reconciled with his duty of loyalty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> On the other hand, however, I would not foreclose <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>the effectuation of necessary structural changes by a voting trustee under the broad form of authority conveyed by the present trust instruments where the intent underlying the changes, and their effect, are otherwise, and, after careful scrutiny of the facts, the duty of loyalty can be said to be fulfilled. Indeed, this latter form of action would seem to fall well within the scope of the parties’ initial intention in entrusting their interests to a single decision maker whose own interests were, in significant part, in alignment with theirs. Thus, in my assessment, the critical questions in determining John Warehime’s compliance with his fiduciary obligations in connection with the proposed amendments to HFC’s articles of incorporation are: whether, and to what extent, the amendments were intended to, and/or would have the effect of, perpetuating John Warehime’s control over HFC; and whether, and to what extent, the amendments would inure to the benefit (or, conversely, operate to the detriment) of the minority shareholders.</p>

Regarding the company’s past performance under existing management, the trial court found that, despite a general decline in the industry, HFC had achieved record-high results in terms of asset valuation, shareholder’s equity and pre-tax earnings. It found, however, that uncertainties associated with the future expiration of the voting trusts were causing destabilization of HFC’s corporate governance and would prevent the company from raising essential capital — according to the trial court, absent necessary stabilization, it would be impossible for HFC to conduct business in a manner beneficial to its long-term interests, and the company would likely deteriorate within a short time period. The trial court also found that HFC had <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>lost key employees and was in danger of losing others; the uncertainties jeopardized relationships with growers and suppliers; and particular minority interests were engaging in behaviors disruptive of corporate governance, although they had no plan for the future of the corporation. The trial court then described the response of HFC board members to this state of affairs, including the formation of an “Independent Directors Committee” to consider strategic alternatives absent advice or input from John Warehime, the retention of several firms and individuals in this regard, and the ultimate recommendation of the amendments to HFC’s articles of incorporation. <em>See generally Warehime, </em><a href="/a2d/722/1060-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="722 A.2d 1060" data-case-ids="11782283" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/1060-01">722 A.2d at 1061-62</a> (describing the trial court’s findings).</p>

The trial court found that the voting structure embodied in the amendments constituted a necessary and neutral dispute resolution procedure in furtherance of the essential goal of stability. Further, the trial court specifically determined that the amendments were in the best interests of all shareholders, including minority interests.

As noted <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>below, however, where minority shareholders themselves have conflicting interests, the trustee (and ultimately, where necessary, a trial court) may be required to undertake some form of balancing of those interests to determine the highest net benefit to minority interests. Here, as I read the sum and substance of the trial court’s findings, it weighed particular subjective minority interests (for example, Michael Warehime's desire to oust John Warehime) against more objective minority interests (maximization of share value) and found that the highest net benefit to minority interests would be achieved by favoring the latter. While this sort of balancing ordinarily would not be within the court’s province, since minority interests generally do not owe fiduciary obligations to a corporation, <em>but see </em>Mitchell, <em>Fiduciary Duty, </em>138 U.Pa.L.Rev. at 1730 (advocating imposition of fiduciary obligations upon minority interests in close corporations as one solution to the problem of inherent conflicts of interests), here, the minority interests surrendered their voting rights to a trustee, and it is solely in the context of the assessment of the trustee’s performance of his duties and obligations that this balancing occurs. Indeed, the trial court’s decision to favor the objective goal of promoting share value over subjective goals of individual shareholders seems entirely consistent with the parties’ decision in the first instance to delegate their voting powers to a trustee to centralize the decision making authority.</p>

While the two Warehime Voting Trust agreements (collectively Warehime Trust) do direct the trustee to use his “best judgment” and to act “in good faith,” these terms do not pertain to the duty of loyalty imposed on a trustee. Rather, they define the required <em>standard of care </em>a trustee must use in exercising his powers. Thus, I believe that while the majority' opinion properly characterizes the broadness of the scope of a trustee’s <em>powers, </em>it does not adequately acknowledge the more constraining <em>duty </em>of absolute loyalty to the beneficiaries which must pervade any and all actions a trustee undertakes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

I do not find the omission or inclusion of such language dispositive of the intent of the trust, as the accepted tenets of the law of trusts and trustees regarding any specific trust provide that the duty of loyalty is inherent in the trust relationship itself. <em>See </em>Bogart, <em>supra, </em>§ 543, at (217-18) (emphasis added). In other words, merely by being named trustee, the trustee’s duty of complete loyalty to the beneficiaries attaches. Thus, the trustee’s actions are governed <em>first </em>and foremost by the threshold “usual fiduciary principles of a trust,” regardless of what standard of care is set forth in the trust documents.

Instead, in using the voting trusts to perpetuate his own power to vote those shares, John Warehime not only “destroy[ed] the beneficial ownership interests” by depriving the beneficiaries of their right to vote the shares themselves, but clearly put himself in a position where his own interests — keeping control of the company — impermissibly conflicted with the interests of the trust’s beneficiaries.
