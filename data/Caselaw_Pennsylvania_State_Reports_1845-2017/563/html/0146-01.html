Pursuant to their reporting obligations under Article III of the Compact, authorities in those states reported appellees’ DUI convictions to PennDOT. In accordance with the requirements of Article IV(l)(b) of the Compact, PennDOT treated appellees as if they had been convicted of violating 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a) and notified them that their Pennsylvania operating privileges <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>would be suspended for one year.

Specifically, the trial court determined that the application of Article IV of the Compact to appellees violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The trial court also determined that PennDOT’s documentation was constitutionally deficient because PennDOT’s certified records stated that appellees were convicted of violating 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a) rather than referencing the specific out-of-state statutes that furnished the basis for the underlying convictions, thereby violating appellees’ procedural due process rights. On December 31, 1997, the trial court entered an Order consolidating all of appellees’ statutory appeals for purposes of further appeal. PennDOT filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>
