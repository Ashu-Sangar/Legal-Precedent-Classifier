On August 18, 1983, John Henry Strock was driving a white Ford Grenada along Route 81 in Green Castle, Pennsylvania. Mr. Strock stopped the car on the side of the road and offered a ride to two hitchhikers, James Strong, the appellant herein, and James Alexander. According to the trial testimony of James Alexander, Alexander sat in the front seat and appellant sat in the backseat. (Trial Transcript, hereinafter “T.T.” p. 1224). Alexander testified that he promptly fell asleep. (T.T. p. 1225).</p>

(T.T. p. 1225). Appellant directed Mr. Strock to pull the car to the side of the road and exchange seats with Alexander, so that Alexander could drive the car. (T.T. p. 1226). After driving for some time, Alexander pulled the car to the side of the road along an isolated stretch of interstate 81. (T.T. p. 1227). Alexander walked into the woods a few steps in order to relieve himself. When Alexander returned to the car, appellant and Mr. Strock were not present. Alexander then heard a gunshot. Approaching the sound of the gunshot, Alexander saw that Mr. Strock had been shot and his body had fallen into a gully. Appellant was holding the shotgun. (T.T. p. 1232). Alexander asked appellant why he had shot Mr. Strock. Appellant replied that he was tired of leaving witnesses behind. (T.T. p. 1232). Appellant directed Alexander to go through Mr. Strock’s pockets. (T.T. p. 1234). Alexander complied, handing the items to appellant. Appellant then directed Alexander to shoot Mr. Strock. Alexander <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>refused and began walking back to the car when he heard another gunshot. (T.T. p. 1236).</p>

While in the custody of the New York police, Alexander agreed to cooperate with authorities and assist them in locating Mr. Strock’s body. In furtherance of this objective, Alexander waived extradition from New York to Pennsylvania and it was agreed that the authorities would bring no charges against him in the State of New York. (T.T. p. 1253). Upon returning to Pennsylvania, Alexander assisted the Pennsylvania State Police in locating the body.</p>

On December 6, 1983, Alexander’s attorney, Bruce Miller, wrote to the District Attorney of Luzerne County, Robert J. Gillespie, Jr. In that letter, Miller referenced an earlier conversation with Gillespie regarding a deal for Alexander to receive a two year jail term upon a plea to the pending murder charges. Miller wrote that in light of Alexander’s prior record and the sentencing guidelines, the court would probably reject two years. But Miller agreed that three years was appropriate “in view of the cooperation Mr. Alexander has given up to this point and will give to the Commonwealth in the future.” The second letter is dated December 12, 1983, and was written by Robert J. Gillespie, Jr. to John Mauro, the State Police Trooper in charge of the investigation of Mr. Strock’s murder. That letter forwarded the December 6th letter of Mr. Miller and stated “I believe it’s time we sit down and firmly discuss our deal with Alexander so that we can go forward.” The third letter, dated January 26, 1984, is from Attorney Miller to District Attorney Gillespie.

Alexander and appellant had each been indicted on charges of murder, kidnapping and conspiracy. The Commonwealth did not seek a joint trial of the alleged coconspirators, and in fact dropped the conspiracy charge against Alexander prior to appellant’s trial. The Commonwealth, as the letters revealed, had offered Alexander a sentence of two years on the charges of murder and kidnapping, pending information on his prior <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>record. Mr. Miller, upon receipt of the prior record information, indicated a willingness to have Alexander plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of 36 months, rather than -24 months. Ultimately, Alexander pled guilty and received a sentence of 40 months. Unlike the trial court, we do not find this additional 4 months to be a critical departure from the understanding that the parties had been discussing prior to appellant’s trial. The fact that the trial prosecutor was unaware of the negotiations between his superior and counsel for Alexander is irrelevant. As the United States Supreme Court has repeated time and again, the good faith or the bad faith of the individual prosecutor is irrelevant in determining whether or not the accused has been afforded a fair trial. <em>Giglio, </em><a href="/us/405/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="405 U.S. 150" data-case-ids="11721534" data-case-paths="/us/405/0150-01">405 U.S. at 154</a>, <a href="/us/405/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="405 U.S. 150" data-case-ids="11721534" data-case-paths="/us/405/0150-01">92 S.Ct. 763</a>.

PCRA at 576-83). When Alexander squarely and repeatedly insisted at trial that no “promises,” “agreements,” or “arrangements” for “favorable treatment” had been made in connection with the prosecution pending against him (T.T. 1253, 1303-04), the Commonwealth was under a duty to disclose the promise of consideration and fair treatment made by Gillespie. <em>Giglio v.

Alexander, however, cooperated with authorities, beginning with his assisting police in locating the victim’s body; indeed, his cooperation predated any involvement of the District Attorney’s office. Before appellant was brought to trial, District Attorney Gillespie and Alexander’s counsel engaged in plea negotiations that were memorialized to some extent in a December 6, 1983, letter from Alexander’s counsel to Gillespie. The majority characterizes this letter as referring to “an earlier conversation with Gillespie regarding a deal for Alexander to receive a two year jail term upon a plea to the pending murder charges.” Majority op. 563 Pa. at 464, 761 A.2d at 1172.

Counsel noted that, even if Alexander’s prior record score was “zero,” the mitigated minimum sentence under the guidelines would be thirty-six months. Counsel then stated that, “[previous to our discussion concerning the sentencing guidelines, you had indicated to me a sentence of two years.” Counsel further noted that he understood that the guidelines “could present a problem,” but felt that a sentence in excess of 36 months would be inappropriate in light of Alexander’s cooperation.</p>

PCRA at 592).

Cross-examination of a <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>cooperating co-defendant like Alexander, whose testimony is obviously motivated to some degree by self-interest, can be effective even where the witness has received no “deal” or “promise” in exchange for his testimony. Here, however, there was an existing promise, although a vague promise, and Alexander’s true status was not disclosed to appellant. Moreover, appellant’s efforts to impeach Alexander on grounds of expected favorable treatment from the Commonwealth were stymied when that claim was met by a denial not only from the witness but also from the trial prosecutor, an officer of the court. The jury was thus erroneously led to believe that Alexander had no personal stake in the trial’s outcome beyond a vague hope for leniency. Suggesting to the jury that a witness’s testimony was influenced by a unilateral hope for mercy is far less effective than concrete evidence that the witness was given an actual assurance of fair treatment and consideration in a case where any such consideration meant the prospect of avoiding a life sentence. Given the importance of Alexander’s testimony, and the strength of the undisclosed impeachment, I agree that a new trial is warranted.</p>
    <p id="b676-5" data-blocks='[["BL_676.4",676,[227,1367,1153,414]]]'>Not all negotiations between the prosecution and a cooperating co-defendant witness falling short of an actual agreement must be disclosed to the defense. It is only where some actual promise of favorable treatment in the witness’s own prosecution has been made, and that fact becomes material at trial, that disclosure is required. Because I am satisfied that those contingencies exist here, I concur in the mandate of a new trial.</p>

Since the letter spoke of a sentencing range short of life imprisonment, if it was referring to the murder charge, it had to be contemplating either third degree murder or a manslaughter charge. Notably, since both third degree murder and kidnapping are graded as felonies of the first degree, 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 2502(c), 2901(b), they would result in the same sentencing guideline ranges.</p>
