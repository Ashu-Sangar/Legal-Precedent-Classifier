Appellant, Lance B. Rucker, was sentenced in 1998 to life imprisonment without parole following his conviction of second degree murder, robbery, firearms violations, impersonating a public servant, and conspiracy. Whether appellant was improperly denied his choice of trial counsel is the question presented for review.</p>

Counsel was appointed to represent appellant shortly after his arrest. Following a suppression hearing, two of the codefendants pleaded guilty, and their cases were severed.

After four jurors were selected, appointed counsel informed the court that appellant wanted to switch to counsel that had, earlier that day, been privately retained by appellant’s family. Private counsel had been <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>working on appellant’s case for several months and was therefore familiar with it. Appellant had been unable to pay private counsel, however, prior to that day. Appellant explained to the court that he wanted to change to private counsel because he felt “comfortable” with him. The court denied the request. Next, appellant requested that private counsel be permitted to act as co-counsel with appointed counsel. That request was likewise denied.</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[203,694,1153,468]]]'>In denying these requests, the court noted that appointed counsel had represented appellant from the inception of this case, to wit, from the time of his arrest, through the suppression hearing, and through the selection of four jurors.
