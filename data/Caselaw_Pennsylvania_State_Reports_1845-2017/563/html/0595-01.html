      <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>The facts and somewhat convoluted procedural history underlying the instant appeal are as follows: On March 8, 1994, John Pesce, Walter Hollobaugh and Louis Pesce, employees of Pesce Metal Fabricating (PMF), were involved in a car accident while acting in the scope of their employment. The vehicle in which they were traveling, which was owned by PMF and was being operated by Louis Pesce, crossed the center line and collided with a vehicle being operated by Wilbert C. McMillen. John Pesce (the decedent) died as a result of the accident, while Walter Hollobaugh and Louis Pesce sustained non-fatal injuries. The decedent and Walter Hollobaugh were covered by individual automobile liability insurance policies. PMF was covered by an automobile liability insurance policy with Appellant Huron Insurance Company (Huron), which included underinsured motorist coverage.</p>

McMillen, Huron and their individual first party automobile insurance carriers. Each of their complaints sought a declaration of their rights with respect to the defendants, and specifically sought a declaration that the Workers’ Compensation Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> did not prohibit them from recovering underinsured benefits from Huron. Huron, PMF and Louis Pesce filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer in both actions. In the demurrers, Huron argued that the exclusivity provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act, in conjunction with relevant portions of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> in effect at the time of the accident, specifically precluded employees who had been injured in the course and scope of their employment from recovering underinsured motorist benefits from their employer’s insurer. Likewise, PMF and Louis Pesce argued in the demurrers that the Workers’ Compensation Act precluded recovery in a civil action against employers <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>and co-employees for injuries sustained in the course and scope of employment. On September 9, 1996, the trial court entered orders sustaining the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaints as to Huron, PMF and Louis Pesce. The trial court’s orders dismissing Huron, PMF and Louis Pesce from each case were docketed on September 20, 1996. No exceptions, motions for reconsideration or appeals were filed regarding them.</p>

On January 7, 1997, the decedent’s estate filed an answer and counterclaim. Three days later, on January 10, 1997, the- decedent’s estate filed a complaint to join Huron as an additional defendant in the Nationwide action based on the Superior Court’s then newly-issued decision in <em>Warner v.

By opinion and order dated October 29, 1997, the trial court denied Huron’s preliminary objections to the joinder complaint in the Nationwide declaratory judgment action. That same day, the trial court entered two separate orders, <em>sua sponte, </em>in the declaratory judgment actions filed by Hollobaugh and the decedent’s estate reversing its September 9, 1996 orders sustaining Huron’s preliminary objections. By way of explanation, the trial court’s opinion indicated that Huron’s prelimi<a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>nary objections in the nature of a demurrer were no longer valid in light of the Superior Court’s decision in <em>Warner. </em>Huron filed motions requesting reconsideration or, in the alternative, that the trial court’s orders be amended pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b) to permit immediate appeals. On November 13,1997, the trial court denied Huron’s motions for reconsideration, but granted its motions to amend its October 29, 1997 orders, thereby facilitating immediate appeals to the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b799-4" data-blocks='[["BL_799.5",799,[193,747,1153,419]]]'>Huron filed three separate Petitions for Permission to Appeal to the Superior Court from the trial court’s October 29, 1997 orders, as amended on November 13, 1997. The Superi- or Court granted all three Petitions on January 16, 1998, and later consolidated the appeals. Thereafter, on December 22, 1998, the Superior Court entered an order and memorandum opinion affirming all three of the trial court’s October 29, 1997 orders as amended on November 13,1997.</p>

There can be no disputing that Section 7532 defines any order in a declaratory judgment action that either affirmatively or negatively declares “rights, status, and other legal relations” as a final order. Thus, we must determine whether the trial court’s September 9, 1996 orders granting Huron’s preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer either affirmatively or negatively declared the rights of the parties. If the orders at issue did in fact affirmatively or negatively declare the rights of the parties, then they constituted immediately appealable final orders pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 341(b)(2). If no such declarations were made, then the orders were merely interlocutory, and the trial court retained jurisdiction to reconsider them.</p>

By granting the preliminary objections, the trial court essentially concluded that there was no legal basis upon which Hollobaugh or the decedent’s estate could recover underinsured motorist benefits from Huron.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> In so doing, the trial court effectively declared the legal rights of the parties, notwithstanding Appellees’ assertions to the contrary.

The Superior Court noted that by reading such a requirement into the above-quoted statutory language, possible confusion over the appealability of such orders would be avoided because declaratory judgment orders not identifying themselves as such would not be considered <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>final orders for purposes of Pa.R.A.P. 341(b)(2). However, the plain language of Section 7532 does not support the Superior Court’s expansive interpretation of its terms, and the rules of statutory construction do not permit courts to ignore the plain and unambiguous language of a statute in a supposed pursuit of either its spirit or an unstated legislative intent. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). The language quoted by the Superior Court from Section 7532, given its plain meaning, does not impose any specific requirements on courts seeking to enter declaratory judgment orders. Rather, it affords the courts broad discretion in crafting declaratory judgment orders by permitting such orders to be either affirmative or negative in form and effect. By way of illustration, the trial court’s September 9, 1996 orders were affirmative in form, sustaining Huron’s preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, and therefore dismissing the complaints as to Huron. However, the trial court’s orders were decidedly negative in effect, because they declared the rights and duties of the parties under the law adversely to Appellees, the parties originally seeking an affirmative declaration of their rights. That is, the trial court’s orders effectively declared that Hollobaugh and decedent’s estate had no legal basis upon which to claim underinsured motorist benefits from Huron, and thereby negatively declared their rights.</p>
    <p id="b802-5" data-blocks='[["BL_802.4",802,[231,1607,1155,583]]]'>Section 7532 simply states that an order in a declaratory judgment action that either affirmatively or negatively declares the rights and duties of the parties constitutes a final order. As the above discussion explains, that is exactly what the trial court’s September 9, 1996 orders did. Therefore, the trial court’s orders constituted final orders pursuant to Pa. R.A.P. 341(b)(2), and the trial court was without jurisdiction to reconsider them more than thirty days after their entry. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5505. Accordingly, we reverse the orders of the Superior Court affirming the trial court’s October 29, 1997 orders as amended on November 13,1997.</p>

    <p id="b803-4" data-blocks='[["BL_803.6",803,[198,347,1158,1556]]]'>In this appeal, the majority adopts a reasonable, plain-meaning construction of Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 341(b)(2) as it relates to the Declaratory Judgments Act, and its reasoning appears to follow from the Court’s prior decision in <em>General Accident Ins. Co. of Am. v. Allen, </em><a href="/pa/547/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="547 Pa. 693" data-case-ids="468736" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0693-01">547 Pa. 693</a>, 706-07, <a href="/a2d/692/1089-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="692 A.2d 1089" data-case-ids="11919873,468736" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1089-01,/pa/547/0693-01">692 A.2d 1089</a>, 1095 (1997). Nevertheless, since the opinion ultimately rests upon an interpretation of the intention of the General Assembly, I am troubled by the absence of any express indication within the Declaratory Judgments Act to the effect that the Legislature wished to alter the usual rules of appealability in the context of declaratory judgment proceedings, as has been included within other enactments when the purpose is as such. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 7320 (providing explicitly that appeals may be taken from various interlocutory orders, such as an order denying an application to compel arbitration). Moreover, the primary and direct purpose of the Declaratory Judgments Act, a version of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, was to authorize courts to grant declaratory relief in the face of objections that such relief represented the giving of advisory opinions rather than the adjudication of controversies. <em>See generally Petition of Ranker, </em><a href="/pa/284/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="284 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1092095" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0455-01">284 Pa. 455</a>, 463, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.%20265" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="131 A. 265">131 A. 265</a>, 268 (1925). As the language of Section 7532 pertaining to the finality of “the declaration” is essential to this central purpose, I would read such language as aligning declaratory judgment jurisprudence with that which applies to civil actions generally, rather than as creating a separate and unique scheme for the appeal of otherwise interlocutory orders in declaratory judgment proceedings.</p>
