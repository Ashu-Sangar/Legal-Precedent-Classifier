Section 1705-B. The board of control assumes all powers and duties conferred by law upon the board of school directors except that it may not levy taxes.

Instead, the mayor of the coterminous city, i.e., Harrisburg, appoints a five-member board which serves at the mayor’s pleasure. Also, the mayor, rather than the district, appoints an “education empowerment team” to develop a plan to improve the performance of the district. The department is not required to appoint an academic advisory team to assist the “empowerment” team in developing the improvement plan. Section 1707-B districts, therefore, are treated quite differently from other districts in that other districts are subject to state input and ultimately, state control if their improvement plans are not realized, whereas Section 1707-B districts are immediately placed under the control of the mayor of Harrisburg.</p>

This argument is without merit, for the statute authorizing the location of the capital specifies that there be only one capital city, Act of Feb. 21, 1810, PL 30 § 1. There can, therefore, be no more than one member of the class. Commonwealth Court was correct, therefore, in determining that the Reed Amendment is constitutionally infirm.</p>
