      <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>On May 26, 1995, at approximately 12:40 a.m., a uniformed officer of the Upper Allen Township Police Department was on routine patrol in a marked vehicle, traveling on Fisher Road in a rural area, when he saw a car parked at the side of the road, alongside the lawn in front of a farmhouse and barn. Standing about fifteen feet from the parked car were two men who appeared to be urinating. The officer pulled in behind the parked car with the intent, as he explained at the suppression hearing, to ascertain what was happening and whether anything was wrong. He stepped out of his vehicle and approached the individuals, noticing, as he passed their car, that it contained a cooler containing unopened beer cans. When the officer asked the men what they were doing, they replied that they were coming from the races at the Williams Grove Speedway and had stopped to urinate. The officer asked to see their driver’s licenses, which they produced, and returned to his vehicle to check on the validity of the licenses and to determine whether there were outstanding warrants for either of the men. As he was conducting the license check, a fellow officer arrived and parked his vehicle behind the patrol car. After verifying that the licenses were valid and that there were no warrants for either of the two men, the officer stepped back out of his cruiser; called defendant/appellant Brett Strickler (the owner and operator of the parked car) over to him; returned Strickler’s driver’s license to him; advised him that it was not appropriate to stop along the road and urinate on someone else’s property; thanked him for his cooperation; and began walking toward his cruiser. At that point, he later testified, Strickler was free to go, although there is no evidence that he informed Strickler of that fact.</p>

When Strickler answered that he did not, the officer then asked him “if he wouldn’t mind if I took a look through his car.” As the officer testified at the suppression hearing, he had no reason to suspect Strickler of having any form of contraband in the car. Nevertheless, his reason for request<a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>ing Strickler’s consent to search was “[t]o see if there was anything illegal in his car.” In response to the request,</p>

The suppression court conducted a hearing, at which the Commonwealth elicited the testimony of the arresting officer, and Striekler presented no witnesses or other evidence. At hearing, the court expressed reservations about relying upon any admonition by the officer concerning the voluntariness of the consent. N.T., Nov. 2, 1995, at 18 (stating that “[w]hen an officer asks somebody, you know, to do something, they don’t — I don’t expect the Defendant to be familiar with Constitutional law or something[;] [u]sually when an officer asks you something, this idea that well, he didn’t have to, that’s really meaningless to a large extent”). The court subsequently granted the suppression remedy, finding the case analogous to <em>Commonwealth v. Lopez, </em><a href="/pa-super/415/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="415 Pa.

The suppression court determined that the officer’s initial detention of Striekler and his companion to ascertain what they were doing had been proper, but the subsequent request to search the car, coming as it did after the purpose of <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>such detention had been accomplished, was illegal as it was not based on reasonable suspicion or probable cause.

Acknowledging that the Upper Allen Township police officer had not informed Strickler that he was free to go, the Superior Court reasoned that the officer’s actions preceding the request for consent to search had nevertheless clearly communicated to Strickler that the traffic stop, and therefore Strickler’s detention, had ended. The Superior Court’s assessment entailed a broader evaluation of the relevant circumstances, proceeding as follows:</p>

Deputy Newsome proceeded to: obtain Robinette’s driver’s license; perform a computer check of Robinette’s driving record (which indicated no violations); ask Robinette to step out of his vehicle; direct Robinette to stand in a particular location; activate a mounted video camera; issue a verbal traffic warning; and return Robinette’s license. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%20695" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="653 N.E.2d 695">id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%20695" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="653 N.E.2d 695">at 696</a>. Deputy Newsome then asked: “One question before you get gone: are you carrying any illegal contraband in your car? Any weapons of any kind, drugs, anything like that?” When Robinette said that he was not, the officer asked: “Would you mind if I search your car? Make sure there’s nothing in there?” Robinette lent his consent to the search, which revealed a methamphetamine pill and a small amount of marijuana, and was arrested and charged with criminal offenses entailing possession of illegal drugs. Robinette sought to suppress the evidence obtained in the search; following denial of his motion, he pled no contest and was found guilty. The Ohio Court of Appeals, however, reversed the conviction, and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed in a four-to-three decision. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%20695" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="653 N.E.2d 695">id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%20695" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="653 N.E.2d 695">at 699</a>.</p>

Since there was no appreciable lapse of time between the detention and the request to search, the deputy sheriff prefaced his request with the phrase “before you get gone,” and it discerned no circumstances which might have served to break or weaken the effect of the prior detention, the court deemed Robinette’s consent to have resulted from the illegal detention. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%20695" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="653 N.E.2d 695">id.</a> </em>(concluding that, “[gjiven the circumstances, Robinette felt that he had no choice but to comply”).</p>

Moreover, as noted by Justices Stevens and Ginsburg, the <em>Robinette I </em>court, the <em>Robinette III </em>court, other courts and numerous commentators, this coercive effect is not necessarily entirely dispelled merely because a law enforcement officer returns the citizen’s driver’s documentation or otherwise accomplishes the purpose of the detention.

Reciprocally, law enforcement officers can tailor their conduct in ways that will assist trial and appellate courts in the performance of their essential functions, with the corollary benefit of enhancing consistency and predictability of results in judicial proceedings. Toward both ends, we reiterate that, in evaluating a consensual encounter that follows a traffic or similar stop, a central consideration will be whether the objective circumstances would demonstrate to a reasonable citizen that he is no longer subject to domination by police. The presence of an express admonition to the effect that the citizen-subject is free to depart is a potent, objective factor that favors such conclusion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_24" id="ref_footnote_1_24">24</a> As this Court stated in <em>Jones, </em>“while not required to do so, an officer who wishes to approach a citizen to investigate crime but who does not wish to ‘stop’ that citizen, can best predict the consequences of his behavior by advising the citizen he is free to leave without answering questions.” <em>Jones, </em>474 Pa. at 373 n. 7, 378 A.2d at 840 n. 7. This observation is even more appropriate in the context of a post-detention interaction. <em>See generally Ferris, </em>735 A.2d at 504 (citing cases for the proposition that “the failure by law enforcement to inform a citizen that he or she is free to terminate the encounter is a significant factor suggesting a continued seizure under the Fourth Amendment”); <em>Robinette III, </em><a href="/citations/?q=685%20N.E.2d%20762" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="685 N.E.2d 762">685 N.E.2d at </a>771 n. 6 (“[i]f police wish to pursue a policy of searching vehicles without probable cause or reasonably articulable facts, the police should ensure that the detainee knows that he or she is free to refuse consent despite the <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>officer’s request to search or risk that any fruits of any such search might be suppressed”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">25</a>

Also enhancing the coercive aspects to a degree are the temporal and geographic elements of the interaction. As Strickler recounts, “[i]t was late at night, [he] was not from the area, and there were two police officers with marked patrol cars with flashing lights standing three to four feet away from [him].” <em>See generally Ferris, </em>735 A.2d at 505 (indicating that such factors would have been unsettling to a reasonable person in the defendant’s position).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_26" id="ref_footnote_1_26">26</a> Looking more closely at the character of the prior seizure, however, it is significant that the officer’s conduct appears to have been quite restrained throughout the period of the detention; indeed, the level of coercion that was applied was less than that associated with an ordinary traffic stop. In the first instance, it was not necessary to stop Strickler at all, since he was already out of his vehicle. Although the officer <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>asked Strickler to come over to him, this directive was issued in the initial stages of the detention, <em>cf. Freeman, </em>563 Pa. at 89, 757 A.2d at 906, and entailed a lesser degree of intrusion than that involved in requiring a driver to step from his vehicle during a traffic stop. As the Superior Court stressed, there are a number of other factors involving a demonstrative exercise of police authority that are absent from the present case. There is no evidence of a show of weapons, unusual commands, aggressive behavior or any use of language or tone by the officer that was not commensurate with the circumstances. Although a second officer was present for part of the encounter, the evidence suggests that he was not an active participant. Thus, overall, the arresting officer operated well within the boundaries of a typical traffic stop/investigative detention.</p>
    <p id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[235,1069,1156,740]]]'>Further, although the officer did not expressly advise Strickler and his companion that they were free to leave, his actions at least suggested as much, in that he returned Strickler’s driver’s documentation, thanked him for his cooperation, and turned away prior to reinitiating the interaction and ultimately requesting consent to search. <em>See generally United States v. McKneely, </em><a href="/f3d/6/1447-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="6 F.3d 1447" data-case-ids="10515461" data-case-paths="/f3d/6/1447-01">6 F.3d 1447</a>, 1451 (10 th Cir.l993)(referencing the “clear line historically drawn between police-citizen encounters which occur before and after an officer returns a ... driver’s documentation”).

Strickler's suggestion that flashing lights from the nearby police cruiser added to the unsettling effect is not supported in the record.

At oral argument, counsel advancing the lead issue in this and several consolidated cases requested that this Court take judicial notice that police employ tactics such as consent searches on a selective, discriminatory basis against members of protected classes, primarily on Pennsylvania interstate highways used as conduits by traffickers of illegal drugs. Preliminarily, such arguments would appear to be better framed under the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses, or addressed to our supervisory powers, than asserted as a basis for a modified construct for determining whether a seizure has occurred in <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>the first instance, or the voluntariness of consent. As important, courts are ill-suited to render pronouncements concerning such claims absent a full evidentiary record. While counsel’s assertions, if proven, would certainly merit this Court’s attention, as counsel acknowledged, the assertion of such discriminatory conduct finds no support in the record of any of the consolidated cases. <em>Cf. generally State v.

When the officer returned Striekler’s license and registration and issued him a warning, he no longer had a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot (i.e., a justification to continue the stop). Nevertheless, the officer proceeded to question Strickler, asking him whether he had anything illegal in his vehicle, and ultimately obtained consent to search the vehicle. In my view, any reasonable individual in Strickler’s position would not have felt free to go when the officer turned around and asked whether he had anything illegal in his vehicle.
