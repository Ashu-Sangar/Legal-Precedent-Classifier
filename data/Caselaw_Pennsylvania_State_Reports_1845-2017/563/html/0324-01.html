Specifically, the court found that the provision impermissibly sets up the presumption that the offender is a high risk dangerous offender, then places the burden of proof on the offender to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. The court likened the scheme set forth in Section 9714 to that of the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9791-9799.6, which, at the time of sentencing, the Superior Court had found to be unconstitutional in <em>Commonwealth v. Halye, </em><a href="/a2d/719/0763-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="719 A.2d 763" data-case-ids="11682075" data-case-paths="/a2d/719/0763-01">719 A.2d 763</a> (Pa.Super.1999).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, the court concluded that Section 9714 violated Appellee’s procedural due process rights pursuant to both the state and federal constitutions since, in the court’s view, the burden of demonstrating that an offender is a high risk dangerous offender must rest with the Commonwealth.</p>

Specifically, the Commonwealth notes various differences between Section 9714 and the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act, which, in its view, make the two distinguishable. The Commonwealth points out that this Court found the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act to be unconstitutional because it required the trial court to make a subjective determination of whether the offender was a “sexually violent predator,” but did not require the prosecu<a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>tion to demonstrate this fact; rather, the Act placed the burden on the offender to disprove his or her status as a sexually violent predator. The Commonwealth further notes that our Court concluded in <em>Williams </em>that because the question of whether an offender was a sexually violent predator was not “a straightforward issue susceptible of objective proof’ where the “risk of error was slight,” the risk of error, and thus any burden of proof, must be borne by the prosecution. Appellant’s brief at 14, citing <em>Williams, </em>733 A.2d at 607.</p>
    <p id="b527-5" data-blocks='[["BL_527.4",527,[230,742,1154,664]]]'>Conversely, the Commonwealth notes that Section 9714 is different from the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act in that it places upon the Commonwealth the initial burden of demonstrating that the offender was convicted of a “crime of violence” within the past seven years before the questioned presumption becomes applicable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Commonwealth further notes that the existence of the required prior offense is a straightforward issue susceptible of objective proof and the risk of error in making this finding is slight. Thus, the Commonwealth maintains that Section 9714 comports with due process since the prosecution must prove by a preponderance of the evidence any aggravating factors that require a harsher sentence.</p>
    <p id="b527-6" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[232,1436,1153,622]]]'>Appellee counters that the determination of whether a defendant is a high risk dangerous offender is made under the statute without requiring the Commonwealth to prove the case-specific factors relating to high risk dangerous offenders. This, Appellee maintains, violates due process. Appellee argues that the ultimate judicial determination of whether an offender is a high risk dangerous offender is neither straightforward nor susceptible of objective proof as it requires the court to apply a list of disparate factors in making its assessment. Additionally, the Appellee points out that many of the case specific factors listed in Section 9714 are the same factors listed in the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

      <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>At the outset we note that in both Section 9714 and the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act the legislature has attempted to shift the burden onto an offender to prove that he or she does not fall into a legislatively presumed category of offenders based upon some predicate circumstance. In the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act, all persons convicted of certain predicate acts were required to disprove their status of being a sexually violent predator. Likewise, pursuant to Section 9714, all persons convicted of certain predicate crimes of violence, who were also convicted of another crime of violence within seven years, must disprove their status as a highly dangerous offender. Thus, in both instances, the legislature has made a determination that although certain offenders meet the predicate criteria they might not, in fact, fall into the legislatively proscribed category, i.e., sexually violent predator or highly dangerous offender, which will subject them to greater punishment. The burden of demonstrating whether this presumption should continue, in both instances, rests with the offender. Both provisions list subjective case specific criteria that the trial court is to use in evaluating whether the offender is, in fact, a sexually violent predator or. highly dangerous offender.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

As noted, the Board in making its assessment considers a variety of elements in reaching its determination regarding whether an offender is a sexually violent predator. Additionally, just as in <em>Vemiero, </em>the evidence that could be presented at the sexually violent predator proceeding may not have been presented at trial and will largely consist of the testimony of the offender and the victim. Resolution of issues regarding the evidence presented at the proceeding are not subject to the rules of evidence according to the Act and the court is under a time restriction to conduct that proceeding. Accordingly, the risk of an error at a sexually violent predator proceeding is far greater than was present in <em>Wright/McMillan.</em>

The fact that in the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act conviction of the predicate crime triggered the presumption and here proof that the offender committed a prior crime of violence within seven years triggers the presumption is really a distinction without a difference.
