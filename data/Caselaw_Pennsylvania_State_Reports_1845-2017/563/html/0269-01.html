Appellant told Maldonado that he was wanted on a homicide charge in Schuylkill County and that his gun was dropping them like flies. After leaving Maldonado, and sometime before 4:00 p.m., appellant abducted the elderly Betty <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>Amstutz at or near her home in Harrisburg.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Over the next few hours, appellant drove to various places with Ms. Amstutz being held hostage, obtaining money, clothing, and lodging by use of her credit card and checking account. Thus, at 3:59 p.m. a bank employee in Harrisburg, cashed a $500 check for Ms. Amstutz, who was accompanied by appellant. A bank security camera filmed the transaction. At approximately 5 p.m. an employee of a sporting goods store in Cumberland County, sold appellant and Ms. Amstutz $262.05 worth of Orlando Magic products, which were purchased with a credit card belonging to Ms. Amstutz. At 5:26 p.m. an employee of a Camp Hill bank, cashed another check in the amount of $1,139.95 for appellant and Ms. Amstutz. A bank security camera filmed that transaction as well. Finally, at 6:04 p.m., Ms. Amstutz and appellant checked into the Knight’s Inn in Carlisle, Pennsylvania using Ms. Amstutz’s credit card. Shortly thereafter, at approximately 6:30 p.m. a woman and her daughter were driving on McClures Gap Road in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where they saw a white male standing near a car matching the description of the vehicle owned by Ms. Amstutz.

    <p id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[227,388,1158,1232]]]'>Appellant’s claim is without merit. Indeed, this Court recently rejected a substantially similar claim in <em>Spotz II. </em>As was noted there, § 110’s compulsory joinder rule was designed to serve two distinct policy considerations: (1) to protect a person accused of crimes from governmental harassment by being forced to undergo successive trials for offenses stemming from the same criminal episode, and (2) to ensure judicial economy. <em>Spotz II, supra, </em>at 1157; <em>Commonwealth v.

Section 110(l)(ii) will only bar a prosecution if: (1) the former prosecution resulted in an acquittal or a conviction; (2) the instant prosecution is based on the same criminal conduct or arose from the same criminal episode as the former prosecution; (3) the prosecutor was aware of the instant charges before the commencement of the trials on the former charges; and (4) the instant charges and the former charges were within the jurisdiction of a single court. <em>Spotz II, supra, </em>at 1157; <em>Commonwealth v.

The mere fact that certain evidence of appellant’s other crimes was relevant and admissible in this prosecution does not mean that the four killings must be deemed part of a single criminal episode. Other crimes evidence may be admissible for a variety of evidentiary purposes. Here, the evidence was relevant to establish motive, <em>ie., </em>appellant’s need to escape after the previous killings, his intent, his identity as the killer, and to establish the sequence of events leading up to the <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>murder of Ms. Amstutz. These limited evidentiary purposes of the relevant evidence stand in contrast to the purposes for which portions of the evidence were introduced in the separate prosecutions for each of the killings, where the relevant evidence constituted direct evidence of appellant’s guilt. <em>See Spotz II, supra, </em>at 1158.</p>
    <p id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.4",477,[203,583,1154,1006]]]'>However, the mere fact that the prior killings were admissible here for limited purposes does not alter their essentially independent nature. The killings involved four different victims, committed in four counties, occurring on different days, and generating four separate criminal investigations. The first killing occurred on January 81, 1995, in Clearfield County, when appellant killed his brother during a family argument. The second killing occurred on February 1, 1995, in Schuylkill County, where appellant, after fleeing Clearfield County, abducted June Ohlinger, stole her car and murdered her. Following that murder, appellant and Noland fled to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. They returned to York County, Pennsylvania, on February 2, 1995, where they abducted Penny Gunnet, stole her car and appellant ultimately murdered her. After murdering Ms. Gunnet, appellant fled to Harrisburg, without Noland, abducted Ms. Amstutz, stole her car, used her to get money and lodging from the victim, and then killed her. The killings are logically connected primarily by the fact that appellant committed all four of them.</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth called numerous witnesses to establish that appellant was seen with Ms. Amstutz prior to her murder, that a man matching appellant’s description was seen standing near a vehicle matching Ms. Amstutz’s at the location where her dead body was later found, and that appellant was staying at the Knight’s Inn. Moreover, an investigation unique to this killing was conducted by local law enforcement officials, which resulted in testimony from different investigating officers and authorities. What this Court noted in <em>Spotz II </em>is equally applicable here: <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>this is not a case in which the Commonwealth relied solely upon the same witness(es) to prove each of the killings.

Under the current state of the law, I am compelled to agree with the majority that the trial court did not err in failing to issue a <em>Simmons </em>instruction in the instant case, as Appellant did not request such an instruction nor did the Commonwealth raise the issue of Appellant’s future dangerousness. However, for the reasons more fully explained in my concurring opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Clark, </em><a href="/pa/551/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="551 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="507821" data-case-paths="/pa/551/0258-01">551 Pa. 258</a>, <a href="/a2d/710/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="710 A.2d 31" data-case-ids="11827068,507821" data-case-paths="/a2d/710/0031-01,/pa/551/0258-01">710 A.2d 31</a>, 43-44 (1998), I continue to believe that the better approach would be to give a standardized <em>Simmons </em>instruction in all capital cases.</p>
