Laubach received workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to a notice of compensation payable. He was not released to <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>return to his pre-injury job, but was able to work at a modified job when he returned to Bethlehem Steel on January 28, 1993. During various periods of time thereafter, Laubach either received benefits for partial disability or his benefits were suspended because his earnings equaled or exceeded his average weekly wage.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[230,592,1155,418]]]'>Laubach continued to work in a light duty capacity until he was laid off by Bethlehem Steel on December 10, 1995. The layoff resulted from the closing of the plant where Laubach was employed. Bethlehem Steel continued to operate other facilities, but no other employment was offered to Laubach. Bethlehem Steel continued to pay partial disability benefits to Laubach after the layoff, but refused to reinstate total disability benefits.</p>
    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[229,1037,1155,366]]]'>On February 15, 1996, Laubach filed a penalty petition alleging that Bethlehem Steel had refused to reinstate his full benefits. Bethlehem Steel subsequently filed a petition to modify or suspend benefits alleging that Laubach had returned to work in a light duty capacity for the period from June 25, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at varying rates of partial disability.</p>
    <p id="b514-6" data-blocks='[["BL_514.6",514,[227,1431,1156,573]]]'>Following a hearing, the workers’ compensation judge granted Bethlehem Steel’s petition to modify or suspend benefits during the six-month period before the layoff. The WCJ treated Laubach’s penalty petition as a petition for reinstatement of temporary total disability benefits and granted reinstatement. The WCJ found that Laubach had sustained his burden of proving that he was entitled to reinstatement of benefits because he was returned to work in a light duty capacity, rather than to his pre-injury job, and was laid off for economic purposes. The Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the WCJ’s decision.</p>
    <p id="b514-7" data-blocks='[["BL_514.7",514,[224,2040,1152,248]],["BL_515.1",515,[212,244,1152,801]]]'>Bethlehem Steel appealed from the Board’s order, asserting that the WCJ erred in reinstating total disability benefits where there was no evidence of any change in Laubach’s earning power and he was laid off for economic reasons. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board’s order. The court <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>reasoned that where a claimant returns to work under a suspension of benefits with restrictions and is subsequently-laid off, the claimant is entitled to the presumption that the disability, i.e. the loss of earning power, is causally related to the continuing work injury. Because Laubach had not been released to return to his pre-injury job and was assigned to light duty work before the layoff, the court found that he was entitled to the presumption that his loss of earning power was causally related to his work-related injury. In order to rebut the presumption, Bethlehem Steel was required to demonstrate that there was available work within Laubach’s physical restrictions or establish that his current disability was not due to his work-related injury. The court determined that, in the absence of such evidence, the WCJ did not err in reinstating total disability benefits.</p>
    <p id="b515-4" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[211,1086,1157,798]]]'>We granted Bethlehem Steel’s petition for allowance of appeal to address the claimant’s burden of proof for reinstatement of benefits when the claimant has returned to work in a modified position and is subsequently laid off.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Bethlehem Steel acknowledges that when a claimant is receiving partial disability benefits, or his workers’ compensation benefits are suspended, a presumption exists that the claimant’s loss of earning power is causally related to his work injury. Bethlehem Steel asserts, however, that the presumption does not eliminate a requirement that the claimant demonstrate a causal relationship between the work injury and a subsequent reduction in earnings. An employer would then have the opportunity to establish that a claimant’s loss in earnings, as opposed to earning power, is attributable to factors other than the work injury.</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.6",515,[213,1913,1152,149]],["BL_516.1",516,[229,250,1151,304]]]'>Bethlehem Steel argues that Laubach’s earning power did not change when he was laid off because his physical condition did not change. The increased loss of earnings is attributed <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>simply to the layoff because the physical disability remained the same. Bethlehem Steel contends that a claimant, who has not fully recovered from a work-related injury and has returned to work in a modified job, is not entitled to total disability benefits when the claimant is laid off for economic reasons.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[224,588,1156,853]]]'>Laubach argues that where a claimant is restricted to light duty work due to a work-related injury, it is the responsibility of the employer to show available work within the claimant’s physical limitations. In the absence of such evidence, the claimant is eligible for total disability benefits. Where the claimant is laid off from light duty work, the only burden of proof placed upon the claimant is to show that the lay off was caused by no fault of his own and his earning power continues to be affected by the work-related injury. Laubach states that he was put into the job market with a significant detriment to his earning capacity, a restricted ability to work, because of his work-related injury, and the fact that the plant was closed does not suffice to overcome the presumption that his loss of earnings continues to be related to the work-related injury. For the following reasons, we find that the WCJ did not err in awarding total disability benefits to Laubach.</p>

First, it is presumed because the causal connection between the original work-related injury and disability was initially either not contested by the employer or established by competent proof by the employee at the time of the original disability claim. Second, it is presumed because with a mere suspension of benefits, there is no contention by any party that the liability of the employer has terminated. The only fact established at a suspension of benefits is that the earning power of a claimant has improved to a point where benefits are no longer necessary. Since the disability continues to exist, the liability of the employer for the injury has not terminated. Therefore, in these situations the causal connection between the original work-related injury and the disability goes unquestioned.</blockquote>

Here, with respect to Laubach’s initial return to work in the modified-duty position, it is undisputed that Bethlehem Steel satisfied the first two <em>Kachinski </em>steps. It is equally undisputed that Laubach satisfied the third step as he applied for, was hired for, and continued to work in the modified-duty job until the position was eliminated and he was laid off after less than three years on the job. The layoff was due to no fault of Laubach and he can therefore be said to have continually demonstrated the good faith effort required by step three. Because step two requires that Bethlehem Steel produce a job that is both actually available and tailored to the claimant’s abilities, the elimination of Laubach’s modified-duty position, therefore, puts Bethlehem Steel back at step two. It is then Bethlehem Steel’s burden to make new job referrals to Laubach in order to shift the burden back to Laubach to make a good faith effort to follow up on the referral(s). Then, pursuant to step four, if the referral(s) does not result in a new job for Laubach, he would continue to receive total disability benefits.</p>

      <em>Kachinski </em>is clear that an employer seeking to modify an injured employee’s benefits must show two things: change in medical condition and actual availability of a suitable job. Thus, absent a revisit to step one, and a showing of further recovery from the work-related injury, Bethlehem Steel is married to the medical determination made at the initial modification hearing that there has been some medical improvement in Laubach’s work-related injury. Therefore, Laubach would not be required to return to pre-injury duties. Rather, he would be cleared only for modified duty consistent with his residual incapacity. It is then, pursuant to step two of <em>Kachinski, </em>incumbent on Bethlehem Steel to show that actual suitable work is available consistent with Laubach’s <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>medical condition. If there is no such showing, then Laubach is entitled to total disability benefits under <em>Kachinski.</em>

Nonetheless, as there are likely to be endless variations on the theme of burden-shifting in the context of benefit modification fact patterns, I believe that employers and employees alike would do well to look first to <em>Kachinski </em>which provides an accessible roadmap for these types of cases.</p>
