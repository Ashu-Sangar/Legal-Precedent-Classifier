At that time, the trial court arrested judgment on the following four counts: statutory sexual assault, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3122.1, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3123(a)(7), aggravated indecent assault, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3125(8), and indecent assault, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2126(a)(8). The court did so based upon its conclusion that these provisions violate the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions because the provisions criminalize sexual assaults where the victim is less than 16 years old and the offender is four or more years older than the victim. Specifically, the court held that while “the Commonwealth has a clear interest in enacting laws designed to protect children and minors below a certain age ... there is no rational reason to differentiate among defendants based upon their age.” Trial court opinion at 5. Thus, the court only sentenced Appellee on the remaining counts. The Commonwealth then filed a direct appeal to this Court, challenging the trial court’s finding that the four provisions are unconstitutional.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The Legislature was faced with the reality that sexual relations among teenagers occurs. In addition, the Legislature recognized the seriousness of the problems associated with teenage sexual behavior and crafted four statutes that criminalize sexual contact between children under 16 and significantly older teenagers and adults. The Commonwealth submits that the Legislature properly recognized that unfair advantages of more mature individuals allow them the ability to take advantage of younger less experienced children. The onus of sexual responsibility must be placed on the older more mature individual in the relationship. Consent is not an issue. The physical and psychological protection of young children is at issue. But at the same time, the Legislature was cognizant of the fact that there is an overlapping in social crowds between younger teenagers under 16 years of age and older teenagers over 16 years of age that should not warrant immediate criminalization of sexual contact between them.</blockquote>
