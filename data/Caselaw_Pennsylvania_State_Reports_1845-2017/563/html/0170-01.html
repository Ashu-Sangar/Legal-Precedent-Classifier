The mining activities at the Cambria site encompassed an area in the Upper and Lower Kittaning coal seams beneath the watersheds of Roaring Run, Howells Run and the North Branch of the Little Conemaugh River.</p>
    <p id="b371-7" data-blocks='[["BL_371.6",371,[233,1232,1152,584]]]'>A resident of the Roaring Run area complained to DEP in July of 1983 that Bethenergy’s mining activities had resulted in a loss of water flow in the Roaring Run watershed. In response, DEP sent a hydrogeologist and a geologist trainee to investigate the Roaring Run watershed to determine whether there was any correlation between Bethenergy’s mining activities and the complained of flow loss. While DEP was unable to draw any conclusions from this initial investigation, it followed up by sending a surface mining inspector to study the area in August of 1985. The surface mining inspector observed that various portions of Roaring Run were dry.</p>

In response to yet another complaint filed by the resident with the DEP in June of 1986, the hydrogeologist returned to the site to conduct further investigation. At this juncture, he observed that two sections of Roaring Run had no visible flow, while another portion had become dryer than it was in November of 1985. As a result, the hydrogeologist recommended that DEP thoroughly investigate the area and, by 1989, DEP had undertaken a full investigation of the Roaring Run watershed.</p>

According to DEP, Subsection 5(g) empowers the Board to award attorney’s fees and costs only in proceedings under Section 5, which involves the permitting and bonding requirements of the Act, not in an enforcement action. Moreover, DEP proffers that its misguided reliance on Subsection 5(e) in the Compliance Order does not serve to authorize the Board to award fees and costs in this enforcement action. Finally, DEP contends that the decision of the Commonwealth Court in the present matter is contrary to its previous decision in <em>McDonald Land &amp; Mining Co. v. Department of Envtl. Resources, </em><a href="/a2d/664/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="664 A.2d 194" data-case-ids="7863502" data-case-paths="/a2d/664/0194-01">664 A.2d 194</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.1995).</p>

According to Bethenergy, because DEP’s position, as evidenced by its citation to Subsection 5(e) in the Compliance Order, was that this subsection imposed post-permit obligations on Bethenergy, its defense of the Compliance Order qualified as proceedings pursuant to Section 5.

In particular, Subsection 5(e) requires that mine operators adopt protective measures to guarantee the stability of their mines and to prevent material damage to the land and structures on the surface. Additionally, Subsection 5(e) mandates that as part of their permit applications, mine operators must describe the protective measures they will undertake.

I am not as troubled, however, as the majority by the Department’s compliance-order references to Section 5(e) of the Act, 52 P.S. § 1406.5(e), establishing the requirement for Bethenergy’s subsidence control plan (also referenced, described and relied upon by the Department as a basis for its action), which was a necessary point of reference from which to evaluate Bethenergy’s compliance. Moreover, I question whether the vesting of authority in the Environmental Hearing Board to make a discretionary award of attorneys’ fees in <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>Section 5(g) was ever in the first instance intended by the General Assembly as a basis for awarding monetary relief against the Department related to its essential performance of its statutory role in permitting and bonding matters. Resolution of such question would necessarily entail consideration of the Commonwealth’s sovereign immunity in connection with construction of Section 5 of the Act, and whether there is an express, applicable waiver to be found within the Act’s provisions. Given the Court’s holding that Section 5(g) is not implicated in the first instance, such issue need not be resolved in the present appeal — I write merely to make my reservation express.</p>

Second, DEP may bring an enforcement proceeding in the courts, seeking an injunction to prevent a violation of the Act, and to otherwise provide for its enforcement. 52 P.S. § 1406.13.

The department shall have the authority to order the immediate cessation of any operation that is being conducted without a permit, as required by this act, or in any case where safety regulations are being violated or in any case where the public welfare or safety calls for the immediate cessation of the operation until corrective steps have been started by the operator to the satisfaction of the department.</blockquote>

Only in situations where the mine is being operated without a permit, or where violations of regulations call for the immediate cessation of operation to ensure public safety does section 1406.9 authorize the issuance of an order halting operations.

Yet, the order, in addition to listing the alleged violations under section 5(e), goes on to describe the remedial actions being ordered by DEP. The remedial portion of DEP’s order required Bethenergy to stop mining in certain geographical areas. Additionally, in various other geographical areas Bethenergy was ordered to stop mining until it submitted a remedial plan for restoration of the value of an affected stream; demonstrated to DEP’s satisfaction that a supported area would meet certain safety factor requirements; implemented a monitoring program; modified its subsidence control plan and six month maps; demonstrated that the mining is not having an effect on an above ground water supply; revised its subsidence control plan; revised its six month mining maps; and submitted various hydrogeological, geological, and biological analyses. These remedial measures track the permit requirements of section 1406 <em>et seq. </em>In fact, 52 P.S. § 1406.5, which is titled “Permit; application; map or plan; bond or other security; filing; general rulemaking authority; prevention of damage; mine stability; maintenance of use and value of lands,” describes the maps, surveys and studies required in order to obtain a permit. In essence, DEP’s order listed requirements that Bethenergy was to meet or risk losing its permits. While the majority concludes that the Commonwealth Court and the Environmental Hearing Board elevated form over substance, I would find that the adjudications below correctly ascertained that in this case, form and procedural process properly followed substance. Therefore, I would hold that the Environmental Hearing Board was acting within the <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>authority prescribed by the Act when it awarded fees and costs to Bethenergy.</p>
