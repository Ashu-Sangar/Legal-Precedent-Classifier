Minteer was an employee,' or an independent contractor, of Appellant Universal Am-Can, Ltd. for the purposes of the Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act. For the reasons that follow, we determine that Minteer was an independent contractor. Thus, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

      <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>Minteer is an owner-operator of a tractor-trailer unit. Pursuant to an operating agreement, Minteer’s tractor-trailer was under lease to Universal Am-Can. On April 16,1993, Minteer fell from his truck while attempting to secure a tarp that covered his shipment. As a result of the fall, Minteer sustained serious injuries to his right arm, left wrist, and left leg. Minteer filed a claim petition under the Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> on June 15, 1993, alleging that he became fully disabled because of these injuries. Universal Am-Can denied the allegations, specifically contending that Minteer was an independent contractor at the time of his injuries.</p>
    <p id="b682-4" data-blocks='[["BL_682.4",682,[225,926,1152,419]]]'>In addressing the issue of employee status, the workers’ compensation judge concluded that Minteer had met his burden of establishing that he was an employee of Universal Am-Can at the time of the injury. Critical to the WCJ’s decision was the finding that, to a significant degree, Universal Am-Can controlled Minteer’s work. Thus, Minteer’s petition was granted and Universal Am-Can was ordered to pay Minteer disability benefits.</p>
    <p id="b682-5" data-blocks='[["BL_682.5",682,[223,1371,1154,526]]]'>The Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Board) affirmed the decision of the workers’ compensation judge on appeal. The Board opined that the key elements in determining employee status are whether the alleged employer has the right to control the work to be done and the manner in which it is performed. In affirming the WCJ’s decision, the Board found that the facts indicating that Minteer’s work was controlled to a large degree by Universal Am-Can were supported by substantial evidence. Thus, the Board too found Minteer to be an employee of Universal Am-Can.</p>

Without so stating, the court upheld the decision of the Board on two distinct bases. First, as did the workers’ compensation judge and the Board below, the Commonwealth Court considered certain common-law factors traditionally used in considering employee status. Consistent with the <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>Board’s analysis, the Commonwealth Court noted that while all factors are important, the most persuasive indicator of a claimant’s employee or independent contractor status lies in the right to control either the work to be done or the manner in which the work is to be accomplished, citing <em>Lynch v. WCAB (Connellsville Area School District), </em>123 Pa.Cmwlth. 299, <a href="/pa-commw/123/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="554 A.2d 159" data-case-ids="1382654" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/123/0299-01">554 A.2d 159</a> (1989). The Commonwealth Court concluded that in this case, Universal Am-Can had the right to control and to supervise the manner and method by which Minteer hauled cargo and completed his deliveries. However, the court went further in its decision and also conducted an analysis of federal and state regulations; the court concluded that these regulations predetermined Minteer’s status as an employee of Universal Am-Can. In fact, the Commonwealth Court found that certain regulations regarding the use of a carrier’s insignia upon the tractor-trailer create an “irrebuttable presumption” of employee status. Thus, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the order of the Board finding an employer/employee relationship between Universal Am-Can and Minteer.</p>

Thus, employee or independent contractor status is a crucial threshold determination that must be made before granting workers’ compensation benefits. It is a claimant’s burden to establish an employer/employee relationship in order to receive benefits. <em>Johnson v.

Although it is a claimant’s burden to demonstrate an employer/employee relationship, our court has decided that “neither the compensation authorities nor the courts should be solicitous to find contractorship rather than employment, and that inferences favoring the claim need make only slightly stronger <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>appeal to reason than those opposed.” <em>Diehl v.

Contrary to the Commonwealth Court’s finding that the federal regulation regarding exclusive possession, control, and use of the equipment is dispositive, Universal Am-Can offers a different regulation, not addressed by the Commonwealth Court, which renders this basis for requiring a conclusion of an employer/employee relationship nugatory. Universal Am-Can aptly points to <a href="/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20376.12" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="49 C.F.R. § 376.12">49 C.F.R. § 376.12</a>(c)(4) which provides that:</p>

The Commonwealth Court, seizing on this regulation, concluded that Minteer’s display of Universal Am-Can’s insignia and ICC and DOT permits on the outside of his truck established an “irrebuttable presumption” of an employment relationship between Universal Am-Can and Minteer, citing <em>Carolina Casualty Insurance Company v.

However, I respectfully dissent with respect to <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>the majority’s conclusion that Clarence O. Minteer (Claimant) was an independent contractor of Appellant Universal Am-Can, Ltd. (Universal) for purposes of the Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act (Act). 77 P.S. § 1, et seq.</p>
    <p id="b695-4" data-blocks='[["BL_695.5",695,[204,495,1153,528]]]'>Federal law has extensively regulated the motor carrier field. 49 CFR Ch. III. Of course, compliance with federal regulation in this area is mandatory. Thus, I agree with the majority that conduct required by federal regulation should not be considered when determining employee/independent contractor status. However, since federal regulation has eliminated many of the traditional considerations used in determining employee/independent contractor status, then necessarily, heightened scrutiny must be given to those remaining aspects of the relationship that are extra-regulatory.</p>
    <p id="b695-5" data-blocks='[["BL_695.6",695,[204,1050,1153,368]]]'>At the outset, it is important to note that there is no public policy in favor of employee or independent contractor status. Rather, inferences favoring a claim need only be slightly stronger than those against claim recognition. <em>Diehl v. Keystone Alloys Co., </em><a href="/pa/398/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="398 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="1289084" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0056-01">398 Pa. 56</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.2d%20818" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="156 A.2d 818">156 A.2d 818</a>, 820 (1959). Thus, only a slight tipping of the scales in favor of employee status is required to sustain granting benefits to a claimant.</p>
    <p id="b695-6" data-blocks='[["BL_695.7",695,[203,1445,1154,419]]]'>While certain criteria pointed to by the majority suggests independent contractor status, other weightier factors tip the scales in favor of employee status. Numerous aspects of the relationship between Universal and Claimant confirm that Universal’s significant right to control Claimant’s work and the manner in which Claimant’s work was to be performed goes beyond the requirements found in federal regulations and mandate a finding of an employer/employee relationship.</p>
    <p id="b695-7" data-blocks='[["BL_695.8",695,[205,1892,1153,420]],["BL_696.1",696,[239,261,1150,150]]]'>Claimant’s “independence” from Universal’s control, upon closer scrutiny, is severely limited and commands a finding of employee status. Specifically, Universal purports to allow Claimant to refuse a load, yet he may do so only if no other commodity is available (“The Contractor may decline to haul any particular commodity provided by the Carrier and Carrier shall not provide to Contractor any commodity load previously declined by the Contractor unless there is no other commodity <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>available.”). Contractor Operating Agreement (Agreement) p. 2 para. 4. Likewise, according to Claimant, he could not return home empty without Universal’s approval. R.R. 231a-32a.</p>
    <p id="b696-4" data-blocks='[["BL_696.4",696,[237,442,1153,635]]]'>Claimant may broker a load for another carrier only if there is no Universal freight available. Driver Manual (Manual) p. 7. Claimant may not trip lease if Universal freight is available. Manual p. 9. Thus, while purporting to be an independent contractor, Claimant is captured, absent limited circumstances. Moreover, in the instance in which trip leasing is permitted, Universal takes from Claimant, not a set expense fee, but a percentage of Claimant’s gross transportation revenue. Agreement, p. 1, para. 1; Manual p. 49. Thus, rather than operating independently, even when Universal permits Claimant to perform work for another entity, Universal uses Claimant’s “independent” work as a profit center for itself.</p>
    <p id="b696-5" data-blocks='[["BL_696.5",696,[235,1108,1153,476]]]'>Another prime example of the control exercised by Universal over Claimant is in the purchase of insurance. The testimony of record establishes that when he began working for Universal, Claimant was required to cancel his insurance and to purchase all his insurance from Universal. If Claimant failed to purchase insurance through Universal, Claimant could not drive for Universal. RR. 16a-17a, 288a. These examples of Universal’s significant control over Claimant belie a finding that Claimant is a true independent contracto^.</p>
    <p id="b696-6" data-blocks='[["BL_696.6",696,[231,1614,1155,687]]]'>The right to control the manner of performance is another significant ^factor in determining employee/independent contractor status. Outside of compliance with federal regulations, Universal governs the performance of Claimant’s work in numerous ways. While federal regulations set forth criteria for qualified drivers, the Agreement with Claimant goes farther and allows Universal the unfettered right to disapprove of any of Claimant’s drivers, whether or not they are otherwise qualified under federal regulation. Agreement, p. 4, para. 7F. While Universal and Claimant are subject to federal safety requirements, Universal goes beyond these requirements and subjects Claimant to random safety checks. Manual p. 48.</p>
    <p id="b697-3" data-blocks='[["BL_697.4",697,[190,268,1155,1218]]]'>
      <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>Not the subject of regulation, Universal requires all drivers to telephone Universal’s dispatcher every 12-24 hours. Significantly, Claimant is subject to fine for failure to comply. Manual pp. 9-10. Furthermore, the Agreement purports to place upon Claimant all responsibility for, <em>inter alia, </em>paying operating and maintenance expenses including all expenses for fuel, road taxes, mileage taxes, fuel taxes, licenses, permits, and tolls. Agreement p. 4, para. 7. Yet, Universal mandates that Claimant purchase enough fuel to cover the mileage driven and to turn in fuel tickets verifying required purchases. Manual p. 18. Universal requires that it file fuel tax reports. Manual p. 18. It is Universal that applies for and files Ohio Highway use tax, and fuel receipts must be in Universal’s name. Manual p. 18. Universal requires documentation from Claimant for fuel receipts, fuel and use tax worksheets and toll receipts. Manual p. 20. Although there was testimony that the carrier must ultimately be in compliance with regulations regarding reporting for fuel tax purposes, other evidence indicated that federal regulations only required designation as to the responsible party, and in this case, it was Claimant that was deemed to be responsible for all fuel taxes. <a href="/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20376.12" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="49 C.F.R. § 376.12">49 CFR § 376.12</a>(e); R.R. 245a-247a, 252a-254a; Agreement p. 4, para. 7D.</p>
    <p id="b697-4" data-blocks='[["BL_697.5",697,[190,1511,1154,570]]]'>Likewise, while all permits are supplied by Universal, Claimant is responsible for their expense. Manual p. 42; Agreement p. 4. para. 7D. However, during the first year, Universal charges claimant for permits, but during subsequent years, all permits are provided by Universal at no charge if certain minimum gross revenues are maintained. Manual p. 42. Related thereto, even though Claimant was responsible for keeping a daily log, Universal retained the right to “audit” the logs and to “reprimand” Claimant for violation for Hours of Service Regulations in conjunction therewith. Manual p. 27.</p>
    <p id="b697-5" data-blocks='[["BL_697.6",697,[191,2114,1154,201]],["BL_698.1",698,[237,268,1152,634]]]'>Finally, numerous rights possessed by Universal are cast in terms of an employer/employee relationship. Universal grants “advances” and “credit” to its drivers. Manual p. 1; Agreement p. 2, para. 5, p. 4, para. 9. Universal requires that <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>Claimant obtain prior approval for a “leave of absence.” Manual p. 8. Similarly, it is especially telling of the relationship that Universal may “fine,” “reprimand” and “terminate” Claimant for non-compliance in a number of areas. Specifically, Claimant is subject to progressive discipline and can be punished in the nature of a fine or “termination” for failing to call Universal’s dispatcher for approval to work for another carrier. Manual p. 49. Likewise, Claimant can be fined for failing to call every 24 hours while under load. Manual p. 9. Claimant can be reprimanded for failure to properly maintain his daily log. Manual p. 27. The right to punish or to discipline is clear indicia of an employer/employee relationship.</p>
    <p id="b698-4" data-blocks='[["BL_698.4",698,[234,945,1153,471]]]'>Thus, while federal regulation impacts the relationship between Universal and Claimant, the terms of the Agreement and Manual evince Universal’s great right to control Claimant’s work and the manner in which Claimant performs his work. I conclude that Universal’s pervasive and significant extra-regulatory right to control Claimant tips the scales in favor of a finding that Claimant was an employee of Universal for purposes of the Act. Thus, I would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court, albeit for different reasons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
