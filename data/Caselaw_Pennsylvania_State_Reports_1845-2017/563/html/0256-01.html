On May 8, 1998, Thomas Kimbell, Jr. was convicted on four charges of first degree murder in connection with the stabbing deaths of Bonnie Dryfuse, her two daughters, 7 year-old Jacqueline Dryfuse and 4 year-old Heather Dryfuse, and her niece 5 year-old Stephanie Herko, at the Dryfuse home in Lawrence County. After the penalty hearing, the jury imposed death sentences for the murders of the three girls. Kimbell was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Bonnie Dryfuse. On May 18, 1998, Kimbell filed a post-sentence motion for judgment of acquittal or, alternatively, for a new trial. The Lawrence County Court of Common Pleas denied his motion on February 11, 1999.</p>

Mary Herko was called as a defense witness at trial. For the following reasons, we find that the trial court erred in denying defense counsel the opportunity to cross-examine the witness.

The victims sustained multiple stab wounds and their throats had been slashed with a knife. Tom Dryfuse, who was also known as Jake, made a phone call to a friend, then called 911. Police officers responded to the call and arrived at the scene.</p>

He testified that Heather was the only child whom he touched after finding the bodies. Dryfuse’s testimony was inconsistent, however, with the testimony of one of the Commonwealth’s forensic experts, who testified on cross-examination that blood found on the right hand of Tom Dryfuse was a genetic match for that of his daughter Jacqueline, not his other daughter Heather.</p>

Mary Herko, the mother of victim Stephanie Herko, had given a statement to the Pennsylvania State Police indicating that she was speaking on the telephone with Bonnie Dryfuse around 2:00 p.m. on the day of the homicides. Herko indicated that the conversation ended at about 2:20 p.m. after Bonnie Dry-fuse stated that she had to go because Jake (Tom Dryfuse) had just pulled in.</p>

Defense counsel then sought to question her about her prior statement to the State Police. The prosecutor objected on the ground that defense counsel, was seeking to impeach his own witness. The objection was sustained and defense counsel was not permitted to question Herko about the prior statement.</p>
    <p id="b458-5" data-blocks='[["BL_458.4",458,[221,697,1155,991]]]'>Kimbell asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow defense counsel to cross-examine his own witness about her prior statement to the State Police, which placed a specific person at the scene of the homicide at the time the crimes appeared to have been committed, where her testimony at trial indicated only that an unidentified person was at the scene. He contends that the prior statement was significant because it was exculpatory as to him and cast serious doubt on the alibi of Tom (Jake) Dryfuse. Kimbell asserts that the refusal of the trial court to permit further questioning of the witness with regard to her prior statement denied him the opportunity to place the last words of Bonnie Dryfuse before the jury, words that indicated that another person was at the scene at the time of the homicides, and that those words could have had an impact on the jury’s verdicts by creating a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. He argues that the interests of truth and justice require that he be given the opportunity to cross-examine Mary Herko as to her prior statement.</p>
    <p id="b458-6" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[218,1721,1153,470]]]'>The Commonwealth responds that the trial court’s determination that Kimbell would not be permitted to cross-examine Herko was well reasoned and justified. It asserts that the trial court faithfully applied the multi-step analysis of the decisional law of the appellate courts to guide the exercise of its discretion in concluding that the traditional requirements for permitting Kimbell to cross-examine his witness were not met. The Commonwealth maintains that the trial court’s ruling was within the bounds of its discretion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

It is generally thought to be a relic of the primitive time when parties were not supported by witnesses in the modem sense of the word, but by oath-helpers whose function was not to attest to facts but the purely partisan one of swearing for the party calling them. See 3A Wigmore, Evidence § 896 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). Since these oath-helpers were ordinarily chosen by the party from among his own relatives, friends, or adherents and countered by similar oath-helpers representing the other side, it was thought appropriate to regard each party as vouching for the credibility of his own witnesses and bound by what they affirmed. Courts have long recognized, however, that a strict application of the ancient voucher rule under the conditions of modern jurisprudence can lead to injustice, and so they have articulated and developed a number of exceptions to the mle, usually without questioning whether the rule itself remains a valid one.</blockquote>

The defendant contended that the trial court erred because the Commonwealth was aware in advance of trial that the witness would be uncooperative. The district attorney admittedly knew that the witness was friendly with the defendant, did not want to testify and feared reprisal if he did testify. The Superior Court found that the testimony of the witness at trial was unexpected because the district attorney had no reason to believe that the witness would deviate from his statement to police, and that the district attorney’s knowledge that the witness did not want to testify and feared reprisal was not to be equated -with knowledge that the witness would change his testimony.</p>

The inconsistency lies in the fact that the testimony failed to indicate that Bonnie Dryfuse’s conversation indicated that she knew the identity of the individual who had entered the driveway. Mary Herko’s testimony at trial would lead the jury to believe that Bonnie Dryfuse had not identified her husband as that person. Furthermore, defense counsel’s inability to cross-examine Herko regarding the statement deprived Kimbell of an opportunity to establish that Tom Dryfuse was at the scene of the murders during the time that he had claimed to be elsewhere, as well as an opportunity to offer an explanation for the presence of the blood of Tom Dryfuse’s daughter, whose body he had denied touching, on Dryfuse’s hand. This obviously worked to the benefit of the Commonwealth.
