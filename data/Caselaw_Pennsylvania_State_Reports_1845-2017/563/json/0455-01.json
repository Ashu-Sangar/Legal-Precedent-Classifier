(Suspended August 11, 1997, reinstating subsection (d) from the 1988 Act). Appellant alleges that he is entitled to relief under the PCRA, as his conviction resulted from a constitutional violation of due process in contravention of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(2)(i). As for the following reasons we find appellant is entitled to relief, we reverse the order of the trial court.\nOur resolution of this case requires that we set forth a brief synopsis of the facts that led to appellant\u2019s conviction. On August 18, 1983, John Henry Strock was driving a white Ford Grenada along Route 81 in Green Castle, Pennsylvania. Mr. Strock stopped the car on the side of the road and offered a ride to two hitchhikers, James Strong, the appellant herein, and James Alexander. According to the trial testimony of James Alexander, Alexander sat in the front seat and appellant sat in the backseat. (Trial Transcript, hereinafter \u201cT.T.\u201d p. 1224). Alexander testified that he promptly fell asleep. (T.T. p. 1225).\nWhen Alexander woke, he observed appellant produce a .20 gauge sawed-off shotgun and rest it upon Mr. Strock\u2019s shoulder. (T.T. p. 1225). Appellant directed Mr. Strock to pull the car to the side of the road and exchange seats with Alexander, so that Alexander could drive the car. (T.T. p. 1226). After driving for some time, Alexander pulled the car to the side of the road along an isolated stretch of interstate 81. (T.T. p. 1227). Alexander walked into the woods a few steps in order to relieve himself. When Alexander returned to the car, appellant and Mr. Strock were not present. Alexander then heard a gunshot. Approaching the sound of the gunshot, Alexander saw that Mr. Strock had been shot and his body had fallen into a gully. Appellant was holding the shotgun. (T.T. p. 1232). Alexander asked appellant why he had shot Mr. Strock. Appellant replied that he was tired of leaving witnesses behind. (T.T. p. 1232). Appellant directed Alexander to go through Mr. Strock\u2019s pockets. (T.T. p. 1234). Alexander complied, handing the items to appellant. Appellant then directed Alexander to shoot Mr. Strock. Alexander refused and began walking back to the car when he heard another gunshot. (T.T. p. 1236).\nAlexander and appellant got into the Ford Grenada and continued their journey. (T.T. p. 1237). Appellant and Alexander ultimately abandoned Mr. Strock\u2019s Grenada when it ran out of gas. (T.T. p. 1240). Appellant and Alexander continued hitchhiking until they were apprehended in Pottsdam, New York. At the time of the arrest, the officers discovered a .20 gauge sawed-off shotgun. (T.T. p. 1252). While in the custody of the New York police, Alexander agreed to cooperate with authorities and assist them in locating Mr. Strock\u2019s body. In furtherance of this objective, Alexander waived extradition from New York to Pennsylvania and it was agreed that the authorities would bring no charges against him in the State of New York. (T.T. p. 1253). Upon returning to Pennsylvania, Alexander assisted the Pennsylvania State Police in locating the body.\nAlexander ultimately testified for the Commonwealth at appellant\u2019s trial. Prior to trial, appellant had requested any evidence pertaining to an agreement between Alexander and the Commonwealth. The assistant district attorneys prosecuting the case assured appellant that no deal had been made in exchange for Alexander\u2019s testimony. Alexander denied that his testimony against appellant was in exchange for favorable treatment by the Commonwealth, although Alexander was also facing trial on charges of murder and kidnapping arising from the same incident. (T.T. p. 1303). Subsequent to appellant\u2019s trial, Alexander entered a plea of guilty on the charges of murder and kidnapping in exchange for a sentence of 40 months\u2019 of incarceration. (H.T. p. 33). Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death on October 30, 1984. The judgment of sentence was affirmed in Commonwealth v. Strong, 522 Pa. 445, 563 A.2d 479 (1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1060, 110 S.Ct. 1536, 108 L.Ed.2d 775 (1990).\nIn 1995 appellant filed a pro se petition seeking post-conviction relief. Counsel was appointed to assist appellant and an amended petition was filed. Evidentiary hearings were held on April 7th and 8th, and May 8th, 1997. On June 30, 1998 the lower court denied the petition for PCRA relief. This direct appeal followed.\nIn preparation for the post-conviction evidentiary hearing scheduled for April 7, 1997, appellant\u2019s counsel requested copies of all relevant documents contained in the prosecution\u2019s file. On April 3, 1997, several letters were faxed to counsel which revealed that Alexander\u2019s public defender and the District Attorney of Luzerne County had been discussing an agreement with Alexander prior to appellant\u2019s trial. This was the first time this information was made available to appellant. Appellant alleged at the post-conviction hearing that in failing to reveal this information, which he specifically requested prior to trial, the prosecution had deprived him of a fair trial in accordance with the dictates of Brady. During the course of the evidentiary hearing, testimony was elicited regarding these letters and any possible deal between Alexander and the Commonwealth impacting upon Alexander\u2019s credibility at appellant\u2019s trial. At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial court determined that there was no actual deal struck between Alexander and the Commonwealth; therefore, there was no material evidence that had been withheld from appellant and thus no Brady violation.\nAppellant asserts that the trial court erred in its determination that Brady had not been violated. To obtain relief on this claim pursuant to the PCRA, appellant must establish that the constitutional violation at issue so undermined the truth determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(2)(i); see Commonwealth v. Kimball, 555 Pa. 299, 724 A.2d 326 (1999). In assessing appellant\u2019s right to relief, we must determine whether a Brady violation occurred.\nIn Brady, the United States Supreme Court declared that due process is offended when the prosecution withholds evidence favorable to the accused. Id. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. Brady and a co-defendant, Boblit, were tried and convicted of first-degree murder in separate trials. Brady was tried first, and testified on his own behalf, naming Boblit as the actual killer. Prior to trial Brady had requested Boblit\u2019s extrajudicial statements. The prosecution turned over several statements, but withheld one statement wherein Boblit admitted that he committed the actual killing. The United States Supreme Court found the action of the prosecutor in withholding Boblit\u2019s statement violative of Brady\u2019s right to due process. The Brady decision extended the principle of Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935), which prohibits the prosecution from obtaining a conviction through deliberate deception. The Brady court established the obligation of the prosecution to respond affirmatively to a request for production of exculpatory evidence with all evidence material to the guilt or punishment of the accused . Where evidence material to the guilt or punishment of the accused is withheld, irrespective of the good or bad faith of the prosecutor, a violation of due process has occurred. Brady, at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194.\nExculpatory evidence favorable to the accused is not confined to evidence that reflects upon the culpability of the defendant. Exculpatory evidence also includes evidence of an impeachment nature that is material to the case against the accused. Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959). As the court in Napue sagely observed: \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence, and it is upon such subtle factors as the possible interest of the witness in testifying that a defendant\u2019s life or liberty may depend.\u201d Id. at 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173. Any implication, promise or understanding that the government would extend leniency in exchange for a witness\u2019 testimony is relevant to the witness\u2019 credibility. United States v. Giglio, 405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). As Brady and its progeny dictate, when the failure of the prosecution to produce material evidence raises a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different if the evidence had been produced, due process has been violated and a new trial is warranted. United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).\nAppellant alleges a Brady violation occurred in this case because despite appellant\u2019s requests, the Commonwealth denied the existence of any arrangement with Alexander relevant to Alexander\u2019s testimony against appellant. The trial court found no violation as the evidence failed to reveal the existence of a completed deal between the Commonwealth and Alexander prior to appellant\u2019s trial. However, Brady does not require a signed contract between the prosecution and its witnesses.\nIn Giglio, the government needed the testimony of Taliento, a bank teller, in order to convict Giglio in a scheme involving forged money orders. The government attorney who presented the case to the grand jury \u201cpromised\u201d Taliento that he would not be prosecuted for his part in the scheme. Taliento testified against Giglio before the grand jury and at trial. Although Taliento was listed on Giglio\u2019s indictment as a co-conspirator, Taliento was not indicted. At trial Taliento did not reveal the promise. A different government attorney tried the case, and in his closing argument stated that no promises had been made regarding Taliento\u2019s testimony. The trial attorney had not been informed of the promise made by the attorney who prepared the case before the grand jury. The matter of Taliento\u2019s promise was not discovered until after Giglio had been convicted. The United States Supreme Court found that it was irrelevant which attorney made the promise and that the first attorney failed to reveal the promise to the second attorney, because for Brady purposes, the prosecutor\u2019s office is one entity. Id. at 154, 92 S.Ct. 763. The critical point for the Court in Giglio was that Taliento was a crucial witness and thus, his credibility was an important issue for the jury in resolving Giglio\u2019s culpability. Any evidence of 'an understanding or promise regarding Taliento\u2019s testimony was relevant and the jury was entitled to that knowledge. As Giglio made clear, due process requires that any potential understanding between the prosecution and a witness be revealed to the jury.\nIn reviewing appellant\u2019s allegation of a Brady violation, we begin with the letters that were turned over four days prior to the evidentiary hearing. (Appellant\u2019s exhibit A). A condensed chronological summary of the four letters is as follows. On December 6, 1983, Alexander\u2019s attorney, Bruce Miller, wrote to the District Attorney of Luzerne County, Robert J. Gillespie, Jr. In that letter, Miller referenced an earlier conversation with Gillespie regarding a deal for Alexander to receive a two year jail term upon a plea to the pending murder charges. Miller wrote that in light of Alexander\u2019s prior record and the sentencing guidelines, the court would probably reject two years. But Miller agreed that three years was appropriate \u201cin view of the cooperation Mr. Alexander has given up to this point and will give to the Commonwealth in the future.\u201d The second letter is dated December 12, 1983, and was written by Robert J. Gillespie, Jr. to John Mauro, the State Police Trooper in charge of the investigation of Mr. Strock\u2019s murder. That letter forwarded the December 6th letter of Mr. Miller and stated \u201cI believe it\u2019s time we sit down and firmly discuss our deal with Alexander so that we can go forward.\u201d The third letter, dated January 26, 1984, is from Attorney Miller to District Attorney Gillespie. In that letter, Miller reported that Alexander had complained of his prison situations and he sought accommodation for Alexander, \u201cconsidering the cooperation that Mr. Alexander is offering to the Commonwealth, it does not appear that this request is unreasonable.\u201d On January 27, 1984, District Attorney Gillespie responded to Miller\u2019s letter with the statement that he had no control over the current placement of Alexander, but that he would forward Miller\u2019s letter to the warden.\nAfter the admission of these letters into evidence, several witnesses were called. James Alexander testified that his trial testimony against appellant was in exchange for a deal for minimum jail time on his pending charges of murder and kidnapping. (H.T.15). Alexander could not recall the names of the attorneys involved, but he did recall being advised to state that no deal had been made when he testified at appellant\u2019s trial. (H.T.15, 28). Alexander acknowledged that he had completed his jail term and parole prior to coming forward at appellant\u2019s evidentiary hearing. (H.T.83).\nAppellant\u2019s trial counsel, Michael Kostelansky, testified that he was of the belief that the Commonwealth had procured Alexander\u2019s testimony by striking a deal favorable to Alexander. (H.T.379). Kostelansky made several attempts to discover a plea agreement, or any arrangement between Alexander and the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth always denied the existence of any arrangement with Alexander. (H.T.380). Kostelansky had never seen the letters referred to herein prior to the evidentiary hearing. (H.T.389). If he had known of the letters, he stated that he would have used them in cross-examining Alexander, as he believed Alexander\u2019s credibility was a critical issue in appellant\u2019s trial. (H.T.426-7).\nAnthony Lumbis, co-counsel for appellant at trial, recalled having similar suspicions as those of Attorney Kostelansky regarding a deal between Alexander, and the Commonwealth. (H.T.679). Attorney Lumbis had never seen the letters at issue until the evidentiary hearing. (H.T.682). He testified that had the letters been known they would have been helpful in supporting evidence of a deal regarding Alexander\u2019s testimony. (H.T.703).\nRobert J. Gillespie, Jr. testified that he had no recollection of the letters at issue. (H.T.565). However, he did recall discussions with Mr. Miller regarding consideration for Alexander. (H.T.568). Mr. Gillespie was positive that no plea agreement was made, for if one had been arranged it would have been on the record. (H.T.577). Mr. Gillespie elaborated that it was his practice as District Attorney of Luzerne County at the time of appellant\u2019s trial to avoid entering into plea agreements until after receiving the cooperation. (H.T. 577). Rather, it was his \u201cnormal course to indicate that truthful cooperation would get consideration.\u201d (H.T.577). Mr. Gillespie acknowledged that Brady concerns factored in to his policy on plea agreements because the jury would have to be apprised of any such agreement. (H.T.578). Mr. Gillespie described the letters at issue as negotiations, not evidence of a deal. (H.T.599). He acknowledged that a fair statement would be that Alexander testified in hopes of getting consideration for himself. (H.T.603).\nAttorney Bruce Miller represented Alexander. (H.T.717). Mr. Miller had no recollection of the letters, but upon review he found them indicative of negotiations on behalf of Alexander. (H.T.726). He testified that he would not have told Alexander to lie about a deal for his testimony. (H.T.743). Attorney Miller admitted the possibility that he may have advised Alexander to testify in hopes of favorable consideration. (H.T.751-2). Attorney Miller also admitted to the possibility that an unwritten agreement may have existed regarding a deal between Alexander and the Commonwealth. (H.T. 756-7).\nJohn Eichorn and Daniel Pillets, the Assistant District Attorneys who prosecuted appellant, testified to no knowledge of the letters. (H.T.793, 815). Both attorneys denied the existence of any deal with Alexander. (H.T.782, 805). Both attorneys testified that if they had known of the letters, Brady would require their disclosure. (H.T.795, 814).\nWe agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that the witnesses were credible in stating that there was no deal struck, and that there was no definitive agreement between Alexander and the prosecution. In addition, we concur in the trial court\u2019s assessment that Alexander\u2019s testimony as to the existence of an agreement lacked credibility. Alexander could not recall the name of his attorney, or of the District Attorney who negotiated an agreement on his behalf, nor could he recall the particulars of the deal. However, we note that the absence of an ironclad contract in exchange for Alexander\u2019s testimony is not dispositive. See Giglio, supra. Therefore, we do not agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment that these factors are determinative of appellant\u2019s Brady claim.\nEven if we disregard Alexander\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing, sufficient circumstantial evidence of an understanding between Alexander and the Commonwealth regarding Alexander\u2019s testimony at appellant\u2019s trial exists. Alexander and appellant had each been indicted on charges of murder, kidnapping and conspiracy. The Commonwealth did not seek a joint trial of the alleged coconspirators, and in fact dropped the conspiracy charge against Alexander prior to appellant\u2019s trial. The Commonwealth, as the letters revealed, had offered Alexander a sentence of two years on the charges of murder and kidnapping, pending information on his prior record. Mr. Miller, upon receipt of the prior record information, indicated a willingness to have Alexander plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of 36 months, rather than -24 months. Ultimately, Alexander pled guilty and received a sentence of 40 months. Unlike the trial court, we do not find this additional 4 months to be a critical departure from the understanding that the parties had been discussing prior to appellant\u2019s trial. The fact that the trial prosecutor was unaware of the negotiations between his superior and counsel for Alexander is irrelevant. As the United States Supreme Court has repeated time and again, the good faith or the bad faith of the individual prosecutor is irrelevant in determining whether or not the accused has been afforded a fair trial. Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154, 92 S.Ct. 763. Accordingly, we find the record establishes the existence of an understanding between the Commonwealth and Alexander that he would be treated with considerable leniency in exchange for his testimony against appellant. This understanding although not articulated in an ironclad agreement, was sufficient to implicate the due process protections of Brady.\nHaving found that an understanding existed between Alexander and the Commonwealth, which was sufficient to trigger Brady, we must next determine if that understanding was material, thus entitling appellant to relief. As stated previously, impeachment evidence is material, and thus subject to obligatory disclosure, if there is a reasonable probability that had it been disclosed the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 678, 105 S.Ct. 3375; Agurs, 427 U.S. at 112-113, 96 S.Ct. 2392; Commonwealth v. Wallace, 500 Pa. 270, 455 A.2d 1187, 1192 (1983).\nThe evidence at appellant\u2019s trial established that appellant and Alexander were hitchhiking together. Several witnesses were called who gave rides to the two men. Appellant was seen with Alexander in the victim\u2019s car. Appellant and Alexander had in their possession the identification of the victim and certain of his belongings at the time of their arrest. In appellant\u2019s luggage, police recovered a .20 gauge sawed off shotgun. Alexander had in his possession a bloodstained handkerchief. (T.T. 1667). The blood was Type A, the same blood type as Alexander and as Mr. Strock. (T.T. 1678). Testimony of a firearm expert established that the shot pattern of the shotgun recovered at the time of arrest was similar to the shot pattern of the weapon that was used on the victim. (T.T. 1663). The expert conceded that there would be no way to exactly identify the shotgun used to kill Mr. Strock. (T.T. 1664).\nThis circumstantial evidence places Alexander and the appellant in exactly the same position regarding their culpability for the death of John Strock. The crucial fact that alters this equation is Alexander\u2019s testimony. During trial, appellant testified that he was hitchhiking with Alexander from Pennsylvania to New York. (T.T. 1717). Appellant testified that Alexander was the person who brought along the shotgun. (T.T. 1721). However, at some point in their progress along the highways they separated, as it was difficult for two men to get rides together. (T.T. 1735). A day or so later they happened upon each other at a rest stop at which time Alexander had in his possession the items later identified as belonging to the victim. (T.T. 1750).\nThere are obvious discrepancies between appellant\u2019s and Alexander\u2019s testimony. Given that James Alexander is the key witness who puts the gun in appellant\u2019s hand at the moment of the murder, his credibility was decisive to the jury\u2019s finding as to appellant\u2019s guilt. Impeachment evidence which goes to the credibility of a primary witness against the accused is critical evidence and it is material to the case whether that evidence is merely a promise or an understanding between the prosecution and the witness. The absence of an ironclad, signed, sealed contract does not conclusively establish that no other information affecting the credibility of the witness exists. Giglio, at 155, 92 S.Ct. 763. To the contrary, the fact that there was no binding agreement regarding Alexander\u2019s deal in exchange for his testimony, but rather only a contingency dependent upon the Commonwealth\u2019s satisfaction with the end result, only strengthens Alexander\u2019s motive to testify favorably for the Commonwealth. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 683, 105 S.Ct. 3375. The facts in this case strongly indicate that Alexander\u2019s testimony was in exchange for what he believed would be a beneficial outcome to him. That understanding was material information that appellant\u2019s jury should have been informed of when weighing Alexander\u2019s credibility. There is a reasonable probability that had this information been revealed, the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial would have been different. Bagley, supra., Agurs, supra., Giglio, supra., Brady, supra.\nAppellant has established a due process violation as the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpatory information concerning .the credibility of its key witness. The Commonwealth\u2019s failure to comply with Brady is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. As demonstrated above, that violation undermined the truth-determining process so that no reliable adjudication of appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence could have taken place. Kimball, supra., Wallace, supra. Thus, appellant has met the criteria for relief under the PCRA. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(2)(i).\nAccordingly, this matter is remanded for a new trial.\nJurisdiction is relinquished.\nJustice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion joined by Justice NEWMAN.\n. As we find the Brady issue dispositive we do not review appellant\u2019s other claims of error.\n. The Commonwealth dropped the charge of conspiracy against Alexander prior to appellant\u2019s trial. Post Conviction Hearing Transcript (hereinafter \"H.T.\u201d p. 378).\n. In proceedings under the PCRA, the scope of review of an appellate court is limited by the parameters of the act. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9541 et seq. Since most PCRA appeals involve, as in this case, issues raising mixed questions of fact and law, our standard of review is whether the findings of the PCRA court are supported by the record and free of legal error. See Commonwealth v. Allen, 557 Pa. 135, 732 A.2d 582, 586 (1999); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543.\n. Whether or not a Brady violation occurred must be determined in accordance with the status of the law at the time of appellant\u2019s trial in 1984.\n. The rule of Brady has been extended to require the prosecution to disclose exculpatory information material to the guilt or punishment of an accused even in the absence of a specific request. United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976); Commonwealth v. Moose, 529 Pa. 218, 602 A.2d 1265 (1992).\n. Kostelansky testified to receiving a phone call, at the time of appellant's trial, from a confidential source telling him that a deal existed between Alexander and the Commonwealth. (H.T.382). On the strength of this tip, without revealing the source, he renewed the Brady request for information about a plea arrangement between Alexander and the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth again denied the existence of any deal. At the evidentiary hearing, the trial court directed Kostelansky to reveal the source of the tip. (H.T.383). Kostelansky named Russell Thomas, an investigator for the Office of the Public Defender of Luzerne County. At the time of appellant\u2019s trial, a defense request for appointment of a private investigator was denied, and Mr. Thomas was directed to work as the investigator for appellant, while he was also the investigator for the Public Defender. (H.T.435). The Public Defender represented Alexander. Mr. Thomas testified that he had no recollection of making a call to Kostelansky regarding a deal with Alexander. (H.T.438). At the time of the evidentiary hearing, Thomas was still employed as an investigator for the Public Defender of Luzerne County. In a related argument, appellant alleges that Thomas' simultaneous functioning as investigator for him and Alexander created a conflict of interest detrimental to appellant\u2019s case. Given our resolution of this matter we do not address this issue.\n. Only Justice O\u2019Connor joined this portion of Justice Blackmun\u2019s opinion.",

        "text": "CASTILLE, Justice,\nconcurring.\nAlthough I agree with the majority that appellant is entitled to a new trial, my reasons for reaching that conclusion are sufficiently narrower and distinct as to warrant a separate opinion. I also write separately to emphasize the unusual circumstances of this case and to address further the question of whether and when guilty plea negotiations with, or promises to, a cooperating co-defendant that fall short of a formal plea agreement must be disclosed.\nIn finding a violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the majority\u2019s primary focus is upon a letter sent by co-defendant James Alexander\u2019s counsel to the District Attorney of Luzerne County, Robert J. Gillespie, Jr. The majority construes this letter as proof of a guilty plea \u201cunderstanding\u201d between the Commonwealth and Alexander. The majority derives further support for its belief that the letter proves a specific \u201cunderstanding\u201d from the fact that the sentence Alexander ultimately received was only four months longer than the sentence his counsel had proposed in the letter. Slip Op. at 10-11. In my view, the majority\u2019s overemphasis on the letter is mistaken. The Commonwealth clearly had no obligation under Brady to disclose this letter, or the other letters the majority discusses, since the credited testimony below established that the plea negotiations to which they refer, occurring nearly a year before appellant\u2019s trial, did not result in any actual plea agreement.\nInstead, the due process duty to disclose here arose from the separate fact, unequivocally testified to by former District Attorney Gillespie at the PCRA hearing, that although no specific plea agreement was ever reached, Gillespie nevertheless had advised Alexander\u2019s attorney that Alexander would receive consideration and be treated fairly if he cooperated (N.T. PCRA at 576-83). When Alexander squarely and repeatedly insisted at trial that no \u201cpromises,\u201d \u201cagreements,\u201d or \u201carrangements\u201d for \u201cfavorable treatment\u201d had been made in connection with the prosecution pending against him (T.T. 1253, 1303-04), the Commonwealth was under a duty to disclose the promise of consideration and fair treatment made by Gillespie. Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 153-55, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) (United States Attorney\u2019s office obliged to disclose promise of non-prosecution in exchange for cooperation made by assistant United States attorney at grand jury stage; \u201cevidence of any understanding or agreement as to a future prosecution\u201d is relevant to credibility).\nInstead of doing so, the trial prosecutor, who apparently was unaware of the previous representation made by his superior, denied the existence of any arrangement (T.T. 1201, 1499). Under Giglio, it does not matter that the trial prosecutor was unaware of the prior promise made by his superior:\n[Wjhether the nondisclosure was a result of negligence or design, it is the responsibility of the prosecutor. The prosecutor\u2019s office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government. A promise made by one attorney must be attributed, for these purposes, to the Government.\nGiglio, 405 U.S. at 154, 92 S.Ct. 763. The failure to disclose the District Attorney\u2019s promise of consideration in the face of Alexander\u2019s denial at trial of any arrangement implicates Brady/Giglio. The unconsummated guilty plea correspondence is of secondary importance at best; i.e., it is relevant only insofar as it suggests what it was that Alexander and his counsel might have understood the general promise of consideration/fair treatment to entail.\nIn its Brady analysis, the majority overstates the content and importance of the guilty plea correspondence, while it fails to fully appreciate the significance of the District Attorney\u2019s testimony. Like appellant, Alexander was charged with first degree murder and kidnapping. Alexander, however, cooperated with authorities, beginning with his assisting police in locating the victim\u2019s body; indeed, his cooperation predated any involvement of the District Attorney\u2019s office. Before appellant was brought to trial, District Attorney Gillespie and Alexander\u2019s counsel engaged in plea negotiations that were memorialized to some extent in a December 6, 1983, letter from Alexander\u2019s counsel to Gillespie. The majority characterizes this letter as referring to \u201can earlier conversation with Gillespie regarding a deal for Alexander to receive a two year jail term upon a plea to the pending murder charges.\u201d Majority op. 563 Pa. at 464, 761 A.2d at 1172. Later on, the majority goes so far as to state that the letter revealed that the Commonwealth \u201chad offered Alexander a sentence of two years. on the charges of murder and kidnapping, pending information on his prior record.\u201d Id. 563 Pa. at 467-68, 761 A.2d at 1174. These characterizations are inaccurate.\nIn fact, the December 6th letter did not specify whether it was referring to the murder charge or the kidnapping charge, nor did it make any reference to a \u201cdeal\u201d or a sentencing \u201coffer.\u201d Instead, Alexander\u2019s counsel stated in the letter that he had received a copy of Alexander\u2019s prior record and then discussed how that record might affect a calculation of the sentencing guidelines \u2014 again, without specifying a particular offense. Counsel noted that, even if Alexander\u2019s prior record score was \u201czero,\u201d the mitigated minimum sentence under the guidelines would be thirty-six months. Counsel then stated that, \u201c[previous to our discussion concerning the sentencing guidelines, you had indicated to me a sentence of two years.\u201d Counsel further noted that he understood that the guidelines \u201ccould present a problem,\u201d but felt that a sentence in excess of 36 months would be inappropriate in light of Alexander\u2019s cooperation.\nThe majority\u2019s characterization of the letter as referring to a \u201cdeal\u201d \u201coffered\u201d by the Commonwealth for a two year sentence also ignores the PCRA testimony of Gillespie, who stated that the reference to \u201ctwo years\u201d could just have easily concerned a mere proposal by the defense, or \u201cI could have said that the last time we had cooperation somebody received two years\u201d (N.T. PCRA at 592). In addition, there is no evidence that Gillespie wrote back to Alexander\u2019s counsel on the matter, although Gillespie did forward a copy of the letter to the state trooper spearheading the murder investigation, along with a notation that it was time to \u201cfirmly discuss our deal with Alexander.\u201d\nConflicting evidence was presented at the PCRA hearing concerning whether these \u201cnegotiations\u201d resulted in an actual plea agreement with Alexander before appellant\u2019s trial ten months later. Alexander, who by the time of the PCRA hearing had served his entire sentence, testified, as co-felons so often do at that point, in favor of appellant. Alexander insisted that such a deal had been reached. Specifically, he claimed that he was promised that he would receive a \u201cminimum sentence\u201d in exchange for his testimony. Alexander further claimed that he was told by \u201csomebody\u201d in the district attorney\u2019s office, whom he could not identify, to deny that the deal existed if he was asked about it at trial because \u201cit could mess everything up.\u201d Alexander claimed that he had deliberately perjured himself at trial when he stated that he was not testifying pursuant to an agreement (N.T. PCRA at 14-16, 29).\nAlexander\u2019s account that he testified pursuant to a plea arrangement and perjured himself at trial was squarely contradicted by every other PCRA witness who would have been in a position to know about such an arrangement \u2014 ie., his counsel (who would have to have actively suborned the perjury if Alexander was telling the truth), Gillespie, and the two assistant district attorneys who actually prosecuted appellant. That evidence established that there were plea negotiations, but no concrete plea agreement, and Alexander was never told to lie at trial. The testimonial conflict was resolved by the PCRA court, which had an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the relevant witnesses, in favor of the Commonwealth, with the court specifically discrediting Alexander\u2019s testimony. PCRA slip op. at 20. That credibility finding, of course, is binding on this Court. Commonwealth v. Nelson, 484 Pa. 11, 14, 398 A.2d 636, 637 (1979) (\u201cIt is up to the trial court to judge the credibility of [recantation testimony]\u201d); accord Commonwealth v. Henry, 550 Pa. 346, 706 A.2d 313 (1997).\nThe fact that no plea agreement was reached, however, does not end the Brady/Giglio inquiry, for the United States Supreme Court has recognized that promises or understandings as to the potential future prosecution of a co-defendant that fall short of a finalized plea bargain may also sufficiently implicate the witness\u2019s credibility that due process requires disclosure. The constitutional underpinning for the requirement that such exculpatory evidence be disclosed was traced by the Giglio Court as follows:\nAs long ago as Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 112, 55 S.Ct. 340, 342, 79 L.Ed. 791(1935), this Court made clear that deliberate deception of a court and jurors by the presentation of known false evidence is incompatible with \u2018rudimentary demands of justice.\u2019 This was reaffirmed in Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U.S. 213, 63 S.Ct. 177, 87 L.Ed. 214 (1942). In Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959), we said, \u2018[t]he same result obtains when the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.\u2019 Id., at 269, 79 S.Ct., at 1177. Thereafter Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. [83,] 87, 83 S.Ct. [1194,] 1197, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 [(1963)], held that suppression of material evidence justifies a new trial \u2018irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u2019 ... When the \u2018reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence,\u2019 nondisclosure of evidence affecting credibility falls within this general rule. Napue, supra, at 269, 79 S.Ct., at 1177.\nGiglio, 405 U.S. at 153-54, 92 S.Ct. 763. Indeed, since Giglio, some courts have recognized that an unconsummated agreement can create a greater incentive for a witness to testify in a manner that he perceives to be favorable to the government. E.g. State of Louisiana v. Lindsey, 621 So.2d 618 (La.Ct.App. 1993) (promise of favorable consideration in exchange for testimony deemed credible gave witness \u201ca direct personal stake\u201d in defendant\u2019s conviction; \u201cThe fact that a specific reward was not guaranteed through a promise or a consummated plea agreement, but was expressly contingent on the state\u2019s good faith and satisfaction with [the witness\u2019s] testimony, served only to strengthen any incentive to testify falsely in order to secure [the defendant\u2019s] conviction.\u201d). Cf. United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 683, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) (plurality opinion by Blackmun, J.) (\u201cThe fact that the stake was not guaranteed through a promise or binding contract, but was expressly contingent on the Government\u2019s satisfaction with the end result, served only to strengthen any incentive to testify falsely in order to secure a conviction\u201d).\nHere, the plea negotiations with Alexander did not break down or terminate. Rather, they were deliberately left open in part because District Attorney Gillespie, as a matter of policy, sought to avoid plea agreements with cooperating co-defendants until after the cooperation had occurred and could be assessed for truthfulness. There is nothing wrong with such a policy which, as Gillespie testified, he deemed a practical necessity since, \u201cyou always have the possibility of getting burned into a plea agreement and then having the defendant not cooperate\u201d (N.T. PCRA at 577). An additional legitimate concern weighing in favor of not committing to plea agreements before cooperation was the recognition that such agreements were relevant to bias/credibility and thus could be used to undermine the witness\u2019s testimony (id. at 578, 589-90).\nGillespie further testified, however, and it this testimony that implicates Brady/Giglio, that it would have been his normal practice to indicate to Alexander\u2019s counsel that Alexander\u2019s truthful cooperation \u201cwould get consideration\u201d and that, in point of fact, \u201cI can tell you that I am sure we told [Alexander\u2019s counsel] that his client would be treated fairly if he cooperated\u201d (id. at 577, 582). Gillespie elaborated that what fair treatment would entail was a \u201ccase by case\u201d matter, ie., the Commonwealth would \u201clook at the circumstances of, one, his cooperation, what it meant to the trial of the case; two, look at his participation in the crime; and three, then look and see what justice demanded. And I can tell you that takes many forms\u201d (id. at 576, 582-83). Finally, Gillespie noted that his county was comparatively small, that he had a relationship of \u201cmutual respect and trust\u201d with most defense counsel, including Alexander\u2019s lawyer, and thus he expected that Alexander\u2019s counsel would accept that the Commonwealth would honor its word (id. at 573-74, 577, 579-80).\nGillespie\u2019s promise to Alexander\u2019s counsel, rather than the plea negotiation letter, implicates due process. It was that promise that had to be disclosed once Alexander flatly denied at trial that any \u201cpromises,\u201d \u201cagreements,\u201d or \u201carrangements\u201d for \u201cfavorable treatment\u201d had been made in connection with his open case. The plea negotiation letter, though important, was derivative. It suggests what Alexander had reason to believe would be the \u201cconsideration\u201d he would receive for his cooperation. Alexander, like appellant, was facing charges of first degree murder; if convicted, he faced a sentence of life imprisonment at best. The fact that the Commonwealth was willing to discuss a plea agreement that would result in a significantly lesser term of years and remove the prospect of life imprisonment was significant in and of itself, irrespective of the precise sentence Alexander ultimately would receive. Alexander\u2019s credibility and potential interest and bias were a central issue at trial. Particularly in light of the nature of the negotiations that preceded it, Gillespie\u2019s promise provided Alexander with a powerful incentive to testify favorably for the Commonwealth and unquestionably was a matter that was relevant to attack Alexander\u2019s credibility. Such impeachment evidence, no less than exculpatory evidence, is covered by the Brady rule. See Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375.\nThe remaining question is whether the undisclosed promise was material for Brady purposes and whether there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the outcome of the trial would have been different if Alexander had been subject to cross-examination on the point. Id. at 677, 105 S.Ct. 3375; see also id. at 685, 105 S.Ct. 3375 (White, J., concurring). As to this point, I agree with the majority\u2019s analysis. Alexander was not just a key witness against appellant, but an indispensable one. This trial, moreover, squarely pitted his credibility against that of appellant, who also testified. Cross-examination of a cooperating co-defendant like Alexander, whose testimony is obviously motivated to some degree by self-interest, can be effective even where the witness has received no \u201cdeal\u201d or \u201cpromise\u201d in exchange for his testimony. Here, however, there was an existing promise, although a vague promise, and Alexander\u2019s true status was not disclosed to appellant. Moreover, appellant\u2019s efforts to impeach Alexander on grounds of expected favorable treatment from the Commonwealth were stymied when that claim was met by a denial not only from the witness but also from the trial prosecutor, an officer of the court. The jury was thus erroneously led to believe that Alexander had no personal stake in the trial\u2019s outcome beyond a vague hope for leniency. Suggesting to the jury that a witness\u2019s testimony was influenced by a unilateral hope for mercy is far less effective than concrete evidence that the witness was given an actual assurance of fair treatment and consideration in a case where any such consideration meant the prospect of avoiding a life sentence. Given the importance of Alexander\u2019s testimony, and the strength of the undisclosed impeachment, I agree that a new trial is warranted.\nNot all negotiations between the prosecution and a cooperating co-defendant witness falling short of an actual agreement must be disclosed to the defense. It is only where some actual promise of favorable treatment in the witness\u2019s own prosecution has been made, and that fact becomes material at trial, that disclosure is required. Because I am satisfied that those contingencies exist here, I concur in the mandate of a new trial.\nJustice NEWMAN joins this concurring opinion.\n. Although Giglio involved a federal prosecution, it was based upon the due process clause and the Brady line of cases and thus is binding on state prosecutions.\n. Since the letter spoke of a sentencing range short of life imprisonment, if it was referring to the murder charge, it had to be contemplating either third degree murder or a manslaughter charge. Notably, since both third degree murder and kidnapping are graded as felonies of the first degree, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2502(c), 2901(b), they would result in the same sentencing guideline ranges.\n. This portion of Justice Blackmun\u2019s opinion in Bagley was joined only by Justice O'Connor.\n. Alexander\u2019s counsel testified that, if plea negotiations had broken off, he would have advised Alexander to cease cooperating with the Commonwealth (N.T. PCRA at 727). Alexander, of course, did continue to cooperate and testified against Appellant.'\n. Bagley was a majority opinion as to the propositions cited in the text above but was a plurality opinion as to its application of ihe Brady materiality standard to the facts of that case.",
