Commonwealth, 497 Pa. 453, 442 A.2d 210, 212 (1981), for the general proposition that the Department of Revenue is not bound by a Common Pleas Court\u2019s decision. Accordingly, this matter is REMANDED to the Commonwealth Court for consideration of whether Lester Associates proffered sufficient evidence that the March 20, 1992 deed was void ab initio, Sabatine, 497 Pa. at 458, 442 A.2d at 212, such that there was no transfer of real estate, justifying the imposition of realty transfer tax by the Department of Revenue.",
