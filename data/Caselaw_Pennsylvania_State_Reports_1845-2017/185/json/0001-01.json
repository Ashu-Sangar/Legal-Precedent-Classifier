Vogel, Jacob Boon, William Albert Johnson and Real Estate, Title Insurance and Trust Company.\nMortgage \u2014 Release\u2014Principal and agent.\nWhere the holder of a purchase money mortgage which covers a large number of building lots agrees to release the several lots as they are sold, upon the payment to him of the purchase price of the lots, and the relation of principal and agent does not exist between the mortgagor and mortgagee, the purchasers of the several lots cannot compel the mortgagee to release their lots upon the payment of the money to the mortgagor unless it can be shown that the purchase money was paid over by the mortgagor to the mortgagee.\nWhere a mortgagor who is in default in his payments agrees to pay the mortgagee weekly all purchase money thereafter received from lots then sold or thereafter to be sold, and to give him access to the books relating thereto, and the mortgagee, in consideration thereof, agrees to release the lots as they are sold, upon receiving the full consideration money obtained for them, this does not make the mortgagor the agent of the mortgagee so as to compel the latter to release lots, the purchase money of which has been paid by the purchasers to the mortgagor, but which has not been paid by him to the mortgagee.\nArgued Feb. 11, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 9, Jan. T., 1898, by plaintiffs, from decree of C. P. Delaware Co., March T., 1896, No. 5, on bill in equity.\nBefore Green, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity to compel the execution of releases of the lien of a mortgage.\nThe bill alleged in the first paragraph, the conveyance of a tract of land of about eighty-five acres in Upper Darby, Del. Co., by William Albert Johnson and wife to Jacob Boon on July 9,1889. In the second paragraph a statement of the purchase money mortgage of 1117,000 was made. In the third paragraph it was alleged that Jacob Boon and wife had conveyed the premises subject to said mortgage and certain trusts to the Beal Estate, Title Insurance and Trust Company of Philadelphia. In the fourth paragraph it was alleged that the trust company had executed a declaration of trust in which it was declared that the \u201c title to the said tract of land vested in the said company shall be held by them so far as concerns the said Jacob Boon and all other persons until otherwise conveyed as personalty and not realty\u201d to convey as Frederick B. Vogel, attorney for Lansdowne Heights, shall direct, and divide the net profits between Vogel and Boon. In the fifth paragraph it was alleged that the tract had been laid out in lots, a plan recorded, entitled \u201c Plan of Lansdowne Heights, No. 2,\u201d upon which lots are laid out and numbered from 950 to 1720.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of the court below, Clayton, P. J., which was as follows:\nThe facts stated in paragraphs 1, 2, 8, 4 and 5 of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill are found to be true as therein stated.\nSales were made from time to time of lots mentioned in said plan by Frederick B. Vogel, who signed himself as attorney for the Lansdowne Estate. The firm called the Lansdowne Estate consisted of Jacob Boon and the said F. B. Vogel, who were the only persons interested in said firm. The profits were to be equally divided between said Boon and Vogel. The said William A. Johnson had no beneficial interest in said firm or the lands conveyed to Boon, except as mortgagee. Vogel had the entire management of said land and acted only for himself, and as attorney in fact for Boon, the legal owner, subject to the mortgage to Johnson. By a written agreement signed by Johnson, dated June 11, 1889, two days after the date of the deeds from Johnson to Boon, Johnson agreed to release from the lien of said mortgage debt all lots as laid out and sold, upon receiving the full consideration money obtained for said lots, said consideration to be not less than $2,500 per acre for lots on Darby road and Owens avenue, and $1,750 per acre for the balance, or at that rate. The said Vogel, acting for himself and Boon, proceeded to sell lots and received the consideration, under an agreement in writing, of which exhibit \u201cA,\u201d hereto annexed, is a copy. Under this agreement the plaintiffs in this bill purchased the several lots mentioned in the said bill of complaint. Johnson was not a party to, or known to any of the plaintiffs when said lots were bought. His name was not mentioned in any way when the agreement to purchase said lots was signed or afterwards. Under the agreement marked exhibit \u201c A,\u201d the said Jones to acquire title to lots Nos. 1407,1408, 1410 and 1411, was required to pay .... $1,800\nOn lot 1455, ....... 250\n$2,050\nHe paid on this to Vogel prior to December 5, 1892,.....$1,160\nHe paid on this to Vogel after December 5,\n1892,...... 375 \u2014 $1,535\nLeaving due to Vogel, .... $ 515\nOf the $1,535 received by Vogel he paid to William Albert Johnson after December 5, 1892, $300, and nothing before that date, leaving of the $375, so received after December 5, 1892, $75.00 unaccounted for.\n2. On June 26, A. D. 1890, the plaintiffs, Horatio Lavender and Edmund W. Hetherington, entered into an agreement with the defendant, Frederick B. Vogel, attorney for the Lansdowne Heights Estate, similar in form to exhibit \u201c A,\u201d for the purchase of certain lots designated on said plan as Nos. 1563, 1564 and 1565. Under this agreement the said Lavender and Hetherington, to acquire title to the said lots were required to pay........$975\nThey paid on this to Vogel prior to December 5, 1892,......$585\nThey paid after December 5, 1892, . . 195 \u2014 $780\nLeaving due to Vogel, ..... $195\nOf the $780, received by Vogel, he paid to William Albert Johnson after December 5,1892, $90.00 and nothing before that date. Of this $195, received after December 5, 1892, Johnson received only $90.00.\n8. On October 1, 1889, the plaintiff, Calvin A. Brown, entered into an agreement with the defendant, Frederick B. Vogel, attorney for the Lansdowne estate, similar in form to exhibit \u201c A,\u201d for the purchase of a lot designated on said plan as Nos. 1368 and 1369. Under this agreement the said Calvin A. Brown, to acquire title to said lots, was required to pay . $650\nHe paid on this to Vogel prior to December 5, 1892,.......$470\nHe paid on this to Vogel after December 5, 1892,....... 180 \u2014 $650\nOf the $470, received by Vogel prior to December 5, 1892, he paid nothing to Johnson, and of the $180, received after that dat\u00f3, he paid Johnson $135. Prior to December 5, 1892, the plaintiff, William August Haegele entered into an agreement with defendant, Frederick B. Vogel, as attornejr for the Lansdowne estate, similar in form to Exhibit \u201cA,\u201d for the purchase of a lot designated on said plan as No. 1257. Under this agreement the said Haegele was required to pay to Vogel, in order to acquire title,......$325\nHe paid on this prior to December 5, 1892, . $250\n\u201c \u201c \u201c \u201c after \u201c \u201c \u201c 75 \u2014 $325\nOf the $250, received by Vogel prior to December 5, 1892, Johnson received nothing, and of the $75.00, received by Vogel after December 5, 1892, he paid Johnson $30.00.\nPrior to December 5, 1892, plaintiff, John O. Smith, entered into an agreement with defendant, Frederick B. Vogel, as attorney in fact for the Lansdowne estate, similar in form to exhibit \u201c A,\u201d for the purchase of four lots designated on said plan as Nos. 1200, 1201, 1566 and 1567. Under this agreement, said Smith was required to pay to Vogel, in order to acquire title, . ..... $1,300\nHe paid on this prior to December 5, 1892, $715\n\u201c \u201c \u201c \u201c after \u201c \u201c \u201c 585 \u2014 $1,300\nOf the $715, received by Vogel prior to December 5, 1892, Johnson received nothing, and of the $585, received by Vogel after December 5,1892, he paid Johnson $300.\nOn October 4, 1894, plaintiff, John F. Power, entered into an agreement with Frederick B. Vog\u00e9l as attorney for the Lansdowne estate, similar in form to exhibit \u201c A,\u201d for the purchase of lots Nos. 1641 and 1642, for . . $815\nOf this he claims to have p dd . . . . 820\nJohnson has been paid upon the said mortgage debt the sum of $51,569.50, and has released lots (valued at the sale price) to the amount of $48,569.50. The mortgagor being in default, the mortgage has been foreclosed, and after the sale of the balance of the land exclusive of the lots mentioned in this bill, there is still due to Johnson the sum of $55,679.89.\nThe sheriff\u2019s sale was on February 29, 1896. The only connection the Rea] Estate Title Insurance & Trust Co. have with the case will sufficiently appear by a declaration of trust, a copy of which is hereto annexed, marked exhibit \u201cB.\u201d This declaration of trust recognizes the said Vogel as the attorney in fact for Boon. Vogel at once commenced the sale of said lots under the form of an agreement, of which exhibit \u201c A \u201d is a copy. Johnson carried out his agreement and released all lots sold by Vogel for which he was paid the full sale price, and for quite a large number he released without receiving the sale price. The releases he signed without receiving the price were signed wholly upon the request of Vogel, and on his personal promise to pay over the said price.\nPayments on the mortgage being in default, Johnson threatened a foreclosure, whereupon an agreement was made, dated December 5, 1892, of which the paper annexed marked exhibit \u201c C \u201d is a copy. Johnson carried out his part of this last agreement. Vogel becoming again in default, Johnson proceeded to foreclose his mortgage. None of the plaintiffs had any knowledge or notice of the agreement of December 5,1892, nor of any agreement for the release of the lots they were buying other than the record notice of the first agreement. No tender had been made of any amount admitted to be due. While Johnson does not recognize the right of the complainants to demand a release from him, he has expressed his willingness to execute such releases upon being paid the full amount of each purchase, less what he has received from Vogel.\nCONCLUSIONS ON LAW.\nThe above are all the material facts in the case. But two questions are raised: First, have the plaintiffs a legal or equitable right to require Johnson to execute releases for the lots so purchased by them without paying him the full consideration money, less what he has already received from Vogel ?\nSecond. Are the plaintiffs entitled to credit on the purchase money of their lots, for the money paid by them to and embezzled by Vogel?\nIt may be admitted that the plaintiffs have an equitable right to have credit for all the money they have paid Vogel and which he has paid over to J ohnson. This, as I understand Mr. Johnson, he has always been willing to do. This is all, therefore, that need be said upon the first question.\nThe second question is the important one and its answer must depend entirely upon the written evidence, as there is no parol testimony upon the subject. Unless, therefore, the agreement of December 5, 1892, standing alone, can be construed as creating an agency, in which Johnson is the principal and Vogel his agent to receive the purchase money from the purchasers of such lots as Vogel should thereafter sell, or had theretofore sold, the plaintiffs must fail.\nWe are of opinion that no sufficient evidence has been produced to warrant the court in finding that Vogel was the agent of Johnson for any purpose. There is no privity, either contract or estate, sufficient to raise such a presumption. We are also of opinion in the present condition of the case that Johnson cannot enforce any of the contracts made by Vogel or compel any of the plaintiffs to pay the balance admitted by them to be due to Vogel and Boon on account of their purchase of said lots. It will, therefore, be useless for the court to make a decree which it cannot enforce. The plaintiffs are before the \u2022court as terre-tenants and not as contracting parties. If we were to require J ohnson to execute the releases demanded on receiving the balances admitted to be due him, we could not make a binding decree that would require the complainants to pay said balances unless we find Vogel to be Johnson\u2019s agent. As we find no such agency, it follows that Johnson cannot recover the balances unpaid on a contract made with Vogel.\nThe complainants can demand releases upon tendering the balance actually due, but, if we were to require Johnson to execute such releases, the complainants could decline to tender him the money. The contest is therefore not equal. They must be bound by our decree if he is. In the present condition of the real estate market, those who have made but small payments would not show great wisdom in tendering Johnson the balance of their purchase money.\nIf, however, the complainants or any of them will pay into court within ten days from the filing of this decree the full amount of their purchases, less what Vogel has actually paid over under the agreement of December 5, 1892, with interest thereon from the time the whole balance was due, then we will order and decree that Johnson shall execute the releases prayed for, and we will permit him to take out the money, and we will make an order on the trust company to execute the deed. On failure to pay said money into court within the time above limited, let the bill be dismissed with costs. In any event the costs are ordered to be paid by the complainants.\nexhibit \u201cA.\u201d\n\u201c This agreement, made the 21st day of June, Anno Domini, 1890, between Frederick B. Vogel, attorney for Lansdowne Estate, party of the first part, and John J.
