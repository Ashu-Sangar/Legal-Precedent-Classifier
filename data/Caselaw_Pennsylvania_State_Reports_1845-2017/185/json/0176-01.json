The undisputed testimony on the part of the plaintiffs established beyond all question that the death of the child was caused by his suddenly darting upon the track immediately in front of the approaching car, and that it was not possible to stop the car in time to prevent the collision. In such circumstances, as we have frequently held, there is no right of recovery, because there is no breach of legal duty to the child.\nThere is no merit in the second assignment. The motorman, Barnet, was neither a party nor a person having legal interest in the pending suit, and hence the plaintiffs had no right to call him as if on cross-examination. The remaining assignments are of no importance and cannot be sustained.\nJudgment affirmed.",

The Easton Transit Company.\nNegligence \u2014 Street railway \u2014 Nonsuit.\nIn an action against a street railway company to recover damages for-the death of a child six years old, a nonsuit is properly entered where the-undisputed testimony on the part of the plaintiff establishes beyond all. question that the death of the child was caused by his suddenly darting upon the track immediately in front of the approaching car, and that it was not possible to stop the car in time to prevent a collision.\nEvidence \u2014 Gross-examination \u2014 Party without interest \u2014 Gross-examination of motorman in negligence case.\nIn an action against a street railway company to recover damages-for death, the motorman who ran the car of the defendant company-which caused the death cannot be compelled to testify as if under cross-examination by the plaintiff, inasmuch as he is neither a party nor a person having legal interest in the pending suit.\nArgued March 7, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 356, Jan. T., 1897,. by plaintiffs, from order of C. P. Northampton Co., Dec. T.,. 1894, No. 63, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Green,. Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for the death of a son six years old. Before Schuyler, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on November 13, 1894, plain-, tiffs\u2019 son, a child about six years old, while playing upon a street on which the defendant operated an electric railway, suddenly darted upon the track immediately in front of an approaching car, and it was not possible to stop the car in time to-save the boy.\nUnder objection and exception the court refused to permit-plaintiffs to call George Barnet, tbe motorman of tbe car, as if for cross-examination. [2]\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nErrors assigned were (1) refusal to take off nonsuit; (2) ruling on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions.\nJames W. Fox, with him Edward J. Fox, for appellants.\nA failure to do anything which a safe course would require to be done is negligence, and where there is evidence that either the car was running very rapidly or that the motorman was either inattentive to his duty or careless in the performance of it, the question is for the jury: McCullough v. Traction Co., 183 Pa. 241; Phillips v. Traction Co., 183 Pa. 255; Lenkner v. Traction Co., 179 Pa. 487; Schnur v. Traction Co., 153 Pa. 29; Iaquinta v. Traction Co., 166 Pa. 63; Dunseath v.

Co., 161 Pa. 1.\nIf under the common law Barnet would not have been a competent witness for the defendant on the ground of interest, it follows necessarily that he was liable to be called as if under cross-examination by the plaintiffs in this suit: 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 393; Catawissa R.

Steele and J. J). Brodhead, for appellee,\nwere not heard, but argued in their printed brief: If the parents permit a child of tender years to run at large without a protector in a city traversed constantly by cars and other vehicles, they fail in the performance of their duties, and are guilty of such negligence as precludes them from a recovery of damages for any injury resulting therefrom: Johnson v. Ry., 160 Pa. 651.\nThe accident was one resulting from childish indiscretion alone, and for it the defendant is not responsible: Hestonville Pass. Ry. v. Connell, 88 Pa. 524; Fischer v. Camden, etc., Ferry Co., 124 Pa. 154; Moore v. Penna. R. R., 99 Pa. 301; Balt., etc., R. R. v. Schwindling, 101 Pa. 258; Chilton v. Traction Co., 152 Pa. 425; Fleishman v. Neversink, etc., R. R., 174 Pa. 510; Funk v. Electric Traction Co., 175 Pa. 559; Kline v. Electric Traction Co., 181 Pa. 276.\nIt was a sudden emergency, and the omission to do the very best possible thing is not negligence: Brown v. French, 104 Pa. 604; Flanagan v. People\u2019s Pass. Ry., 163 Pa. 106.\nA motorman employed by a defendant street railway company may not be compelled to testify as if under cross-examination by the plaintiff in a negligence suit such as this: Hill v.
