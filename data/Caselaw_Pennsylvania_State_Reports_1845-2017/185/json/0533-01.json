Union Traction Company.\nNegligence \u2014 Death\u2014Release of damages \u2014 Evidence.\nIn an action to recover damages for death of plaintiff\u2019s husband, the action of the trial court in directing a verdict for the defendant will not be reversed where the evidence shows that the husband\u2019s head and eye were slightly injured while riding in defendant\u2019s car; that he walked home after the accident, merely complaining of being tired; that ho felt worse the next day, had fever with pain in the head the third day and also on the fourth, with restlessness, swollen throat and wandering of the mind, and died on the sixth day; and where it appears that the deceased and his wife executed a release of damages, and there was nothing to show mental incapacity at the time of tlic release, except an offer to prove 1ns condition on the day before he signed the release, which offer was excluded by the court.\nArgued April 6, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 66, Jan. T., 1898, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 8, Pliila. Co., Sept. T., 1896, No. 869, on verdict for defendant.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband. Before Finletter, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that plaintiff\u2019s husband, Richard J. Bruns, died on August 15, 1896, at a hospital. The evidence showed that on August 9, 1896, plaintiff\u2019s bead was slightly bruised and bis eye blacked wlfile riding as a passenger on one of defendant\u2019s cars. He walked home, complained of feeling tired, felt worse the next day; the day after be was feverish, witb pain in His head; to tliese were added, the next day, restlessness, swelling in the tliroat and wandering of the mind, and he died on the sixth day.\nAt tbe time of the accident be was suffering from blood poisoning, complicated witli Bright\u2019s disease.\nOn August 14, 1896, tbe day before lie died, the deceased and bis wife executed a release of damages for tbe consideration of $40.00. The evidence tended to show that tbe deceased signed tbe release after bargaining with tbe defendant\u2019s agent, and tliat be was mentally competent at tlie time.\nUnder objection and exception tbe court overruled plaintiff\u2019s offer to prove by the attending physician that on the day before the release was signed, the deceased was not mentally competent to transact any business. [2]\nThe court charged as follows :\n[It is not worth while arguing this case, for I direct the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, for two reasons. First of all, the evidence does not show that this man\u2019s death was necessarily the result of the accident. I do not recollect that any evidence has been given to show that fact; in other words, to connect the accident and the death. But independently of that, the defendant has produced a release regularly signed by the deceased before his death, and the evidence is not sufficient for me to permit the question of his mental capacity to go to the jury, and I therefore direct the jury to render a verdict for the defendant.] [1]\nVerdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nJErrors assigned were (1) charge of the court, quoting it; (2) rulings on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions.\nPreston K. JSrdman, with him J.
