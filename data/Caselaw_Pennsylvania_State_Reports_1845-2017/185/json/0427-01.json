T., 1897, by-plaintiffs, from order of C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., March T., 1895, No. 364, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Gbeen, Williams, Mitchell, Dean and Pell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for the death of plaintiffs\u2019 son. Before Finlettek, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on January 13, 1895, plaintiffs\u2019 son, a boy sixteen years old, with several other boys, was running east on the north side of Bainbridge street, in the city of Philadelphia. As they approached Tenth street they saw a car going south on that street. Plaintiffs\u2019 son checked his speed, but continued on, and either ran into the front corner of the car, or on the track immediately in front of the car. He was struck and killed. The second boy struck the side of the car, but saved himself by throwing up his hands against the side. The motorman had his hands upon the brake and lever; he was at the moment looking eastward; the car was stopped in about four feet. The trial judge directed a nonsuit, which the court in banc refused to take off.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nW. Horace Hepburn, for appellants,\ncited Shearman and Red-field on Negligence, sec. 28; Penna. R. R. v. Ogier, 35 Pa. 60; Lake Shore, etc., Ry. v. Frantz, 127 Pa. 297; Haney v.
