P.\nAn affidavit for an attachment under the Act of 1809, P. L. 8, averted that the defendants *\u25a0 have assigned and are about to assign, dispose of and remove their property, money and evidences of debt with intent to defraud their creditors and the plaintiff, and that they fraudulently contracted the said debts, and incurred said obligation.\u201d Two weeks after the writ was issued a rule to dissolve was allowed, and about a year afterward the rule was discharged. In the meantime judgment had been entered against the defendant served for want of an affidavit- of defense, and his property had been sold under a ii. fa. Held, that the rule to dissolve the attachment was properly discharged.\nArgued March 24, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 469, Jan. T., 1897, hy plaintiffs, from judgment of C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., June T., 1896, No. 1150, discharging rule to dissolve attachment.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nRule to dissolve attachment under act of 1869. Before Br\u00e9gy, J.\nOn August 28, 1896, an attachment under the act of 1869 was issued upon the following affidavit:\n\u201c Peter J. Brady, being duly sworn, deposes that lie is assistant manager of the H. B. Claflin Company, a corporation; that he makes this affidavit for said company; that Samuel White and O. Fred Spate, partners, trading as White & Spate, are indebted to the said H. B. Claflin Company, in a sum exceeding one hundred dollars, to wit: in the sum of $4,391.58, for goods and merchandise sold and delivered, to wit: carpets by said company, to said White & Spate, from December 1, 1895, to Juno 1, 1896. That the said Samuel White and 0. Fred Spate, liave assigned and are about to assign, dispose of, and remove their property, money and evidences of debt with intent to defraud their creditors and the said company, and that they fraudulently contracted said debt and incurred said obligation.\u201d\nService was bad on Samuel White, and nihil habet as to O. Fred Spate.\nOn September 8,1896, the court granted a rule to show cause why the attachment should not be dissolved. On October 15, 1896, judgment -was entered against Samuel White for want of an affidavit of defense, and subsequently a fi. fa. issued upon which defendants\u2019 property was sold. On October 23, 1897, the rule to dissolve the attachment was discharged.\nJError assigned was order discharging the rule.\nCharles J. Sharkey, for appellants.\nThe affidavit was insufficient: Sharpless v. Ziegler, 92 Pa. 467; Biddle v. Black, 99 Pa. 380; Matthews v. Dalsheimer, 10 W. N. C. 371; Ferris v. Carlton, 8 Phila. 549; Adams v. Bailey, 17 W. N. C. 399; Netter v. Harding, 18 Pa. C. C. 353.\nMatthew JDittmann and Thomas R. JElaoek, for appellees,\nwere not heard, but in their printed brief said: The motion to dissolve was too late: Schober v. Mather, 49 Pa. 21; Loewenstein v. Sheetz, 7 Phila. 361; Poor v. Colburn, 57 Pa. 415.\nAn affidavit for an attachment, under the Act of March 17, 1869, P. L. 8, is sufficient if made in the words of the act without setting out specific acts of fraud: Sharpless v. Ziegler, 92 Pa. 467; Boyd v. Lippincott, 2 Pa. C. C. 585; Hall v. Kintz, 13 Pa. C. C. 24; Werner v. Gross, 174 Pa. 622; Hall v. Kintz, 12 Pa. C. C. 90.\nNo appeal lies from a decree discharging defendant\u2019s rule to show cause why a writ of attachment issued under the Act of March 17,1869, P. L. 8, should not be quashed and attachment dissolved: Lafferty v. Corcoran, 175 Pa. 5; Black v. Oblender, 135 Pa. 526; Wetherald v. Shupe, 109 Pa. 389; Walls v. Boteler, 23 W. N. C. 508; Hall v.
