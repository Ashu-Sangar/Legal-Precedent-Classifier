The single question to be determined upon this case stated is, whether plaintiff’s interest in said realty is a fee-simple or not. The answer to that question must depend upon the proper construction of the proviso to paragraph 13, read in the light of the other portions of the will above quoted. So read, it cannot be successfully maintained that the language of this proviso imports a limitation over upon an indefinite failure of Weaver Shearer’s issue. The direction that, upon the falling hack of the property to the estate, it be sold by “ the said exec<a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>utor ” is inconsistent with the idea that the time of the reversion is designed to be postponed to an indefinite period: Middleswarth’s Adm’r v. Blackmore, <a href="/pa/74/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="74 Pa. 414" data-case-ids="1034700" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0414-01">74 Pa. 414</a>. So is the direction that the proceeds of the sale of the reverted property go towards the satisfaction of Jeremiah’s “present creditors:” Taylor v. Taylor, <a href="/pa/63/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="63 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1019043" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0481-01">63 Pa. 481</a>. Besides, that sale is to be made about the time of Jeremiah’s death. And again, the phrase “issue or descendants of such” is significant. If the word “ issue ” were used to denote an unbroken and indefinite succession, there would be no sense in adding “ or descendants of such; ” for all would be covered by “ issue.” The addition of these words, which may mean “heirs,” (Huston v. Read, <a href="/nj-eq/32/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="32 N.J. Eq. 591" data-case-ids="743353" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/32/0591-01">32 N. J. Eq. 591</a>), and may mean “children,” (Schmaunz v. Goss, <a href="/mass/132/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="132 Mass. 141" data-case-ids="2131575" data-case-paths="/mass/132/0141-01">132 Mass. 141</a>), would seem to indicate that Weaver Shearer’s “issue” means simply his children, and that they were regarded as taking, if or when they should take, as a new Stock, by way of substitution and as purchasers. But neither does the testator appear to contemplate a failure of issue at the death of Weaver Shearer. Certainly not a “death without issue ” before the testator, within the rule in Mickley’s App., <a href="/pa/92/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="92 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="491071" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0514-01">92 Pa. 514</a>; Morrison v. Truby, <a href="/pa/145/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="145 Pa. 540" data-case-ids="825912" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0540-01">145 Pa. 540</a>; Mitchell v. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/165/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="165 Pa. 645" data-case-ids="862024" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0645-01">165 Pa. 645</a>; Keating v. McAdoo, <a href="/pa/180/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="180 Pa. 5" data-case-ids="888343" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0005-01">180 Pa. 5</a>, and similar cases; for, in paragraph 7, he appoints a trustee for Weaver Shearer in case of his being under age at testator’s decease— thus showing that he is providing for one whom he expects to survive his, testator’s, death and that, when he speaks of Weaver Shearer’s death, he has reference to a period subsequent to his own. This inference is greatly strengthened by the fact stated by counsel on- both sides at the argument that at the time of making his will testator was about eighty years old, whilst Weaver Shearer was a child. It would seem nonsensical to suppose that, in these circumstances, the testator was contemplating a possibility that Weaver Shearer might have children and grandchildren, and that all of these persons might live and die before the will should be probated. Yet, though evidently thinking of Weaver Shearer’s death as something subsequent to his own, there is that in this will which forbids the conclusion that the testator is speaking of a failure of Weaver Shearer’s issue upon the latter’s death at any time thereafter. The realty in question is subject to a life estate in <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>Jeremiah. It is upon Jeremiah’s death that Weaver Shearer, if living, or his children, if he be dead, are to go into possession. It is upon Jeremiah’s death, if at all, that the property is to be sold by the executor. In order to enable them to do so, it must have reverted before Jeremiah’s death, i. e., Weaver Shearer must have died and his issue, etc., failed before Jeremiah died. If this be too literal a construction, still clearly, Jeremiah’s death is the important epoch in the testator’s entire scheme— the point of time to which he refers the ultimate disposition of his estate, and it seems most reasonable to assume that that is the period which was in his mind when he provided for the event of Weaver Shearer’s death without issue, etc. The words, “ or at any time thereafter,” in paragraph 18, directing distribution -among Jeremiah’s creditors, refer to what may be found remaining of the testator’s estate after Jeremiah’s death, including, not the reverting realty itself (the time for the sale of which is fixed by paragraph 15), but only its proceeds, and have, therefore, no bearing upon the question as to when the period for its reversion is to be ascertained. Accordingly, the intention of the testator was that, subject to Jeremiah’s life estate, the realty should upon testator’s death vest in Weaver Shearer; that, in the event of the latter’s surviving Jeremiah, it should continue his absolutely; that, in the event of his death before, and leaving children, grandchildren, etc., surviving Jeremiah, it was to be theirs; and that, in the event of his dying before Jeremiah, without leaving children, grandchildren, etc., surviving the latter, it should go to the executor as part of the estate. Words of inheritance not being essential in a devise in order to create a fee, Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249, see. 9, the effect of the language in which this intention is sought to be expressed would seem to be to give Weaver Shearer a fee, with an alternative executory limitation, in case of his death before Jeremiah, to his children, grandchildren, etc., if there be any surviving Jeremiah, or, if not, to the testator’s executor for the purposes specified in the will. Weaver Shearer’s surviving Jeremiah rendered impossible the contingency upon which the executory limitation was to tah'e effect, and his interest then became an indefeasible one in fee simple: Wentz’s App., <a href="/pa/106/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="106 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="455695" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0301-01">106 Pa. 301</a>: Drum v.
