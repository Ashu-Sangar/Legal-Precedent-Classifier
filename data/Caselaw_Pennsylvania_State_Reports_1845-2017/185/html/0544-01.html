An examination of the cases cited shows that with the exception of Brownfield’s Estate not one of them sustains or even hints at such a proposition. In Smith’s Appeal, there was an absolute gift with limitation over in case of death without issue; in Diehl’s Appeal, power was given to the wife “ to do with all my property, whatsoever is left, whatever she pleases ; ” in Silknitter’s Appeal, the gift was to a daughter “and her heirs,” with a provision that she should have “ only the interest during life,” — these words, under well-settled principles, being insufficient to reduce the absolute gift (as in McCune v. Baker, <a href="/pa/155/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="155 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="983219" data-case-paths="/pa/155/0503-01">155 Pa. 503</a>), and only “ operating on the manner of enjoyment; ” and in Grove’s Estate, the wife to whom the estate was given, “ to be absolutely her own for and during her life,” had also <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>power to dispose of all, except what was given to certain legatees, ■“ by her will together with such estate as she may acquire as her own.” The syllabus of Brownfield’s Estate, — the only remaining of the “ line of decisions ” referred to, is “ a bequest of personal property to a legatee for life, without any disposition of it after her death, may be. paid to her absolutely by the executor, and will be credited to him upon the settlement of his administration account.” The objection to the credit was made by persons claiming as residuary legatees, but clearly shown not to be, and having, therefore,, no right to object. In the course of the argument for the executors, it was said by counsel, among other grounds, “ there being no limitation over, the bequest of personal property is absolute. See the rule established in 5 Johns. Chan. Rep. 848; ” and the court, after showing that the exceptants had no interest, adopted this suggestion, in. almost the very words in which it was made: “ The wife was entitled to receive it to dispose of as she pleased, there being no limitation over of it after her death. See 5 Johns. Chan. Rep. 848.” In view of the want of interest on the part of the parties objecting to the credit, the point was not necessary to the decision of the case; and as no such rule was “ established in 5 Johns. Chan. Rep. 848,” (Westcott v. Cady), it is probable, or at .least possible, that the learned judge accepted the assertion of counsel without looking at the report. Had he done so, he would have found that nothing of the kind was decided.</p>

It is mentioned in Grey on Perpetuities, section 97, and shown to be opposed to the “ sounder and better supported doctrine ” that after a bequest of a life estate “ a reversionary interest is as valid as an executory bequest.” .The idea is probably a relic of the common-law doctrine that there could be no limitation of personal property, by deed, after a prior life estate: 2 Kent, 352. Of course, where the gift is chiefly, or altogether, of things of which the use consists in the consumption — quaj ipso usu consumuntur (2 Kent, 353; 2 Williams on Executors, 1503; Drennan’s Appeal, supra; Markley’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/132/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="132 Pa. 352" data-case-ids="970556" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0352-01">132 Pa. 352</a>; Scheifler’s Estate, 18 W. N. 64), or where a power, to use or dispose of principal is given, expressly or by implication (Markley’s Ap<a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>peal, supra; Gold’s Estate, <a href="/pa/133/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="133 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="812889" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0495-01">133 Pa. 495</a>; Heppenstall’s Estate, <a href="/pa/144/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="144 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="823750" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0259-01">144 Pa. 259</a>), the gift of a life estate may be the equivalent of a gift of the absolute ownership — as it may be, also, where the will, taken in its entirety, shows that this was the intention of the testator, as in Merkel’s Appeal; but in any case, this manifestly is not because of the mere absence of a limitation over. It is a fundamental principle that rights conferred by the intestate laws, in personalty no less than in real estate, can only be taken away by a will clearly manifesting a purpose to that effect (Hancock’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/112/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="112 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="546641" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0532-01">112 Pa. 532</a>), which certainly cannot be said of a will limiting, in express terms, the extent of its operation to the life of the legatee, with no suggestion whatever of power to use or consume principal. In the case now before us, there is not only the gift of a mere life estate, but the further provision restricting it to the widowhood of the legatee, which, being a limitation — “ so long as,” etc. (unlike the case of a condition), requires no gift over to make it effective: 2 Black, Com. 155; Richards v. Baker, 2 Atk. 321; Bennett v. Robinson, <a href="/watts/10/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="10 Watts 348" data-case-ids="1850958" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0348-01">10 Watts, 348</a>. This restriction would be wholly defeated if the gift is to be treated as absolute in the first instance. See Sheaffer’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/8/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="8 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="959495" data-case-paths="/pa/8/0038-01">8 Pa. 38</a>. If, however, the law of Pennsylvania is as asserted in Merkel’s Appeal, the principle would not apply to so much of the personal estate of this testator as is given at the death of the widow to charities. To this extent there is a limitation over; and the gifts having failed by reason of the death of the testator within a month after the execution of the will, the void legacies go, under the provisions of the statute, “ to the residuary legatee or devisee, next of kin or heirs, according to law.” As there is no residuary gift, “ the next of kin according to law ”■ — that is, the persons who take under the intestate laws — are entitled.</p>
