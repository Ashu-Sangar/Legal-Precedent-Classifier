Tiffany, plaintiff’s husband, was killed at Kingsley station while driving a sulky over the tracks of the defendant company. The evidence on behalf of the plaintiff tended to show that, at a point on the highway a short distance east of the railroad, the tracks could be seen a long distance in both directions but that at no nearer point could the tracks be seen. Plaintiff relied on the presumption that the deceased stopped at that point, and the defendant proved that from about that point to the crossing, he did not stop. Several witnesses for the plaintiff testified that no signal was given, and that the train was running at the rate of thirty-five to forty-five miles per hour. A number of witnesses for the defendant testified that a whistle was sounded and a bell rung before the train approached the crossing.</p>

It is undisputed that some distance east of this crossing there was a junction of two highways, called an upper and a lower road, and at or near the junction of this road, it is claimed on the part of the plaintiff, and they claim they have proved it by evidence, that there was a point, and the last point where any one could stop, look and listen and see approaching trains, and hear the approaching trains, and at the same time have an opportunity to avoid the dangers of the approaching trains. It is claimed by them that at the time of this accident there were upon this switch track east of the main tracks of the railroad two freight cars, one abutting upon the highway upon <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>the south, and the other extending into the highway from the north, that that, and the station, and the buildings at that point so obstructed the view of an approaching train from the north that he could not — that a man driving across the track there— could not see the approaching trains ; there was no place to stop, look and listen until he was so far upon the track, or so far in danger from one or the other trains as that he could not avoid it. It is undisputed evidence in this case that after he passed a short distance from the junction of these highways east of the crossing, part way down the grade, heavy grade, near the end of the switch, from that point until he was on the track where he received the injury, that he did not stop, and that he did not look up the track; so that if you should find as a fact that that point between the switch track, or ivhen after he had crossed, so that he got a view of the railroad in coming through between those two cars which were on the switch track, if you should find, as a fact, that between that point and the track he could get such a view of an approaching train as to see it, so that he could have avoided it by stopping before he got onto the track, it would be your duty to find your verdict for the defendant. In speaking of the negligence of the railroad in a former part of my charge, I called your attention to the fact that the railroad and its employees were presumed to have used the care necessary under the circumstances; that the presumption was that they were not guilty of any negligence; that same presumption applies to any one who is crossing a railroad track. The law presumes that every man who crosses a railroad track uses ordinary care to escape the dangers incident to' a crossing, and in that connection the law presumes that whoever crosses a railroad track stops, looks and listens at the point, at the last point, where he could see an approaching train and avoid the dangers of a collision. But this presumption may be overcome by proof. Where there is direct, positive evidence that is uncontradicted that a man in approaching a train did not stop, look and listen, that overcomes any presumption arising from the fact that men ordinarily do what is reasonable and necessary under the circumstances. It is claimed on the part of the plaintiff in this case, as I said before, that the point, the last point, where a person approaching that crossing from the east, where Mr. Tiffany was approaching, could stop, look and listen, and <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>at the same time avoid the danger of an approaching train when he saw it, was near the junction of these two roads east of the station ; that is a question of fact for you. If you should find that that was the last point at which he could stop, look and listen, and by stopping, looking and listening see and hear approaching trains from both directions, and at the same time avoid the danger of a collision from an approaching train, then you next should say whether there is any evidence in this case that he did not at that point stop, look and listen. [As I said before, the presumption is that he did stop, look and listen, but if there is any evidence in the case that shows directly that he did not stop, look and listen at that point, and you having previously found that was the proper place, then you should find for the defendant; but if you should find that the evidence fails to show that he did not stop, look and listen at that point then the presumption that he did would govern, and he would be without fault in going forward upon the track, provided it was the last place where he could do that and avoid danger.] [8] If you should find that under this presumption he stopped, looked and listened, the law presuming that he did, in the absence of a.ny evidence to the contrary, that he stopped, looked and listened at the proper place, and that the railroad company was negligent in crossing that track by not sounding the danger signal, then this plaintiff would be entitled to recover from this defendant company such damages as she has suffered, and her “ son has suffered, from the loss of her husband.</p>

    <p id="b335-6" data-blocks='[["BL_335.7",335,[173,815,1164,759]]]'>This case involved questions of fact relating to the defendant company’s negligence, as the proximate cause of the death of plaintiff’s husband, and also to the alleged contributory negligence of said deceased. Under the testimony before the court, these questions were manifestly for the exclusive consideration of the jury, and they were accordingly submitted to them in an impartial and fully adequate charge to which no just exception can be taken. By their verdict the jury definitively determined all the material questions of fact in favor of the plaintiff; and we find nothing in the record to justify us in disturbing the judgment entered on the verdict. The case was ably and accurately tried. It is not our purpose to notice the specifications of error in detail. To do so, would consume much time to no good purpose. The assignments of error are all overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
