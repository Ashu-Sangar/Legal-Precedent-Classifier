The widow Anna Evans, by her will gave her executors full power to sell any or all of her real estate. Her executors and Andora E. Tarrance, her sole residuary legatee and devisee, waived and relinquished all rights which their testatrix had under the terms of the will of Josiah W. Evans in the corpus of his estate. Montgomery Evans was made administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of Josiah W. Evans. Mr. Evans as such administrator united with the executors of Anna Evans in the sale of the real estate above named, situate in Philadelphia. Will their deed convey a good title to the defendant Henry C. Reuther, the purchaser?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[207,930,1171,1173]]]'>Whether Anna Evans took a fee in said real estate under her husband’s will is doubtful: Gross v. Strominger, <a href="/pa/178/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="178 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="885534" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0064-01">178 Pa. 64</a>, but it is not necessary to determine her title, for we are fully satisfied that the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of Josiah W. Evans has full power and authority to convey a good title to the defendant. The power of sale was given to the executor, virtute officii, and such power when absolute, passes to the administrator, d. b. n. c. t. a. The will says, “ I authorize and empower my hereinafter named executor to sell or dispose of my real estate, either at public or private sale, whenever and however it may be thought best.” When and how the sale is to be made the executor shall determine, the discretion is not limited to Anna Evans nor to her as widow. The executor :'s given full power “to carry the will into effect.” A sale is necessary, first to execute the will, and secondly, there is such a blending of real and personal estate as to clearly show an intent to create a fund out of both real and personal estate and to bequeath the same as money. This is further shown by the direction “ to pay the shares to the sisters.” It is evident that the testator intended “ what may be remaining,” should pass to his brothers and sisters as money. Under the very terms of the will there is a, necessary conversion of the real estate: Darling-ton v. Darlington, <a href="/pa/160/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="160 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="852127" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0065-01">160 Pa. 65</a>; Hunt’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20Pa.%20141" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="105 Pa. 141">105 Pa. 141</a>.</p>

Evans. If there is any difference it is in the clearer interest on the part of Josiah W. Evans that the executor shall convert his real estate and <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>pay the proceeds in money to the legatees, the brothers and sisters.</p>

In that case is distinguished a line of cases which have tended and which did tend to raise grave doubt in the-mind of defendant as to whether upon the death of an executor, the power of sale, where it was discretionary in extent, survived and could be exercised by an administrator with the will annexed. The cases which seemed to indicate strongly that such power does not survive may be found in Swift’s Appeal, 87 Pa-502, Wilkinson v. Buist, <a href="/pa/124/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="124 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="563062" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0253-01">124 Pa. 253</a>, and Fidler v.
