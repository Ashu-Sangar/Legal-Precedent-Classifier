In January, 1888, he agreed to sell the business to the plaintiff for $3,500, which sum was afterwards reduced to $3,300, the difference representing the value of a horse which was not to be included in the sale. This agreement of sale was subsequently varied as to the purchase' money and on July 7, 1888, in pursuance of the prior negotiations, defendant transferred to the plaintiff the stock, good will and fixtures of said business, including the horse omitted in the first agreement of sale of January, 1888, above referred to, for $3,850, of which sum $2,550 were paid in cash, and the balance secured by a bill of sale from the plaintiff of the personal property transferred.</p>

These representations were made for the purpose of establishing in the plaintiff’s mind the value of the defendant’s business; and said representations were material and were relied upon by the purchaser.</p>

He soon discovered that the representations of defendant were not true, and tried to have the contract rescinded, but the defendant refused to do so. He then applied to counsel, who on August 1,1888, communicated with defendant concerning the representations and had an interview with him. On August 8, 1888, plaintiff sold the business and all the personal property received from defendant to Messrs. Dilahay and Coppes for $1,000 in cash and a release from the bill of sale given defendant to secure $1,300 of the original purchase money. This sale was made with the full knowledge and approval of the defendant, and no testimony was offered to show that the full market price had not been obtained. The purchasers were employees of defendant who had been retained by plaintiff, and $750 of the $1,000 consideration paid to plaintiff was loaned to the purchasers by defendant, who took title to the personal property and secured himself by a contract of bailment with the purchasers.</p>

The transaction was an ordinary one of bargain and sale. The vendee had been in the same kind of business' for forty years, he was thoroughly familiar with the business in all its details, and was as capable of determining the value of what'he bought as was the vendor. He made his own investigation, in his own way, during the negotiation which extended over a period of six months. It is true that when asked to examine the books he declined, saying that he would rely on the vendor’s statement as to the amount of sales and profits, but it is evident that he did not rely on these statements. He instituted and carried on an investigation of his own, and kept it up for weeks ; he saw and conversed with the vendor’s employees repeatedly, he examined the slips on which sales were entered on the order books, and made extracts therefrom without the vendor’s knowledge, and he appears by this means to have become entirely familiar with the character and extent of the business before he bought it. His knowledge thus acquired, if not as full as that which might have been obtained from an examination of the books, appears to have been more satisfactory to him, and we cannot but conclude from the testimony that it was upon this knowledge that he acted. If he undertook to judge for himself, or if he acted upon the knowledge gained in his investigations, to verify the representations made, there was no relation of trust between him and the vendor.</p>

It was conceded that the sales of coffee made by the vendor were substantially as represented <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>by him, and the referee does not find that there was any misrepresentation as to the amount of the profits of the business. The uneontradicted evidence from the books produced is that the profits were in excess of the representation made. The only remaining allegation of fraud was that the representation as to the amount of coffee roasted for customers was untrue. Whether the representation made related to the whole amount of coffee roasted or only to that roasted for customers was disputed by the testimony. But taking the view most favorable to the plaintiff, and assuming that the representation related to the roasting of coffee for customers, the testimony would not sustain a finding of fraud. Two expert accountants who had examined the books testified. One found that the whole amount of roasting done for both customers and for sale equaled the amount represented, and as the profits on coffee sold exceeded the profits on roasting done for others, if there was a discrepancy between the facts and the representation, the plaintiff profited by it. The other witness found that the amount appearing from the books was short of the amount represented, but he had not, because of the imperfect manner in which the books were kept, brought the account up to within four months of the time of the sale of the business. When recourse was had to the books the defendant was entitled to have the whole account considered, and we can see no reason for setting aside the conclusion reached from a full examination and adopting that reached by a partial one.</p>
