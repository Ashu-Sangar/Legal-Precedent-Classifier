Seel and John E. Norton to furnish the heaters, ranges, slating and metal work, consisting of the cornices for twenty-three houses, which the said ,Seel and Norton were erecting upon lots of ground on the west side of Heiskill street, in the twenty-second ward of Philadelphia, for the price of $100 per house, to wit, $2,300. An apportioned mechanic’s lien was filed by plaintiff against the said twenty-three houses on September 11, 1896, in which the said Ida F. Seel was named as owner or reputed owner, and the said John E. Norton as contractor. The work was done between October 5, 1895, and <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>July 31, 1896. No objection was made to said lien until February 17, 1897, when the said Ida F. Seel, having sold said property a short time previously to one Alexander McKenna, the latter applied to the court for a rule to strike off said lien on the ground that the lien contained a lumping charge and was thus void. On the hearing of this rule, plaintiff asked leave to amend and subsequently filed an affidavit in which it asked for a rale to show cause why it should not have leave to amend the lien by striking out the word contractor after the name of Norton, so that the same should read Ida F. Seel and John E. Norton, owners. The rule to show cause was granted, and on March 27, 1897, was, after hearing, discharged, and the rule to strike off the lien made absolute.</p>

Plaintiff however averring that John E. Norton, named in the lien as contractor, was in reality the owner, and the title was put by him in the name of Ida F. Seel as a device to defraud his creditors, moved to amend by striking off the word “contractor ” after Norton’s name so that the lien should stand on the record as against Seel and Norton, “owners.” The court however discharged a rule to this effect, and made absolute a rule to strike off the lien.</p>
    <p id="b404-7" data-blocks='[["BL_404.9",404,[257,1234,1174,1166]],["BL_405.1",405,[153,358,1164,351]]]'>The amendment was asked after the six months in which a lien could have been filed, and we have therefore to consider whether it should have been allowed under the Act of June 11, 1879, P. L. 122. We are of opinion that so far as the parties now before us are concerned the amendment was purely formal and should have been allowed as “ conducive to justice and a fair trial upon the merits ” within that act. No new party is sought to be brought on the record, all were before the court already. The only change is in the capacity in which Norton is to be charged. He is named now as contractor, and plaintiff’s contract is charged to have been made with him. If he was in fact the owner, as now averred, he has no equity to complain that his houses are made liable for the debt which he incurred in building them, and his apparent legal right to have them escape lien in a lump sum by a subcontractor, is negatived by the fraudulent device resorted to in order to protect them from a lien to which on the true facts they would be subject. We regard the case as belonging to the class of Ballman v. Heron, <a href="/pa/160/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="160 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="852218" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0377-01">160 Pa. 377</a>, and <a href="/pa/169/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="169 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="870538" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0510-01">169 Pa. 510</a>, where it was held that one of several tenants in common may become contractor for the improvement of the joint property, and his part ownership will not prevent his waiver in good faith of the right of lien both as to himself and his subcontractors, but “ if the contract <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>is not made in good faith but for the purpose of misleading and so defrauding subcontractors and material men, it should be held invalid because of the fraud.” So in the present ease if Norton was in fact the owner, his contract with plaintiff for a lump sum was valid and would sustain the lien. The plaintiff should he allowed to so amend his claim of record as to enable him to prove the facts, if they are as he avers.</p>
