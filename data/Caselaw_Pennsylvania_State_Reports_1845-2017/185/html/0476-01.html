      <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>It is difficult to believe that with the dealings of August Heekscher with George K. Sistare’s Sons, covering several years and including, just prior to May 19, 1890, a two weeks’ examination of that firm’s books, he did not know of the trust of which the said securities were a part, and if he did not actually know it in person on that date, he certainly did by agent on May 20, 1890, the time of their receipt. The use of the securities was a breach of trust by Harold Clemens, and August Heekscher had legal notice that the trustee was abusing his trust and applying the proceeds of the loan to his own use. The loans were for no purpose connected with the trust, but for the individual benefit of Harold Clemens and George K. Sis-tare’s Sons, and the face of the certificates, with the exception of &lt;j$l,000 of Allegheny Yalley Railroad Company bonds, informed August Heekscher, when dealing with them, that they were “ trust securities,” and inquiry would have revealed the fact that the use to which the stock was put was unauthorized. The duty of making such inquiry was imposed on him, for it is out of the common course of business to take corporate stock held in trust as security for the trustee’s own debt or for the debt of a firm of which he is a member. The party taking such stock on pledge deals with it at his peril, and it matters not whether the stock is pledged for an antecedent debt of the trustee or for moneys loaned at the time. August Heekscher either knew or ought to have known that George. K. Sistare’s Sons were operating with these securities on their own account, and he is chargeable with constructive notice of everything which upon inquiry he could have ascertained from either Brentano Clemens, co-trustee of Harold Clemens, or Susan B. Clemens, the cestui que trust.</p>

Clemens was equivalent to a written request by the trustee to sell the said securities, and thus a good title was passed to George K. Sistare’s Sons by the delivery of the certificates with the transfer signed in blank, would be plausible if a contract between the parties requiring “written consent” to alterations, etc., were in question. There are cases in which, though a written instrument may require a writing to alter, etc., it can be altered by parol, which is thus equivalent for that purpose to a writing, but I cannot find any case where a testator lias <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>required a writing to transfer or show consent to. transfer in which it has been held that such transfer can be made by parol or by conduct such as that of Susan B. Clemens in this case. The testator was solicitous for his daughter’s welfare, and so solicitous that he provided that the trustees might sell at her request, but with a wisdom (if my view of this case be correct) that is almost prophetic, he further provided that her request to sell must be in writing, and this request was not so given, nor is there sufficient evidence to show her acquiescence therein, and if there were, title to these securities would not, in the absence of such written request, thereby pass.</p>

There can be no question that if the trust had been created solely for the coverture of Susan B. Clemens and she had •become discovert, the securities of said trust would have then become hers absolutely, or if they had been bequeathed to her for life with remainder to the “ heirs of her body,” that is, all the heirs of her body, or all the heirs of her body of a class, she would have taken absolutely by analogy to the rule in Shelley’s case, but that is not the case here. The will expressly bequeathed certain real and personal property to trustees in trust, to pay over to the said Susan B. Clemens for her sole and separate use during her natural life profits of real estate and dividends and interest upon certain stocks and loans as the same were received, and at her decease the said stocks, loans, etc., were bequeathed “ equally to and amongst all the heirs of her body if she should have any. The children or descendants of any one of her children who may be dead to take collectively what their parent or ancestor would have been entitled to if living, and if any die before their mother without issue, the share or shares of such to go to the survivor or survivors, or their issue in the same manner and in default of such heirs equally to her brothers and sisters and their heirs. But if any of them should die without lawful issue before their sis<a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>ter, Susan B. Clemens, the same to be divided among the survivor of them or their issue; the issue of any one dying taking in any ease what the parent or ancestor could have been entitled to if living; ” and it was further provided, “ it is my will and I do hereby order and direct that my hereinbefore named children, to wit, Daniel Wagener, Elizabeth K. Leary, Susan B. Clemens, Sarah Eve Wagener and John O. Wagener or any, either and any of them shall have the right, .liberty and privilege at any time to occupy and possess or to receive the rents, profits and income of the said real estate or any part thereof, and to receive the dividend and interest of the said stock loans and pecuniary legacies hereinbefore .respectively devised and bequeathed to them in trust, etc., without passing unto the hands of their respective trustees or any of them.” This language creates a life estate in Susan B. Clemens and no more. It expressly states that she is to receive the rent, issues, and profits, etc., “ for her sole and separate use during her natural life.” I do not agree with the contention of the learned counsel for defendant that by the use of the words “heirs of the body,” the testator intended to create such an estate as would, by analogy of the rule in Shelley’s case, be converted into a fee in Susan B. Clemens. He expressly bequeathed at her death the said stocks, loans, etc., “equally to and amongst all the heirs of her body if she should have any. The children or descendants of any one of her children who may be dead to take collectively what their parent or ancestor would have been entitled to if living, and if any die before their mother, the share -or shares of such to go to the survivor or survivors, and their issue in the same manner,” etc. By the words “ heirs of the body,” the testator meant children alive at his daughter’s (Susan B. Clemens’s) decease, for he immediately follows the use of said words with the words “ if she should have any,” referring to the time of her death, for it was at that time that the bequest to them was intended to become operative, and he thereupon further provided that “ the children or descendants of any one of her children who may be dead to take collectively,” etc., certainly referring to the death of children of Susan B. Clemens prior to her decease. The subsequent provision, that “if any die before their mother without issue the share of such to go to the survivor or survivors, etc., if any,” can refer <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>to naught but children. I agree with the contention of the learned counsel for plaintiff that “ the testator limits the remainder to children alive at. the death of their mother and children dead at the death of their mother, leaving issue then surviving.” There is no provision for a child dying childless before the mother, and the testator further bequeathed said securities “ in default of such heirs equally to her brothers and sisters and her heirs,” he meaning by the words “ such heirs,” children of Susan B. Clemens alive at her death, or descendants of any of her children then dead, and in default of such, the estate should go to her brothers and sisters and their heirs. This language clearly limits the bequest of the testator to a certain class of the heirs of the body of Susan B. Clemens, to wit: her children or the descendants of any of her dead children at her death alive, and if there be none in this class her brothers and sisters shall then take. The learned counsel for defendant has not referred to a case where such language has been held to create an estate tail convertible into a fee in the first taker, and a thorough examination into the subject has failed to discover any such decision.</p>

I find that August Heckscher was informed by Harold Clemens that the securities in question had previously belonged to his mother, had stood in her name, and that they had been for years used by the firm as collateral for loans; and that August Heckscher was shown the books of the firm which showed that fact, and that the certificates bore on their face that they were originally held in trust for Susan B. Clemens only, and the transfer indorsed on the certificates was executed by Harold and Brentano Clemens, the trustees; but I decline to find that “ presumably inquiry of Susan B. Clemens would only have disclosed the facts shown by the receipt of September 26,1887.” I am unable to find just what information August Heckscher would have obtained by inquiry of Susan B. Clemens, but if <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>Susan B. Clemens had been properly informed as to the facts, it is fair to presume that she would have advised him of the trust created by her father, and that the securities belonged to it, and George K. Sistare’s Sons had no right to dispose of them; but if she would have informed him of the contents of the receipt of September 26, 1887, only, he would have learned that the securities in question were by the terms of said receipt returnable to the trustee on demand.</p>
