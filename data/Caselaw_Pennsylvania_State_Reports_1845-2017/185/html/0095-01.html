    <p class="summary" id="b116-5" data-blocks='[["BL_116.5",116,[231,463,1170,185]]]'>The cause of action averred is that defendants by negligence caused the death of plaintiff’s minor unmarried son. The action was brought more than one year after the son’s death. Defendants demurred to the statement of cause of action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b116-6" data-blocks='[["BL_116.6",116,[230,668,1174,810]]]'>The ground of the demurrer is that the action does not lie-because not brought within one year after the death, as required by sec. 2, of the Act of 1855, P. L. 309. As to this, plaintiff’s counsel insists that said one year’s limitation is abrogated, and actions of this nature are left under the act of 1713, limiting actions, by virtue of article 3, sec. 21, of the constitution of this state, which provides that “No act shall prescribe any limitation of time within which suits may be brought against corporations for injuries to persons or property or for other causes different from those fixed by general laws regulating actions against natural persons, and such acts now existing are avoided.” The argument in this reference is that said act of 1855 and that of 1851, P. L. 674, which gives a right of action to the widow or personal representative of one whose death was unlawfully caused, are not general laws; that said act of 1855 picks out a particular class from a general class.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b116-7" data-blocks='[["BL_116.7",116,[229,1486,1176,912]],["BL_117.1",117,[182,364,1169,711]]]'>The court is of the opinion that this action cannot be sustained. At common law an action for malfeasance or misfeasance died with the person. A personal right of action dies with the person, was the maxim, (Broom’s Legal Maxims, 702). Therefore the act of 1851, conferring a right of action, and that of 1855, designating the beneficiaries, and the time within which suit should be instituted, relate to a class; a class was created by said legislation. Said one year limitation is as general a law as can be conceived, unless it were conceded that to be a general law, the law must embrace all human beings, all kinds of property, or all legal remedies, which of course would be impracticable. The foregoing is a reply to plaintiff’s counsel’s chief argument. But that argument does not bear on the real question. Said provision of the constitution avoids all acts of assembly that prescribe any limitation of time for suits against corporations different from those fixed by general laws regulating actions against natural persons. No difference as to rights exists between corporations and natural persons by reason, <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>of said acts of 1851 and 1855. Said act of 1851, see. 18, saves from abatement by the death of the plaintiff all actions for injuries to the person by negligence or default, and declares sec. 19, that whenever death shall be occasioned by unlawful violence or negligence and no suit be brought by the injured party in his lifetime, the widow or personal representatives may recover damages ; section 1 of the act of 1855 designates what relatives of the deceased may recover for any injury causing death; section 2 prescribes what the declaration shall set forth, and declares that such action shall be brought within one year after the death, and not thereafter. It cannot be said that said legislation affects only corporations. For natural persons as well as corporations are made defendants in actions for damages for injuries causing death.</p>
