There appeared before him counsel for Mr. Magill, the execution creditor of Clark, the original defendant, who claimed, first, that distribution should not be made of this fund pending the determination of the inter-pleader granted in his execution, and after that had been <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>decided in his favor, that the fund should be awarded to him on the ground that pending the interpleader the horses were in custodia legis, his lien still existed, and that they having been sold and possession given by the sheriff the fund arising therefrom stood in the place and stead of the horses and should be awarded to him. Counsel representing the various execution creditors of Willis A. Ogden, the claimant under the original execution, claimed the fund on the ground that the sheriff’s sale was only of the interest of Ogden in these horses; that the giving of the bond had taken the horses out of the grasp of the sheriff under Magill’s execution; that the sale was subject to the result of the interpleader suit; that the purchaser bought but Ogden’s title, and the horses were still subject to the lien of Magill’s writ, who could pursue his execution and sell them as though this sale had not been made, and that the fund having been raised on the sale of the Ogden title, Clark’s creditors had no interest in it and were not entitled to participate in its distribution. Counsel who appeared for Ogden claimed that 8300 should be awarded to his client under the exemption law. Counsel for Frank Ogden claimed the sum of $140 as wages for the keep of these horses while in the possession of Willis A. Ogden. The sheriff was also represented by counsel, as was the bondsman in the interpleader bond. They were present to look after the interests of their respective clients, and to see they were not jeopardized in their absence.</p>

Ogden for his exemption of $300 out of this fund should lie rejected. Outside of the fact that Mr. Ogden has been decided not to be the owner of these horses, the further fact lias been shown by the evidence that lie by means of an attempted sale sought to get them out of the reach of his creditors and so defeat the levy of the execution upon them; and that has been held sufficient to defeat his claim for exemption: Frank v.

If he could do so, he being the first execution creditor, and his judgment being for more than the amount to be distributed, he would be entitled to the whole of it. As was said before, none of the cases cited, nor any to which the auditor has been able to refer, seems to be exactly on fours with this case, but there are cases both in this state and others which bear upon the question raised here. It seems to be settled beyond controversy that the effect of the interpleader bond was that it simply gave possession of the horses into the hands of the claimant, Ogden, but that the lien of the levy still remained: Bain v. Lyle, <a href="/pa/68/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="68 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1024597" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0060-01">68 Pa. 60</a>; Byrne v.

Justice Sterbett saying in the latter case: “ It has been repeatedly held that the execution and delivery of such bond does not discharge the goods from the lien of the execution, or substitute the bond for the goods, it merely operates as a transfer of the goods from the custody of the sheriff to that of the claimant, pending the issue as to their ownership.” It also seems clear that at a sheriff’s sale the rule of caveat emptor applies, and the purchaser takes the title of the defendant in the execution: Bain v. Lyle, <a href="/pa/68/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="68 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1024597" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0060-01">supra;</a> Wells v.

And it has been held that the fact of an execution and the giving of an interpleader bond does not prevent the issuing of a second execution and a sale thereon, the fund produced to be paid primarily to the first execution creditor if he <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>be successful in the interpleader suit: Battersby v. Haubert, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.N.C.%2094" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="8 W.N.C. 94">8 W. N. C. 94</a>. Justice Mitchell, then a judge in the court of common pleas of this county, said “ the inconvenience of a contrary rule is patent. A dishonest debtor would only have to get a friendly or nominal creditor to make a levy, and a collusive friend to make a claim, and then other creditors might safely be held at bay during the years of waiting for a jury trial, which both parties to the issue would unite in postponing. Other creditors have rights and must have an opportunity to enforce them, and the most regular and convenient, if not the only way, is by allowing them to acquire a standing as junior execution creditors, to call upon the man in front to push on, or stand aside for those who will.” And although this decision has been criticised by the annotator in Ilagan v. Lucas, 10 Peters (U. S.), 400, Brightly’s notes, as being unsound, the auditor is not only bound to accept it, but is convinced that it is both wise and sound. The facts there, however, differ from the case in hand in this, that both the executions in that case w'ere issued against the same defendant, whereas in this case the second set of executions are issued against a different person, the claimant. And just here comes the pinch of this case. It would seem, as in Bain v. Lyle, <a href="/pa/68/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="68 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1024597" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0060-01">supra,</a> was actually done, that if the lien of the levy still remained, and the execution creditor still had his right to pursue the horses and the purchaser bought only what title the defendant in the writ had, as was the case in Wells v. Van Dyke, supra, then the execution against Clark would be unaffected by this sale and the execution creditor would have no interest in this fund; and if the law was logic, the auditor would unhesitatingly arrive at that conclusion ; but as he understands it the law is not administered, nor courts of justice instituted to bo logical, but to be just, and to decide as nearly as can be that which is right between man and man, settling each class of cases as they arise upon principles which reason and experience show to be just. We have here an execution creditor who has been diligent in the assertion of his rights, and who has laid his hand upon these horses as being the property of his debtor, and is ready to make his claim of them, but the law, in order that no injustice be done, temporarily stays him that another’s right to these goods be tested, and allows the claimant to hold the goods pending the deter-<a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>ruination of the interpleader, he giving a bond to return them if the issue is settled as against him. The bond is given and the goods are to be taken away from the possession of the sheriff who holds them under the execution, but the sheriff holds them under a second execution against the claimant, and, after notifying all the parties in interest, proceeds to sell them under the second execution, and does so for a full price, giving possession of the property to the purchaser. Now, it will be noticed in the first place that the salé here is not of a title, as in the sale of real estate, but of the thing itself, and possession and removal follow it; secondly, that the property which the first execution creditor had in his grasp has been taken away from him; thirdly, that the prices paid for the horses were full ones, and that all the parties in interest knew of the sale ; and lastly, the horses had never been delivered to the claimant.</p>

Lucas, supra, has said: “ Goods once seized and in the custody of the sheriff cannot be seized again by the same or any other sheriff.” That case, however, decides only that goods in the custody of the United States marshal cannot be seized by any sheriff and vice versa. But Battersby v. Haubert, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.N.C.%2094" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="8 W.N.C. 94">supra,</a> distinctly decides that such an execution could be made subject to the right of the original execution creditor, who would be entitled to priority in the distribution of the fund. It is contended, however, that this only applies to cases where, as there, the executions were levied against the same defendant, but that a different rule must be evoked if the defendants are different, that the rule of caveat emptor must be applied to the purchaser, and the lien of the first execution creditor still subsisting, his remedy is against the horses, or in default of their production then against the bond. If this is the law, then let us see in what position it places the parties. The claimant had no title to the horses; that has been judicially determined, yet if this contention is correct his creditors are to be paid out of the price paid for the horses, and he himself is here claiming to be paid his exemption of ($300 out of it. On the other hand the original execution creditor, whose execution has been held to be good, has that which he had levied upon taken away from him, and he is left to the chance of seeking it again in strange hands. The risk which the law puts upon him was the chance of get<a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>ting it back from the claimant, but the law itself has taken it away from the claimant and given it to a stranger, and, as it was said by Sharswood, J., in Bain v. Lyle, <a href="/pa/68/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="68 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1024597" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0060-01">supra,</a> about goods which claimant might sell: “ It is next to impossible for the sheriff or execution creditor to follow the goods in such a case, and in the majority of instances, and in all of that character, he is necessarily thrown upon his bond.” But under our decisions the bondsman is not responsible in such cases as this, his bond is given that the claimant will produce the goods if the issue is determined against him, that however the law has made impossible by taking them away from him, or rather in this case by refusing him possession of them. Says Judge Sharswood, in Bain v. Lyle, <a href="/pa/68/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="68 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1024597" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0060-01">supra:</a> “ The surety on bonds undertakes for the forthcoming of the identical goods, not for their value, except in the case of a breach.

Lyle, <a href="/pa/68/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="68 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1024597" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0060-01">supra.</a> Justice Huston, in deciding in favor of tlio original execution creditor, said: “No court can construe a law so as to entirely and totally defeat its operation. If any other creditor could take the property as soon as the bond was given no man would have given bond to deliver it at the end of the year. Besides, no law would require bail to deliver property at the end of twelve months, and yet allow it to be taken by law in twelve days or less. The bail then would, according to the law of the land, give a conditional bond which, by the law of the land, might become absolute in a week or a day; or if the law offered a delay on giving bail and the law took away the delay, could tbe law enforce the payment of tlie bond given by tbe bail ? ”</p>

His thought is that the goods in the hands of the claimant were still in the custody of the law, and that he held them as a kind of bailee of the sheriff, and a retaking of them by the sheriff discharged that bailment, releasing the bailee and his bondsman, and that any sale of them subsequently by the sheriff by which the custody was passed away, no matter under whose writ, the sale was made, being the sale of the thing itself, and not the title alone, inured to the benefit of all the execution creditors in the order of their priority. Judge Hustor, in Sedgwick’s Appeal, supra, says “ it is during the year in the custody of-the law, as much as it were before this act, from the time of the levy during the time which elapsed till the day of the sale, no one supposes that the law was intended to defeat a plaintiff absolutely in recovering his debts, but if the property <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>is appraised and a bond given, the plaintiff cannot recover from the sheriff, for the law protects him; he could not in these or similar cases recover from the bail, for at the expiration of the year the property was all forthcoming, and if, when it was sold, the proceeds would go to a subsequent execution creditor, the plaintiff in the first execution would lose his debt, unless the debtor bad property sold sufficient to pay all bis debts.”</p>

That issue has been tried and determined in favor of Magill. The deputy sheriff testified that at the request of all parties claiming ownership of the horses, he sold them at the Tatters all, a place where the highest price was most likely to be got, and the result justified the agreement and choice of the parties. The sale was of the horses and not of an interest in them or subject <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>to a prior levy.
