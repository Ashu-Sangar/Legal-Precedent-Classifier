At the same time it is submitted that, as councils may change their intentions before this (paper) vacation is made absolute, by actual closing of the street to public use, the parties owning the property have no remedy for the damages sustained, and no action can be commenced against the city until after the street is actually closed. Parties seeking equity must do equity, hence this great injustice should not be forced upon the appellants, especially at the instance of such a small holding, — the complainants having less than a quarter interest in the property.</p>
