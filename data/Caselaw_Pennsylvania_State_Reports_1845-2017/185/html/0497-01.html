    <p id="b521-8" data-blocks='[["BL_521.9",521,[201,1330,1167,1007]]]'>Our act of June 16, 1836, section 23, provides that “the power of the several courts of this commonwealth to issue attachments and to inflict summary punishments for contempt of court shall be restricted (inter alia), .... to disobedience or neglect by officers, parties, jurors or witnesses of or to the lawful process of the court.” In Scott’s case, <a href="/grant/1/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="1 Grant 237" data-case-ids="225834" data-case-paths="/grant/1/0237-01">1 Grant, 237</a>, it was held that this act has no relation to attachments to enforce decrees in equity when the object is not to inflict punishment, but to compel performance of such decrees. While it was also decided in that case that a decree in equity for the payment of money due upon a contract cannot be enforced by attachment since the act of July 12, 1842, abolishing imprisonment for debt, it has been repeatedly held in later cases that the exception, in the act of 1842, of arrests “ in proceedings for contempt to enforce civil remedies” applies to cases involving breaches of trust: Chew’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/44/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="44 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="484347" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0247-01">44 Pa. 247</a>: Tome’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/50/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="50 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="425143" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0285-01">50 Pa. 285</a>; Church’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/103/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="103 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="449173" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0263-01">103 Pa. 263</a>; Wilson v.

It is too clear for argument that such requests or demands, not preceded by a rule to show cause duly issued, served and returned, and an order duly entered by the court, after hearing, are neither rules nor orders of court, and cannot in any proper sense be regarded as the legal equivalents of either. The verbal statement of the court, made at the hearing of the rule for attachment, and recited in the answer to appellant’s rule to set aside the attachment proceedings, is o'f no consequence whatever. Decrees and orders of courts of record cannot be carried in the breast of the judge who makes them. If any regard is to be had to the regular and orderly conduct of judicial proceedings in such courts, all their orders, rules and decrees must be recorded. The verbal order referred to never was recorded, and its first and only appearance in the case is the reference made to it in the appellee’s answer to appellant’s rule to show cause. Further elaboration is unnecessary. There is nothing whatever in the record to ■ justify the attachment proceedings against the appellant.
