First of all, the evidence does not show that this man’s death was necessarily the result of the accident. I do not recollect that any evidence has been given to show that fact; in other words, to connect the accident and the death. But independently of that, the defendant has produced a release regularly signed by the deceased before his death, and the evidence is not sufficient for me to permit the question of his mental capacity to go to the jury, and I therefore direct the jury to render a verdict for the defendant.] [1]</p>
