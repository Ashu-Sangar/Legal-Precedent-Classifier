The fund raised by the sale of the goods was claimed by C. &amp; Co., and also by the receiver of the corporation. Two witnesses testified that the writing was executed to prevent the goods from being attached prior to the general assignment. Three witnesses testified that the assignment was made for the purpose of preferring C. &amp; Co. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the auditor committed no error in admitting parol evidence to show the consideration-for the execution of the paper; (2) that the paper was a valid equitable assignment; (3) that the finding of the auditor, confirmed by the court below, that the parol evidence was insufficient to vary the terms of the writing would not bo reversed by the Supreme Court; (4) that the knowledge by the corporation of the acts of its secretary and its failure to repudiate them were sufficient to warrant the auditor in considering the assignment ratified.</p>

It does show that Mr. Coates contended then that it should be preferred to an amount equal to the interest, and that it was not given for the exclusive purpose of preventing attachments. It is far from clear that this evidence supports the testimony of Mr. Potts. Wo are of the opinion that the evidence offered is insufficient and not clear enough to vary the terms of the assignment.

The by-laws of the corporation gave the treasurer custody of the funds of the corporation, gave him power to manage and conduct the operations of the mill and the business generally in accordance with the direction of the board. In pursuance of this very general power the treasurer, who was also chief executive officer and general manager, had, with the knowledge of the company, general supervision of all business, paid all bills, bought and sold goods, arranged with commission houses to sell on consignment, signed notes, drafts and checks, employed and discharged the hands and workmen, and exercised, without disapproval of the directors, all powers necessary to carry on the business. The directors seemed to meet every three months, but the minutes disclose the transaction of very little, if any, business, and do not show any action of the directors in conducting any particular business, or that the acts of the treasurer were approved or disapproved. If the proceeds of the sale of the goods in the hands of O. J. Martin &amp; Co. had been in the bank account of Rose Valley Mills there can be no question that the treasurer had authority to draw a check for the amount to Edward H.

Coates &amp; Co., because the assignee of Rose Valley Mills, for the benefit of its creditors, clahned them, and would not give them to the assignee because E. H. Coates &amp; Co. claimed them and, to get the matter adjusted, an agreement was entered into between the assignee and E. H. Coates &amp; Co., on May 9,1892, wherein it was agreed that the goods be sold, if not then sold, and that their proceeds be paid to the United Security, etc., Co., and that a suit for the proceeds be brought to determine who had the right to the money. It was afterward agreed by the parties that the dispute be referred to your auditor. After the agreement was entered into, Mr. Potts went to see 0. J. Martin &amp; Co., and obtained from them a draft, which represented the goods sold, indorsed to the order of the United Security, etc., Co., and the warehouse receipt which was indorsed to him as treasurer, and which represented the goods which had not been sold. The draft and warehouse receipt were turned over to the United Security Co., in pursuance of the agreement, and they had never been in the hands of E. H. Coates &amp; Co. The draft and warehouse receipt were transferred by O. J. Martin &amp; Co., for the purpose of getting them into the hands of the stakeholders. Upon this state of facts, it is urged:</p>

Coates &amp; Co. did not pass the goods unsold in the hands of O. J. Martin &amp; Co. I think it cannot be doubted but that it was the intention of all parties in interest to transfer everything in the hands of O. J. Martin &amp; Co., belonging to Rose Valley Mills. “All money now due and to become due for goods consigned,” is the language of the assignment. The goods were placed in the hands of 0. J. Martin &amp; Co. for sale, and the proceeds of those sold at the time of the assignment of E. II. Coates &amp; Co. undoubtedly passed to them, and those unsold had been in the hands of Martin &amp; Co. for some time, and were put there for sale, and the clause in the assignment, “All money to become due,” certainly contemplated a transfer of that realized by a sale of those not then sold, and would certainly put the goods themselves out of all reach and control of the Rose Valley Mills. Your auditoi <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>is of the opinion that it would, be drawing too fine a distinction to hold that the goods in the hands of Martin &amp; Co. for sale, did not pass by the assignment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[277,521,1180,1274]]]'>2. That E. H. Coates &amp; Co. cannot claim them as against the assignee, because they did not have them in possession. Your auditor does not understand the law to be that an assignee of goods must take actual possession of them when they are not left in the hands of the assignor. The general rule is that possession must be given to the vendee when the property sold is in vendor’s possession and, in determining the kind of possession necessary in the vendee, regard must be had to the character of the property, the location of it, the nature of the transaction, the position of the parties and the intended use of the property. In this case, when the property was assigned, it was out of the actual possession of the assignor, and the assignee of it had quite as much possession after the assignment as the assignor had before. It had been placed in the hands of a commission merchant for sale, and was at the time of the assignment in his hands for that purpose, subject to his charges, and of course E. H. Coates &amp; Co. would only take possession of the goods and money subject to the charges of the commission house, and only wanted the proceeds of the sale of the goods, after being converted into cash. Your auditor is therefore of the opinion that the assignment to E. H. Coates &amp; Co. passed the money, together with the goods in the hands of Martin &amp; Co. for sale, and that the possession of E. H. Coates &amp; Co. was sufficient under the circumstances, and sees no reason to change his report.</p>

Mr. Potts, the principal creditor, excepts to the auditor’s construction of the paper executed by him for the company, purporting to assign to E. H. Coates &amp; Co. the commission account of the company in the hands of O. J. Martin &amp; Co. of New York, dated February 29, 1892.

The points in dispute may be reduced to five: 1. What is the proper construction of the paper of February 29, 1892, unaffected by the parol testimony? 2. Is the parol testimony sufficient to either explain or vary the writing ? 3. If the paper is to be construed as an assignment of the money and goods in the hands of O. J. Martin to E. H. Coates &amp; Co., had Mr. Potts authority to make such a contract, to be binding upon both the company and’ its creditors ? 4. Has the auditor allowed Mr. Potts too much for his services as general manager of the concern ? 5. Has the auditor properly distributed the fees and expenses in charging them to the fund instead of charging the dividends awarded to the several litigants ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b147-6" data-blocks='[["BL_147.5",147,[186,1020,1175,1373]],["BL_148.1",148,[239,369,1182,2029]],["BL_149.1",149,[169,373,1166,554]]]'>The paper, standing alone, would undoubtedly be an equitable assignment if it was for a good and sufficient consideration and was authorized by the company. On its face, it states no consideration. This, however, can always be proved by parol. The uncontradicted evidence on both sides is that the Rose Valley Mills owed E. H. Coates &amp; Co. an honest business debt more in amount than the highest value of the goods and money assigned. It was also competent to hear parol testimony as to any latent ambiguity in the paper. It speaks of “ money due and to become due,” etc. The uncontradieted parol testimony is that it was intended to cover all the property in the hands of 0. J. Martin &amp; Co. that could be attached, and that the subject of the alleged assignment was the goods and money of the Rose Valley Mills in the hands of their commission merchant, 0. J. Martin &amp; Co., of New York. This far, therefore, the auditor has heard proper testimony to enable him to construe the paper. If the evidence of a contemporaneous parol agreement giving to the paper a meaning different from its apparent meaning has not been sufficient in law to have that effect, then the construction put upon this paper by the auditor is correct, and the chief exception must be dismissed. This brings us to the second question. Is the parol testimony sufficient, of a contemporaneous parol agreement that this paper should only be used for the benefit of all the creditors and that its object was to assign the money and goods to Edward H. Coates &amp; Co., as a trustee for all the creditors so as to place the property beyond attaching foreign creditors. The auditor has found <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>against this proposition, and we are not convinced that this is erroneous. He had the witnesses before him, and was able to weigh the testimony better than the court can by a mere reading o£ it. This brings us to the third question. Had Mr. Potts authority to make such a contract? It may be conceded that he had not such authority either as secretary or general manager. And unless there is sufficient evidence of a ratification of his contract by the company, we are of the opinion that this point was well taken. We find, however, that the company, from the time the paper was signed, knew of its existence, and have not from then till now repudiated it. The assignment that was made by the company a few days after the date of the paper virtually recognizes it; as the assignee in his inventory of the assets names the commission account of O. J. Martin &amp; Co., and notes it as subject to the claim of Edward H. Coates &amp; Co. “ Potts was the active business executive of the company under its by-laws.” I quote from Mr. Johnson’s paper-book. There was a meeting of the directors after the date of the paper, and after an alleged compromise with all the creditors, including Coates and Co., and after the Eose Valley Mills Co. had full knowledge of the existence of the paper. In addition to this, the company and assignee claimed under the assignment. The tripartite agreement to select a stakeholder until the effect of the paper should be construed, was a clear ratification of Pott’s power to make it. Not only was no action taken to repudiate it, but on the contrary it was regarded by the company as a valid transfer of the claim in New York, at least so far as to protect the property frem attaching creditors. True, Mr. Potts says the company supposed his construction of the paper was all the effect it was to have, but a mistake in law will not relieve them. We are, therefore, of opinion that the learned auditor has given the proper construction to the paper, and that its legal effect was to vest in E. H. Coates &amp; Co. the title to said goods and money, not only as to the company but as against its creditors. By the uncontradicted testimony the intention of the parties was that this paper was to have the effect'of defeating any foreign attachment, which it could not have unless it was a full and absolute assignment, bona fide, made before the levying of the attachment. The fourth question is: Has the auditor allowed Mr. Potts more than he was entitled to under <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>his agreement and the resolution of the company, as measured by the services he rendered. ? It must be remembered that Mr. Potts was the factotum of the concern; that the company had agreed to the compensation claim; that the company, although it had reorganized and held a meeting afterwards, did not change it. It must also be remembered that the success of business was doubtful, and the result has shown that all he could receive was his dividend. Under all the circumstances we do not feel like disturbing the finding of the auditor on this point. His findings upon the fifth and last point are entirely satisfactory, and in our judgment correct.</p>
