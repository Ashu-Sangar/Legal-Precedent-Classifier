There were specific provisions with regard to acceptance of notes not being considered as payment until actually paid, etc., and a guaranty that if the machinery and apparatus should not accomplish the results guaranteed in the specifications, then a reasonable time should be allowed in which to accomplish the results. On the same day another contract in precisely the same terms as the one just recited was made between the same parties for the erection of another ice plantón another property of Segal in West Philadelphia. At the time when this contract was made, and for some time prior <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>and subsequent thereto, Joseph Koenigsberg had represented the Hercules Ice Machine Company as its agent for the purpose of obtaining contracts upon which he received commissions, and on each of the foregoing contracts he was entitled to receive a commission of $9,000. At some time prior to July 12, 1895, the Hercules Company had suggested that Koenigsberg accept in part payment of this commission, $10,000 of the bonds which Segal had agreed to pajr under his contracts, but this Koenigsberg declined to do. Writing on July 12,1895, to the president of the company, he said: “ I have carefully gone over the entire correspondence relative to the Segal bonds, and while it is true that you have insisted several times that I must accept $10,000 in bonds as a part of my commission, the whole correspondence very pointedly indicates that you are in error in the premises. .... My commission is due and I will take bonds if you have them, or I will take acceptances or cash, the form of the payment being immaterial. I do not consent and never have consented to take these bonds for my commission, with the possibility that they may not be delivered to me in one year or ten years.” He received no reply to this letter and on July 17, 1895, he wrote again to the Hercules Ice Machine Company, proposing that the company should give him an order on Segal for $10,000. He wrote : “ The order is not to specify ‘ bonds,’ nor that the amount named is due as commission merely on Segal contracts. With this order in hand I will go to Philadelphia and attempt to collect the claim; it being understood that I accept the order as payment to the amount named, provided Mr. Segal honors the same, but otherwise the order is void.”</p>

But I will have to have a guarantee from Mr. Allison personally, as I will not take their word for it. I will also say that if I do not hear from them in ten days from this date, I will begin suit for damages,” and he again refused to give any bonds to Koenigsberg until the Hercules Ice Machine Company had fulfilled its contract, as he claimed it should have been fulfilled.

The first conclusion of lawr, that Koenigsberg never agreed to accept the order upon Segal for $10,000 of bonds as payment of his claim, or as collateral security therefor, is a deduction from the admitted facts. The test of his right to consider it as payment is whether at any time subsequent to his receipt of this order the Hercules Company owed him less than the full amount of his original claim, and could have successfully set up his acceptance of the order for these bonds as payment pro tanto of his claim. It seems impossible to reach such a conclusion. His original proposition was that he should be given an order for $10,000 cash, “ to be void ” if not honored. He did not receive an order for this amount of cash, but one calling for bonds to this amount, but it was not honored, and <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>lie subsequently wrote to the Hercules Company, “ tliis throws the responsibility for the immediate payment of my commission directly on you. I insist that you pay me the amount either by check or acceptances, either in one payment or in substantial instalments.” In the face of such a positive repudiation of this form of payment it would have been impossible to hold that he had accepted the order in payment. Koenigsberg’s subsequent conduct entirely accords with this finding. On December 6, 1895, he wrote for another order on Segal for $10,000 in bonds, and very shortly after, not having received the second order, he assigned to the Colonial Finance Company, not the balance of his claim, but his entire claim against the Hercules Company, without allowing any credit for the bonds, and still further acting upon the theory that there had been no payment on account, commenced suit by way of foreign attachment to the use of the finance company, and through his counsel stated that his cause of action was the original balance of account assigned to the finance company. It might well be that this subsequent course of conduct would not of itself necessarily determine his rights under the order of July 19, 1895, but it goes to show still further his attitude of mind on the subject, and that he never accepted the order for the bonds as a payment on account. It is certain that he never acquired title to any specific bonds, and that no action of trover would have lain against Segal had he parted with all of the bonds due and owing to the Hercules Company. Neither could Koenigsberg have sued the Hercules Company in trover or replevin.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b633-5" data-blocks='[["BL_633.5",633,[174,1738,1161,92]]]'>It goes without saying that if the first conclusion of law is correct, the second and third follow as necessary corollaries.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b633-6" data-blocks='[["BL_633.6",633,[173,1840,1164,399]]]'>As to the third conclusion, not much room is left for doubt upon reading the contract of September 20, 1895. Whatever might have been said in support of Segal’s intention that he had advanced the $1,000 to Koenigsberg on the faith of the order of July 19, as to the correctness of which there might be some reasonable doubt, this argument fails in the face of the agreement of September 20, that on that day he owed $500 in cash and $12,000 in bonds.</p>

The referee found as facts that Koenigsberg presented the order to Segal, gave him a copy of it, and kept the original, and that Segal declined to deliver the bonds on the ground that the ice machine company had not finished its work, but subsequently expressed in writing his willingness to do so if the company would give a guaranty to do certain specified things with respect to the machines, and loaned him $1,000 on his due bill in which he promised to deliver the bonds back to Segal as collateral as soon as he received them. It is claimed by the appellant, assignee of Koenigsberg, that these matters amounted to an assignment of the bonds, which took precedence of a subsequent assignment to the use plaintiff. In support of this contention cases are cited to the effect that no particular form of words is requisite for a valid assignment of a fund or a chose in action, and that contingent interests and expectancies may be the subject of a contract which will be enforced when the event happens. These legal principles are entirely sound but they are not applicable to the facts of this case. There can be no assignment, any more than any other contract, without the meeting of the minds of the contracting parties, and the referee has found here that neither Koenigsberg nor Segal accepted the order as a contract. On the contrary Koenigsberg not only did not receive the bonds, but never agreed to look to them as payment nor to release the machine company pro tanto as on a payment on account, nor on the other hand did Segal ever agree, in any manner that would bind him or make him liable, to deliver the bonds or to hold them for Koenigsberg on the order. The ivhole matter was an attempt at a settlement which was never reached, but remained <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>merely tentative. It is not necessary to review tbe evidence on wliicli tbe referee readied tliis result. His findings of fact are practically unchallenged, and bis conclusions follow as corollaries from them.</p>
