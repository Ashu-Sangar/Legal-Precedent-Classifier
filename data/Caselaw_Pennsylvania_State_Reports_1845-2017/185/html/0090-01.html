The pain soon left him, and he set up a step ladder in the open wagon, and for an hour and a half picked cherries, standing on the ladder. For two days he was able to-attend to his business as a real estate and insurance agent, but at the end of the third day he began to feel a pain in his back,. <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>and subsequently became paralyzed in his lower limbs.

    <p class="summary" id="b111-7" data-blocks='[["BL_111.7",111,[155,1124,1171,660]]]'>There is a contention as to the meaning of the word immediate as used in this policy. One contention is that by the word “immediate ” here is meant direct; owing to a particular cause, and no other cause. Against this it is insisted that the word “immediately” here means instantly. [The court is of the opinion that the word immediately, as here used, is to be taken as an adverb of time, and that it here relates to the time of the disability, and that it is here used in the sense of instantly, or at once, but that, owing to the nature of the contract which these parties made there is not to be attached to it the strict idea that it means instantaneously, or at the same time, but that it seems that the disability must have resulted within a reasonable time after the hurt.] [8]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b111-8" data-blocks='[["BL_111.8",111,[154,1792,1171,658]]]'>[This policy undoubtedly covers cases of disability other than those where a man is immediately and absolutely paralyzed by a blow or a fall, or where he is so injured that he cannot for even an instant afterwards do anything in the line of his business. The court is of the opinion that it means disabilitj- resulting within a reasonable time after the injury. There might be the case of a man who immediately upon being hurt would be unable to attend to his business, and there might be cases where, a few minutes afterwards or a few hours afterwards, the disability would ensue; and there might be other cases where in a month or a year afterwards results might appear which would disable a man, and which could be traced to the injury received a month or a year before.] [9]</p>

      <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>[By the use of this term “ immediately ” the parties no doubt meant something; they manifestly meant to exclude the idea of liability on the part of the company to pay 125.00 a week if a man should be hurt to-day but attended to his business for a whole year afterwards and then the disability ensued. In this case it appears from the testimony of the plaintiff that he went to his office on the first and second day after the fall, and that he attended to some slight matters of business; all that we know that he attended to directly is the receipt of rent from a few persons, and then, if you believe the testimony of the plaintiff and his wife, he practically on Sunday evening, the evening of the third day after the fall, became disabled so that manifestly he could not attend to his business of real estate and insurance agent, and the court is of the opinion that if the disability resulted, as has been testified to here, on the third day afterwards, and that there was a continuous ailment and pain felt from the time of the fall, and that it continued to grow worse until it became so serious that the man was compelled to lie down and could not walk, we think this requirement of the policy has been met, and that the jury may say that the disability resulted immediately, and when the court says this we are aware of the fact that it is not for the jury to say whether it occurred in a reasonable time. What is reasonable time in a matter of this sort is a question for the determination of the court, and the court say to you that reasonable time would be three days, or four days, under the circumstances of this case as the plaintiff’s testimony discloses it.] [10] Therefore, gentlemen of the jury, you will inquire whether it is proved that the plaintiff was disabled from transacting any and every kind of business pertaining to his occupation of real estate and insurance agent, and whether his disability resulted altogether from the cause alleged, and whether he was continuously disabled. If he recovers he can recover only for the weeks that he was continuously disabled, that is, for the weeks that the disability was continuous from the beginning. For instance, if a man were disabled and got well so that he could attend to his business again, and then had a relapse and was disabled again, such subsequent time would not come in under the policy. You will decide whether the disability which, it seems, resulted on the third or the fourth day was the certain result of the fall, and <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>whether the injury sustained by that fall continued all the time as the plaintiff says it did. I have already said to you that this policy covers only a case of external accidental injuries. The plaintiff has based his claim upon the injury resulting from his fall; if he has not proved that his injuries resulted from that fall he cannot recover, and it must, of course, appear that it was accidental; if a man was to fall intentionally for the purpose of hurting himself to lay ground for a claim against an insurance company he could not recover; but there is no allegation here that there was any such attempt at fraud.</p>
