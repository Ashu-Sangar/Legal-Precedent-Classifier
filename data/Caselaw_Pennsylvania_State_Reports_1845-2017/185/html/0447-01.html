Brown were engaged in the dry goods business and a species of banking business in Philadelphia, under the firm name of John PI. Brown &amp; Company. They had a large capital, and they used in the banking business deposits which were made with them from time to time, as well as their own money not used in the dry goods business. On January 1,1845, they took the plaintiff, who had been their salesman for a number of years, as a partner. The agreement of partnership was not reduced to writing, and while plaintiff contended that he was to receive one eighth of the profits of both branches of the business and bear his proportionate share of the losses, the two Browns furnishing the capital, and he to contribute his services, the surviving partner, John H. Brown, contended that plaintiff had an interest in the dry goods business only.</p>

This latter agreement was not in writing, and plaintiff contended that he was to contribute $20,000; that the amount of capital standing to his credit in the firm on January 1, 1853, was to be credited on this sum, and he was to pay interest on the balance until it should be paid out of the profits. This was denied in the answer of John H. Brown, who asserted that plaintiff was to be charged with interest on $20,000 as an additional theoretical contribution to the capital account, entirely irrespective of what might be standing to his credit.</p>

Swearingen, who had been salesmen for the firm, to give each of them seven and one hal per cent out of their (the Browns’) profits. The new firm conducted the business under the firm name of John H. Brown &amp; Company until 1860, when James W. Brown died. The remaining partners continued the business as before, gradually liquidating it, until December 31, 1860, when the firm was formally dissolved. The plaintiff and Blakemore, with a man named Brady, formed a new firm, called Garretson, Brady &amp; Co., which conducted the same business at the same place. The new firm bought the stock of the old firm, but, otherwise, tlie affairs of the old firm remained in an unsettled condition. Tlie settlement of the business of the old firm was delayed on account of the breaking out of the war, their business having been largely in the south. There was no agreement at any time between the partners of the late firm about the maimer of its liquidation or the person who should act as liquidator. The books were kept in the safe which had become the property of plaintiff. John H. Brown did not again enter into active business, but devoted the larger part of his time to the settlement of the old partnership affairs, occasionally consulting with the plaintiff and Blakemore. The moneys received by Brown in settlement were deposited with Garretson, Brady &amp; Co. by Brown, and drawn out by him, one Thomas Waterman keeping the accounts in the old firm’s regular books. Brown used as the office of the old firm of John II. Brown &amp; Company, the second floor of the building occupied by Garretson, Brady &amp; Co. The books were always open to the inspection and scrutiny of the plaintiff and Blakemore. The master could not find whether they did or did not examine the books and he found no evidence that either of them objected to the active part which Brown assumed in the settlement of the business of the old firm. The cash was exclusively received and deposited by Brown as to him seemed best. From 1860 to 1866 he loaned large sums of it to different persons without the knowledge of his former partners, but doubtless for the benefit of all. Garretson, Brady &amp; Co. borrowed $10,000 of the assets from Brown and repaid the loan to him. From 1861 to 1865 the plaintiff received $3,374.54 from Brown on account of liis interest in the firm.</p>

Brown commenced proceedings in the orphans’ court to compel an accounting from John H. Brown who had administered upon her husband’s estate. This matter was not finally settled until 1880. Up to this time the matters between plaintiff and Brown remained in statu quo. Plaintiff several times demanded a settlement from Brown, and Brown said he would have to wait until the litigation with James Brown’s widow was ended. This appears to have satisfied the plaintiff, who permitted Brown to remain ‘in the undisputed possession of the assets of John H. Brown &amp; Company without resorting to any legal means to obtain possession of the same. After the final settlement with Mrs. Brown, plaintiff, in 1881 or 1882,-again went to Brown and demanded a settlement and the possession of the books. Brown refused to give him possession but allowed him to inspect them and make an exhaustive examination of them, with an expert accountant. Waterman, the bookkeeper, by direction of Brown, made two statements from the books for plaintiff, which were designated as exhibits “ A ” and “ B ” respectively.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b470-7" data-blocks='[["BL_470.7",470,[269,1748,1170,95]]]'>It was contended that all of plaintiff’s claims, as set forth in his bill, were entirely within the statute :</p>

Brown or his estate as to any matters arising prior to 1861, for the reason that no matter what might have been liis relation to the affairs of the firm after that time, even if it was that of liquidating partner, all of the accounts prior to that date appearing upon the books were accounts stated, and conclusive as between the partners, and could not be inquired into under any circumstances. And that, for what took place after 1861, even if John H. Brown during any of the six years succeeding the respective dates of such entries might have been called to account, yet as the plaintiff had permitted those statutory years to go by without legal proceedings, he had lost his day in court and was now without remedy.</p>

Brown stood to Jacob Garretson at the time the bill in this cause was filed in February, 1883. Was John II. Brown the liquidating partner of John H. Brown &amp; Company ? If he was, then necessarily the statute of limitations did not begin to run against Jacob Garretson until June, 1881, the first time at which John H. Brown attempted to account to his late partner, and the bill for an accounting <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>was in time, and the plaintiff was entitled to maintain Inis action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.5",472,[262,475,1174,758]]]'>What is a liquidating partner ? A most careful search of decided cases in this state and elsewhere has failed to disclose any precise and well-considered definition of this relation, or to indicate what are the essential acts which are required from the members of a dissolving partnership to constitute one of their number a liquidating partner, or exactly what such a liquidating partner must do to show that he has accepted such position. It seems to be clear from all of the cases that formal action by way of vote, or written document, or similar process, is not a prerequisite to the exercise of such right bjr one member of a partnership, or to the legal imposition upon the partner so acting of all the duties and consequent responsibility of such office. Among such cases the following are pertinent and sustain such conclusion: Wilson v. Waugh, <a href="/pa/101/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="101 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="500925" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0233-01">101 Pa. 233</a>; Siegfried v.Ludwig, <a href="/pa/102/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="102 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="502751" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0547-01">102 Pa. 547</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b472-5" data-blocks='[["BL_472.6",472,[249,1243,1181,912]]]'>The term “liquidating partner,” and all that it implies, seems to have been the outgrowth of early English commercial usage, and has become part of the lex mercatoris, supported and approved through a long course of mercantile usage by reason of its simplicity, adaptability and almost necessity, under the usual and ordinary circumstances of commercial life. The impossibility, ordinarily, of all the partners attending to the unremunerative details of the closing of an ended business; the necessity for profitable occupation elsewhere, and the useless waste of energy which would happen if all of those interested devoted their time to this winding up, naturally brought vabout the result that such closing up of the ended business should be committed to the care of one of the partners, who should receive the assets, convert the same, collect the outstandings, pay the debts and divide the surplus among those entitled. The earliest cases treat such partner as a trustee for the co-partners, and hold him accountable for his acts and for the property in his charge, until his account and settlement are made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b472-6" data-blocks='[["BL_472.7",472,[252,2164,1174,247]],["BL_473.1",473,[203,333,1163,96]]]'>Your master has found nothing in the cases and sees nothing in the reason of the situation which requires that every act of the liquidating partner must be exclusive of any concert with his former copartners. On the contrary, the commonsense of the situation points to the advisability and usefulness of his <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>consulting them upon many points for the interests of all concerned, as would any trustee, if occasion required.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b473-5" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[203,436,1162,1323]]]'>The main and important feature to the mind of the master in the establishment of this trust relation between partners, and the main test to be applied to ascertain what the dissolved relations really are, is whether or not one of the partners actually received and disbursed the assets to the exclusion of the others, with their consent and by his own apparent voluntary action. If in any given case such appeared to have been the course pursued by all concerned without objection from any of them, although without any formal action, and it was found that one of the partners, from the time of the dissolution, had exercised the exclusive control of the disposition of the results of such partnership property, appropriating it as lie deemed best, keeping it in liis single control, paying to his copartners from time to time portions of such <em>net </em>results, and in similar ways taking care and disposing of the assets of the late firm, your master is of the opinion that lie would be a liquidating partner, under the common law, and charged with all the duties and responsibilities of accounting to his late partners for whatever disposition he might have made of such assets. Applying such tests to the present case, it seems to your master to be clear, and he so finds, that John H. Brown assumed the office of liquidating partner of the firm of John II. Brown &amp; Company, which was dissolved in 1860 by the death of James W. Brown of his own volition and with the consent of his copartners. Almost every circumstance narrated by himself and them attending this dissolution points to his exclusive custody of the assets. . . .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b473-6" data-blocks='[["BL_473.6",473,[201,1768,1164,602]],["BL_474.1",474,[254,328,1173,655]]]'>It is true that John IT. Brown, in his testimony at one place, does deny that he was the liquidating partner : but your master has found the establishment of such relation is a conclusion of law, rather than of fact; and his opinion is, and he so finds, that whatever John II. Brown may have considered his attitude to the old firm to be, what be did and said and his whole voluntary course after the dissolution, as matter of law, constituted him a liquidating partner, and placed upon him the duties and responsibilities incident thereto. Having so found, the importance of some of the other questions here raised fades away, and their solution becomes less difficult. His duty was a plain one, to wit: to take the assets and liabilities as he found them <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>at tbe time of dissolution, collect the assets, liquidate the debts and account for the balance properly. His being in such office could not in any way alter the previous relations of the parties, vary their accounts or in any way change their previously legal established rights. If the statute of limitations was running between them, his assumption of such office did not toll the statute nor open up all their settled accounts. And, beyond* all else, any erroneous entries made by him in the books, or unsubstantiated claims made in his final account, cannot be considered as -opening up the closed accounts of twenty odd years and throwing open the whole partnership accounts of these three firms for a new and general accounting in a court of equity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b474-4" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[241,992,1175,1064]]]'>Yiewed in this light, the giving by him to Jacob Garretson, upon demand, of the papers, exhibits “ A ” and “ B,” upon which so much stress has been laid, and the testimony attending which giving, has been previously extracted at length, is but the natural act of a liquidating partner. The fact that such papers show upon inspection that Mr. Brown attempted to charge against Mr. Garretson certain old claims which do not appear upon the books has, to the master’s mind, no legal significance. If such items were unjust or unsupported, or outlawed by time, they necessarily will drop out of the final true accounting; but to draw from them a promise to pay something else, or an agreement to open up all of the old accounts, or to toll the statute of limitations, is a most forced and inequitable conclusion. Despite the most able argument of the complainant’s counsel upon this point, after a careful study of the authorities relied on, your master fails to find anything in this transaction beyond the natural effort of a man to make his liability as small as possible, he being a liquidating partner bound to account, and does not find anything from which the legal inference can be drawn that the statute was tolled wherever it had run, or that the closed accounts were opened, wherever they had been closed.</p>

It appears from the books that the whole of such interest balance, $13,454.49, had been divided between and credited up to the two Browns, share and share alike, in their individual accounts. It also appears, and your master finds that Garretson had free and full access to the books at all times; did examine them from time to time, and made no objection to the entries as above mentioned. Apart from the finding in the early portion of this report that Garret-son’s partnership agreement did not entitle him to any share in this interest account, the master finds that these entries and the yearly profit and loss accounts and other entries in the books, were in the nature of accounts stated between these parties under such circumstances; that the statute ran against Garret-son from the time of the making of the same, and that he cannot recover therefor under this bill. That such accounts are accounts stated between partners on which the statute does run, is abundantly sustained by the following case: McKelvy’s App., <a href="/pa/72/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="72 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="434668" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0409-01">72 Pa. 409</a>.</p>

Garretson claimed the sum of $2,306.71, one fifth, or his partnership share, of a certain interest which he asserted should be charged against John H. and James W. Brown from the <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>years 1847-1858, upon certain large sums which they drew out from the firm and carried in a separate account in the ledger, in red ink, called the “ red ink loan ” account. An examination of the books discloses the facts that whatever may have been the occasion of these withdrawals, and whether or not they had justification, and whether they were loans to these men, or simply capital withdrawals which they had the right to make, all of the same were carried out of this red ink account and charged up to the respective capital accounts of the two Browns, prior to the dissolution in 1860, except the sum of $896.48, which was charged up to John H. Brown (after the death on February 6, 1860, of James W. Brown) on December 81, 1860, and December 81, 1861, for $695.64, after his death; and that during the entire period of the. running of this account upon the books, no interest appears to have been charged against the sums so taken out, nor any demand made by Garretson that interest should be so charged. This account and its subsequent disposition is therefore also of the nature of an account stated, and covered by the principles before referred to. Garretson cannot now charge either of his copartners with interest on these sums, as the claim is barred by the statute. But even were this not so, it is very doubtful from the evidence in the case whether such withdrawals were not entirely within the rights of the parties. There was not any agreement to charge interest on the amoúnts drawn by the partners, and in the absence of such agreement the legal presumption is that interest is not chargeable. This is too well established to require citation of authorities. It may be, as contended by complainant’s counsel, that the withdrawal of these sums seriously impaired the working capital of the firm, but in the absence of an agreement as to interest, and with no allegation or proof of fraud, and with the entries openly carried on the books, even beyond the question of limitation, the master fails to find any good reason for charging interest against the Browns on account of this withdrawn capital. The transactions were all finished and closed out upon the books as above mentioned, and for all of aboye reasons the master finds against this claim.</p>

This liquidation extended over a period of twenty-one years, before the liquidator rendered an account to the plaintiff. To restate the entire account from these books would be a most troublesome and tedious matter. Fortunately it is not necessary, as the account which was prepared under the direction of John H. Brown as a balance sheet on June 30, 1881, is made part of the bill filed by the plaintiff under the heading of exhibit “A,” and its main figures are not contested by the plaintiff, and are admitted by him to be correct.

It consists of the share — twenty per cent — of Garretson in the interest account on folio 18 of ledger C of the firm, which upon June 30,1881, stood undivided to the extent of #24,650.91.

No arrangement was made that salaries were to be paid to these two new partners, and, on the contrary, the books show that their salaries ceased upon their admission to the firm, and the profits apparently took the place of the salaries previously paid. There was some evidence offered and taken under objection subject to subsequent ruling, as to these and other transactions, the evidence being that of the plaintiff, of Thomas F. Blakemore and of John H. Brown. In the opinion of the master, all of this evidence, as well as all evidence of any of the partners affecting transactions prior to the decease of James <em>W. </em>Brown, was inadmissible, and he sustains the objection taken. That none of these partners were competent witnesses within the exceptions of the act of 1878, which was in force at the time they testified, or of the act of 1887, which was passed after their testimony was taken, seems clear to the master. James <em>W. </em>Brown had died in 1860. His estate was clearly affected by the claims of the plaintiff. His mouth was sealed.</p>

As his evidence upon this has been ruled out, further consideration of it is unnecessary, there being nothing upon the face of such account to indicate that it was opened for this purpose; (2) because the Browns had admitted the new partners without his consent, and had agreed to take care of them, in both sides of the account, out of their interest in the business.</p>

Yet the plaintiff, beyond making the administrator of James <em>W. </em>Brown a party to the suit, has never taken any action against said estate. As shown by the abstract of the pleadings at the commencement of this report, answers were not filed by the administrator of James W. Brown. Presumably the plaintiff is entitled to a decree pro confesso against such estate, but with that your master takes it he has no concern. An inspection of the bill discloses that its entire gravamen is against John H. Brown, who it is alleged owes the plaintiff a large sum as liquidating partner. Substantially nothing is claimed from the estate of James W. Brown. Your master is very much in doubt whether at this late day any claims against it could be enforced. However, it is clear that the plaintiff has not substantiated any of his claims against John H. Brown. The result of the accounting is to alter somewhat the figures of the credit balance due from the firm assets to the plaintiff, but this is not found to be due by John IT. Brown.</p>

Brown have been converted by him, and undoubtedly to a small portion of the same the plaintiff is entitled “to a share thereof;” but the master does not see his way clear to enter a decree against John H.
