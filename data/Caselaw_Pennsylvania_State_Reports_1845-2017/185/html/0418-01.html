I had taken the first ten minutes, and was resting, and the instructor was busy fm'ng something, and then he came and put me on my wheel, and took me once around; he thought, no doubt, I was capable of going alone. He put me on my wheel and took me once around the room, and then says, 1 Go ahead.’ I said, ‘ Don’t leave me.’ He said, ‘You are all right, push,’ and he started me around the room with a push. Q. Pie started you around the room with a push? A. Yes, sir; as they usually do, give the people a push and let them go. I was not capable of managing the wheel, and it went part way and struck a post — not another wheel, and I bounded off. I tried to get up and I was so jarred internally that I could not.”</p>

Plaintiff rested her right to recover upon the wilfully reckless act of the instructor in pushing her forcibly and violently from him in disregard of her entreaty and protest. It was error to say that plaintiff was injured because “in trying to go alone the bicycle was upset.” The very converse was the fact. Plaintiff was not “ trying to go alone.” On the contrary, feeling herself unprepared as yet to go alone, she appealed to the instructor not to leave her. This was the very point in the case. She had a right to demand this by virtue of the ticket she held, entitling her, if she desired it, to instruction to the extent of twenty lessons. Yet, after she has taken but three lessons, the instructor, not only gives no heed to her wishes not to be left alone, but propels her forcibly ahead with the words : “ Go ahead, you’re all right, push,” and she promptly collides with a pillar.</p>
