    <p class="summary" id="b192-12" data-blocks='[["BL_192.18",192,[281,1752,1168,302]]]'>We are asked to dismiss this appeal upon these grounds: first, the decree of the register of wills entered May 16, 1892, probating decedent’s will of May 17, 1888, has become final and conclusive; and second, the petitioner as guardian of the minor children of W. Cooper Wetheral, deceased, has no interest under the alleged will of January 27, 1888.</p>

The guardian claims that such disposition has been made by the substitution of his children, and points to the following clause of the will as making it.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b193-6" data-blocks='[["BL_193.6",193,[181,831,1166,854]]]'>This is not a clause of substitution, for, if under it the children take, it must be by inheritance, and the legacy consequently have to first vest in the parent legatee. As Mr. Wetheral died before the testator the legacy bequeathed to him never vested in him, and his children consequently could not inherit it from him, and have, therefore, no interest under this will. If, however, we are wrong in our construction of the will, the appeal has been taken too late. The decree of the register probating the will of May 17, 1888, was entered May 16, 1892, and no appeal was taken therefrom until May 15, 1897, five years, less a day, thereafter. This decree was under the act of March 15, 1832, conclusive as to the personal estate unless appealed from within three years, and its legality could not be inquired into collaterally: Carpenter v. Cameron, <a href="/watts/7/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts 51" data-case-ids="1846787" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0051-01">7 Watts, 51</a>. The appeal in this case was consequently not taken in time, and for this reason, as well as for want of interest in the appellant, must be dismissed.</p>
