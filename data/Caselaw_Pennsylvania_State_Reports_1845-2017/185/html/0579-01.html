But in cases of the settlement of estates, the qxxestion always is what proportion of the fund or estate before the court should be allowed to be expended by the executor or other trxxstee for the employment of counsel to aid, advise and assist him in its collection, final settlement and distribution, to and among the parties interested, whether creditors, heirs or legatees. The money is that of the parties interested therein, not of the trustee, and is to be expended only for proper and necessary services or advice of counsel axid the amoxxnt to be paid therefor must be a reasonable and fair coxnpensatioxi. In the present case, the question is, xxot whether the amount asked for has been fairly earned by counsel, for this may be coxiceded, but whether the whole <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>amount should properly be deducted from the fund included in the account. It is complicated from the fact that the fund was realized by proceedings instituted by the administrator for his own individual benefit. He is the only creditor of the estate, and to pay his claims the real estate was sold. The counsel employed by him as administrator is also his individual professional adviser and counsel. The administrator thus occupied the dual position as a trustee and as a creditor. As administrator it was his duty to sell the real estate for payment of debts, under the act of assembly, and if there were other creditors, and he should refuse to perform that duty, he would be liable to dismissal. In his individual capacity -he endeavored to effect an amicable compromise and settlement of his claims against the estate with his cotenant, and avoid proceeding to the extremity of a sale. But after long negotiations, they proved unavailing and, finally, by advice of counsel, he petitioned this court for an order of sale for payment of debts. A long and protracted litigation was then inaugurated. The judgments held by accountant as his claims against the estate were most strenuously attacked and resisted, both in this court and in the court of common pleas, and only after months of active opposition were they finally held valid claims and debts for payment of which the real estate could be sold. The real estate was finally sold at public sale, and in one instance a resale was had. Throughout, the continuous and constant services of counsel were required by the accountant, negotiations and settlements were made by counsel, who attended the sales and gave his personal attention to every matter connected therewith. His services and advice were in constant requisition, even down to the preparation of the account, its filing and adjustment before the court. For these laborious and constant professional labors and services the counsel for accountant deserves a liberal compensation. While this is the case, yet it must be reasonable; the amount realized is to be considered, ' and the views of the other tenant in common whose money is to be in part expended, ought not to be wholly disregarded. She, by her counsel, is of opinion that the accountant who as a creditor is so largely interested, should personally contribute towards the amount which his counsel considers bis full and fair compensation. In view of all the circumstances, the amount <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>realized, etc., the auditing judge has reached a conclusion that a fair and reasonable sum to allow out of the fund for the employment of counsel by the administrator as such will be the sum of $750, and this amount is accordingly allowed.</p>

In this the court fell into error. The first gift was to Henry and appellant absolutely. The qualifying clause which followed referred to tbe death of Henry unmarried and without children, and upon the happening of that contingency devised “his one half” to appellant for life with remainder to her surviving children, to be sold on the youngest reaching the age of twenty-one. The manifest purpose of the clause is to dispose of Henry’s half on the specified contingency, and there is no reference in it either express or by fair implication, to the half originally given to appellant. That was given to her absolutely but the other half if Henry should die unmarried and without children, was given to her for life with remainder to her surviving children. The direction for a sale when the youngest of such children should reach the age of twenty-one, notwithstanding the use of the words “the whole of the property” must be limited to Henry’s half, passing under the contingency, not only because that is the only subject of the clause, but also because a larger application of those words would be contrary to the prior gift in absolute fee to appellant and to Henry subject to the specified contingency. The contingency has not in fact happened: Henry is still living, and all that is coming to appellant is her half under the first devise. This she is entitled to have absolutely without security.</p>
