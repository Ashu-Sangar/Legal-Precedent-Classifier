Subsequently plaintiffs wrote defendants that on account of a strike they would be obliged to have an extension of time of about forty days to deliver the goods. Defendants wi’ote first that they could not make any change in the order, and then wrote canceling the order, stating that on account of plaintiffs’ inability to deliver the goods they had been obliged to leave them out of their price list, and that under the circumstances the goods would be of no use to them. It appeared that if the shipments had begun on the day designated in the contract it would have taken about four months to complete the deliveries. The notice of the refusal to make the extension was given one month and twenty-one clays before the time to which the change was requested to be made. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover damages from defendants.</p>

We think it quite clear that by the explicit terms of the contract the plaintiffs were bound to commence the deliveries of the goods by shipping one hundred dozens of the pants during the period from April 15 to 20. This was to be followed by further weekly shipments immediately thereafter of fifty dozens each until the whole quantity was delivered.

If an extension to May 25 was granted the deliveries would not be completed until the latter part of September. How important this proposed change in the time of the delivery was to the defendants, they subsequently expressed in their letter of April 18 to the plaintiffs. They there say: “Your inability to complete the contract under agreed specified dates has greatly inconvenienced us, inasmuch as we were about to list the goods as a profitable item in our catalogue, and were compelled to leave them out on account of your inability to deliver. We do not now wish to be put to the further inconvenience of receiving a lot of merchandize that we cannot sell because we could not advertise them.

They were under no obligation to consent to the change; they had a right to stand on their contract, and if the plaintiffs failed to commence their deliveries according to the contract they had a perfect right to refuse to receive them. In point of fact the plaintiffs did not deliver nor did they offer to deliver the goods at the time fixed by the contract. We know of no reason why the defendants should be held liable in damages for declining to agree to the proposed change in the contract. Unless they were in technical legal default for refusing to make the change there could be no such liability. But it is very clear to us that they were in no default for declining to agree to the change, and surely they could not be held to be in default for giving <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>notice that they would not so agree. They had a right to take the plaintiffs at their word when they said they Avere obliged to have an extension and gave as a reason that they were unable to employ the necessary hands. The reply of the defendants was promptly made and it was emphatic. Being made on April 4, it Avas one month and twenty-one days before the time to Avhich the change Avas requested to be made. It is difficult to understand how the plaintiffs could liaAre suffered any damage when the notice of refusal to make the change was given at so early a period. But whether damage was sustained or not it Avas not through any fault of the defendants, and they cannot in fairness be held responsible. We think the learned court beloAv unwittingly fell into error in holding that before the defendants could decline to agree to the proposed change in the contract, the letter of the plaintiffs must have contained also the statement of the plaintiffs that unless the extension was granted they could not comply with the order and Avould not attempt to do it. We do uot understand that there is any such rule of law, and we are not referred to any authority for such a proposition, nor have avo been able to find any. There is no question of technical cancelation requiring the consent of both parties involved in the case. In using the word “ cancel ” in their letter of April 4 and the Avord “cancelation ” in their letter of April 13, the defendants Avere merely expressing their refusal to consent to the proposed change and their decision not to be further bound by the contract, and that, as we have seen, they had a right to do. Entertaining these views we are obliged to sustain the assignments of error.</p>
