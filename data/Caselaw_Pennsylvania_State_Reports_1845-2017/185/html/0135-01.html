They made estimates without his knowledge; drew up an agreement dissolving the partnership and demanded his signature which was given.

    <p class="summary" id="b157-10" data-blocks='[["BL_157.7",157,[189,1699,1172,554]]]'>1. In January, 1882, Israel Bittenbender, Abraham Bitten-bender and John M. Kemmerer formed a copartnership under the firm name of Israel Bittenbender, afterwards Bittenbender and Company, for the purpose of carrying on the business of wholesale and retail dealers in hardware, wagonmakers’ and blacksmiths’ supplies, on Eranklin avenue, in the city of Scranton. In addition to their stock in trade, the partners became the owners of certain pieces of real estate, designated in the pleadings and in the evidence as the Franklin avenue property, the Mifflin avenue property, the Washington avenue property, and a one fifth interest in the Williams property.</p>

He had also lost some money in gambling. About December 1, 1895, he said to his copartner, John Kemmerer, that he wanted $7,000. After some further talk, the three partners met about December 6. It was ascertained by this time that Israel needed about $13,000 instead of $7,000. At this interview several solutions of the difficulty were suggested, such as an assignment for the benefit of creditors, a sheriff’s sale of Israel’s interest in the firm, or a private sale by Israel of his interest to his copartners. The latter method was agreed upon. Figures were discussed as to inventory of stock, book accounts, notes, valuation of real estate and manner of payments. These figures are found in plaintiff’s exhibit, and I incorporate them in this finding of fact.</p>

According to the terms of the contract, Israel Bittenbender was to convey by deeds his interest in the several pieces of real estate owned by the firm. Demands were made upon him several times for these deeds, and on April 17, 1896, Israel said to Kemmerer that he and his wife would acknowledge the deeds, but that there was a discrepancy in the figures as to the amount due on a certain note, A mistake had been made. The difference amounted to $804. This difference was settled by a bank note given to Israel, which note was paid when it became due. From the time the contract was signed, December 9, 1895, to April 17, 1896, when the difference mentioned was adjusted, and up to April 27, when the last monthly payment was made, Israel made no complaint to his former copartners concerning the terms on which the partnership accounts were settled. He said nothing and did nothing to indicate that he was dissatisfied. His conduct in receiving the monthly payments, and in permitting his notes to be paid without objection on his part, amounts to a ratification of the terms of the contract of sale. I do not consider such ratification essential in this case, but I find it as a matter of fact.</p>

A large portion of the testimony is directed to the question of Israel Bittenbender’s mental condition at or about the time the contract of sale was signed. It is contended on the part of the plaintiffs that, on account of his financial troubles, Israel was not in a fit condition of mind to transact business in December, 1895. This is denied, and controverted by testimony, on the part of the defendants. After due consideration of the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiffs’ contention on this point is unfomided. Not only was Israel in sound mental condition, and able to transact business, but he was fully aware of the nature .of' the transactions connected with the dissolution of the copartnership, and of the terms on which the partnership accounts were settled.</p>

Did the other two partners conceal any facts from him or did they take advantage of him in any way ? In answer to these questions, I find from the evidence that the settlement between the partners was just and honorable; that nothing was concealed by one from the other, and that no undue advantage was taken of Israel Bitten-bender by his copartners in the adjustment of their partnership interests; the books of the firm were always open to Israel’s <em>inspection; </em>his long experience in the business enabled him to form a judgment as to the value of the stock, and he had the same knowledge of the value of the real estate owned by the firm as the other partners had.
