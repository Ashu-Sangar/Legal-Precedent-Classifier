The redemption value of the ground rents was made equal to the value of the land and the advances. B’s rights under the contract became vested in other parties who, in order to extinguish the ground rents, tendered to A an amount which was obtained by deducting interest on the advances. A had paid all the advances when demanded, but there were certain advances still due which had not been demanded. A refused the tender and claimed an amount which did not allow for the advances still unpaid. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the transaction under the building agreement constituted a sale of the land; (2) that as the advance payments were to be made at a future time, and as all had been paid when demanded, no interest was chargeable against A; (8) that on a bill in equity to enforce the extinguishment of the ground rent A should pay the costs, inasmuch as he had been in fault in making an excessive demand.</p>

The obvious meaning of the agreement, therefore, is that the covenantor, in effect, sells to the covenantee an estate in fee simple in a rent, and the price paid therefor by the covenantee is the sum of two items — one the purchase money of the land, and the other the amount of advances thereafter to be made by the covenantee. This is a contract in the nature of an outright sale, in which the covenantor has already delivered the thing sold, to wit: the deed for the rent; and the covenantee has made the partial payments agreed on, namely, the price of the purchase money and some of the advances. It is true that there are still mutual covenants to be performed, namely, the covenantor is to finish certain buildings, and the covenantee is to advance more moneys. These, however, are auxiliary covenants, and do not relate directly to the principal matter of contract between the parties, such principal matter being the grant of a rent and the payment of its price. Auxiliary covenants such as these cannot have the effect to utterly change the nature of the principal covenant, their office being merely to aid or support it. Nor does the covenant for redemption of the ground rent help the plaintiff. Were it otherwise, all the thousands of ground-rent deeds containing clauses of redemption, made in Pennsylvania during the last two hundred years, would have been mere mortgages. Upon this ground, then, the plaintiff cannot stand; but even if he were right in his contention that the transaction was in substance a loan, he would not have advanced a step. If the transaction was a loan, then the ground rent was given as collateral security for the loan; and if this absolute deed was given as collateral security, then it was given in mortgage : Guthrie v. Kahle, <a href="/pa/46/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="46 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="420609" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0331-01">46 Pa. 331</a>; McClurkan v.

When this point is reached, we are confronted by the act of June 8, 1881, entitled “ An act relating to and defining defeasances in this commonwealth.” By the first and only section of this act it is provided: “ That no defeasance to any deed for real estate regular and absolute upon its face, made after the passage of this act, shall have the effect of reducing it to a mortgage, unless the said defeasance is made at the time the deed is made, and is in writing, signed, sealed, acknowledged and delivered by the grantee in the deed to the grantor, and is <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>recorded in tbe office for the recording of deeds and mortgages, in the county wherein the said lands are situated, within sixty days from the execution thereof.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[271,531,1170,351]]]'>Our courts have always held that ground rents are real estate, bound by judgment, and that they may be mortgaged like other real estate. Hypercriticism might urge a doubt whether the statute was applicable to rents, in view of the use of the words “said lands” near the end of the statute. The word “said,” however, seems to indicate that “lands” and “real estate” are here used synonymously.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b546-6" data-blocks='[["BL_546.6",546,[272,889,1169,906]]]'>When closely examined, the plaintiff’s right is made to turn upon a scrivener’s error. In drawing the agreement for the advances, he appears to have used the form appropriate where advance money mortgages, and not ground rents, are to be given. So trifling a blunder will not vitiate a deed nor lose an estate. Indeed, the plaintiff himself somewhat inconsistently relies upon the defendant’s duty to collect $199 from the sheriff as the basis of the validity of his tender; but tbe defendant could have had no right to this sum of $199, except as the owner of the rent in question. Upon the whole case, then, we see no ground for sustaining the plaintiff’s contention. Were the transaction merely usurious and oppressive, and the form it was made to assume merely colorable, there might be ground for the interposition of a chancellor. Here, however, we have parties of mature age, of competent understanding, willing and able to contract, and who have contracted. Under such circumstances equity, like law, demands that they abide by their contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b546-7" data-blocks='[["BL_546.7",546,[272,1812,1171,607]],["BL_547.1",547,[176,362,1167,1733]]]'>The justice of this conclusion becomes obvious when the true point at issue is made to appear. The defendant bought a ground rent, a part of the consideration money for which was payable at a future time. The plaintiff, in substance, contends that on these delayed payments he has an equitable right to demand interest from the date of the deeds, because he began to pay his ground rent from that date, under the terms of the deeds. Interest, however, in the view of our law, if not contracted for, is in the nature of a penalty, and a penalty cannot be imposed save for some default. It is not pretended that the defendant failed to pay any of his advances at the time when they were properly demandable, nor, indeed, is he alleged to <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>have ever refused the payment of any. Undoubtedly the plaintiff is entitled to obtain from the defendant deeds of ex-tinguishment of the ground rents upon the payment of the amount required for tlieir redemption. The right of the plaintiff being so obvious, and Ms willingness to exercise it having been shown so emphatically, one wonders liow this controversy could have arisen. We are hound to say that the defendant does not appear to be free from blame. He admits that on November 23, 1893, lie claimed from the plaintiff the sum of 812,798.53 as tbe amount proper to be paid to Mm before be should be required to extinguish the ground rents. In this he was in error. The plaintiff was obviously entitled to a credit of 81,590 for the amounts covenanted by tbe defendant to be advanced, from which covenant the said plaintiff then and there proposed to release Mm, and actually tendered Mm a release. The plaintiff was, furthermore, entitled to a credit of 8199 for arrears of rent which stood to the credit of the defendant with tbe sheriff. When plaintiff on that day tendered him the 811,000, the defendant, if he had not made an erroneous and excessive claim, might have simply stood mute. But, instead of this, he had made an alternative claim of 811,998.53, by saying that <em>he </em>was willing to deduct $800 from the amount first demanded. This alternative claim was likewise erroneous and excessive. By this conduct of the defendant, he, in effect, gave notice to the plaintiff that the disparity between their calculations was so large as to be irreconcilable, whereas in reality there was only a trifling difference between them. By this error of the defendant -he defeated the settlement which would doubtless have been made then and there, and the flood of litigation thus loosed by him was swollen by new suits for arrears, in which the plaintiff has been uselessly subjected to additional costs and expenses. The defendant having by his conduct produced this litigation, it is only just that he pay the costs.</p>
