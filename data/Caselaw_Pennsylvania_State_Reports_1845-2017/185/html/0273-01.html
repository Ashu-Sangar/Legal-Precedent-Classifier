That the credit of $470.66 mentioned in the statement of claim was not originally a payment to the plaintiff on account of interest on said note, but a balance of a temporary loan of $4,000 made by the defendants to the said Robert Callaghan to tide over a financial emergency, and said balance was by agreement with him credited on said note, instead. of <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>being repaid to the defendants, and was so credited by the plaintiff by his direction, without the payment by him to her of any part thereof.

Defendants have a valid defense to the said note as against the said Robert Callaghan to the amount of $2,803.55 and interest from June 16, 1891, as follows: The said Robert Callaghan, soon after the death of George Callaghan, agreed to purchase from plaintiff the interest of said George Callaghan in a partnership existing between them as Callaghan Brothers, a part of the consideration being the assumption by the said Robert Callaghan of the liabilities of the firm at the time of the' death of George Callaghan. Among these liabilities, as defendants aver, was a sum of money due by the firm to said George Callaghan, as salary under their agreement of partnership, amounting, at the death of the latter, to $2,303.55, the said Robert Callaghan having under said agreement drawn a corresponding amount. A deed was prepared for the transfer by the defendants of said interest to him, but the defendant, Sarah E. Callaghan, refused to sign it, and the defendants to deliver it, unless the said Robert Callaghan would pay said salary. Thereupon, he promised to pay the same, and upon the faith of said promise the said Sarah E. Callaghan executed said deed, and the same was delivered by the defendants to the said Robert Callaghan, who, however, has never paid said sum, and now wholly refuses to so do.

The suit is on a note of which George Callaghan, now deceased, was the maker, and in which the plaintiff appears to be the payee. The plaintiff alleges in her statement of claim that she is entitled to the amount of the note with interest from April 1, 1891, less $470.66 indorsed thereon May 25, 1893. The defendants aver, in their supplemental affidavit, that the plaintiff is not now, and never was, the real owner of the note; that her husband, Robert Callaghan, <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>is the actual and beneficial owner of the same and that the suit upon it, is really “prosecuted for his use.” They also declare in this connection that they expect to be able to prove this averment on the trial of the case. It is further averred by the defendants that Robert Callaghan is indebted to the estate they represent in the sum of $2,803.55, with interest thereon from August 17, 1891, which sum they claim they are entitled to set off against the indebtedness of the estate on the note in suit. The nature and origin of Robert Callaghan’s indebtedness to the estate, the consideration of his assumption of it, and the agreement relating to it sufficiently appear in the affidavit and need not be repeated here. It may also be stated in this connection that the defendants aver that the credit of $470.66 already referred to was the balance of a temporary loan made by them to Robert Callaghan, and that the plaintiff by his direction and with their consent indorsed the same on the note, “without the payment by him to her of any part thereof.” This averment was doubtless intended as the statement of a circumstance corroborative of the defendant’s claim that the plaintiff’s husband was the owner of the note. The averments in the affidavit of defense must be accepted, on this appeal, as true, and they are clearly sufficient if established by competent evidence to allow a set-off against the note of the indebtedness of Robert Callaghan to the estate.</p>
