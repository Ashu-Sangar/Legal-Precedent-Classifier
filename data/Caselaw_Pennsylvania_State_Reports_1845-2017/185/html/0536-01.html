Subsequent to March 2, 1893, the plaintiff obtained from Mr. Howland an offer for the defendant’s house. He communicated the offer by a telegram to the defendant who was in Mexico. The defendant telegraphed Mr. Hazen that the plaintiff had submitted an offer, and in consequence of this communication the plaintiff had an interview with Mr. Hazen in regard to it. The offer was refused, a second offer was made and refused, and finally an offer of $90,000 made by Mr. Howland, was submitted by the plaintiff and accepted by Mr. Hazen, acting for the defendant. When the first and second offers were made the plaintiff desired that they should be submitted to the defendant, but Mr. Hazen said it was useless to do so, as he was bound by his instructions to accept no sum less than $90,000. When the offer of $90,000 was made and before it was accepted the plaintiff said to Mr. Hazen that, of course, he would expect the usual commission of two and one half per cent, and asked him to notify the defendant to that effect. Mr. Hazen replied that he had no authority to discuss the question of commission, and that it would have to be settled with Mr. Wanamaker. Mr. Hazen did not communicate the plaintiff’s demand for commission to the defendant. The offer of $90,000 having been accepted, the terms of settlement were agreed upon, and the sum of $5,000 was paid on April 15,1893, on account of the consideration, by a check of the purchaser, Mr. Howland, to the order of the defendant, and delivered to Mr. Nevin, a representative of the defendant, at a meeting at the plaintiff’s office in Washington, at which there were present, the plaintiff, Mr. Nevin, Mr. How-land and Mr. Hazen. Subsequently, the plaintiff ordered a title policy of insurance upon the property, and caused the deed to be prepared, and upon May 8, 1893, inquired of Mr. Nevin by letter, at what time the defendant would sign the deed, and on May 12, 1893, wrote Mr. Nevin as follows:</p>

Nothing, in the opinion of the referee, occurred in the subsequent relations between the plaintiff and the defendant to alter the status established by the interview between the parties and by this letter.

Plaintiff averred in substance that, acting for the defendant as his real estate broker, he effected the sale and thereby earned the commissions claimed. The defendant, on the other hand, denied that he ever employed plaintiff to sell the property or procuro a purchaser therefor, and also denied that he owed him the sum claimed or any sum whatever. It was, of course, incumbent on the plaintiff to prove a contract, express or implied, with the defendant. In that be signally failed. The evidence tended strongly to prove that he had two clients or customers, each of whom wished to buy property similar in grade, etc., to that of tlio defendant. For one of these be finally arranged, through defendant’s agent, satisfactory terms of purchase, and the property was subsequently conveyed accordingly ; but there is not a particle of evidence that the plaintiff was ever authorized by the defendant to represent him in the transaction. On the contrary, the defendant appears to have been studiously careful to avoid saying or doing anything from which any inference of employment as his agent for any purpose, might be drawn. The plaintiff’s suggestion, that irrespective of any contractual relation, whatever, between the broker and the vendor, it is customary for tbe latter to pay the commissions of the former, and therefore he is entitled to recover, cannot bo entertained. No such viciously bad custom as that should ever be recognized, unless it has been previously made the subject of agreement between all the parties concerned ■ — vendor, vendee and the broker. The plaintiff in this case was manifestly the employee of the person who afterwards became purchaser of the property, and hence be was not in a position to properly act as agent of the defendant. That “ no man can serve two masters ” is a sound proposition resting on the highest and best authority. Any alleged agency that is in conflict with ibis principle must rest on express contract between tbe parties in interest. As was said in Cannell v. Smith, <a href="/pa/142/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="142 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="976801" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0025-01">142 </a><a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a><a href="/pa/142/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="142 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="976801" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0025-01">Pa. 25</a>, “it is against public policy and sound morality for a man to act as broker for botlx parties, unless that fact is fully communicated to them.” To the same effect are Everhart v.
