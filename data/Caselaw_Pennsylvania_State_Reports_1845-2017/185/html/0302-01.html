Tozer is practically the sole cestui que trust, as he is in fact the principal one, and he is one of the parties to the confession of judgment given for his express benefit. A. R. Tozer received full consideration, therefor; he was individually liable for all the indebtedness of their late firm, and his liability was not increased so far as the creditors themselves were concerned, and at the same time he had acquired all the assets for the express purpose of paying the debts. Ralph Tozer himself testifies that he signed the bond as trustee of the estate of Sarah Tozer, at his son’s request. A. R. Tozer therefore consents that so much of his beneficial estate may be used for the purpose of paying this indebtedness, and expressly ratifies this act of his trustee, which he has the-legal right to do.
