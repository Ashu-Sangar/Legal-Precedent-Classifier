The purpose of this was to reduce the temperature of the storage room that the ice there stored might not readily melt. Ballingall, the president of the company, noticing that ice had collected upon the cold pipes, directed Flynn to shut down the brine pump for two or three hours; the effect of which would be, by removing the source of the cold, to soften the ice, and he further directed him that he should then have some one go along the pipes with an ice pick and the coating would then be readily removed. Flynn disobeyed orders and did not shut down the brine pumps. He was not present at the trial, having removed to Florida; but one Corner, who was a mere journeyman, testified that Flynn told him to take an axe and break off the ice from the pipes. Corner took an axe and struck the pipes a hard blow with the blunt end of the axe, with the result that the pipes, with the heavy coating of ice, fell, injuring the plaintiff, who had been employed some time before by the manager, as a kind of “ extra,” to do such work as might be required from time to time, for which he was paid by the hour when he was actually engaged.</p>

While his leg is healed of the fracture <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>and lie can walk, nevertheless, ho says he feels the effects of the injury, and he is not able to do as much work as he formerly did. [The basis of the claim is that the officers of the company superior to him desired those pipes cleaned, and that they gave orders to the men to see to it, to wit: by breaking off the ice with an axe and striking heavy blows upon it, and that those heavy blows struck upon it caused the rings which held it up to break, and all the pipes fell upon the plaintiff.] [4]</p>

The complaint, however, is not so much against the character of the machinery furnished as it is against the manner in which the machinery was ordered to be cleaned. [It is testified that the order to clean was given by the officer of the company to an employee who, obedient to orders, struck the pipes with an axe and thereby caused them to become dislodged, and the pipes and the ice on them fell upon the plaintiff.] [5] There is another rule of law, that where people are working together, that is, coemployees, and one is injured by the fault of the other, he has no remedy against his employer, because it was his coemployee who caused the injury. That is one of the defenses alleged here, that the injury was caused by the fault of a fellow-workman, and not by the fault of the company. As to that, however, [the plaintiff has produced some testimony showing that the orders to clean, these pipes that way were given by a superior officer, principal or vice principal of the company, in which case, the rule that exempts the company from the responsibility for the acts of fellow-servants, does not apply, and the company then becomes responsible for the injury which is the result of orders given by it or by its officers.] [6]</p>

[If, on the other hand, you believe that Corner did what he did by direction of some of the officers of the company higher in authority, then that rule of law does not apply and you can find a verdict against the company] [7] for damages in favor <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>of the plaintiff. That is really the pinch of the case. [What was the relation between - these parties ? You are to settle it upon the testimony. By whose orders were these pipes hit with the axe ? By whose orders was that mode of cleaning adopted? By the orders of the officers of the company principals, or, was it the act of Corner alone, and were Corner and Prevost fellow-servants of colaborers ? If you find that Corner and Prevost were fellow-servants, working together in common work, and the accident was caused by the act of Corner, by his judgment in cleaning the pipes that way, it is Corner’s fault, and Corner’s fault only, and the company is not responsible. If you find, however, that that method of cleaning the pipes was adopted by the company, and they set Corner to clean that way, then tbe company is responsible to this plaintiff.] [8]</p>

The evidence is practically undisputed that the president of the company visited the factory several times a week and exercised a general supervision over its operation. Next to him in authority was Harper, the general manager who hired the men, including plaintiff, and “had entire charge of the business inside and out ” as one of plaintiff’s witnesses expressed it. Flynn was tlie chief engineer, and bad general charge of the engine room and the freezing department, of which he was the foreman or <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>boss. In that capacity he gave orders to the men in that department, and as the manager, Harper, testifies, had authority to engage men for short jobs in the manager’s absence.

If Flynn disregarded this order and directed it to be done in a different way, the defendant would not be liable in any event. Where the employer himself assumes control and gives an express order not only what to do but how to do it, even a vice principal is bound to obej1-, and becomes for the time being a mere eoemployee, whatever his general authority under other circumstances.
