The plaintiffs were not men of much education or knowledge of business affairs. Daniel is a gardener and Hugh was a fireman, who since the filing of the bill died in the performance of his duty. They were not men of means, but plain laboring men with families <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>to support. They had no money to pay the arrears of rent and other liens, and they had not sufficient business knowledge to know how to save their imperiled interests without a considerable outlay. The third party plaintiffs were the widow and five minor children, of a deceased brother, very poor, and of course, ignorant of business affairs. What did these cotenants defendants do under the circumstances? According to their own account they utterly ignored the widow and minor children, and put prominently before the other two plaintiffs the necessity of raising what was to them a considerable amount of money, and all their statements rested on the assumption that some one with money would have to take up the matter, and that the interests of those without money were doomed to be sacrificed. If in so acting they dealt in good faith and honestly gave their cotenants the best thought they had on the subject a question of some difficulty might be presented. We have, however, been unable to avoid the conclusion that at the time when the defendants puzzled two of the plaintiffs with the apparently insoluble difficulties of the situation, they had in their minds a method whereby all rights could have been saved with very little trouble, the method, which in point of fact, they promptly adopted. To us it seems that their bearing towards all the plaintiffs was, to use the language of Chancellor Kent in the somewhat analogous case of Van Horne v. Fonda, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Johns.%20Ch.%20888" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Johns. Ch. 888">5 Johns. Ch. 888</a>, “repugnant to a sense of refined and accurate justice, .... immoral because it would be against the reciprocal obligation to do nothing to the prejudice of each other’s equal claim, which the relationship of the parties, as' joint devisees created. . . . The parties had equal concern which created a mutual obligation, to deal candidly and benevolently with each other, and to cause no harm to their joint interest.” The plaintiffs are therefore entitled to the relief prayed for.</p>

    <p id="b366-7" data-blocks='[["BL_366.12",366,[272,1292,1185,555]]]'>We are not convinced that the learned court below erred in any of its findings of fact referred to in the second specification, or in its omission to find as complained of in the third and fourth specifications. It is not our purpose, nor is it necessary, to discuss here the evidence on which the court below based its findings. It is sufficient to say, there was testimony to justify them. So far as they are relevant they must therefore be accepted as true; and, on the facts thus established, we are not satisfied there was any error either in the conclusion complained of in the fifth specification or in the decree recited in the first specification.</p>
    <p id="b366-8" data-blocks='[["BL_366.13",366,[273,1856,1184,145]]]'>Finding nothing in the record to justify us in sustaining either of the specifications of error, they are all overruled, the ■ decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellants’ costs.</p>
