Plaintiff obtained a verdict, after which defendant opened the ditch, and a few weeks later closed the ditch and placed a pump stock with a bore of two and one half inches through the embankment. In a second action defendant offered in evidence plaintiff’s testimony in the first action, and claimed that he was furnishing water according to the standard set up by the plaintiff. It appeared that the supply which plaintiff received through the pump stock was entirely inadequate for his needs. <em>Held, </em>that there was nothing in plaintiff’s testimony, on the trial of the first action to justify the trial judge on the trial of the second action, in submitting to the jury the question whether plaintiff had set up a standard by which the water should be measured out to him through a two and one half inch pipe.</p>

As we have already said in your hearing, in the judgment of the court the first suit between them, which was tried about a year ago, settled Mr. Marshall’s right to have as mucli of this stream as was necessary for his domestic purposes, and for the purposes of his farming operations. That is the matter that was settled between them in that controversy, and we cannot gainsay it in this. [This jury will understand and take it as the court states it, that as far as the rights of these parties are concerned relative to this water, Mr. Marshall was entitled to have of the stream which Mr. Hershey claims to own just as much as was necessary for his domestic purposes and for the purposes of his farming operations. Now such a claim, as you will see, and such a result, leaves everything uncertain.] [7] If a gentleman complains that his neighbor, by the erection of a dam, is backing the water on him and thus doing him an injury, and the controversy results in a suit, and the plaintiff gets a verdict from the jury in his favor, it simply settles the question that the water is dammed back upon him to his injury.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b259-5" data-blocks='[["BL_259.5",259,[186,1384,1169,1016]],["BL_260.1",260,[255,368,1186,1683]]]'>Then it becomes the duty of the defendant to reduce his dam. How much is not settled. The jury did not determine whether it was to be an inch or a foot. They simply determine that the dam is too high. He removes a portion of his dam. If it does not suit the neighbor his only remedy is to sue again, and if the second jury’s verdict is for the plaintiff it still establishes the fact that the dam is too high, but does not say how much, and it is the duty of the defendant again to reduce his dam. And so one suit follows another, until a jury determines that the dam is where it ought to be, and there is no more backwater. Thus you see a controversy of that kind results in nothing definite, and so it would be here. Mr. Marshall, in the first suit, claimed that Mr. Hershey was taking all this water, was taking more than he ought to take, and the jury so found; and therefore they determined that Mr. Marshall had a right to some of this water. But how much? The court instructed the jury that he was entitled to have just as much as was necessary for domestic purposes and for the use of his property. That is a right that every man has who has a stream of water passing through his land, and his neighbor cannot de<a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>prive him of it. The neighbor above cannot consume all the water unless his necessities require it. If his domestic needs or the use of his stock require that they should drink up and use up-all the water, that he has a right to do, and the neighbor below cannot complain. But he cannot divert it, he cannot use it for' some other purpose and thus deprive the neighbor below. But we instructed the jury upon that trial, as you have heard, that. Mr, Marshall was entitled to just as much of this stream as was-necessary for his domestic purposes and for the use of his farm. But, as we have said to you, the verdict under those instructions-would settle nothing except that he was deprived of that right. Now if two gentlemen entering into a controversy see fit to-agree that the jury shall designate how high the dam shall be, or to what point the water shall come, they may do so, and then the jury would be justified in fixing something definite. But, nothing of that kind, of course, was done here. But the allegation on the part of this defendant is that Mr. Marshall did designate how much water was necessary for his domestic purposes and how much for his farming purposes ; that when that suit ended Mr. Marshall had fixed his right in this way. [If that is so, if Mr. Marshall did so fix his rights, then he is bound by it. If he said in the course of that trial that it takes so much water to comply with my rights, then he is bound to adhere to that. And the question here submitted for your consideration is whether he did so designate.] -[8] If he did not, then the' whole question is open for you to determine whether or not hege ts as much water now as is necessary to satisfy his domestic-purposes and lfis farming purposes. [But if he fixed what was necessary for those purposes, and Mr. Hershey supplies him with that amount of water, then he cannot recover, in the estimation of the court, from this defendant.] [9] Did he thus-fix his rights ? That will depend, as you have heard, upon what took place upon the former trial.</p>

Mr. Marshall did not say when he brought the suit that he was entitled to so much water, and therefore he did not set it out in his statement. But did he say so in the course of the trial, before the verdict was rendered? That will depend upon what took <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>place at the time of the trial. Mr. Hayes has called your attention to some matters connected with Mr. Marshall’s testimony, in addition to reading to you the statement which was filed in the case. I do not know that it is necessary for me to repeat what he has so lately read in your hearing, but probably there will be no objection to it, and it will probably impress your minds better.

On the trial <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>of that action the plaintiff, whose land is below that of the defendant, conceded the defendant’s prescriptive right to divert a part of the water to his mill, but he claimed that enough should be left to flow in the natural channel to supply the needs of his farm and dwelling. The defendant claimed the right to use all of the water, and had diverted all of it to his mill. The issue raised was decided in favor of the plaintiff, and his right thus established. The present action was defended on the ground that at the former trial the plaintiff had fixed a standard for the measurement of the amount of water to which he was entitled, and that he had since received all that he then claimed. Part of the testimony of the first trial was read to the jury, and it was left to them to find whether the plaintiff had at that trial fixed a standard and if so, whether he had been supplied according to his own measure.</p>
    <p id="b268-5" data-blocks='[["BL_268.5",268,[250,1138,1175,1064]]]'>It appeared at the first trial that the plaintiff had purchased his property twenty-four years before the commencement of any litigation concerning the water right, and that, at that time, at or near the point where the water was diverted to the defendant’s mill, a wooden pump stock ten feet long with a bore of two and one half inches extended through an embankment and conducted water from the mill race to the natural channel, and that' when it was unobstructed the supply was sufficient. This pump stock had been removed ten or twelve years before the trial. After its removal the plaintiff’s supply of water came by means of a ditch, until it was finally shut off altogether by the defendant. Immediately after the trial the defendant opened a ditch across the embankment, which furnished an adequate supply, but a few weeks later he closed this ditch and placed a pump stock with a bore of two and a half inches through the embankment, and then claimed that he was furnishing water according to the standard set up by the plaintiff for the measurement of his right, although the amount thus furnished was insufficient for the plaintiff’s use. In fact, at times, there was not enough thus furnished to reach the plaintiff’s property.</p>
    <p id="b268-6" data-blocks='[["BL_268.6",268,[249,2211,1170,197]],["BL_269.1",269,[194,358,1167,1380]]]'>By the statement filed in the former action the plaintiff did not limit his right but claimed the natural flow of the stream. At the trial he conceded the right of the defendant to divert a part, but he.distinctly asserted his right to have at all times an <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>uninterrupted flow of water sufficient for his needs. Whether he had this right was the question submitted by the charge and decided by the verdict and judgment. The plaintiff had shown that a part of the stream had passed in its original channel through his property immemorially until the defendant had diverted all of the water. In describing the condition of the stream when he first took possession of his property, twenty-four years before, he spoke of the pump stock by means of which the water was conducted from the mill race, and of its removal and the substitution of a drain for the same purpose, and said that the supply had always been sufficient unless the stock or drain became obstructed. This was in support of his claim of a right to have enough water, by showing that an uninterrupted supply had always been furnished; and nothing that he then said can be construed as limiting the right which he asserted by setting up a standard by which the water should be measured out to him through a two and one half inch pipe. The uncertainty of such a standard, as to both the quantity and sufficiency of the supply, is manifest. The quantity of water that would pass through the pipe would depend on the head of water in the mill race and the inclination of the pipe, and its position in relation to the current, and a quantity sufficient during a wet season might be insufficient during a dry one. We speak only of the testimony of the first trial which was introduced at the second, as it is all that the record presents. In this we find nothing which justified the submission of the question to the jury.</p>
