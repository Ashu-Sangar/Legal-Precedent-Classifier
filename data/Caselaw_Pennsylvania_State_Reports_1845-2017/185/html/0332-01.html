      <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>The petitioner and respondent are brother and sister. Their mother by her will gave all the rest, residue and remainder of her estate to a trustee in trust to manage the same and collect and receive the rents, issues and profits thereof and “ pay in semi-annual installments one full one-half part of net rents, income, interest, dividends and profits unto my son, Benoni C. DuPlaine, for and during all the term of his natural life,” etc. And the “ said trustee shall pay the remaining one-half part of the said net rents, interest, income, dividends and profits in semiannual installments unto my said daughter, Helen Augusta C. Childs, for and during the full term of her natural life,” etc. In the case of the death of either of the said life tenants, the principal was to go to their children, with, however, a power of disposition otherwise by will, and in default of children or a will, then cross remainders from one to the other. The brother had accidentally learned that the trustee was in an embarrassed condition financially and went to him and insisted upon a settlement for his one half of the principal sum which was in his hands as trustee, and under pressure of threatened arrest, etc., received from him a mortgage upon some real estate for exactly one half of the trust estate. The brother for several years concealed all knowledge of the insolvent condition of the trustee from his sister, and also the fact that he had tried to protect himself by securing this mortgage. This he now claims he holds for his own benefit alone, and that his sister has no interest therein. Such are briefly stated the facts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[147,1674,1167,350]]]'>It is hard to find language sufficiently strong to condemn the conduct of a brother who would thus try to secure himself and leave his sister in the lurch, and after he supposed he was himself secure not to give her the knowledge by which she might have been able to secure herself also; but the case is not to be decided upon any sentimental considerations, but upon the law as applicable to the facts as they are presented.</p>

She did not give one half of the principal to be held for each, but it all is to be held jointly in trust for both. In Aubert’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20Pa.%2052" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="119 Pa. 52">119 Pa. 52</a>, and in Wilen’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/105/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="105 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="454244" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0121-01">105 Pa. 121</a>, the Supreme Court laid down the law that where an estate is so given for two persons it is to remain intact until the time for distribution arrives, because “We cannot say,” to use their language, “ that a moiety of the income of the whole may not be more valuable to the surviving life tenant than the whole of the income of the moiety.” The time for the distribution of this fund has not arrived and, therefore, there can be no distribution or division of it, and in case of a devastavit, as has here happened, anything that the vigilance of either of the cestuis que trust or any one else has rescued from the wreck must inure to the benefit of both of them. It has been settled that where there is a community of interest there is a community of duty, each of those interested must be faithful to himself and equally as well to all the others interested. He can secure no advantage over the others, because he has found out something they do not know, or because perhaps he is in a better position to protect himself than are they.' The rule of law stated in Keech v. Sanford, 1 Leading Cases in Equity, page 64 (4th Am. ed.), has been followed in numerous cases in this state:. “Whenever one person is placed in such relations to another by the act or consent of that other, or by the act of a third person, or by the law, that he becomes interested for him, or interested with him, in any subject of property or business, he is prohibited from acquiring rights in that subject antagonistic to the person with whose interest he has become associated.” This doctrine was enforced in Weaver v. Wible. <a href="/pa/25/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="25 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="975855" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0270-01">25 Pa. 270</a>, the syllabus of which is as follows: “ When several persons have a joint or common interest in an estate, one cannot purchase an encumbrance or an outstanding title, and set it up against the rest for the purpose of depriving them of their interests.” Chief Justice Lewis, in delivering the opinion, said: “ Community of interest produces community of duty. ... A conveyance to one of several tenants in common, or a deed to one of two devisees of the same land, shall enure to the benefit of all who came in under the same title, and are holding jointly <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>or in common. . . . Where several persons have a joint or common interest in an estate, it is not to be tolerated that one shall purchase an encumbrance or outstanding title, and set it up against the rest, for the purpose of depriving them of their interests. Chancellor Kent, with great truth, remarked that such a proceeding would be repugnant to a sense of refined and accurate justice, and would be immoral, because it would be against the reciprocal obligation to do nothing to the prejudice of each other’s equal claim, which the relationship of the parties created. It is the duty of all to deal candidly and benevolently with each other and to cause no harm to their joint interests.” To the same purpose, see Lloyd v. Lynch, <a href="/pa/28/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="28 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="981596" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0419-01">28 Pa. 419</a>; Gibson v.

Whether they-did or did not is immaterial. The only claim the respondent had upon the trustee was as a cestui que trust under this will. He was not a creditor in any other way. When this mortgage was given to him the consideration passing was that the trustee owed this trust estate money. Therefore anything that he received upon that account must in law, equity, morals and common decency be held by him in trust for his sister as well as himself.</p>
