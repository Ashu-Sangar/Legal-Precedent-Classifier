Snavely and William Snavely. November 15, 1877, William Snavely and Nancy Ellen, his wife, conveyed all their right, title and interest in and to said premises to Henry C. Snavely, which deed was duly recorded November 16,1877. His interest was the undivided interest inherited from his father. November 15, 1877, Henry C. Snavely executed a mortgage upon the whole of said premises to Andrew Martin to secure a debt of $5,000, which was duly recorded November 16, 1877. On January 29, 1879, amicable proceedings were had in the orphans’ court of Centre county upon the petition of Rachael Snavely and H. C. Snavely for the purpose of fixing the widow’s dower. The dower was fixed at the sum of $4,470, and H. C. Snavely formally accepted the premises at the appraised value thereof, which was decreed by said court to him, his heirs and assigns forever, and entered into a recognizance to pay the widow the annual interest thereon, and at her death to pay the principal of said sum to the person or persons legally entitled thereto. On May 21,1880, H. C. Snavely executed a mortgage to J. H. Lick upon said premises to secure the payment of the sum of $6,000, which was duly recorded the <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>same day. On September 9, 1882, H. C. Snavely executed a third mortgage upon said premises to William Snavely to secure the payment of $2,235, which was duly recorded September 13, 1882.</p>

Then a scire facias was duly issued upon the first of the foregoing mortgages, and judgment duly obtained thereon in favor of Andrew Martin’s executor, who was duly substituted as plaintiff upon the record, viz: John S. Martin, for the sum of $6,665.24, January 7, 1890. Execution process was issued thereon and said premises were duly and regularly sold by the sheriff of Centre county, April 28,1890, to John H. Lick for the price or sum of $6,800, and the sheriff executed and duly acknowledged and delivered his deed to said purchaser for the same. J. H. Lick, said purchaser, has since died, and his title to said premises became duly vested in Christian N. Seidle, the plaintiff. Christian N. Seidle, the plaintiff, February 1, 1898, entered into articles of agreement with John Holmes for the sale of said premises to Holmes for the consideration therein named, and has executed and duly acknowledged a deed therefor, with covenant of general warranty of said premises, and has tendered the same to said Holmes, the defendant. The said defendant declined to receive the same on the ground that the title may not be clear of liens, especially of the lien of the mortgage of September 9, 1882, executed by H. C. Snavely to William Snavely, upon said premises.</p>

C. Snavely by deed duly executed and recorded November 15,1877, had no further interest therein as against a subsequent mortgagee of H. C. Snavely, who, by said conveyance, became the owner of the whole of said premises, as lieir of John Snavely and grantee of William Snavely, subject to life interest of Rachael Snavely to the one third interest therein. And Henry C. Snavely, having executed a mortgage upon the whole of said premises, November 15,1877, to Andrew Martin, which was prior to any other lien upon said premises, and the property being sold upon said first mortgage, after the decease of the widow, the purchaser at said sheriff’s sale, in our opinion, took a good title, free from all incumbrances, and the plaintiff being duly invested with the title <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>possessed, by said sheriff’s sale, has a good and sufficient title to said land, free from incumbrances.

Lick, the owner of the second mortgage, which was given after partition proceedings had indicated the real state of affairs, and that he, too, was therefore cognizant of William’s rights and equities, and that the recognizance given to secure his interest in the principal of the widow’s dower had never been paid or satisfied.
