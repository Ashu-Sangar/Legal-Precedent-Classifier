If the doctrine of these cases be correct, then clearly enough this particular estate offends against the rule; since not only is there a possibility that the seventy-five years from the death of the testator will carry beyond the lifetime of the last surviving child of the testator, with twenty-one years and nine months added thereto, but, in view of the ages of these children, it is altogether probable that this will result. Besides, in such a case as this, a still shorter limit must be applied; for the rule is, that where the testator fails to avail himself of-lives in' being, and adopts a term of years, without reference to any life in being, the term cannot extend beyond twenty-one years from his death. “ If an absolute term is taken, and no anterior term for a life in being is referred to, such absolute term cannot be longer than twenty-one years : ” Perry on Trusts, 349. So we have a manifest repugnance between the devise and the rule, if the doctrine of the cases referred to be correct.</p>

His argument to us seems complete as it is convincing. Beginning with the origin of the rule, and tracing its development through all stages, he shows how in its design, and purpose, and uniform acceptance and application, except in the eases criticised, it was directed against future contingent interests only, and never could have had any reference whatever to vested estates. In this he is sustained by the terms of every definition that has been given of a perpetuity, and by every authority on the general subject. The cases referred to are not so many attempts to enlarge and widen the rule, so as to embrace other subjects than. those originally intended, but, as he insists, proceed upon a misapprehension of its purpose and scope.' The variance between them and the doctrine as stated in Phila. v. Girard’s Heirs, <a href="/citations/?q=45%20Pa.%2026" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="45 Pa. 26">supra,</a> must strike any one, and it is <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>impossible to see how both can be correct. The particular estates which they condemn are present vested interests, whereas the rule applies only to future estates. They condemn them because the trusts with which they are clothed may require in their execution a larger period than that prescribed by the rule. But Prof. Gray shows, clearly enough, that the rule has no concern with anything but the beginning of the estate; that it requires a vesting within the period, and where this occurs, the extent of continuance of it is something wholly outside of its ox&gt;eration. And so in section 232 he asserts, as admitted and established doctrine, that an interest is not obnoxious to the rule, if it begin within a life in being and twenty-one years thereafter, though it may extend beyond. The same thing is asserted by Lewis in his Work on Perpetuities, p. 144, and with equal clearness and emphasis. He says: “The remoteness against which the rule is directed is remoteness in the commencement, or first taking effect of limitations, and not in the cesser or determination of them. An estate that is to arise within the prescribed period, may be so limited as to be determined on the happening of any event, however remote.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b205-3" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[188,1386,1173,1005]]]'>There is of course no disputing such authority as this ; and the doctrine is so clearly expressed, as in the authority we have cited from our own state reports, that it admits of no two interpretations. Manifestly the cases criticised are reconcilable with neither. Applying then this doctrine and rule to the particular estate created by the devise we are considering, rather than subjecting it to the rulings made in these cases which have been referred to, it seems, judged of by itself, unrelated to other parts, to stand clear of the rule. Here the particular estate, both legal and equitable, vested at once. There was nothing future about it, except its continuance; it began within the prescribed limits, and it is of no consequence, so far as concerns the rule, that it extends beyond it. Each of the testator’s children took a present vested interest in the term of seventy-five years, the full enjoyment of which nothing could defeat but his or her death before its expiration; not transmissible because not an estate of inheritance, but otherwise as freely alienable as any other estate or interest. It is impossible to see how the rule against perpetuities can be applicable in such a case as this.</p>

The determining question must be, is this a vested interest, or is its vesting suspended until the expiration of the particular estate ? If the former, it too is outside of the operation of the rule; but if the latter, the rule necessarily applies and as certainly condemns it; since if there be any suspension at all, it is for seventy-five years, whereas the utmost limit in a case like this is twenty-one years.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[255,871,1178,860]]]'>An estate is said to be vested in interest, when there is a present fixed right in some one of future enjoyment of it; it is not vested, but contingent, when either the person who is to enjoy it, or the event upon which the estate is to arise is uncertain. The rule as stated in Smith on Executory Interests, p. 281, is as follows: “ Where real or personal estate is devised or bequeathed to such children, or to such child or individuals as shall attain a given age, or the children who shall sustain a given character, or do a particular act, or be living at a certain time, without any distinct gift to the whole class, preceding such restrictive description, so that the uncertain even forms part of the description of the devisee or legatee, the interest so devised is necessarily contingent on account of the person. For until the age is attained, the character is sustained, or the act performed, the person is unascertained; there is no person answering to the description of the person who is to take as devisee or legatee.”</p>

The language used makes a fair equivalent of a bequest to such children “ as shall attain a given age.” Not for seventy-five years can there be any person answering to. <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>the description of the persons who are to take as devisees or legatees. It is not as though the parties had been individuated, as in McClure’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/72/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="72 Pa. 414" data-case-ids="434740" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0414-01">72 Pa. 414</a>, where the interest was held to be vested. The peculiar features of that case are said in the subsequent case of Cascaden’s Estate, 15B Pa. 172, to have controlled its decision. The case last mentioned approaches most closely the case in hand. There the bequest was as follows: “ When the youngest child arrives at the full age of twenty-one years then I direct all my said real estate and investments to be converted into money by my executors, and divided as follows: I give and bequeath to my wife out of said moneys fifteen thousand dollars, and all the rest, residue and remainder I direct to be divided among my said children, share and share alike, subject to the deduction which I have before directed to be made. Should any of my children die before the youngest child arrives at the age of twenty one years leaving children, then the said share be divided among said children, share and share alike, or if he or she shall die without leaving children, then his or her share shall be divided among the remaining children, share and share alike.” It was held that the interests given to the children did not vest until the youngest arrived at the age of twenty-one years. In the opinion, the court distinguished clearly between the facts of this and of McClure’s Appeal, supra. They said : “In that case (McClure’s Appeal) the testator directed the residue of his estate, if any, remaining after the death of his wife, to be equally divided between his nephews and nieces, individuating them by their names, and declaring that each is to have an equal share. It was said in the opinion of the court, ‘ The gift is to his nephews and nieces, not as a class, but by name as individuals, without words of survivorship, and with no bequest over, in the event of their death, in the life of the widow.’ Herein that case differs from the one in hand. In the latter the testator does not individuate his children and give each one a share by name. In fact the names of his children are nowhere mentioned in the will. The gift to them is to a class, and the distribution is to be made among them share and share alike when his youngest child shall arrive at the age of twenty-one years and the share of such child as shall die before that period, without leaving children, shall be divided among the remaining children, share and share alike. <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>rt is obvious that had Mrs. Manrise (a daughter of the testator) died prior to the distribution without leaving children, her share would have gone to the surviving brothers and sisters under the terms of the will. But it was contended that because she left a child surviving her, her interest in the estate vested in her descended to and vested in .her child. Had this child lived until the period of distribution, there can be no doubt she would have been entitled to her mother’s share. As she died before that time, to hold that she is entitled to her mother’s share, is to accord to her a higher estate than her mother possessed. The estate of the latter was contingent upon her living until the youngest child came of age.”</p>

What gives it greater confirmation than any adjudication upon a case with general features the same,— since all the cases are more or less distinguishable from each other, and each stands upon its own peculiarities, — is the undisguised and unmistakable purpose of the devise to accomplish this very result, as manifest we think as though expressed in words. After all it is the intention of the testator that governs. It is impossible, as we read this will, to conclude that the testator intended that any of his children should take an estate or interest in the remainder which would be transmissible or alienable, during the continuance of the particular estate. And yet to hold these interests vested, would give them this quality. On the contrary, it is obvious that the testator’s chief and controlling purpose throughout was to tie up his estate, and hold it intact beyond the power of either children or grandchildren to interfere with the final distribution he proposed at the end of seventy-five years.</p>

As we have said, this latter, standing by itself, unrelated to other parts, does not offend against the role; but this needs to be qualified somewhat. The estate it grants is free from offense, since it is freely alienable and in no sense tends to a perpetuity; but it contains a power to sell which flatly contravenes the rule and which dare not be exercised. The rule with respect to powers contained in a grant, is the same as that which applies to estates. “ If a power can be exercised at a time beyond the limits of the rule against perpetuities it is bad. This happens when a donee of the power, and the occasion on which it can be exercised, may both, by possibility, be in existence beyond the limits of the rule: ” Gray on Perpetuities, 306.</p>

The result would be easily reached if the beneficiaries under the trust were the “heirs ” of the testators; but they are not, the gift is to his children and the legal descendants- of such as shall die during the period.</p>

A limitation of a life estate, or other partial interest, with a remainder expectant upon it, which is void for remoteness, of course remains in statu quo prius; neither receiving enlargement nor suffering diminution.”</p>

But, that is a conclusion that it would seem ought, if possible, to be avoided, for the devise stripped of the power of sale and avoided as to the larger estate over, cannot with any reason be said to express the testator’s wishes. It will not be pretended that the particular estate was designed to serve any purpose of its own, distinct from the limitation over. On the contrary it is evident that it was adopted simply as a means to an end; a hook upon <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>which to hang suspended a tied-up estate, until such time as testator desired it to be opened and parted. How does it in any way enforce testator’s wishes, to leave the hook in its place, when there is no estate to suspend upon it ? The estate which he expected to suspend for seventy-five years, if we are right in our previous conclusions, the law has disposed of, vested it at once in his heirs who have the right to dispose of their interests therein at any time. The whole scheme of tire testator in this regard has been defeated. Instead of observing his will, is it not rather enforcing one not his, to keep alive under such circumstances an estate which he contemplated only in connection with another and larger one which the law has annulled ?</p>

Corse, 2 Bar. Ch. 506 (5th L. ed.), 782. The rule is stated in argument in Darling v. Rogers, 22 Wendell, 495, as follows: “ Where a will is good in part and bad in part, the part otherwise valid is void if it works such a distribution of the estate, as from the whole instrument taken together was evidently never the intention of the testator. Otherwise when the good part is so far independent that it would have stood had the testator been aware of the invalidity of the rest.” In Hawley v. James, 16 Wendell, 61, in which the decision of the chancellor was reversed, it is distinctly asserted in the opinion of the Chief Justice that valid life estates prior to void remainders,- will not be upheld, if upholding them would work injustice and defeat the main object of the testator. Prof. Gray in his Work on Perpetuities clearly recognizes such exceptions to the general <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>rule. In discussing those cases which seem to have overlooked that part of the rule which makes it applicable only to future contingent interests, he makes special reference, on p. 172, to the case of Thorndike v. Loring, <a href="/mass/81/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="15 Gray 391" data-case-ids="2089416" data-case-paths="/mass/81/0391-01">15 Gray, 391</a>, supra, which of all the cases we have seen most nearly approaches this in its essential features. In that case a fund was given by will to trustees for fifty years (it is of no consequence in this connection that it was given to accumulate;) then to be paid over to those who would be entitled to the testator’s estate if he had died intestate. The court held that the gift to the trustees was void for remoteness; that therefore the whole trust fell; that .a residuary clause in the will took effect and that the estate passed at once to the residuary legatees. Prof. Gray shows that the particular estate did not offend against the rule; that it was good in law or equity, though the ulterior gift was not. Nevertheless he sustains the action of the court in setting aside the whole trust, in the following language: “ It may be fairly urged in support of the decision in Thorndike v. Loring that the trust was created solely for the purpose of making an invalid gift and that its sole object being illegal the whole trust failed.”</p>

His aim was to control the disposition of his property beyond the period that the law allows, and this devise was the scheme adopted to accomplish it. It was a manifest attempt to accomplish an illegal object, and for this reason, if for no other, the whole scheme should fail. A like result follows from the circumstance that the two estates are not separable; that is to say, they are so related that upholding the one and avoiding the other, would clearly defeat the main, if not the only purpose of the testator in making the devise. No cases are to be found in Pennsylvania supporting the view here expressed; but neither can any be found which are in conflict with it. There are cases, — Lawrence’s Estate, <a href="/pa/136/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="136 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="819995" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0354-01">136 Pa. 354</a>, and others which recognize the general rule as stated by Lewis, viz : that a prior estate neither receives enlargement nor suffers diminution when a remainder expectant upon it is declared void for remoteness; but the question whether this general rule admits of exceptions, is nowhere discussed in <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>any of them. Elsewhere we have seen, the rule is not invariably applied, and a recognized exception is where, as in this case, the failure of the ulterior estate disturbs so as to defeat the main and dominant purpose of the testator. Another is where the particular, prior estate is adopted as a means for the accomplishment of that which the law forbids^ The present case falls within both exceptions.</p>
