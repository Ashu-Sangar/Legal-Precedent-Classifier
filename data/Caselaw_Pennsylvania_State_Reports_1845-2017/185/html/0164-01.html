Harris, one of the terretenants, for himself and the other terre-tenants, filed an affidavit of defense in which he admitted that the defendant, John K. Harris, had executed the mortgage in suit, and in a supplemental affidavit of defense he averred as follows:</p>

The petition of the admin<a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>istrator d. b. n. of the said William Harris, deceased, and all proceedings on said petition which was filed and acted upon by the orphans’ court of Chester county, in February and March, 1897, show on their face that the said orphans’ court had no jurisdiction to make an order or decree that a private sale of said land by the administrator of said decedent to John K. Harris should be confirmed. The said John K. Harris, therefore, got no title to the land of said decedent and has never had title to said land except to the undivided one seventh part of said land which he inherited as one of the children of said decedent. The said Mary A. Fornwalt mentioned in said affidavit, filed December 28,1897, was one of the children of said decedent and the owner of one seventh of said land, but her husband, Howard Fornwalt, whose name appears in said petition was never notified of said petition or the proceedings thereon as the law directs should be done. The said orphans’ court, therefore, for the foregoing reason, as well as for the reasons set out in said affidavit filed December 28, 1897, had no jurisdiction to make the said order or decree and, as a consequence, the said John K. Harris having never been the owner of more than the undivided one seventh part of said land, had no right or power to execute a mortgage to the plaintiff or any one else for more than his own undivided one seventh part of said land. The plaintiff, therefore, has no right to a judgment in the proceedings in this case that will be a lien ag’ainst more than the undivided one seventh part of said land which was owned by the mortgagor at the time he executed said mortgage. Two of the children of said decedent have never conveyed their interests in said land to anyone. The interests of the other children of said decedent are now owned by Maggie S. Harris, one of the terre-tenants, all of which is unincumbered by said mortgage, except the undivided one seventh part once owned by the said John K. Harris, all of which the said terre-tenants expect to be able to prove on the trial of said cause.</p>
