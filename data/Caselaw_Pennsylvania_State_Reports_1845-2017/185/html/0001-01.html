It will, therefore, be useless for the court to make a decree which it cannot enforce. The plaintiffs are before the •court as terre-tenants and not as contracting parties. If we were to require J ohnson to execute the releases demanded on receiving the balances admitted to be due him, we could not make a binding decree that would require the complainants to pay said balances unless we find Vogel to be Johnson’s agent.
