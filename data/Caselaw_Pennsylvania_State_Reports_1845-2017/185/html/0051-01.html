It frequently happens, however, that there are none; as where the principal of the estate from which the income in the meantime is to be accumulated is not given until a future event; or where the persons who are to take cannot now be known with certainty, as in Rhodes’ Estate, <a href="/pa/147/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="147 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="829834" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0227-01">147 Pa. 227</a>; Mellon’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Phila.%20323" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="16 Phila. 323">16 Phila. 323</a>; or where the accumulation is to create a fund from which legacies are payable and there is no present residuary gift, as in Grim’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/109/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="109 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="542287" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0391-01">109 Pa. 391</a>. In these and similar cases the liberated income necessarily passes under the intestate laws ; though where there is a gift, taking effect at once, of the principal from which the accumulations are to arise, or a general residuary gift, carrying with it not only “ everything not disposed of, but everything that, iu the event, turns out not to be disposed of: ” Cambridge v. Rous, 8 Vesey, 25; Act of June 4, 1879, P.

The principal, without augmentation, is to go at the death of the testator’s widow to nephews and nieces then living and the issue of such as may be then dead; while the income, retained until that time, is given to a class, viz: the brothers and sisters “ then living, the survivors and survivor of them.” It is argued, therefore, that as there can be no increase of the class to which the income is given, and no possible introduction into it of a person not known, the beneficiaries are ascertained; that the primary or general intention of the testator is that the income accruing during the period of accumulation shall go exclusively to them, while the direction that it shall go in a gross sum as the result of the accumulation is subsidiary — merely regulating the method or manner of enjoyment: <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>and that the failure of the secondary intent in consequence of the prohibition of the statute will not defeat the general purpose, under the principle which (as in the rule in Shelley’s Case) sacrifices the particular intent in order to accomplish the primary purpose.</p>

Smyth, <a href="/pa/54/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="54 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="1006287" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0245-01">54 Pa. 245</a>; Fairfax’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/103/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="103 Pa. 166" data-case-ids="449103" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0166-01">103 Pa. 166</a>. It is true the limitation is to brothers and sisters living at the death of the wife, “ the survivor or survivors of them,” and it is argued that under the rule which requires the avoiding of an intestacy if, by construction, it is possible to prevent it, these words must be understood as providing for the contingency of the death of all the brothers and sisters in the lifetime of the wife, — the accumulations, in that event, being given to the one who died last. But the gift is to the “survivors,” as well as to the “ survivor,” and this, if the argument is sound, would include all of the class except the one who died first. It is difficult to believe that this was intended. The words “ survivors or survivor,” in a limitation following a prior gift, are understood in Pennsylvania as referring to the death of the testator (Johnson v. Morton, <a href="/pa/10/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="10 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="962726" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0245-01">10 Pa. 245</a>), unless the intent to refer them to some other period is plain and manifest (Woelpper’s <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>Appeal, <a href="/pa/126/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="126 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="968893" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0562-01">126 Pa. 562</a>), which cannot be said of the will of this testator, — .especially as there was an obvious reason for using them in this sense, viz: to exclude claim, under the act of assembly relating to lapsed legacies, by children of a brother or sister dying in his lifetime.</p>

The general residue is to vest at the death of the wife in the nephews and nieces, and issue of deceased nephews or nieces, then living; and when “thereafter,” that is, after the death of the wife and the vesting of the original residue, “ further sums ” become part of it under other provisions of the will, e. g., under items 11, 13, etc., they also are disposed of in the same manner.

He therefore made no provision for principal, such as was made in the case of any beneficiary dead at the time of distribution. It became, therefore, all the more important, inasmuch as he did not admit representation of a dead brother or sister, to provide for the case of nonsurvivorship of his widow by any brother or sister. To this end, and to preArent any intestacy, he added the words “survivors or survivor of them.” <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>By giving meaning to these words we prevent an intestacy.
