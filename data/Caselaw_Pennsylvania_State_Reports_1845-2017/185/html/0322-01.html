February 17,1896, the $250 note payable in twenty-five days was paid by Teal. The other $250 note was renewed February 25 and afterwards, together with the $4,000 note paid by A. J. Sehlager.

If the creditor gives time without reserving the right to pursue the indorsers he discharges them. The agreement to pay usurious interest before a note becomes due, or the payment made subsequent to the maturity of a note, is not sufficient consideration for a contract to give further time and will not discharge a surety: Hartman v.

After a careful consideration of the evidence presented by the parties, the learned judge of the court below “ ordered that the judgment .... be opened as to Charles Schlager and he be let into a defense to the amount of SI,316, and interest thereon from July 31, 1896, and that the rule to show cause be discharged as to the remainder of the judgment.” From that decree Charles Schlager appealed and assigns as error the refusal of the court “to open judgment in its entirety as to” him. The only question therefore is whether the appellant was entitled to further relief than that granted him by the above recited order. Our consideration of the evidence has satisfied us that he was not.</p>
