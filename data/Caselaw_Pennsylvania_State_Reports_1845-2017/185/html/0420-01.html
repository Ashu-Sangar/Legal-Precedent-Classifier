Shortly before his death he orally stated that it was his intention that his children should have only the income of their shares for life. One of the sons was named an executor and trustee of the will. After testator’s death all of the children united in an agreement reciting the oral statement made by testator, and declaring that they held their respective shares in trust for themselves for life, and from their respective deaths for their respective children. Many years afterwards the executor and trustee misappropriated a very-large amount of the funds of testator’s estate. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the agreement was avalid one, based upon sufficient consideration; (2) that the limitations to the children of testator’s children under the agreement were to be regarded as if the written will had expressed them in terms; (3) that the children of the defaulting trustee could not be compelled to make good the devastavit out of their share.</p>

Ford at his death; it being contended by Mr. Johnson that Henry C. Ford being trustee under the will of the testator for the other parties to the agreement, the latter were not bound by its stipulations so far as his share of the estate was concerned ; and also that as against such other parties the limitation to his children was simply a voluntary conveyance, void as to then existing creditors.</p>

The trust was purely for the benefit of the widow, and the relation of trustee and cestui que trust can scarcely be said to have existed between Henry C. Ford and the other children of the testator. Moreover, the disability of a trustee to contract with his cestuis que trust relates only to the trust property, not to the individual <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>estate of the trustee himself, even though he derives title to the latter under the instrument creating a trust for the others ; and in the present case Henry C. Ford was neither buying from or selling to his cestuis que trust — assuming that under the will they were such. He was simply dealing with an estate of which he was the absolute owner, and which the other persons taking under the will could not in any manner interfere with or deprive him of. Of course, those whose rights had their origin in the agreement of November 16, 1876, viz: the children born or to be born, of the original parties, took in strict subordination to all its provisions, and cannot now set up or allege disability growing out of a trust relation which did nob begin until the transaction was fully consummated.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.6",444,[252,1217,1172,861]]]'>That legatees or cestuis que trust bear such a relation to an executor or trustee that any voluntary settlement he may make in favor of his wife or children is void as to them, though he has not committed and does not intend to commit a devastavit, is a startling proposition. His liability is that of depositary or bailee, not that of debtor. It is wholly unlike the case of the maker of a promissory note not yet matured, who is a debtor from the beginning, though the time of payment is suspended. Debitum in prsesenti solvendum in futuro. In the event of his insolvency or bankruptcy the legatees or cestuis que trust— there having been no devastavit — would not share in the distribution of his estate, nor would they be scheduled as creditors. And if it be conceded that they are creditors, as the voluntary conveyance by their debtor is only invalid as to them, they may waive their rights and agree that it shall be made, as in the present case they have done, by uniting in the conveyance and binding themselves by seal.</p>

They were all of full age and had the right to waive the benefit of the law requiring wills to be in writing. The written will was obscurely expressed, but the testator had told them what he intended, and this they agreed should be done, irrespective of technicalities or rules of interpretation. The agreement of the others to this effect was a valid consideration for the agreement of each; and the limitations to the children of the first takers are to be regarded as if the written will had expressed them in terms.</p>
