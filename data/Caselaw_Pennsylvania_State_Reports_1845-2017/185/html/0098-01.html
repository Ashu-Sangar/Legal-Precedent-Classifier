Both were entered on the same day, April 6, 1896. The bond with warrant of the bank is dated July 19, 1893. The condition is that if Neff shall pay, or cause to be paid to the bank, “when so required by them, all notes and other indebtedness in which he is liable in any way to said National Bank of Slatington, and said' bank to have the right at any time to enter judgment and issue execution to secure said indebtedness, whether notes of the said Joel Neff are due or not.”</p>

It is beyond argument that it provided only for indebtedness existing at the date of the bond. It would no doubt cover the case of renewals of evidences of such then existing debts: Appeal of Bank of Commerce, <a href="/pa/44/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="44 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="484277" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0423-01">44 Pa. 423</a>. But it is conceded by the bank that none of the indebtedness when the judgment was entered existed at the date of the bond. It is claimed by the bank that it is shown by testimony that the bond covered indebtedness created subsequent to its date; that Neff so agreed. As to the said matter, Mr. Roper testifies that he was a director of the bank; that the financial standing of Mr. Neff was discussed; that in September or October, 1895, Mr. Gish, the cashier, Thomas Kern, aforesaid, and the witness were appointed a committee to see Neff in relation to his standing and notes in the bank; said committee met Neff at the bank; said bond (it is for $30,000) was talked about: Gish said to Neff that they wished to see him about his notes in the bank, the bank examiner was finding fault; certain notes were mentioned, “that we did not regard these notes as safe and look upon them as single name papers, and that he ought to take them out of the bank or provide us with satisfactory security, and that we wanted him to make some effort to take up these notes, and that we wanted to feel safe in the matter. Mr. Neff said, ‘I will do what I can in that matter to take out notes as fast as I can reduce,’ he said, ‘ I don’t see why you don’t feel safe, I gave you a judgment that secures all these notes.’ I said, ‘Mr. Neff, that judgment is not on record,’ ‘well,’ he says, ‘you might put it on record any time you want if you find it necessary to protect yourself, but’ he says, ‘I would not like to have the judgment on record as it would in<a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>jure my credit and standing. If you feel any danger you may put it on record, but I would not like it; I think I can take these notes up, and I think I am good for all my debts.’ That was principally what was said between us.” Mr. Kern was present and heard what was said. At that time the bank held Neff’s paper for about $20,000.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[201,671,1166,649]]]'>Mr. Gish testifies concerning said meeting and conversation; “I stated the object to Mr. Neff of the meeting about the amount of his notes, saying that we wanted security, some collateral, or to get him to take up some of these notes, and he said he didn’t know why we were uneasy, because he had given judgment for all these notes, he always met me with the argument that he had given judgment for the notes <em>. ; </em>he said, ‘you fellows are safe, because I gave you judgment for all these notes.’ . . . .” That afterwards when Neff was spoken to by the witness about his indebtedness, “he said he would take care of them, that we should renew them, that this judgment that we had was to cover all of these notes, and consequently the notes were renewed for his accommodation.”</p>

The Supreme Court said that Coombs’s acquiescence in that arrangement would no doubt estop him, but as to his judgment creditors the transaction was <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>of no legal force; as to them the mortgage was satisfied, and no arrangement not apparent on its face would avail to continue its lien; and quoted from Irwin v. Tabb, 17 S. &amp; R. 423, that “ It must perhaps be conceded that a mortgage to secure further advances which does not contain notice of the agreement is void against creditors generally.” While Coombs was still indebted to the bank the latter assigned the mortgage to a third party, Coombs representing that it was a first lien and no defense against it. Concerning that, the Court said: “ Suppose that this assignment, made as it was with Coombs’s consent, not only estopped him, but as to creditors amounted to a novation of the mortgage. Yet as to them it could be nothing more than a novation, and in order to give it effect they must have notice.”</p>

The parties to the conference did not have the bond then, and it is probable that no one of them had a distinct idea as to what the bond actually covered. What Neff said on that occasion amounted to no more than an opinion that the bond covered the notes then held by the bank, or an argument, the purpose of which was to persuade the bank’s representatives to be content with his obligation then held by the bank. He said, “ I gave you a judgment that secures all these notes,” and according to another version “ that this judgment that we had was to cover all these notes.”</p>

It seems Kern, like his colleagues, was satisfied with Neff’s assurance that the bond was for all the notes on which he was liable to the bank.
