L. 64. It did not appear of record that any exception was taken to the decision of the court. The errors assigned by the building association were the discharge of the rule, and the refusal to make the same absolute and to enter judgment for the amount of the claim.\nNeill \u2021 Heywang and J. B. Brawley, for plaintiff in error,\nmoved to quash the writ of error for the reason that no exception appeared to the order of the court below discharging the rule for judgment.\nBole Frey, for defendants in error.\nAn exception was asked for and refused on the ground that it was not necessary."
