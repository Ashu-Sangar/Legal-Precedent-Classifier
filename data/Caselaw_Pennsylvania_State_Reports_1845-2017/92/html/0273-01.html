An examination of the schedule attached to said return shows that the sheriff had levied on defendant’s interests in certain partnership real estate held by the firm of Gr. H. Wood &amp; Co., and also on defendant’s interest in the partnership of Hogsett, Watt &amp; Co., and also on defendant’s interest in the partnership of Fuller, Laughead, Baily <em>k </em>Co.</p>

In this case the plaintiff, Harris, only wasted some twenty-six days, before he issued a vend, exp., a writ that is presumed to be issued by the court, on account of the sheriff being in contempt for not executing the former writ, as he was bound to do. As a levy was made on the Harris fi. fa., and the failure to sell being entirely the act of the sheriff, and the plaintiff not having waited for an unreasonable time in issuing the second writ, the money in court must be applied to the Harris judgment.</p>

He must sell on the writ of fieri facias — he can have no other — the act provides for no other. The fieri facias, by virtue of the levy would be a lien during its life, but not beyond. There is no provision for any venditioni exponas, and there can be none. In this case the sheriff levied' Mrs. Kaine’s writ on this partnership interest and sold the same strictly under the act. It was levied subject to no other writ, and if this law is regarded it is entitled to the money.</p>

It was there held that in a proceeding to levy and sell upon an execution issued upon a judgment against a member of a firm for his private debt, his interest in said firm, the directions of the Act of 8th April 1873, Pamph. L. 65, must be conformed to, and that the fieri facias must be a special writ, commanding the sheriff to sell the interest referred to, &amp;c. These executions were in the usual form, and the sheriff might well have refused to make a levy under them. But he did levy and sell, and the money is now in court for distribution, and claimed upon each writ. To which must it be applied ? Obviously to the one on which the sale was made. The record shows that it was made upon the Kaine writ. It could not have been made upon the Harris writ as the fieri facias had been returned with the levy, and a venditioni exponas issued on the 28th day of September. This was only two days before the sale on the Kaine writ. It is plain therefore there was not and could not have been a sale under the venditioni exponas. Nor could the latter hold the proceeds by virtue of the lien of its prior levy, for not being in conformity to the Act of 1873 it conferred no lien. In such case the execution upon which the property was sold must take the money. The facts of the case as well as the sheriff’s return show that the money was made on the Kaine writ.</p>
