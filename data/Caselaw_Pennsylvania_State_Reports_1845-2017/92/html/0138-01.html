Butler, and that a fraudulent count of the votes in said precinct had been made in Butler’s favor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b139-7" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[155,784,1163,552]]]'>A replication was filed to this answer, and a commissioner appointed to take testimony. On the 13th of April 1878, Mathews presented his petition to court, alleging therein that the petition to contest his election had not been signed by twenty-five qualified electors of said ward, and specifying the parties who signed the petition who were not such qualified electors, and prayed the court to quash the petition to contest the election. An answer was filed denying the averments in said petition, and counsel for Mathews then filed a motion to have a commissioner appointed to take testimony, which the court held under consideration, and eventually dismissed the petition to quash without hearing any evidence, which action of the court was assigned for error by Mathews, who took this writ.</p>

The Act of 1874 absolutely requires that, in order to give the court below jurisdiction, a petition must be presented signed “ by at least twenty-five qualified electors who voted at the election contested.” If the contesting petition below was not so signed, clearly the court below had no jurisdiction, and if it had no jurisdiction the whole proceedings are void.</p>

But the specific power to determine and declare who is legally elected was not given in the'fourth class of cases. The court, therefore, had no such power ; but if the court thought, under all the evidence, that Mathews had not been elected, it should have set aside the returns and ordered a new election.</p>

The 17th section, providing “ that cases of this class shall be tried and determined by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the peace of the county in which the election contested shall be held;” The language of this act certainly means the court shall determine the facts alleged in the petition, and the petition averred that Butler, and not Mathews, was duly elected alderman of the Seventh Ward.</p>

The latter act was passed simply to regulate the mode of trying and deciding election contests, and did not repeal the 3d section of the Act of June 21st 1839 (except by transferring the jurisdiction from the Common Pleas to the Quarter Sessions Court, and by changing the number of petitioners, &amp;c.).</p>
    <p id="b140-9" data-blocks='[["BL_140.8",140,[249,1556,1155,251]]]'>It seems then clear that this court having held in Barber’s Case, supra, that this act was still in full force, the court below had full and abundant power to determine who was duly elected alderman of the Seventh Ward.

We can not review the case as on appeal. Every presumption is to be made in favor of the proceedings of the court below: Election Cases, 15 P. F. Smith 20. An application was made to quash the proceedings in the court below, and an answer filed denying the allegations of the petition. No doubt the court had sufficient reasons for denying the motion. The refusal to appoint a commissioner to take testimony proves nothing. They may have heard the testimony in open court. ,</p>
