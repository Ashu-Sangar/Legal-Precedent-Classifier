Thomas Passmore Hanbest died on the 7th of August 1873, leaving a will dated July 30th 1873, wherein he appointed Isaac Norris his executor. By a codicil he appointed his brother, Philip M. Hanbest, co-executor. The latter died intestate in August 1875. The account of Mr. Norris as executor was filed and referred to an auditor, before whom it appeared that at the time of decedent’s death on August 7th 1873, there was a balance to his credit with Jay Cooke&amp;Co., bankers, amounting to $46,623.44. This balance was transferred to Norris, as the acting executor, on August 21st 1873. The ordinary rate of interest allowed by Jay Cooke &amp; Co. was three per cent., but in consideration of the larger balances kept by the decedent, they allowed him five per cent. When the account was transferred to Norris, no arrangement was <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>made in regard to the rate of interest, but they continued to allow him five per cent. On September o 18th 1873, Jay Cooke &amp; Co. failed, at which time there was a balance to the credit of the executor of $42,542.37. The auditor was asked by the residuary legatees to surcharge the executor with the amount of the deposit. The auditor was of opinion that there was no negligence upon the part of the executors, they having acted in good faith, and for the best interests of the estate, as they supposed; and this not being an investment made by them, but merely a continuation of a former deposit made by the testator in his lifetime, this credit should be allowed.</p>

It was held, in a few extreme cases, that he may keep the money in a reliable bank for one year. But was this a reliable bank ? Was the trustee justified in his faith in this bank ? It was a private and interest-paying bank. Jay Cooke &amp; Co. were dealers in bonds, notes and stocks, and invested large sums of money at great risks, so as to make high rates of interest, and were actively engaged in building railroads. Three things were sufficient to put the trustee on his guard, and to prevent him from risking this large sum of money until he had examined its affairs. Where the money is in a private bank and in the hands of brokers, it should be withdrawn forthwith. The money should be so deposited that it can be drawn with the greatest facility at the shortest notice of danger. It should have been entered on joint account, so that the individual checks of the executor could draw it out, and the same care be exercised by him as used in the custody of his own property.</p>
