Goshorn, to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been caused by defendant’s negligently driving against plaintiff on a public thoroughfare. The defendant, on the 30th of June 1876, was driving, about six o’clock in the afternoon, from his office of director-general of the International Exhibition to his house in West Philadelphia. He was in a one-horse wagon with seats for four people, open in front and on the sides, and had therein two gentlemen and his colored coachman. He was driving on the right-hand track of the railway on Lancaster avenue. On reaching Forty-second street he noticed a block of cars on that track, and turned into the left-hand track. Here were two or three cars blocked by a balky horse in the front car. The balky horse was the off horse, and the plaintiff had hold of the head of the near horse. He was standing at the horse’s head, and the space between him and the track on which Mr. Goshorn was driving was between three and four feet. The defendant was driving on a clear track, there being no vehicle ahead of him for a half a square. His rate of speed, according to plaintiff’s testimony, was between six and seven, and, according to one witness, possibly eight miles an hour. According to the plaintiff’s evidence, it did not exceed four miles per hour. Just as the defendant’s carriage got opposite the plaintiff, he jumped backwards to escape from the horses which he was holding, they having started suddenly, or, as his wife testified, he was pushed <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>backwards, either against the shaft or against the body of plaintiff’s wagon, and was knocked down and injured.</p>

Ans. “ Not affirmed;. reserving the further question whether on the whole evidence the plaintiff is or is not entitled to recover.” The verdict was for $2600. Subsequently, the court directed judgment for the plaintiff on the verdict on his filing a remittitur for all over $700. The remittitur was filed and judgment entered accordingly, when defendant took this writ and, inter alia, assigned for error this entry of judgment and the answer to the foregoing point.</p>

In other words, the court can never pass upon what is or is not negligence unless a precisely similar case has been already adjudged. This view of the law has, however, been frequently denied by this court, and the reports abound with cases in which the judges at Nisi Prius have granted nonsuits, or directed verdicts for defendants upon a state of facts entirely novel, and which have never been passed upon as negligence in law: Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Fries, 6 Norris 234; Hoag <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., <em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20W.N.C.%2091" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 W.N.C. 91">supra;</a> </em>King <em>v. </em>Thompson, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.N.C.%20241" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 W.N.C. 241">6 W.

There was a block of cars on the right hand track leading toward the centre of the city, occasioned by the off horse in the front car balking. The defendant in error had hold of the head of the near horse for the purpose of starting the horses. The wagon of the plaintiff in error, containing four men, and drawn by one horse, was moving in the same direction on the left hand track. The space between the two tracks was some three or four feet in width. Just as the wagon was passing this car, the horses attached thereto started, and to protect himself against probable injury from the horse which he was holding, the defendant in error stepped back suddenly and was struck by, or came in contact with, the wagon. He testified, “ I don’t think I jumped back; I stepped back just far enough to get clear of the ear. I stepped back one step, I think.” He further testified, “ the car<a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>riage struck me ; both wheels went over me; the shaft struck me first.” His wife testified: “As he started the horse jumped towards him and knocked him back.” Kimble, another witness called by-defendant in error, swore : “ Mr. Smith stepped back from the horse’s head because the horse came out of his place.” Coomy testified “ if Smith had not stepped out of the way, the horse would have stepped on him, and the body of the car would' have struck him.” The other witnesses called by the defendant did not state the facts as fully, but their testimony did not conflict with that which we have quoted. The plaintiff in error testified when “ he (Smith) sprang back, he struck the rear of the seat on which the driver was seated.” Mr. Asch, a witness of plaintiff in error, testified : “ This man jumped back and struck the carriage behind the driver’s seat.” Thus all the evidence shows the injury was caused by reason of the defendant suddenly stepping or jumping back, whereby he came in collision with the wagon. The only conflict of evidence was as to the speed with which the wagon was moving. The witnesses on the part of the defendant in error thought it was seven or eight miles an hour; those on the part of the plaintiff in error from two to three miles an hour. We, however, are not able to see that the injury resulted from the greatest speed named. If the wagon had been moving at half that rate, and been in the same relative position with the car, the action of the defendant in error would have resulted in his injury. The wagon was moving on the track, where it had a legal right to be. That track was wholly free and unobstructed; the wagon did not leave that track and go nearer to the car, or to the defendant in error. The driver of the wagon had no reason to suppose that any one would suddenly move so near the track occupied by the wagon as to come in contact with it. If those occupying the wagon had no reason to anticipate such action, it is very clear they were not guilty of any negligence in not guarding against it. Conceding that the action of the defendant was excusable to save himself from being injured by the horse attached to the car, so that he may not have been liable to an action in case he had injured the plaintiff in error by this sudden and unexpected movement, yet it by no means follows that he has a right of action for injuries which he thereby sustained. The case rests solely on the alleged negligence of the plaintiff in error. A careful examination of the whole case does not show evidence sufficient to justify the court in submitting the question of the negligence of the plaintiff in error to the jury. The learned judge therefore erred in not affirming the point covered by the fourth assignment.</p>
