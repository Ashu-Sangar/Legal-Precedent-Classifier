At the time of the adoption of this by-law, McVey was a member, and had been prior thereto. He became sick, January 1877, and so continued until March 17th 1877. No notice of this sickness was given to the secretary until about four months after his recovery, at -which time he was six months in arrears. He then paid the arrearages and demanded his sick benefits, which the society refused to pay — because the funds in the treasury did not amount to the sum required by the by-law passed October 1876.</p>

There is no dispute about the fact that he was sick during the time that he claims, to wit, from January 20th 1877, to March 17th 1877. The defendants contend that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, for two reasons: 1. That there was no notice served upon the secretary in accordance with the rules and regulations of the society. This was not of substance in this case. The want of notice here was not one of the substantive requisites for recovery. The want of notice at the time is no substantive reason for not paying the plaintiff. He would be entitled to recover, because the rule in relation to notice was <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>intended to prevent fraud on the society. Here there is no fraud alleged, but there is no denial of the sickness. 2. They relied upon a resolution or by-law passed October 2d 1876, by which the society resolved not to pay any sick benefits until there should be accumulated the sum of $800.</p>

It is opposed to the very object for which the society was formed and is unlawful. They cannot pay one class and not another. They must, if they cannot do better than this society did by this resolution, surrender their franchises or make an assessment on their members to raise funds. Counsel for defendants have submitted to me the following point to charge you on: ‘If the jury believe that the resolution of October 2d 1876, was regularly passed by the society defendant, the plaintiff, being a member, is bound thereby and cannot recover.’ I refuse to so charge you, as the point is given.”</p>

    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[116,590,1163,1077]]]'>Here two important particulars, fundamental in their character, become obvious: 1. The society is a charity, designed primarily, for the relief of such of its necessitous members as may require, that is need, its beneficence; 2. In order that it may be enabled to carry out this scheme of benevolence a fund must be accumulated from the contributions of the membership. Without this it could give nothing, could afford no pecuniary relief, for it would have nothing. What the amount of that fund was to be, under $2500, was left discretionary with the society, as will appear from article sixteen; nevertheless a fixed amount was contemplated. This was wise, for if the money received from monthly dues was to be expended just as it was received the operations of the society must necessarily be fitful and uncertain. One month the sick might be relieved, the dead buried, and the next, it might be impossible to do either for want of means. Hence the efficiency and harmonious working of the society depended largely upon the existence of a permanent fund. It follows, 'that the by-law regulating the amount to be paid weekly to the sick, was but a rule for the government of the officers in the administration of the society’s benefactions, and must necessarily be subject to amendment and alteration to suit the fund set apart for that purpose. Hence arises the error of the court below in treating the case, 1. As though the organization was a quasi insurance company ; and 2. As though the by-law, in existence when the plaintiff became a member, was part of a contract unalterable except with his consent.</p>
    <p id="b513-7" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[115,1667,1158,293]]]'>This error becomes the more obvious upon reference to article ninth of the charter, which provides that the stewards, finding the applicant for “sick benefits” worthy, shall obtain and pay to him such weekly sum as “the existing by-laws may direct.” From this it is manifest that the plaintiff ought not to have been allowed to recover under a by-law which had been repealed before he fell sick.</p>
    <p id="b513-8" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[111,1968,1161,473]]]'>But more than this, to treat the proposed benefaction of this association as a matter of right, was a mistake. When McVey entered the society it promised him nothing of the kind; it promised him pecuniary aid in his sickness or necessity only, in case it had funds for that purpose, and then under the condition that its officers, after notice, found him to be a person worthy of such aid. For the court to say, therefore, that the plaintiff was entitled, as of right, to the sum of five dollars, or any other sum of money per week, whilst he lay sick, and to treat the society as his debtor to that amount, was to introduce into its organic law a novelty found neither in its letters nor spirit.</p>
