Moore upon a judgment in said court in favor of James D. Moore, Jr., and James A. Stranahan, for the use of M. A. Mehard and against said James D. Moore, upon which the real estate of the defendant was sold by the sheriff on the 8th of August 1878, for the sum of $4970, and an auditor was appointed to make distribution of this fund.

This ruling has been expressly reaffirmed in Perry’s Appeal, 10 Harris 45; Hancock’s Appeal, 10 Casey 156, and other cases, and is unalterably established as the law. By these authorities, it is decided that the assignments made by J. D. Moore, Jr., to the appellees, on the 7th of April 1876, vested in each of them a certain fractional part of the judgment in question, and the right to receive a like part of the money distributed to it. It must be conceded that until the 9th of February 1878, the title to that part of the judgment now claimed by the appellant remained in the plaintiff, J. D.

In those cases the assignees took what was assigned to them. For instance, in Donley <em>v. </em>Hays, each assignee took that part of the money raised on the mortgage which answered to the bond which he held. No more being assigned to him he could take no more; and the assignment, in equity, of the one part of the mortgage through the assignment of one of the bonds, could not operate as an assignment of another part of the mortgage answering to another of the bonds. In the same way, in Perry’s Appeal, the assignment of one of the several mortgages could not operate as an assignment of any other of the four mortgages, nor interfere with it in the distribution of the money made by the sale of the land which was held equally by all. And so of all the series of cases following Donley <em>v. </em>Plays. In all of them the portions assigned were separated and distinguished from one another, either by operation of law or the acts of the parties, and consequently partook of the fund as if they had been claims of entirely different parties.</p>

Different portions of this he assigned to different persons on the 7th day of April 1876, among others $1000 to the Bank of Mercer. By this assignment, which was filed of record on the day of its date, the bank became equitably entitled, by the act of the assignor, to receive that sum out of the moneys which should be made on the judgment. Mrs. Moore had actual notice of this assignment, and consequently of the equity existing in the bank. The assignment to her was made a year and a half after that to the appellees. It is submitted that she could not come in at that late date, and by collusion with her husband, divest the equitable rights granted to the former assignees.</p>

The authority of that case was recognised and affirmed in Perry’s Appeal, 10 Harris 43, and again in Hancock’s Appeal, 10 Casey 155. We see no reason for applying a different rule in ease of the assignment of different parts of the same judgment. Every equitable principle in regard to the application of the fund applies with equal force, whether the lien divested be a judgment or a mortgage.</p>

After the plaintiff m the judgment had assigned certain portions thereof to different persons, he assigned the residue to the appellant by the following assignment: “February 9th 1878; for a valuable consideration, I hereby assign the balance of this judgment unassigned, to Stella C. Moore, being the amount due and unpaid after the above and foregoing assignments.” The court construed this language to mean that the sums previously assigned should be fully paid, before’ the appellant was entitled to any of the proceeds. This we think was error. We discover nothing in the letter or in the spirit of the assignment reasonably leading to that conclusion. Describing the part assigned as “being the amount due and unpaid after the above and foregoing assignments” conveys no idea that the sums previously assigned shall first be paid. Its plain import is to assign all that part of the judgment not previously assigned. The reference to previous assignments is not to give them any preference in lien or payment, but merely for the purpose of declaring that the assignor transfers to the appellant all his remaining property in the judgment. The auditor found substantially as a fact, from parol evidence, that such was the intention of the parties to the assignment. We do not, however, think the case needs the aid of parol testimony to give the appellant a right to share, pro rata, with the persons who hold the parts previously assigned. The learned judge therefore erred in decreeing otherwise.</p>
