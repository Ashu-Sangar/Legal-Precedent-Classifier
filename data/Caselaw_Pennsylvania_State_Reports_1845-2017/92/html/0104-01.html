Oil being very low in price, the plaintiffs concluded to put their oil up in good and secure barrels, store it, have it insured, and hold it until it would command a better price. Waring Brothers &amp; Co., of whom the defendant, Richard S. Waring, was one of the firm, were largely engaged in the oil business iu Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and also had a branch,house in Philadelphia. They stored, bought and sold oil. The plaintiffs, in August 1874, called at the business house of the defendants in Pittsburgh, and made a contract with the defendants, as follows: .The plaintiffs agreed to ship their oil to the defendants’ warehouse in Philadelphia, and the defendants agreed to receive it, and store it, for the sum of eight cents per barrel for the first month, and four cents per barrel for each succeeding month. It was also agreed that the plaintiffs should pay the defendants for keeping the barrels in order, cooperage as it is called. The defendants were also to have the oil insured, at the cost of the plaintiffs. It was further agreed <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>between them that the oil should be held until the plaintiffs ordered or desired' it to be sold, and that when the plaintiffs authorized the sale of the oil, they would allow a commission of 1-|- per cent. It was further agreed between them that in case the plaintiffs needed any money before they wished to sell their oil, that the defendants (Warings) would loan them the same at 9 per cent. On the 27th of August 1874, the plaintiffs commenced shipping oil by railroad to the defendants’ warehouse at Philadelphia, and at various times until the 12th of October 1874, shipped to the defendants, under their contract, three thousand one hundred and sixty-seven barrels of refined oil in barrels.

The verdict established the fact that the plaintiffs’ “ oil was shipped to the Philadelphia house, to be there kept in store for them, without any right, on the part of Waring Brothers &amp; Co., to sell or use the same, but simply keep it on storage until the plaintiffs should order it to be sold.” No other disputed fact was passed on by the jury, save the amount of damages. The verdict was rendered subject to the opinion of the court on points reserved, to wit: 1. Whether the composition of the defendant with his creditors, in accordance with the provisions of the bankrupt law, is, under all the evidence in the case, a bar to the plaintiffs’ action; and 2. Whether the plaintiffs’ evidence shows that the defendant was guilty of fraud, or was acting in a fiduciary relation, within the meaning of the bankrupt law.</p>

It was unnecessary for the defendant to prove that he had performed or tendered performance of the terms of the composition. For reasons stated in Bidwell <em>v. </em>Bidwell, ante, p. 61, while the decree of the District Court of the United States stands, or while the proceeding in bankruptcy is pending in that court, the courts of the state have no jurisdiction of an action for recovery of the original debt, if such debt be not within the 33d section of the Act of 1867. It was not there determined whether a debt created by fraud of the bankrupt, or while acting in a fiduciary character, is discharged by a composition; nor need it be here.

In that case the defendant pleaded his discharge by a composition in bankruptcy; the plaintiff replied that the debt was fraudulently ' contracted; to which replication the defendant demurred.

This contract was made with R. S. Waring, who did the firm business at Pittsburgh; the oil was shipped, from August 27th to October 12th 187?, to Philadelphia, where Orville T. Waring had charge of the business. In January 1875, having heard that the credit of Waring Brothers &amp; Co. was shaking, the plaintiffs called on' R. S. Waring at Pittsburgh for the oil, who said it had been sold and he was sorry for it, that he regretted it, and could not give the oil or money. Before the failure the plaintiffs borrowed from Waring Brothers &amp; Co. $1500, and gave orders for $2600, got under the arrangement for advances on security of the oil.</p>

It was not submitted to the jury to find whether R. S. Waring, in fact, participated in the sale of the oil,' or wittingly shared its proceeds, or even had knowledge of its sale before the failure of the firm. He was in Pittsburgh, his partner in Philadelphia, when the oil was sold, and there is no pretence of proof that he directed the sale. No exception was taken to the reservation in the second point, nor is error assigned to the disposition of fact therein. The fourth assignment alleges error in law, under the facts found by the jury.
