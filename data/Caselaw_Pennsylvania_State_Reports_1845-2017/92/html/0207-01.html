There is nothing in the act itself to indicate that its authors designed to introduce any new remedy, or to confine any one interested to contest a will to any exclusive remedy. No new remedy was created or existing remedy destroyed by any section of the act, except the ninth section, and it exhibits the pains taken by the authors of the act to set forth fully, clearly and. in detail, the changes intended to be made. They were preparing a law “ for the greater certainty of title and more secure enjoyment of real estate,” and, after making several important provisions in which no remedies were changed but only the time of their application limited, they came to the subject of the probate of wills; they considered that an unrevoked probate was conclusive as to a bequest of personalty, whereas, with respect to realty, there was no limit to the time within which a person disposed to litigation might unsettle the title or disturb the enjoyment of the devisee. Here was a mischief similar in character to those provided against in former sections, and a similar remedy was demanded, viz.: not the destruction of existing forms of procedure and the creation of new ones, hut the limitation within a definite period of the application of existing remedies.</p>

Though held to be prima facie evidence of title, the probate with us has been open to contest indefinitely, or at least for any time short of the period at which the common law would set up a conclusive presumption in its favor. This was the mischief the statute was intended to remedy. Innumerable titles throughout the state depended, and always will depend, on the probate of wills. That probate, the foundation of so many titles, we treat as a judicial decree, and the legislature here thought there ought to be a time when it should be no longer questionable. * * * It plainly declares that the uncontested probate shall be conclusive after five years from its date.” The court <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>then proceeds to say that the word “ caveat ” in the section is inaccurately used, “but the other words, ‘action at law,’ are sensible and mean an ejectment, as in this case, or any proceeding where the issue is <em>devisavit vel non.</em>

Smith 285. An examination of these two cases reveals the fact that precisely the same questions were tried in the latter, on an ejectment, as had been previously tried in the former, on an issue directed by the register’s court; and, further, that the latter action was a second action of ejectment. Here was the case of a probate which was controverted on an issue <em>devisavit vel non </em>and in <em>two actions </em>of ejectment, and both ejectments must have been tried after 1856. In Kenyon <em>v. </em>Stewart, <em><a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20179" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 Wright 179">supra,</a> </em>Warfield <em>v. </em>Fox, 3 P. F.

In no case was the section considered as limiting the contest of a probate to one proceeding in the Orphans’ Court or to a single action of ejectment. Every case has been ruled upon the question of time and not one upon the failure of the remedy. Our contention, then, is, that actions of ejectment for lands affected by the probate of wills have been tried without question after direct attacks on the probate had failed, and in none of which the probate was held to be conclusive except when it had stood unassailed for the full statutory period; that the rule of evidence making an unassailed probate conclusive <em>after five years, </em>has no application to a case where, within five years, a caveat has been filed or appeal from the probate entered or action of ejectment brought, or any recognised mode of contest instituted, having for its object the setting aside of the will, providing such proceeding, whichever it may be, shall have been duly pursued; and that a party who brings his action of ejectment, as heir at law, to recover his share of lands devised to another by will, within five years after the probate of such will, stands on the same footing as to his remedies which a similar character of plaintiff occupied prior to October 1st 1856, and retains unimpared his right to successive actions of ejectment and two concurring verdicts.</p>

Such will was liable to be disputed whenever and as often as it was set up in any judicial proceeding as evidence of title, and, whether the trial was at law or in chancery, nothing was*established except for the purposes of the particular case between the parties litigant. This arose from the fact that the ecclesiastical court had no jurisdiction over a devise of realty.

But he adds, “ if it be desirable to have it changed, it can only be safely done by legislative interposition, looking to a prospective alteration, Avithout meddling Avith vested interests acquired and held under a Avell-ascertained principle of the law of estates.”</p>

The mischief to be remedied was in the clashing of jurisdictions, by Avhich judicial decrees were collaterally overturned and the harmony of the law disturbed. By one tribunal, to which the probate is exclusively intrusted, the testator is adjudged to have been sane, his will legally executed and free from all fraud: by another tribunal, having no jurisdiction over the probate, the testator is pronounced to have been insane, his will not legally executed or made under undue influence. Thus on the one hand ‘the laAV sustained the Avill and ordered it to be carried into effect, whilst on the other it decreed it to be invalid and set'it aside. The expansion of the register’" jurisdiction to realty making the probate as to it <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>equally conclusive as it is to personalty, after five years, brings into exercise the common recognised rule that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be inquired into collaterally. The probate by the register of any will devising real estate shall be conclusive as to such realty, unless within five years from the date of such probate those interested to controvert it shall, by caveat and action at law duly pursued, contest the validity of such will-as to such realty. In legal acceptation a caveat antedates the probate, its ofiice being to arrest the proof of the will; but manifestly the word caveat is here used in a different and broader sense. By “ caveat” is meant an objection to or a complaint against the probate of the will. By action at law is meant an appeal and issue <em>clevisavit vel non. </em>By no rule of interpretation can the word “ caveat” be eliminated from the act as senseless and devoid of all meaning, because in some cases a “ caveat,” in the strict sense of the word, will not apply, as where the contest begins after the probate -has been made without opposition or notice.</p>

That this is not the proper construction to be placed upon this section has been determined, we think, by this court, in the cases of Dean <em>v. </em>Bolton, No. 155, October and <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>November Term 1870, and Little <em>v. </em>Owens, No. 119 October and November Term 1873, not reported.</p>

Dean <em>v. </em>Bolton and Little <em>v. </em>Owens, already referred to, show the contrary; and in the Robinson Will Case, lately tried before his Honor Judge McKennan in the U. S.

The probate as to realty was but prima facie evidence of the execution of the will and of the testator’s testamentary competency: Rowland <em>v. </em>Evans, 6 Barr 435.

Under this act has the register’s sentence of probate the same conclusiveness upon a devise of realty as it has upon a bequest of personalty ? Does it now occupy the position of a judicial decree that cannot be impeached collaterally ?

It reads : “ That the probate by the register of the proper county of any will devising real estate, shall be conclusive as to such realty, unless, -within five years from the date of such probate, those interested to controvert it shall, by caveat and action at law duly pursued, contest the validity of such will as to such realty.” The first part of this section is clear and unambiguous; the action of the register “ shall be conclusive;” and it shall have all the force of a judicial decree, but the trouble comes with what follows ; that is almost unintelligable. There can be no caveat after probate, neither can the official act of the register be affected by an “ action at law.” Nevertheless, the framer of the statute must surely have meant something by the words, “caveat” and “action at law,” and we must determine what he did intend by their use. In order to solve this enigma we must ascertain, if we can, what previous defect in our laws this statute was designed to remedy. As we have already seen, under the Act of 1832 and those which preceded it, the probate of a will as to realty amounted to nothing, if we except its mere prima facie character ns evidence.; hence, it was open to attack from all quarters and at all times. Any number of suits might be instituted, and in each and every one of them <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>the will might be controverted; it might be sustained to-day and overthrown to-morrow. No one could depend absolutely upon a title which involved a will, for no length of time could make such title secure. Here then was an evil, and a very serious one, and one which, we doubt not, the Act of 1856 was intended to remedy. But the question recurs when does this remedy become operative? Say the counsel for the plaintiffs, not until the end of five years, and the dictum of Mr. Justice Woodward in Kenyon <em>v. </em>Stewart, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20179" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Wright 179">8 Wright 179</a>, is cited in support of that allegation, and it is undoubtedly in point, for that learned justice asserts not only that the word “ caveat ” in the Act of 1856 is inaccurately used, but that the words “actions at law.” mean an ejectment or any proceeding where the issue is <em>devisavitvel non. </em>We must remember, however, that the case he was considering required no construction of the act, since the only question was whether it applied to wills proved before its passage, and whether as to them it was constitutional. We are, indeed, quite sure that that eminent jurist did not give this question that careful consideration which he would have done had it been the point in that case. He says : “ That probate, the foundation of so many titles, we treat as a judicial decree, and the legislature thought there ought to be a time when it should be no longer questionable;” if, however, that probate was treated as a judicial decree, how could it be impeached in a collateral action ? Herein is found the inaccuracy of the above statement in that, before thq Act of 1856, it was not treated as a judicial decree except as to personal property. Judge Lowrie, in the case of Rowland <em>v. </em>Evans, held, that under the Act of 1832, the probate of a will even as to realty must be treated as a judicial decree, and hence, could not be collaterally attacked ; but for so holding he was reversed. Mr. Justice Bell, who delivered the opinion of this court, admits that the register is a judicial functionary, and that his decrees, within certain limits, are conclusive until reversed on appeal, and that it does appear somewhat anomalous to ascribe a binding efficacy to one act of probate which is denied to another, or to accord different degrees of stringency to the same probate, nevertheless, the old rule derived from the common law was held to be still in force, because the act did not, in express terms, alter that rule or make the probate as efficacious in devises of realty as in bequests of personalty.</p>

True it is, if the validity thereof can be contested in any kind of collateral proceeding, involving the will, instituted within that period, the act of the register partakes no more, practically, of the nature of a judicial decree than it ever did, and we may well say that the probate is conclusive <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>only after the end of the five years. Thus, instead of having a' new power conferred upon the register, and a new efficacy given to his act, we have but a limitation of the time within which the title of the devisee may be attacked. Yet, clearly, this is not the intention of the act, as appears, not only from the defect in the old law which it was intended to remedy, but from its language. The probate of the register shall be conclusive “as to such realty;” without more there could not be one particle of doubt as to the meaning of this statute; the doubt only begins when we come to the means prescribed for contesting the will. The framer of the act knew that it would not do to make the probate absolutely conclusive of the execution of the will; that some time must be given within which to contest that execution, but he evidently was not acquainted with the legal forms necessary to reach that end. This is evident from the manner in which he has used the word “caveat,” and also from the manner in which he has connected it with the words “and action at law.” He evidently regarded a caveat as a means or process for contesting a will, and an action or issue at law as a continuation thereof. Taking this view of the matter,' and it is the only one that can be adopted without the rejection of a word which was evidently deemed material by the framer of the act, and the difficulty is of easy solution. Thus the caveat will then mean the initiatory process, or notice preceding a contest before the register, and the action at law an issue triable in the Common Pleas, directed by the Orphans’ Court, after an appeal thereto from the decree of the register, and this appeal may be taken, in the ordinary form, at any time within five years. It is true we might substitute “or” for “and,” and in this manner make the word “caveat” stand for the whole process before the register and Orphans’ Court; and the words “action at law” for any collateral issue involving the validity of the will. This, however, is a use of these words which is less direct and natural than that we have given; moreover it perpetuates a doctrine always regarded as anomolous, and as antagonizing the rule, now universally recognised, that a judicial judgment or decree may not be collaterally attacked except for fraud.</p>
