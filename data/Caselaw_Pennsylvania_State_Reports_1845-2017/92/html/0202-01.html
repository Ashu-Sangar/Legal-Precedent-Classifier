The administrators of M., of whom his s'on was one, made a number of payments to the widow of decedent, on account of her distributive share of decedent’s estate during the years 3870 and 1871. Credits for these paymente were claimed and allowed in their second administration-account, November 18th 1872. The payments were made voluntarily, without a refunding bond or an agreement to repay. It was alleged that she was overpaid §2699.94, and the creditors of the son, one of the administrators, claimed, in 1878, to have this sum set off in the distribution of the son’s assigned estate, against §2528.83 arrearages of dower due the widow, and which was charged on said estate. <em>Held, </em>reversing the court below, that this could not be done, as the payment was voluntary and barred by the Statute of Limitations.</p>

This land was sold by the assignee, under an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington county, discharged of liens, under the provisions of the Act of February 17th 1876.

Her claim was objected to by certain creditors upon the ground, that in the distribution of the personal estate of the said William Montgomery, deceased, the administrators, Dr. John W. Kelly and A.

No demand, however, was ever made by them upon her for its repayment, and no attempt was made to collect it until the first meeting of the audit, on September 19th 1878, more than six years from the date of the last payment, when the creditors claimed to have it set-off against her arrearages of dower due from A.

The payments were made voluntarily, without a refunding bond or an agreement to repay. It is now alleged she was overpaid the said sum of $2699.94, and the creditors of A. J.

That some of the payments at least were made after the expiration of a year from the granting of the letters of administration we do not regard as material, as a payment by the administrator even then without a refunding bond or an agreement to repay was voluntary. The auditor and the court below were of opinion, however, that the statute did not begin to run until the time the over-payment was discovered, to wit: in 1876. But when an administrator pays out money, he is presumed to know the condition of the estáte. The assets are in his hands, and he is familiar with their amount and value. He ought to know, and is chargeable with knowledge, of the amount of claims against the estate when he makes a payment on account of a distributive share. It would be a great hardship upon distributees, to Avhom an administrator has voluntarily made payments on account of their shares, if they may be called upon for repayment after the lapse of years. They may have spent it, or increased their style of living in entire good faith, and in ignorance of any over-payment. We are of opinion that the statute commences to run against the administrator from the time of such payments.</p>
