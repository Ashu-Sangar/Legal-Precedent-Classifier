Simply intrusting the possession of a chattel to another as a depositary, pledgee or other bailee, is insufficient to prevent the real owner reclaiming his property in case of an unauthorized disposition of it by the person so intrusted. The mere possession of chattels, without evidence of property or authority to sell from the owner, will not enable the possessor to give good title. But if the owner intrusts to another the possession of property, and also written evidence of title and power of disposition over it, as respects innocent third persons, he is deemed as intending it shall be disposed of at the pleasure of the depositary. If there be conditions on which this apparent right of control is to be exercised, not expressed on the face of the instrument, the case, in principle, is like that of an agent who receives secret instructions qualifying or restricting an apparent absolute power. If the owner of the stock voluntarily give certificates with blank assignment and power to make transfers, to his brokers, who betray the confidence reposed in them, such owner must suffer the loss, rather than innocent strangers whose money the brokers wmre thereby enabled to obtain. The principle applies to pledges of stock, and one who purchases from the pledgee may hold against the pledgor. And if the pledgee pledge it to secure payment of his own debt, the second pledgee may hold it as security till his debt be paid. “ A person loaning money on such certificate and power, has a right to believe that the borrower from whom he receives them has an absolute right to pledge the stock.” By commercial usage, a certificate of stock accompanied by an irrevocable pow'er of attorney, either filled up or in blank, is, in the hands of a third party, presumptive evidence of ownership in the holder.

Perhaps, under similar circumstances, like rule would be applied to the holder of a stolen certificate as to the holder of a stolen bill of lading, but such is not this case. There the court say, “ It may be that the true owner, by his negligence or carelessness, may have put it in the power of a finder or thief to occupy ostensibly the position of a true owner, and his carelessness may estop him from asserting his right against a purchaser who has been misled to his hurt by that carelessness. But the present is no such case. It is established by the verdict of the jury that the' bank did not lose its possession of the bill of lading negligently. There is no estoppel, therefore, against the bank’s right.” The bill of lading having been stolen without fault in the owner, he was held entitled to recover against a purchaser who had reason to believe that his vendor was not the owner, but held it to secure the payment of an outstanding draft.

An executor holds under a trust; he is the minister or dispenser of the goods of the dead. He has the same property in the personal effects as the deceased, had when living. It is a general rule of law and equity, that an executor has an absolute power of disposal over the personal effects of his testator, and they cannot <em>be </em>followed by creditors nor legatees into the hands of the alienee. This results from the fact that in many instances the executor must sell in order to perform his duty in paying debts, &amp;c.; and no one would deal with him if liable after-wards to be called to an account. Co-executors are regarded in law as an individual person ; and the acts of any one of them, in respect to the administration of the effects, are deemed to be the acts of all; as where one releases a debt or settles an account of a person with the deceased, or surrenders a term, or sells the goods and chattels of the estate, his act binds the others. An exception <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>to this general power will be found in those cases only when collusion exists between the executor and purchaser. That the executor may waste the money is not alone sufficient to invalidate the sale; it must further appear that the purchaser participated in the <em>devastavit </em>or breach of duty in the executor. Thus, when the person to whom the executor passes the property, knows that the executor is acting in violation of his trust and in fraud of those interested in the due administration of the assets, the fraud vitiates the transaction, and the attempted transferís void. These familiar elements, the base of the master’s reasoning, are its sure support.</p>

Wood. As executor, he could not make a valid sale or pledge of the stock as a security for or in payment of his own debt to them ; the transaction itself gave them notice of the misapplication, and involved them as participants in the breach of duty. Where money was obtained on the security of stock belonging to an estate, the borrowers, sons of the testator, represented that they owned and had the right to pledge it, but the transfer was made by the executrix to the lenders, who gave her a receipt stating the purpose for which they held it, and that it was to be returned to the estate if their debt was paid, the transaction gave the lenders notice, and the trust was not divested : Prall <em>v. </em>Hamil, <a href="/nj-eq/28/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="28 N.J.

The powers of an executor or administrator differ from those of an ordinary trustee; the duty of the latter being custody and management, of the former to dispose of the personal property, to pay debts, &amp;c. Executors may use specific legacies to pay debts, if necessary: Bayard <em>v. </em>Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank, 2 P. F. Smith 232. The fact that the legal title to the stock was known to have previously been in the executor, and that the title of the holder appeared on its face to have been derived from him in his representative capacity, will not raise a suspicion, or put a purchaser on inquiry, for the reasoii <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>that it is the executor’s primary duty to dispose of the assets and settle the estate: Prall <em>v. </em>Tilt, <em><a href="/citations/?q=28%20N.J.%20Eq.%20480" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="28 N.J.

Wood, and the blank assignments and powers were signed by George R. Wood as acting executor. They found McDowell &amp; Wilkins clothed with apparent ownership. The testator had given George R. Wood the strongest expression of confidence in making him an executor of his will, thereby vesting absolute power in him to sell and transfer the stock in the line of his duty. He was acting executor. Neither his co-executors, nor others interested in the estate, had taken a step to prevent him from committing waste. The law casts no duty upon a purchaser to ascertain if the trusted executor of the decedent’s will is mismanaging the estate in fraud of creditors or legatees. The defendants had no knowledge of the collusive transaction between the executor and MacDowell &amp; Wilkins, nor reason to believe that they, the pledgors, were not the real owners, as they appeared. If it be that the perfidious conduct of the executor results in loss to innocent persons, either those interested in the estate or the pledgees of the stock, it must fall on those whose interest he betrayed.</p>
