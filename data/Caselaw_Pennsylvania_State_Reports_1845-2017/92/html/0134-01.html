Provided, that such payment has been entered in the book of the depositor at the time when made.” The book of a depositor was temporarily abstracted from his trunk and certain moneys drawn from the bank without the knowledge of the depositor. He afterwards brought suit for the amount, and it was alleged that the above rule relieved the bank from liability. <em>Held, </em>that the rulé' of the bank was reasonable and necessary for its safety, and that plaintiff could not recover. <em>Held, further, </em>that the fact that plaintiff was illiterate and could not read the rules in the bank book delivered to him, made no difference.</p>

His bank book had been abstracted temporarily from his trunk by some unknown person, and the money-secured by personating him, and using the book as above set forth. Plaintiff did not know that his book had been taken, until he applied for the money, when he was informed that the above amount had been drawn. When he was notified of the charge by the clerk at the bank he disputed it, denied all knowledge of it, and demanded payment of the amount so charged, together with what the bank admitted was due to him. This the bank refused to pay, claiming that, even if the check for the $195 was a forgery, it was relieved from payment of that sum under the provisions of sect. 10 of-its by-laws above quoted. Suit was therefore brought, and a verdict rendered by the jury for the full amount of plaintiff’s claim,- subject however, to the question of law reserved, which was substantially <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>whether or not plaintiff is concluded by the terms of sect. 10 of the by-laws, which were printed in his book.</p>

The depositor must be presumed to know what the printed rules and regulations of his book require. If he cannot read he should inquire what they are. Common sense tells him they are there for some purpose; and common prudence would dictate that he should inquire of some one what they are, and how they may affect him.

The rules under consideration in that case were almost identical with rules 8 and 10. The court there says : “It cannot be pretended that Mrs. Cupps’s money was paid out in conformity with any one of these by-laws.
