Kneedler, from the decree of the court discharging a rule to show cause why a judgment .entered upon his bond and warrant of attorney should not be opened on the ground that the defendant was a lunatic when he executed said warrant. It appeared that Kneedler owned certain premises on the west side of Second street above Susquehanna avenue, in the city of Philadelphia, which were subject to a mortgage of $3000. He also owned property on the east side of said street which was subject to certain liens. In order to pay off the charges on the latter he was advised by his counsel to place a mortgage of $5000 on the property on the west side, and with the money thus obtained to pay off these liens. His counsel applied to Mr. Weigand, and through the latter a loan of $5000 was obtained from the Philadelphia Trust Company, for which Kneedler gave his bond and warrant of attorney secured by a mortgage on the west side property. These papers were duly executed on August 18th 1876. On default made a scire facias issued on the mortgage to which an affidavit of defence alleging that defendant was insane was filed, which the Court of Common Pleas held to be sufficient. After-wards the plaintiff entered judgment on the bond in Court of Common Pleas, No. 2, and a rule to show cause why the. same should not be opened was granted by said court</p>

The question is, did the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, discharge the w&amp;? The appellant had no equity. He acted by the advice of counsel, received the consideration, and it was prudently applied to the payment of his undisputed debts. Neither the conveyancer who negotiated the mortgage nor his own counsel considered him as <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>insane. It was undoubtedly a sane act, though it may have been by an insane man. The appellant relies much upon the ground that as the bond and warrant were under seal the case is not within the recognised exception. But the warrant need not have been under seal. In substance, it was a loan of money, and if the appellant had been sued for the loan the alleged insanity could not have availed him. Why then should the judgment confessed be opened ?</p>
