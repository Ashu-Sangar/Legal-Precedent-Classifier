Accordingly, on February 6th 1874, a contract with Evan Jones was duly made by the city, through her engineer, for that work. This contract provided, inter alia:</p>

These he duly advertised, and, as required by law, handed the assessments over to the city treasurer for collection. The treasurer in turn gave notice, and after waiting the allotted time, on February 28th 1877, passed the assessments to the city attorney. As is usual in his office, to save the lot-owners costs, he waited for some time for them to pay, and on March 28th 1877, filed the liens in these different cases, for the assessment against each lot for its share of the cost of the improvement. After the introduction in evidence of the Act of 1864, above referred to, the city ordinance of July 28th 1873, and the liens filed, the city rested.</p>

They introduced witnesses to show that about September 1876, the street commissioners of the city inspected and approved the work; and they also called Mr. Jones, the contractor, and one or two workmen, to show when the last work was done. All of the witnesses, however, who were called, agreed that work was done on this street in October 1876; that when the street commissioners sent their written approval of the paving to the city engineer, he went out on the work; that he notified the contractor that the work was not satisfactory to him ; that the contractor must reset some curbing, a portion of it, near Cooper street, being out of line; that a certain portion of the pavement where there had been a fill, had sunk, and the contractor must fill up to grade at that point, and relay the pavement. The contractor accordingly did this work. Mr. Dempster, the engineer, says it was done in October 1876, and he accepted the work in October 1876. John Callahan who did the work, was also called, and he testified he did it in October 1876.</p>

Two points, the only ones we need mention, as those embrace all that is material in the case, were made by" the counsel for the city; they were, 1. “ That the provisions of the Act of Assembly, with reference to the filing of municipal liens within six months from the .completion of the work, is directory only, and Avill not, as betAveen the lot-owner and the city, defeat the right of the city to file such lien.”</p>
    <p id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.3",121,[152,385,1160,430]]]'>
      <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>2. “ That the time from which the six months run is the ‘completion of said improvements,’ and under the contract in evidence, and the Acts of Assembly and ordinance, the said improvement is not completed until approved by the city engineer.” Both these points were refused; the court holding that the provision of the act, in the first point mentioned, was not merely directory but material, and that a want of compliance with it would defeat the lien; and that the six months must be computed from the time when the contractor finished his work, and not from the time of its approval by the engineer.</p>
    <p id="b121-6" data-blocks='[["BL_121.4",121,[153,814,1160,378]]]'>In this, we think, the court was right. If we examine the act we shall find, “ that the lien authorized by this act shall be filed in the District Court of said county, in the same manner as mechanics liens are filed;” and further, that “the assessments authorized by this act shall be liens upon the properties assessed, from the commencement of the improvements for which they were made, and shall, if filed within six months after the completion of said improvements, continue liens for five years, and be revived by scire facias as other liens.”</p>
    <p id="b121-7" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[153,1201,1161,978]]]'>Now it will be observed that there is here not merely a direction, as in the act considered in the case of Magee <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20358" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Wright 358">10 Wright 358</a>, to file the assessments -within a given time in order that they may become a lien, but the provision is that they shall be a lien from the commencement of the improvement, and shall, “ <em>if filed within six months after the completion of said, </em>improvements, continue liens for five years.” Here the lien is made to depend for its existence upon the compliance with the condition, for if not, it follows that the lien, without the filing of the assessments, continues for five years. For, of course, if this condition is not obligatory but directory then there would be a sufficient compliance if there were a filing of the assessments at any time within the last named period. It would, however, be an amazing stretch of the imagination to suppose the legislature intended a matter so contrary to all reason and precedent as the burthening of property by secret and uncertain liens for the period of five years. The proposition so to construe the act becomes all the more singular when we consider that the framer of the statute had the <em>mechanics’ </em>lien law, not only for his model, but, so far as applicable, made it part of his enactment. There is, therefore, nothing left for us but the conclusion, that as the six months limitation in the mechanics’ lien law is material, so it is in the act under consideration.</p>

Here the statute may well be allowed to interpret itself. The lien is to commence with the commencement of the improvement. Now commencement is just as ambiguous a term as completion and not any less so; we presume, however, <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>no one would pretend that the lien would reach back to the promulgation of the ordinance for the street paving, the approval of the contract or to anything preliminary to the actual beginning Of the work, for nothing is more obvious than if the actual work never begins neither does the lien. Not less obvious is it that the completion of the improvement means the finishing of the work on the ground, for the city engineer is not called upon to finish the work, but to approve and accept that which has already been finisued by the contractor, hence his approval pre-supposes a work previously finished.</p>
    <p id="b122-6" data-blocks='[["BL_122.4",122,[245,818,1159,631]]]'>This question has been already and in point decided by the case of Kaiser <em>v. </em>Weise, 4 Norris 366. In this case, Kaiser the vendee of Weise had executed a mortgage for the purchase-money of the premises conveyed to him. On a scire facias brought to enforce the mortgage, he proposed to set off the payment of a precedent municipal lien originating in a claim for the grading of Hazlewood avenue. This was resisted on the ground that his payment was that of a mere volunteer, having been made one day after the six months had expired from the completion of the work. The court sustained the objection, and in this court its ruling was affirmed. Yet there, as here, it was contended that as the limitation, counting from the time of the approval and acceptance of the work, had not expired, the lien was in force. This case then is directly in point, and settles any doubt that might otherwise arise in the determination of the contention in hand.</p>
