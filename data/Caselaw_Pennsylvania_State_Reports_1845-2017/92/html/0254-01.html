If the words “so long as she remains my widow,” cannot be reconciled with the words of perpetuity, they must give way under the rule of construction relating to repugnant clauses in a will. A devise of profits, is a devise of the land itself: France’s Est., 25 P. F. Smith 223; Crosky <em>v. </em>Dodds, 6 Norris 359.

The words “ I give” are used twice in the clause. By the use of the first “give,” something is bestowed upon Sarah Pogue, with the express qualification that it is given to her during widowhood; by the second “give,” some other and different thing is bequeathed to her, with the express declaration that it is to be hers and to belong to her for ever. This is so plainly expressed on the face of the writing, that it is impossible to understand that all the legacies mentioned in the disputed clause were given for the same period, that is, either during widowhood or for ever. The court must draw a line between what was given to be Sarah Pogue’s during her widowhood, and what was given to be hers for ever, because the testator has plainly and expressly directed the drawing of such line. The subject-matter of the first gift was real estate. Of the second gift, personal property.</p>

    <p id="b257-7" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[130,759,1154,1202]]]'>In the clause quoted the words “I give” are used twice, once before the use and product of the real estate are devised, and once after the personal estate is specified. It begins by declaring, “ to my beloved wife, so long as she remains my widow, I give all the income of the home farm * * * with all the tenements and appurtenances belonging thereto, together with all the products arising therefrom, also the mansion house in which 1 live.” If the clause ended here, there would be no reason to doubt either the intention of the testator or the legal effect of the devise. In clear and express language the income and profits of the lands were given to her. only so long as she remained his widow. There is not only an absence of words necessary to pass a fee, but there is the express use of words giving a less estate. The gift is unequivocally limited to the time that she shall remain his widow. At the latest the interest devised ended at her death; but would end sooner in case of her marriage. While a devise of the income and profits of land is a devise of the land itself, yet it is a devise of it for no longer period of time than the testator gave the income and profits: France’s Estate, 25 P. F. Smith 220. The income and profits having been limited to the duration of her widowhood, her estate in the land was limited to the same period of time. She took an estate for life, because it might possibly last for life, but liable to be determined sooner, on the happening of the contingency of her marriage: 2 Black. Com. 121; 4 Kent’s Com. 26; Rodgers <em>v. </em>Rodgers, <a href="/watts/7/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Watts 15" data-case-ids="1846766" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0015-01">7 Watts 15</a>. It is not a devise upon condition, nor one the object of which is to impose a penalty or forfeiture; but it is a conditional limitation which marks the extent of the duration of the interest given: Bennett <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/watts/10/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Watts 348" data-case-ids="1850958" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0348-01">10 Watts 348</a>.</p>

This evidently means personal property. How does he give it?- Not as he has given the products of the land so long as she remains his widow, but “to be hers and to belong to her for ever.” The distinction is thus clearly made between the real and the personal estate. The former is given to her for life, the latter for ever. This view gives effect to the letter and spirit of the will. It would be <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>giving an unnatural interpretation to the clause to say the latter “I give” refers to the use and products of the lands. They had already been given in distinct and appropriate language. It would do still greater violence to the reading of the will to hold that the gift “to her for ever,” which following immediately after the personal estate, had any reference to that other property that he had just said she should have only so long as she remained his widow. As the last part of the clause reasonably and naturally applies to the personal estate only, we will not assume that it was intended to contradict the language he had used in regard to the real estate, nor to change the estate therein given. We see nothing obscure or ambiguous in the will. It does clearly appear therein, that the testator intended to devise to his wife, an estate in the land less than a fee. The fact that he did not devise the remainder is insufficient to overcome or change the effect of the language giving his wife a life-estate only. It follows that the parol evidence offered was insufficient to change its legal effect, and the title of the testator’s heirs must prevail.</p>
