I said: ‘Leave this matter over until to-morrow, and I will see about it.’ His reply was: ‘ I must leave the city on the first train in the morning, and therefore cannot wait. There is no risk in this business,’ (meaning the agency), ‘as you don’t have to pay only for what you sell, and the §45,’ (meaning the first instalment mentioned in the contract, or agreement), ‘is to protect us’ (the plaintiff) ‘so that you won’t throw the printed matter on our hands; and at the end of the year, if the thing is not a success, we ’ (meaning the plaintiff) ‘ will take the patterns off your hands, and you will be at at no loss.’ When the patterns were received with these assurances from the plaintiff’s authorized agent, we, the said defendants, did the best we could to dispose of and introduce them among the public ; and in accordance with said contract or agreement, both written and verbal, made with said agent, expressly on the conditions above stated; and with the explicit understanding, that we, the said defendants, were in no event to be liable for any goods or any amount, except for such portions of said consignments of paper patterns as were actually disposed of by us, the said defendants, for the account of the said plaintiff. After a fair trial, and finding no sale for said paper patterns in the neighborhood to which we were necessarily restricted, and having made reasonable effort, we, the said defendants, addressed the said plaintiff, and stating that no sale had taken place of said patterns, with the exceptions of those therein referred and specified, being a portion of the said first (and only) consignment of the paper patterns, informed him, the said plaintiff, that the balance of said consignment undisposed of was at the disposal of him, the said plaintiff, and subject to his orders, in pursuance of said agreement, and said notice was so given in writing; and therein was given notice of the desire of said defendant to be relieved from said agency, as provided for in and by said contract or agreement, before the expiration of said year, as therein provided. The deponent further answering, saith, that the said defendants and neither of them is, or are, indebted to the said Frank Leslie in the said sum of §269, or in any other sum whatever; and that said paper patterns are <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>and have been always at the disposal of said plaintiff, prior to the commencement of this action.

Among them was one binding Leslie “ to receive back from P. F. &amp; M. C. Keough unsold patterns within one year from the delivery thereof, and to give in exchange therefor such other patterns as may be ordered at the time the old ones are returned.” Every sentence relates to the agency.</p>

In general, when a party defends on the ground that he was induced to sign by an oral stipulation, unless he so avers in his affidavit, it is defective; but when the positive averments, considered with reference to the written contract, show beyond doubt that the oral agreement induced the signing of the written one, the affidavit is sufficient.
