On Thursday the 26th of March 1876, Ohleman &amp; Kingsbacher delivered to the Union Express Company at Conneautville the goods in question, consigned to Benjamin McMahon, at Millerstown. The property was valued at $40, and this amount was to be collected on delivery. The goods, according to the testimony of Ohleman, should have reached their destination on the day they were delivered to the company. They did reach Millerstown on <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>the next Saturday at five or six o’clock, according to the testimony of the agent of the express company. On the afternoon of that day McMahon called at the express office for the goods, and was informed that they were not there. Millerstown is a small village and McMahon was well known in the place and had beqn living within a hundred rods of the office of the company for one year previous to the fire. The company made no effort to find the consignee or to deliver the goods, and on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning after the delivery of the goods they were burned in the warehouse of the company.</p>

When they took the property, received it, they insured safe delivery in a reasonable time. The simple question for you is, did they deliver the goods ? If they did not, we instruct you, under the evidence, that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the value of the goods, with interest thereon from the time the property should have been at Millerstown; with interest from that time when it ought to have been delivered at Millerstown.

    <p id="b326-7" data-blocks='[["BL_326.7",326,[311,778,1160,464]]]'>These goods were sent by the defendants in error from Connautville, directed to Benjamin McMahon at Millerstown. They were delivered to the express agent on Thursday in time to have reached their destination on the evening of that day if sent by direct route. It appears they were sent by a more circuitous route, which the company was then using, and they did not arrive at Millerstown until from five to six o’clock’on Saturday evening. In anticipation of an earlier arrival McMahon called at the express office about two o’clock on Saturday afternoon, and inquired of the express agent if there was any package for him. The latter replied there was not.</p>
    <p id="b326-8" data-blocks='[["BL_326.8",326,[309,1250,1161,561]]]'>McMahon lived about one hundred rods from the express office, and had lived at the same place for more than a year. Pie was well known in the town. The goods arrived at Millerstown about six o’clock on Saturday evening; but they were never delivered to McMahon nor any notice of their arrival given to him. The company retained them until Tuesday night, at which time they were destroyed by fire. Thus two entire business days intervened between the time of their arrival and the night of the fire. There is no evidence in the case tending to-justify or excuse this omission of the company to either deliver the goods or give notice of their arrival. The main object of sending goods by express is to secure their early and prompt receipt. The case shows a clear disregard of duty imposed on the company.</p>

A receipt was given to the defendants in error when they delivered the goods to the company. No notice was proved of demand on them to produce the receipt. The remark made by the counsel of plaintiff in.error was insufficient for that purpose. On the trial the plaintiff in error offered in evidence a blank receipt with proof it was the usual form of receipt used by the company before, since, and at the time, these goods were shipped. The court rejected the paper but allowed the plaintiff to show what the receipt -was which the defendants took. This certainly opened wide the door to prove the contents of the -receipt actually given to the defendants in error. The company did not show nor offer to show that this blank was a copy of the one given to them. The attempt was to get this paper before the jury and induce them to find it to be a copy when no witness so testified. If the witness- was so doubtful <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>that he would not testify that in his opinion, or to the best of his belief, the paper offered was a copy of the receipt delivered, the court was clearly right in not permitting the paper to go to the JU17-</p>
