In 1875, McCullough borrowed from Dorsey 1000 barrels of oil. As security therefor, he gave Dorsey a check on the Citizens’ Bank of East Brady for $2000, in which it was written, that the bank held 1000 barrels of oil as collateral for the c.heck. This check was not to be presented nor otherwise used during the continuance of the loan. The check was endorsed, “ Good, J. Y. Foster, cashier.” This indorsement and signature of Foster was alleged to have been forged by McCullough; and for this, Dorsey made an information against McCullough for forgery. McCullough was arrested, and indicted by the grand jury of Butler county, for forgery, in January 1878. A jury was empanelled, and a verdict of not guilty entered on the issue joined.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b242-9" data-blocks='[["BL_242.9",242,[277,1316,1159,432]]]'>The verdict was the result of an arrangement previously made by Dorsey, the prosecutor, and the appellant, the brother-in-law of McCullough, by which, in consideration of McCullough’s securing $2800 to Dorsey by anote, the latter agreed not to appear as a witness against McCullough, and to keep back all other witnesses, and thus insure a verdict in favor of McCullough. This was carried out. Neither Dorsey nor any other witness appeared to testify. Upon the rendition of the verdict, the note of the defendants, in pursuance of such arrangement, was handed over to Dorsey, who accepted it as the consideration for suppressing the prosecution.</p>

Y. Foster, as cashier of said bank. The oil was not returned by McCullough, and the check went to protest. The bank refused <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>to pay, alleging that the acceptance was 'a forgery, and that if genuine, it was beyond the power of the cashier. The latter position was sustained by the Supreme Court. Dorsey having then no recourse except on McCullough, who was insolvent, indicted him for forgery, evidently as a means towards securing the debt. Dorsey claimed that McCullough owed him about $2300; McCullough admits some $1400 or $1500; but the great fluctuations in the price of oil. and the difference it would make if the oil was estimated at the price when borrowed by McCullough, or at the price when Dorsey asked its return, give room for a considerable difference in the views of the creditor and debtor, without injuring the honesty of either. We have no evidence that Dorsey used the prosecution to extort from defendants a note for one dollar more than he believed to be honestly due him from McCullough, or that he used any fraud or misrepresentation in the matter. The defendants therefore must rest their application entirely on the grounds, that part of the consideration of the note on which judgment was confessed, was the settlement and stifling of the criminal prosecution, and that, being against public policy, renders the note void. If this was a suit on a note or bond, the defence could be set up, ‘A&amp; <em>turpi causa non oritus actio.' </em>But here the defendants are the actors, they apply to open a judgment and restrain an execution. In this attempt they are met by the maxims: ‘ <em>In pari delicto melior est conditio possidentis,’ </em>and <em>‘Nemo allegans suam twrpitudinem audiendus est.’ </em>There are cases, indeed (such as attempts to poison the fountains of justice, and others), where the public interests demand the overthrow and exposure of the scheme, that the particeps criminis may be used for that purpose. But this is not such a case, and the agreement being executed not executory, defendants are without remedy. The practice which has grown up in this and other counties in the western part of this state, of making use of judgment notes in lieu of promissory notes, for vendue notes, for discount paper in bank, and. indeed for all ordinary business transactions,-must if such practice becomes general over the state, lead the courts or the legislature to relax the rules as to defences thereto. But as yet ‘ There is no difference in legal effect between a judgment confessed, and a judgment on a verdict of a jury Hopkins <em>v. </em>West, 2 Norris 109. A judgment is an executed contract. “ So long as a contract continues executory it may not only be impeached for fraud or mistake, but'any illegality which would be a defence at law, would in general be ground for cancellation in equity; as for instance, the illegality of contracts for gaming or smuggling, or aiding prosecution for compounding a felony or for paying usury. But a contract already executed, cannot be set aside as illegal or immoral, and nothing but fraud or palpable mistake is ground for rescinding an executed conveyance:" Nace <em>v. </em>Boyer, 6 Casey 110.

Entering judgment on this note, was filing or recording it in the office of the prothonotary — nothing more. . When a judgment is opened on terms that the case be tried on its merits, it does not preclude the defendant from showing that the bond sued on is invalid: Bradley <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 7 Casey 522; Cochran <em>v. </em>Eldridge, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wright%20365" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Wright 365">13 Wright 365</a>; Dorney <em>v. </em>Mertz, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Phila.%20553" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Phila. 553">8 Phila. 553</a>.

In Collins <em>v. </em>Blantern, 2 Wils. 341, a leading case, it was decided that illegality may be pleaded as a defence to an action on a bond, and so it has been held in England and this country ever since. The bond in that case was given as an indemnity for a note entered into by the obligee for the purpose of inducing a prosecutor of an indictment for perjury to withhold his evidence. After speaking of the transaction as one to gild over and conceal the truth, the court said, <em>“ </em>This is an agreement to stifle a prosecution for wilful and corrupt perjury, a crime most detrimental to the Commonwealth; for it is the duty of every man to prosecute, appear against and bring offenders of this sort to justice.” “ This is a contract to tempt a man to transgress the law, to that which was injurious to the community ; it is void by the common law, and the reason why the common law says such contracts are void is for the public good.” Had the defendant not been heard the court would have known nothing of the facts; they were not set out in the bond, the plaintiff was not compelled to show them in making out his case, and on the face of the bond he was entitled to recover; all that which proved it a void contract was shown by the defendant. So in the late case of Ham et al. <em>v. </em>Smith, 6 Norris 63, the corrupt, immoral and forbidden' contract appeared in the proofs adduced by the defendants; the plaintiff made his case by showing the note, the fair-looking fruit of the illegal bargain. Notwithstanding the maxim, it has been settled that when a contract or deed is made for an illegal purpose, a defendant against whom it is sought to be enforced, may show the turpitude of both himself and the plaintiff, and a court of justice will decline its aid to enforce a contract thus wrongfully entered <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>into. The principle depends on the public good, not on the merit of the defendant, whose hand is as foul as the plaintiff’s. Public policy requires that he be heard, and if the contract be void, his relief is an incident. Swan <em>v. </em>Scott, 11 S. &amp; R. 155, is no exception. There the suit was on a bond, given in satisfaction of an award of arbitrators, which had become a judgment; and the defendant proposed to go behind the judgment and show the illegal contract on which the award was obtained. <em>Held, </em>that he could not, and Duncan, J., remarked, “ The test, whether a demand connected with the illegal transaction is capable of being enforced at law is, whether the plaintiff requires the aid of the illegal transaction to establish his case.” It is manifest the judgment was conclusive, though obtained in a suit on an illegal contract, and the remark strictly fitted the facts in that case, without infringing on the rule. Wherever that test has been quoted and applied, it will be found there was a good consideration for the contract in suit before reaching back to the alleged illegal one.</p>

Obligors in an instrument under seal, made for the purpose of defrauding the obligee’s wife, cannot shield themselves by alleging their own fraud; for this does not belong to the class of contracts forbidden by statute or public policy: Evans <em>v. </em>Dravo, 12 Harris 62; Hendrickson <em>v. </em>Evans, 1 Casey 441. On like principle, voluntary conveyances and contracts made to defraud creditors, though void as to them, are good and binding between the immediate parties. These are avoided by the statute of 13 Elizabeth, for the benefit of creditors, but not' as to the parties: Hershey <em>v. </em>Weiting, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20240" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="14 Wright 240">14 Wright 240</a>; Blystone <em>v. </em>Blystone, 1 P. F. Smith 373. “ That a collusive contract binds the parties to it is a principle which commends itself no less to the moralist than to the jurist; for no dictate of duty calls on a judge to extricate a rogue from his own toils.” Stewart <em>v. </em>Kearney, <a href="/watts/6/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 Watts 453" data-case-ids="1846147" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0453-01">6 Watts 453</a>.

The law recognises this in their punishment. For instance, the maximum of imprisonment for one convicted of forgery is ten years, of larceny three. Stifling a prosecution for forgery, though an offence of same grade as compounding divers felonies, seems to be a graver offence than compounding some felonies. It comes within the rule, that where the welfare of society and the vindication of the law are the chief objects, the defendant may give in evidence the illegality of the contract as a bar to a suit to enforce it; and this to prevent the evil which would he produced by enforcing the contract or allowing it to stand.

The court in which the judgment is rendered will indeed open one of the former kind, and let the defendant into a defence in a proper case and upon equitable terms.” In Pennsylvania it has always been the right of a defendant in a judgment confessed by virtue of a warrant of attorney to petition that it be opened for cause. This right was so well respected by the courts that there was no occasion for legislation providing for appeal from refusal to open till a recent date. The entry of judg<a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>merits, either by attorneys or prothonotaries, on judgment-notes, is very common. These though having the same effect as if on the verdict of a jury, while they stand, in fact, never were the results of adjudication. To hold that such a judgment entered on an immoral and illegal obligation, part of a transaction subversive of public interests, shall be deemed an executed contract, with absolute right in the plaintiff to judicial process for collection, would be shocking to every man’s sense of justice. The argument is that the judgment shall stand, for the plaintiff need only show the note, and the defendant, as actor, will not be heard alleging his own and the plaintiff’s turpitude in an application for opening the judgment. In one sense the plaintiff is an actor — he caused confession of judgment on the void instrument, and uses the process of the law to collect the money agreed to be paid for its violation. The reason of the rule which allows a defendant to plead and prove the illegality of a contract in bar of a suit upon it, demands that he be heard in an application to open a judgment so confessed. His rights are of secondary importance, and he is not heard for their vindication. It is the duty of the court, on proper showing, to open such a judgment, to the end that there may be a trial as if suit had been originally commenced on the note or other obligation on which the- judgment was entered. In this way the law may be vindicated and the interest of the Commonwealth conserved.</p>
