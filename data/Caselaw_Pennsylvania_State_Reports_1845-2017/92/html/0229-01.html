Both the Acts of June 16th 1836 and of 1870, have reference solely to corporations having franchises and privileges from which they derive a profit or income for the individual benefit of its members. The Reform School is not of this character. It has no capital stock, no provision for making dividends; has no rents, issues, profits, tolls or receipts from any source. The funds necessary to carry on its work were originally derived from public and private charity, and are now furnished wholly by the state. No private advantage <em>or </em>emolument accrues to the corporation or its members in any way, as in banking, railroad or turnpike companies, and its managers conduct its affairs without any compensation or right to receive compensation. As originally, incorporated it was a great public charity. It held and owned no property, except such as was necessary for the proper conduct of its work, and had no privileges or franchises which could be seized by writ of sequestration.</p>

Fees are established by a subsequent act to be paid by the proper county. The name was afterwards changed to the Pennsylvania Reform School. The question is, can a mechanic’s claim be filed against the building occupied by the school? If it can, a levari facias may be issued, the building may be sold and the inmates let loose. We think that it accords with all our decisions to hold that an institution of this character is a public institution, though under the control of a corporation, yet subject to visitation by the legislature. It is a public corporate body, and cannot be proceeded against by levari facias. No other writ could be issued under proceedings upon a mechanic’s claim, and it is unnecessary to inquire what the proper remedy of the plaintiffs would be.</p>
