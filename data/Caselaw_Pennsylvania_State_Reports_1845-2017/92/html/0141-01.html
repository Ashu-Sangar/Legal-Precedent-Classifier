Lloyd in and of any and all personal, real or mixed property, rights, claims and credits of the partnership styled J. G. De Huff &amp; Co.

Lloyd in and of the personal and mixed property, rights, claims and credits of the said partnership firms, and sold the same for the sum of $&gt;1320.

No. 55 September Term 1875, to be in his hands and to be prior in order of time to said fi. fa., No. 88 October Term 1875, refused to appropriate the proceeds of said sale to either of said writs (they being claimed by the respective plaintiffs in each of said writs), but, after deducting the costs in both writs, to wit: the sum of $&gt;34.03, by leave of court he paid the balance, ¡$1285.97, into court. That thereupon the court appointed an auditor to make distribution of said proceeds, before whom the plaintiffs in said writs appeared and made proof of the facts herein stated. That said auditor, on November 29th 1875, reported to this court a distribution appropriating the fund, paid into court as aforesaid, to said fi. fa., No. 88 October Term 1875. That exceptions having been taken by the plaintiffs in fi. fa., No. 55 September Term 1875, to the finding and distribution of said auditor, they came on for hearing before this court, and were overruled and the report of said auditor confirmed absolutely. That said exceptants thereupon took an appeal to the Supreme Court of this state, at No. 151 October and November Term 1876, assigning for error the rulings of this court in overruling said exceptions and confirming said report; at which term the said Supreme Court affirmed the rulings of this court. That upon said action of this court and of the said Supreme Court, the proceeds of said sale were paid out of court to said fi. fa., No. 88 October Term 1875, whereupon the said plaintiffs, being the plaintiffs in said fi. fa., No. 55 September Term 1875, brought this action.</p>

    <p id="b144-8" data-blocks='[["BL_144.8",144,[259,1007,1166,1284]]]'>The Act of 8th April 1873, Pamph. L. 65, Purd. Dig. 1813, provides a special form of proceeding where it is sought to levy upon and sell the interest of a partner in the firm of which he is a member. Without entering into all the details of said act, it contains two features that are essentially different from the practice existing at the time of its passage. 1st. The judgment must be entered in the county where the chief office or place of business of the said partnership is or was last located; or if not entered in such county, then a <em>testatum </em>writ of fieri facias may issue upon such judgment, as in case of a fieri facias; and 2d, The fieri facias is required to be a special writ, “ which shall command the sheriff or other officer to levy the sum of said judgment, with interest and costs of suit, upon the interest of defendant or defendants in said writ, of any personal, mixed or real property, rights, claims and credits in such partnership, and thereupon proceed and sell the same,” &amp;c. In most, if not in all other respects, the act is merely declaratory ; it being well settled, that prior to its passage, the interest of a. partner in a firm could be sold upon a fieri facias, issued upon a judgment recovered against him for his individual debt: Deal <em>v. </em>Bogue, 8 Harris 228; Vandike <em>v. </em>Rosskam, 17 P. F. Smith 330. But the provision requiring the sale to take place in the county where the chief place of business of the firm is located, is important, and cannot fail to prove beneficial. Prior to the act, the interest of a partner residing in Pittsburgh, in a firm located and doing business in the city of Philadelphia, could be sold by the sheriff of Allegheny county upon a writ of fieri facias, without notice to, or the knowledge of the firm. This was a serious evil, and liable to entail loss and inconvenience upon firms so situated. The Act of 1873 was evidently intended to remedy this defect, and it has certainly done so to a very great extent.</p>
    <p id="b144-9" data-blocks='[["BL_144.9",144,[263,2291,1157,128]],["BL_145.1",145,[139,401,1164,730]]]'>The legislature having provided a particular mode of procedure in such cases, it must be followed. The Act of 21st March 1806, Purd. 58, 4 Sm. Laws 332, provides that, “ In all cases where a <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>remedy is provided, or duty enjoined, or anything directed to be done by any Act or Acts of Assembly of this Commonwealth, the directions of the said act shall be strictly pursued ; and no penalty shall be inflicted, or anything done agreeably to the provisions of the common law in such cases, further than shall be necessary for carrying such act or acts into effect.” This act was formerly held to extend only to penal actions and indictable offences: Rees <em>v. </em>Emerick, 6 S. &amp; R. 286. But later decisions have extended it both to civil and criminal proceedings : Wike <em>v. </em>Lightner, <a href="/rawle/1/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Rawle 289" data-case-ids="1819167" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0289-01">1 Rawle 289</a>. In Suydam <em>v. </em>North-Western Insurance Co., 1 P. F. Smith 394, it was said: “ These acts having thus provided a remedy and devised a system by which the rights and credits of a corporation, the debts due it, deposits belonging to it, all that is applicable to the payment of its debts, may be reached at the suit of a judgment-creditor, the mode pointed out is, by force of the Act of 1806, exclusive of all others.” We might multiply authorities, but it is not needed. The principle is well settled.</p>
    <p id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[133,1133,1162,600]]]'>The first execution issued in this case, No. 55 of September term 1875, was an ordinary writ of fieri facias. It contained no command to the sheriff to levy upon the interest of John L. Lloyd, defendant therein, in the firms of De Huff &amp; Co., and the iEtna and Sharpsburg Savings Bank ; nor was the sheriff or the plaintiffs in the execution aware that Lloyd was the owner of any such interests. Subsequently, and while this writ was in the hands of the sheriff in full force and unexecuted, the execution No. 88 October term, came into his hands. This was a special writ of fieri facias under the Act of 1873, commanding the sheriff to levy upon the interest of Lloyd in the partnerships referred to. The sheriff obeyed the command of the writ and made the levy, and the proceeds of the sale thereunder were afterwards awarded to the second execution, the one upon which the levy had been made.</p>

    <p id="b145-8" data-blocks='[["BL_145.6",145,[123,2037,1162,257]]]'>Each of these propositions must be answered in the negative.
