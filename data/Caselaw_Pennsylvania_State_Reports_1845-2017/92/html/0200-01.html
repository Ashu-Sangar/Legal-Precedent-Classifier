But the evidence shows that there was no arrangement between the parties (as is alleged), and that the two transactions were separate and distinct. The sale was <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>made on the 6th of September 1876, and Mackintosh, Hemphill &amp; Co., at once gave a credit of that date upon their judgment, as appears from the writs of fi. fa. subsequently issued. The purchase of the Boyce judgments, and their assignment to Mackintosh, Hemphill &amp; Co., were not made until July 23d 1877, nearly a year after the sale and waiver by Boyce. Boyce had a clear legal right to waive the priority of his lien, and to sell his judgments to whomsoever he pleased, and the purchaser undoubtedly succeeded to all the legal rights of Boyce; and one of these rights was to receive the money, in court.</p>
