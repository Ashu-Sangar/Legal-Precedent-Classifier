Where a fact is established in a cause by evidence, tne jury may properly be allowed to draw therefrom such inferences as are logically deducible from it. Thus if it be shown that the driver of a car was asleep or intoxicated at the time of an accident, a presumption of negligence would properly arise. But the fact from which such inference is to be drawn must first be established. It will not do to presume that he was in that condition from some remote fact, in no way connected with the case, and upon this presumption base the additional presumption of his negligence.' A presumption should always be based upon a fact, and should» be a reasonable and natural deduction from that fact.</p>

The court permitted plaintiffs to ask a witness how many hours the drivers and conductors on the railway were employed each day, for the purpose of showing that the driver of the car which injured the child was physically unable to discharge his duty at the time of the accident. <em>Held, </em>that this was error.</p>

While so employed the child went into the street, and was knocked over by car No. 127 of the defendant’s line. The mother did not know that the child had left the room until she heard its screams. The child was injured by a car going east on the track nearest the house of Henrice. A woman living opposite had seen the child coming towards the track, and had thrown up her hands and motioned to the driver “ to stop.” Another woman testified that the driver could have seen the child if he had been looking; that one looking on the street could have seen the child. The driver testified that he did not see the child, and that he did not understand the woman who cried out to him, and that his attention had been diverted by a woman who was crossing the track in front of him. The plaintiffs proposed to ask a witness what were the hours of service per day then required by the company of the driver. This to be coupled with the offer to show that the hours of service required of other drivers were required of the driver of the car that ran over the child. Objected to. Objection overruled, and evidence admitted. (First and second assignments of error.)</p>

That is, if the jury should think th'e contract of employment of a driver was too long in point of time, then, without any evidence, they were at liberty to believe such time of service rendered him unable to discharge his duties properly, and thus .they could impute negligence to the company.

Such proof was admissible as furnishing a <em>probability </em>that such would be the effect of such hours of labor upon the driver, and, as a fact in connection with the other circumstances, it is right to refer it to the jury : Tanner <em>v. </em>Hughes, 3 P.

The first and second allege error in the admission of evidence on behalf of the plaintiff below to prove the hours of service required by the defendant company of its drivers and conductors, whilst the fourth relates to the instructions of the court upon said evidence.</p>
    <p id="b433-8" data-blocks='[["BL_433.12",433,[128,1677,1160,727]],["BL_434.1",434,[299,387,1159,1161]]]'>The fact to be proved was, whether the driver of car No. 127 had been guilty of negligence upon the occasion in question in consequence of which the child, Charles Ilenrice, had been run over and injured. Was the evidence objected to of such a character as tended to prove this fact ? It "was undoubtedly competent to prove the condition of the driver at the time the accident occurred; that he was intoxicated, or absent, or for any other reason incompetent to attend to his duties: Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Books, 7 P. F. Smith 339; Mansfield Coal &amp; Coke Co. <em>v. </em>McEnery, 10 Norris 185. These were specific matters which might have been proved; but how the fact that other drivers and other conductors were allowed only a certain number of hours for sleep and rest could affect the question of this particular driver upon this particular occasion is not apparent. It is easy to see, however, how. such evidence might seriously influence the jury and increase the damages. When a fact is established in a cause by evidence, the jury may properly be allowed to draw therefrom such <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>inferences as are logically deducible from it. Thus if it be shown that the driver was asleep or intoxicated at the time of the accident, a presumption of negligence would properly arise. But the fact from which such inference is to be drawn must first be established. It will not do to presume that he was in the condition referred to from some remote fact in no way connected with the case, and upon this presumption base the additional presumption of his negligence. This would be to found a presumption upon a presumption, which is never allowed. A presumption should always be based upon a fact, and should be a reasonable and natural deduction from such fact. The true rule was correctly stated by Mr. Justice Thompson, in Douglass <em>v. </em>Mitchell's Exrs., 11 Casey 443 : “ That as proof of a fact, the law permits inferences from other facts, but does not allow presumptions of fact from presumptions. A fact being established, other facts may be, and often are ascertained by just inferences. Not so with a mere presumption of a fact; no presumption can with safety be drawn from a presumption : there being no fixed or ascertained fact from which an inference of fact might be drawn, none is drawn.” What has been said applies to the charge of the court embraced in the fourth assignment, as well as to the offers of evidence. There was no evidence that the driver of car No. 127 was in any way rendered incompetent to perform his duties in a proper and careful manner by reason of the severity of his labors or the loss of rest and sleep. In the absence of such evidence we have but a mere presumption, and upon this it was not competent to construct the further presumption of his negligence.</p>
    <p id="b434-6" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[299,1548,1160,846]]]'>There was also error in affirming the plaintiff’s fourth point. (See third assignment.) The point is framed upon the assumption that the driver saw the child approaching the car. There is no evidence upon this point save that of the driver himself, and he says he did not see it until after the injury. It is possible he might have seen it had he been on the alert — some of the witnesses say so substantially — but the point is not so framed. But if he had seen the child “in the street approaching the car, and in such close proximity that the child might reach the track before the car passed,” it was still error to instruct the jury, as a matter of law, that it was negligence for the driver not to stop the car. The standard of duty in such a case was a shifting one, and for the jury, not a fixed rule, the same under all circumstances, and, therefore, for the court. It did not follow that the child would reach the car, and the point was framed upon the mere possibility of its doing so. From the driver’s standpoint, assuming him to have seen the child, it may have appeared extremely improbable. It was a question for the jury to determine whether, under all the circumstances, it was his duty to stop. It was error to rule it as a matter of law.</p>
