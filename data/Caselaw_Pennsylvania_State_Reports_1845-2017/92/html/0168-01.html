Ejectment would not have been a proper remedy, neither could it have been maintained; the possession of P. A. Templeton and J. Y. Foster, their tenants in common and partners, was the possession of the plaintiff; neither one was entitled to maintain ejectment against the other for any purpose. It was with a view of compelling P. A. Templeton and J. Y.

The plaintiffs’ complaint is, “that the defendants refuse to recognise their claim and title” to the undivided one-fourth interest in the property, and consequently do not account to them for the proceeds. The whole testimony before the master relates to title, not a word about the amount of the production, proceeds or expenses. The question of account or other equitable relief was not raised or heard of after the filing of plaintiffs’ bill and appointment of a reqeiver, of which no record even seems to exist. The master’s report deals only with the question of title, and his chief error was in not dismissing the plaintiffs’ bill as prayed for by defendants, because to sustain it he must decree the title to be in the plaintiffs. It is then properly a question of title. There are no mutual, disputed or complicated accounts, no discovery sought, no ground whatever for equitable relief.</p>
