That at the time the work was done, the front of the lot was paved and curbed as required by the city ordinances, and that the repavement was without authority. 6.

The claim referred to a curb-line fixed under the ordinance of 1872. The plea does not aver that the curb was on a different line. To avoid mistake, the replication made a new assignment, that the curbing done was not on the line for which the claim was filed. If claimants had traversed plea on the theory that it meant to traverse the claim, a departure might have taken place in pleading, according as the j udge at Nisi Prius might have construed it. As, however, from the demurrer the defendant construes his plea to mean that he had curbed his footway when it was of a different width, judgment should have gone for the plaintiff on the whole pleading, unless it be held that the city is powerless to change the width of a footway on a public street, and if she does so, it cannot be curbed at the expense of the owner.</p>

If any plea raised a sufficient defence, and that plea was admitted in fact by a demurrer, the court were clearly right in entering judgment for the defendant upon the whole record. Now the fourth plea set up the facts which, in Wistar <em>v. </em>The City, were held to constitute a good defence to the claim. It was objected that the plea was double and could not be replied to issuably. But a plea may suggest many facts when they all go to make up a single defence: Blair <em>v. </em>Singerly, 7 Phila. R. 230; Crogate’s Case, 8 Rep. 67. It was accordingly held in Robinson <em>v. </em>Bayley, Burrows 316, that to a plea of a right of common, the replication might deny that the cattle belonged to the defendant, that they were levant and couchant upon the premises, and were commonable cattle. Lord Mansfield said: “ It is true you must take issue upon a single point; but it is not necessary that this single point should consist only of a single fact.” Now the point is that the city could not recover the cost of the curbing from the properties, on the street. The whole plea might have been traversed, or, if the plaintiff had so chosen, he might have traversed any one of the facts necessary to constitute the defence. There is no general issue to a scire facias on a municipal claim, and it cannot, therefore, be objected that this plea amounts to the general issue.</p>
