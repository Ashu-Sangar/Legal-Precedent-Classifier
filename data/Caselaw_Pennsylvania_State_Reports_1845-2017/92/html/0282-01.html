The rule that a deed absolute on its face may be shown, by parol, to have been intended as a mortgage, is too well established in Pennsylvania to need the citation of authorities.

The judgment on which it was sold was entered after the deed from Paige to the defendant in error and after the contract of defeasance were recorded. Inasmuch, however, as the defeasance was not recorded in the mortgage-book, but in the agreement-book, it is claimed that it was improperly recorded, and, therefore, if in fact a mortgage, the sheriff’s sale passed a title discharged therefrom. It may be conceded that this was the correct view under the authority of Luch’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20510" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="8 Wright 510">8 Wright 510</a>. That case, however, has been expressly overruled by Glading <em>v. </em>Frick, 7 Norris 460. It is there held that such an instrument of writing is properly recorded in any book kept by the recorder of deeds. Cooper then bought subject to the claim óf the defendant in error, conceding the conveyance to have been a mortgage. If a mortgage, the latter can recover no more than the sum loaned, which it was given to secure, with legal interest thereon. The assignments are substantially sustained.</p>
