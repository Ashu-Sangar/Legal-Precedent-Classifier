Courts should be- ingenious in discovering reasons in support of the right of appeal but not to take away that right.</p>

    <p id="b297-10" data-blocks='[["BL_297.12",297,[147,1914,1162,428]]]'>As the right of appeal is given by Act of Assembly, a party cannot be deprived thereof, except by his express agreement. How may that agreement be shown ? How shall the Common Pleas, when no fraud or want of jurisdiction in the justice is alleged, inquire into the cause of action before him ? Shall it be by inspection of the transcript, or by parol evidence? Manifestly by the former. A court of error cannot look beyond the record. A paper does not become a part of the record merely by being filed. It required an express statute to put depositions on the record, and that can be done only by bill of exceptions.</p>
