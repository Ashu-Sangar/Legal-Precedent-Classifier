It is true that when the will was made, and when the testator died, his daughters were all unmarried. They were then young children, the youngest but thirteen years of age. He was aware, for knowledge in this respect must be presumed, that a trust for separate use could not, under these circumstances, be created. He does not attempt to do it. Evidently acting under professional advice, he defers the time at which his daughter’s estates are to take effect, and gives his entire property to trustees, upon whom he confers certain active duties. These duties are : first, to receive and apply the income for a given period; and, second, to make conveyances when that period has expired. The character of the conveyances so to be made is simply indicated by the testator, the actual conveyance being left to the trustee, and whether the daughters shall receive legal or equitable estates depends upon their status when the conveyance is to be made.</p>

The estate given to the trustees terminated <em>ipso facto, </em>when the youngest child became of age, and no power or duty with regard to the settlement or division then to be made was conferred upon them. The testator undertook to make the division himself, and, of course, the invalidity of the trust for separate use was determined by the state of facts at the time of his death. But here the estate remains in the trustees, and until they have exercised the power given, does not pass to the daughters at all. Until then, though in one sense vested, it is as already stated,.uncertain whether their interests will take effect as legal or as equitable estates.

The youngest daughter attained her majority in August 1878, prior to which time one of the four was married; another, then betrothed, was married shortly afterwards, and both husbands are living. The other two daughters remained single; and as to them no question arises. It is conceded that the will was inoperative to create any trust as to their respective shares, and consequently they are entitled to take them absolutely. But, as to the married daughters, the contention is that inasmuch as the one was actually married and the other in immediate contempla<a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>tion of marriage at the time fixed by the testator for the division of his estate, the trust for their separate use took effect at that time; that their then status determined the nature of their interest.</p>
    <p id="b509-6" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[118,515,1163,1418]]]'>While the English doctrine appears to be, that a trust for separate use may be effectually created, notwithstanding the woman is unmarried at the time, and no particular marriage is then in contemplation, and that the trust, although suspended by the cessation of coverture, will re-attach on a subsequent marriage, it is not so with us. In McBride <em>v. </em>Smyth, 4 P. F. Smith 245, Mr. Justice Strong says, “ Whatever may be the rule in the English courts, it is here too well-established to be disturbed by anything else than a legislative enactment, that a separate use for a woman cannot be created unless she is covert, or unless in immediate contemplation of her marriage.” The same doctrine is re-asserted in Wells <em>v. </em>McCall, 14 P. F. Smith 207, where it is said, that all the cases which decide, that on the termination of coverture the trust falls and is not revived by a second marriage, prove that the marriage must be in immediate view at the time the trust is created, for if any marriage would answer to the provision for the trust, a second would as well as the first. After referring to the opposing principles underlying our doctrine of trusts, and springing, on the one hand, from the private right of the donor to control his gift; and, on the other, from that public policy which forbids restraints on alienation, it is said, that the necessary consequence of this conflict has been “a compromise which yields the doctrine of policy so far, as to enable the donor to impose a trust upon his gift when it is done in immediate contemplation of marriage.” This appears to be the utmost limit to -which this court has gone in favor of private right as against public policy, and it would perhaps be unwise to go any further. Trusts for coverture, either actual or in contemplation at the time of their creation, have some foundation in reason which cannot apply to coverture in the more remote future. In the former, the testator is presumed to know the then existing or contemplated alliance, and has the data on which to base an intelligent judgment as to the propriety of creating a trust. While in the latter, he can have nothing more than a bare possibility as a guide.</p>

In the present case, the testator directed his executors to divide his estate when his youngest daughter attained her majority, and enjoined on them to do it in such “way and manner,” as that the respective shares of each daughter should be for her sole and separate use.
