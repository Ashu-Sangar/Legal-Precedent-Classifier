In a partnership bill the plaintiffs and defendants were members of an unincorporated association called the “ Concord Bank.” The prayers were for an account for contribution. One of defendants denied his liability to account, on the ground that he was not a member of the co-partnership. <em>Held, </em>that his liability was a question to be settled before the equities between the parties could be gone into.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b157-10" data-blocks='[["BL_157.8",157,[155,1988,1162,208]]]'>2. The plaintiffs alleged that they had become security for and been compelled to pay large sums on account of the partnership. To establish the liability of the partner who refused to contribute and ascertain the amount he was entitled to pay involved the adjustment of complicated accounts. <em>Held, </em>that the questions thus to be settled were not adapted to an ordinai-y jury trial, and that a resort to equity proceedings was proper.</p>

His report was only as to the liability of the defendant who refused to contribute. <em>Held, </em>that the proper practice would have been to have made a special reference to the master to report upon the preliminary question of the defendant’s liability as a partner, but as the master had done what he ought to have done, under a proper reference, this court will regard the order as amended.</p>

    <p id="b163-12" data-blocks='[["BL_163.14",163,[117,2326,1160,85]],["BL_164.1",164,[296,424,1164,595]]]'>This was a partnership bill. The plaintiffs and defendants are respectively members of an unincorporated association called- the <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>“Concord Savings Bank.” The prayers were for an account and for contribution. H. P. Conway, one of the defendants, by his answer denied his liability to account, for the reason that he was not a member of the co-partnership. The liability of the other defendants to account and contribution was not denied. The denial of the partnership by Conway, raised a preliminary question as to him which, under the authorities, it was necessary to settle before the equities between the parties could be gone into: Collyer <em>v. </em>Collyer, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20257" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Wright 257">2 Wright 257</a>. The master accordingly proceeded to hear the case, and upon testimony which is entirely satisfactory, found the fact that H. P. Conway was a member of the partnership ; that he was liable to contribution, and recmomending a decree for an account. Upon exceptions filed to his report, the court below dismissed the bill.</p>
    <p id="b164-6" data-blocks='[["BL_164.4",164,[298,1026,1161,641]]]'>This was error. The subject-matter of the bill was clearly within the jurisdiction of equity. It comes within the express terms of the Act of 16th June 1836, conferring equity powers upon the courts. See also Collyer <em>v. </em>Collyer, <em><a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20257" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Wright 257">supra;</a> </em>Tutton <em>v. </em>Addams, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%2067" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="9 Wright 67">9 Wright 67</a> ; Hedge &amp; Horn’s Appeal, 13 P. F. Smith 273. The point strongly pressed on behalf of Conway, that the plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law, is not well taken. The questions to be settled, were not adapted to an ordinary jury trial. The plaintiffs allege, that they had become security for, and had been compelled to pay large sums on account of the partnership. To establish the liability, and ascertain the amount the defendant Conway would be entitled to contribute, necessarily involved the adjustment of complicated accounts. The flexible machinery of a court of equity, is peculiarly adapted to such proceedings, and has very generally driven out of use the old remedy by action of account render.</p>
    <p id="b164-7" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[302,1669,1160,465]]]'>Objection was made, that the report was incomplete; that the reference to the master was general, and included the whole case. It is true the reference was general. This was a mistake, and probably an oversight. The proper practice would have been to have made a special reference to the master, to report upon the preliminary question of the defendant Conway’s liability as a partner. As the master has done just what he ought to have done under a proper reference, we may well regard the order as amended. The objection is purely technical, and the irregularity did no harm. Mere technicalities are not favored in equity, which regards substance rather than form.</p>
    <p id="b164-8" data-blocks='[["BL_164.6",164,[306,2141,1159,86]]]'>The court below gave no reasons for dismissing the bill, and we are unable to see any.</p>
    <p id="b164-9" data-blocks='[["BL_164.7",164,[479,2228,988,214]]]'>The decree is reversed at the costs of the appellees; the bill is re-instated ; the decree reported by the master is approved ; and it is ordered that the record be remitted to the court below for the purpose of taking an account, and for such further proceedings as may be necessary.</p>
