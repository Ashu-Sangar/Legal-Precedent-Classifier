S. had no license to sell whiskey, nor were the barrels when sold marked as required by the United States laws. The bank brought suit against R. on the note, who contended that it was void because of these violations of the law by S. <em>Held, </em>that it was not void, as the United States Statutes did not prohibit the sale of whiskey, but only imposed a penalty for their violation. <em>Held, further, </em>that S., by this single transaction, was not a dealer within the meaning of the statutes.</p>

      <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>At the trial, it appeared that in 1872 David G. Swartz had a quantity of whiskey, the product of his distillery, which, together with his distillery, he sold to Rahter. In payment therefor he received from Rahter a certain amount of cash, a house in Baltimore, and the note in suit. A draft, also in suit, was given by Rahter to pay arrears of ground-rent and taxes on the Baltimore property. The note was drawn payable in one year after date. Before it came due Rahter failed, and the note was not paid. Six days before the note came due, Swartz, who was a director in the First National Bank of Lancaster, had it discounted by the hank, who brought this suit upon it. It appeared that the note had been, in effect, paid to the bank, it having charged the same up to Swartz, and there being sufficient funds to his crpdit to pay it. Swartz also admitted that at the time of this transaction he had no United States license as a dealer in whiskey, nor a license under the laws of Pennsylvania; that the barrels were not branded with the words “containing no deleterious drugs or added poison,” and that he did not certify these facts to the purchaser.</p>

He has, therefore, failed to comply with this law. The law prescribes that it shall be the duty of <em>any person. </em>There is no room for defining Mr. Swartz out of the operation of the law. The language is as broad as it can be made. The act provides that any one “ offending against <em>any </em>of its provisions shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and subject to fine and imprisonment.” By the Act of 8th May 1854, the legislature has declared the common law to be what we have contended it is.</p>
