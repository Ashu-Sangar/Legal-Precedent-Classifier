It was shown that the Central Bank of Pittsburgh had received all said notes from Jacob II. Walker at or about their respective dates. It appeared that the Central Bank of Pittsburgh at the dates respectively of the $4000 and $2500 notes and the original of the $800 note, and at the times the same were respectively received by it from Walter, was a private hanking co-partnership, of which Walter was a partner and managing director, he being a member of its discount committee. It remained a private co-partnership until September 1875, when it purchased a charter, viz.: “ The Act to Incorporate the Western Savings Bank and Safe Deposit Company of Pittsburgh,” and procured a decree of court changing this corporate title to “ The Central Bank of Pittsburgh,” and thereafter, without any change in its membership or otherwise, it continued the business at the old stand and with the old officials.</p>

The defendants denied that he was the liquidating partner, and this was one of the principal questions in the case. Defendants testified that the said notes were made and negotiated without their consent or knowledge, and the first they knew of the existence thereof was about the time of their maturity; that they were not made or negotiated in the course of the business of the firm of Fulton, Marvin &amp; Co., but long after <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>its dissolution; that as early as the spring of 1873, the firm sold their works and all their other property, ceased all business and dissolved; and that Jacob H.

He testified that the $2500 note was the last part renewal of a note originally for $5000, which his banking firm had discounted for Eulton, Marvin &amp; Co., and had carried for several years by renewals every four months.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b114-7" data-blocks='[["BL_114.5",114,[269,919,1159,214]]]'>Upon the cross-examination of Mr. Walter, the defendants proposed to interrogate him further in respect to said original note for $5000, and the renewals thereof, and to show that these renewals had been at extravagant and usurious rates of interest, and if the usury was abated there was nothing due upon that note.</p>

    <p id="b115-6" data-blocks='[["BL_115.6",115,[124,491,1161,563]]]'>It is well-settled that after dissolution, a liquidating partner may bind his late co-partners in borrowing money to pay the debts of the late firm. He may renew an accommodation endorsement, and give notes to liquidate the partnership indebtedness: Dundas <em>v. </em>Gallagher, 4 Barr 205; Robinson <em>v. </em>Taylor, Id. 242; Brown <em>v. </em>Clark, 2 Harris 469; Ward <em>v. </em>Tyler, 2 P. F. Smith 393; Lloyd <em>v. </em>Thomas, 29 Id. 68. The authority to act as a liquidating partner, does not require an express and specific appointment. When one so acts with the knowledge of his late co-partners, their permission may be presumed, and as to third persons, they may be bound by his acts. The court stated the law correctly. We are not furnished with the full evidence; but will not assume it to have been insufficient to carry the question of authority to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b115-7" data-blocks='[["BL_115.7",115,[123,1052,1164,343]]]'>The seventh assignment is to the rejection of certain evidence in cross-examination. A cross-examination should be confined to matters, in relation to which, the witness has been examined in chief, or to such questions as may tend to show his bias or interest. Hopkinson et al. <em>v. </em>Leeds, 28 P. F. Smith 396. It was well said in that case by Mr. Justice Williams, “ to permit the defendant under the guise of cross-examination, to give evidence in chief, is not only disorderly, but unfair to the plaintiff.”</p>
    <p id="b115-8" data-blocks='[["BL_115.8",115,[122,1395,1160,377]]]'>The attempt in the present case, was made under circumstances more than usually objectionable. In making their defence, the plaintiffs in error had not proved or alleged usury. They did not claim that any had been received by the corporation defendant in error, or by the association from which the bank obtained the notes. They had put their defence on other grounds and rested. When the defendant in error had called Walter in rebuttal, then the plaintiffs in error sought in his cross-examination, to introduce this new and distinct defence.</p>
    <p id="b115-9" data-blocks='[["BL_115.9",115,[121,1783,1172,343]]]'>Much must be left to the discretion of the judge, as to the time and order of introducing evidence. The tendency of the evidence proposed by the cross-examination, if it had any effect, was to re-open the case, and involve an inquiry into matters not alleged before. We do not think the incomplete evidence furnished, will justify us in holding, that the learned judge committed such an error in rejecting this evidence, as to call for a reversal. We discover no error in the other assignments.</p>
