Cowell against Jacob Shriver, before a justice of the peace, to recover the sum of $28.84, the amount of school tax alleged to have been levied against the defendant in Whiteley township, Greene county, Pennsylvania, for the year 1875, and paid by the plaintiff for the defendant. The justice having entered a judgment against the defendant by default, the case was removed by appeal to the Common Pleas.</p>

On the 19th of July 1875 the school board appointed Cowell'collector for the year 1875. .The school directors issued their duplicate for the collection of the above-mentioned taxes, with a warrant to Cowell, the collector. On that duplicate Jacob Shriver stood charged with $28.84. Cowell, on the 2d day of June 1876, settled with the township auditors, and was charged with the $28.84, the amount of Shriver’s tax, and on the same day he paid the same to his successor in office, Mr. Eli Rose.</p>

In this case, if the tax collector preferred to disobey the mandate of his warrant, by refusing to sell personal property in order to satisfy the tax, he necessarily assumed the position of one paying the debt of another voluntarily, and in the absence of any request on the part of the defendant. His act was a mere voluntary courtesy, and he cannot recover therefor: Winsor <em>v. </em>Savage, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Metc.%20347" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Metc. 347">9 Metc. 347</a>; Anderson <em>v. </em>Hamilton Township, 1 Casey 75 ; Natcher <em>v. </em>Natcher, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20496" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 Wright 496">11 Wright 496</a>; Irwin <em>v. </em>Hanlin, 10 S. &amp; R. 219. One person being benefited by th.e payment of money by another is not sufficient to raise an assumpsit against the former. The <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>consent of the party therefore, either express or implied, is essentially necessary to support the action. Cowell could not legally delay the collection of the tax with a view to the expiration of the warrant, and the fact that he did so without the existence of any apparent necessity or compulsion, makes it clearly voluntary.</p>

It is in no sense a voluntary payment. The action is expressly authorized where his warrant has expired, and he has not been exonerated, by the 3d section of the Act of April 11th 1848, Pamph. L. 624. He may have very good reason for so doing, when he is properly satisfied of the responsibility of the taxpayer. Here the legality of the tax was contested, and if he had levied a distress, he might have been punished in damages to a much greater amount than the articles levied on would have produced at a forced sale. Whether he had a good reason for his course or not, the Act of Assembly gave him the right to pursue it, of which he cannot be deprived. There was no evidence to warrant the instruction prayed for in the defendant’s third point.</p>
