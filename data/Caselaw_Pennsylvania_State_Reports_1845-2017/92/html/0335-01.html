    <p class="summary" id="b335-12" data-blocks='[["BL_335.12",335,[133,1763,1165,604]]]'>The Shenango and Allegheny Railroad crosses the public highway leading from Mercer to Franklin, about two miles distant from Mercer. During the winter of 1877, the crossing at this point was out of repair. The plank on the inside of the rail had become worn or misplaced, so as to leave an open space four and five-eighth inches wide between it and the rail. This space rendered the crossing unsafe to travellers, as it was wide enough to admit a horse’s foot, and on account of its depth and shape, it so fastened the foot of the horse that stepped into it, as to render it difficult to extricate his foot without assistance. The crossing remained in this condition for several weeks prior to the day in February 1877, upon which the plaintiff sustained the injury complained of, during which time different travellers had encountered difficulty by their horses’ feet becoming fast in the crossing.</p>

When he approached this railroad crossing, he drove very slowly —bringing his horse almost to a halt. The railroad was visible for a long distance in both directions, but there was no train within sight or hearing. Just as the horse stepped upon the railroad, his foot become fast in the space between the rail and the plank, and in his efforts to withdraw it, he threw himself down upon the track. The plaintiff immediately alighted from the buggy and attempted to loosen his horse’s foot by working it back and forth with his hands. He labored in this manner for about two minutes, but with no success. The horse’s foot was fastened in such a way that he could not even arise. The plaintiff then told his wife, who had remained in the buggy, to alight and assist him. She alighted from the buggy and looked down the track where she saw the locomotive of a freight train just coming in sight. She then ran down the railroad waving her handkerchief and calling to the engineer to stop, while the plaintiff was still trying to get his horse’s foot loose. The train was a heavy one and moved slowly up grade and over the crossing, breaking the horse’s leg and otherwise injuring him, and demolishing the buggy and harness. This suit was brought by the plaintiff to recover damages for the loss of the horse, buggy and harness.</p>

All the plaintiff seeks to recover is damage for whatever injury he sustained by reason of his horse becoming fast in the crossing. The horse was thrown down, and his shoe pulled off before the engine struck him. This was some injury, and entitled the plaintiff to nominal damages, at least. His right of action was, therefore, complete before he was injured by the train, and it was wrong to nonsuit him. The defendant was liable for all damages which were the direct result of the defect in the crossing, and if such defect was the immediate cause of the injury the plaintiff sustained from the train, he was also entitled to recover. This was a question of fact under the evidence, and ought to have been submitted to the &gt;ry-</p>

    <p id="b337-11" data-blocks='[["BL_337.13",337,[138,2024,1161,300]]]'>The first assignment of error is not sustained. The evidence offered to show the value of the harness and buggy was properly rejected. The plaintiff had already testified that they belonged to W. H. Reed, who had loaned them to him. It was not error therefore for the learned judge to say, that Reed was the proper person to sue for the alleged injury to said articles. A recovery by the plaintiff would have been no bar to a suit by the owner.</p>

The court below nonsuited the' plaintiff upon the ground that he did not stop and look and listen before attempting to cross the <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>track. The rule invoked is a valuable one, and sustained by several well considered cases, among which may be mentioned, Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Heileman, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wright%2060" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Wright 60">13 Wright 60</a> ; Hanover Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Coyle, 5 P. F. Smith 396, and Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Beale, 23 Id. 504. We do not propose to depart from this principle nor to weaken its force. We are unable to see its applicability to this case, however. The injury, as developed by the plaintiff’s testimony, was not the result of a failure to observe the rule. Had he stopped, looked and listened, it is not probable he would have seen or heard the train, for the reason, that i,t was too far off to have been patent to any of the senses. The trouble, was, that the horse which plaintiff was driving, caught his foot in the space between the rail and the plank at the crossing, and fell down on the track. The plaintiff got out of the buggy and endeavored to get his horse upon its feet again. But this was not an easy task, as one of its feet was fast. After working unsuccessfully in this manner for about two minutes, he told his wife to get out of the buggy. She did so, and shortly thereafter heard the cars coming, upon which she ran up the road to meet them, signaling them at the same time to stop. The warning came too late, and the train passed over one leg of the horse, and damaged the harness and buggy to some extent. There was evidence that the track was out of order at the point where the accident occurred; that the flange way was too wide — one witness says four inches and five-eighths — and that other horses had been caught in the same way before. The true question in the case therefore was, whether the company were guilty of negligence in allowing the track at the crossing' to be in an insecure condition, and this question should have been submitted to the jury.</p>
