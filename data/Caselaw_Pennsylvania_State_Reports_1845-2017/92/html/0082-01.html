The coal cars are run into the coal yards upon switches and short tracks running out into the coal yards upon frame trestle-work, and the coal is unloaded by drops, in the bottom of the cars, which are unfastened and the coal dropped down through the trestle-work into the coal yard. There are between the points named two main tracks of the railroad; then alongside and east of these main tracts there is a side track, which side track is located, partly on the ground of the railroad and partly on the ground of the owners of the coal yard. This side track was put in by the railroad, but a part of the cost of the same was assessed upon the owner of each coal yard connected with it.</p>

These short tracks are upon the private property of the owners of the coal yards, and were constructed by themselves upon the trestle-work, as above stated. The owner of one of these coal yards is Morris McCue. He owns mines on the line of the railroad. His coal is loaded into cars of his own at the mines and then brought in by the defendant railroad company, on its road, by its locomotives and employees, to his coal yard in the city. When the train with the coal cars arrives it is changed, by a switch, from the main track to the side track, above mentioned; then it passes along the siding until near McOue’s siding, when that switch is also turned and the cars are run from the coal siding on McOue’s private track. The locomotive does not follow on this private track into the coal yard, but at this point it gives the cars a <em>shove </em>or a <em>shot </em>and drives them back on the coal switch by means of the force thus applied by means of the locomotive.</p>

Of the cars in this train six belonged to McCue and the balance to the National Coal <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>Company, and were to be delivered upon tbe sidings or tracks in these two coal yards.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b84-5" data-blocks='[["BL_84.4",84,[262,480,1156,515]]]'>The twelve coal cars were in front and pushed by the locomotive in the rear. The train switched off upon the side track, ran opposite to McCue’s yard, uncoupled the six cars of McCue, gave them a shove and sent them back upon McOue’s siding, in his coal yard, and then ran back towards Second avenue until clear of McOue’s siding, and stopped; then came ahead fast, intending to pass McCue’s coal yard and shove or shoot the other six cars upon the siding of the National Coal Company. When the locomotive and train drew back from McOue’s siding it was the duty of those in charge of the train to <em>change </em>the switch at McOue’s so as to direct and send the train, on its return, past McCue’s siding and upon the siding of the National Coal Company.</p>

He and his employer, McCue, had just mounted the next to the rear car for this purpose, when the collision took place. McCue sprang down upon the coal below, but the boy was caught between the fragments or parts of the car, and fell, with the debris, down upo.n the coal below; his leg was crushed and was amputated shortly after. This action was brought for the injury thus sustained, and the cause of action against the defendant was the alleged carelessness and negligence of the defendant’s employees in again running their train back into McCue’s coal yard with great force and violence, and with neglecting to <em>turn </em>the switch and thus guide and direct the train to its proper destination on the tracks of the National Coal Company.</p>

A very superficial examination of that case shows that it does not rule this one. Kirby, when injured, was on the cars of the railroad on the side track of the railroad, actually on the company’s ground. The coal railroad did not connect, but ran alongside above grade, and the coal was run down chutes from the cars of the coal company into the cars of the railroad. Kirby was loading coal into the railroad company’s cars. Cummings, the plaintiff, was on the cars of McCue. The cars were on the siding of McCue, and the siding was on his property at a time when all connection was or should have been cut off. The cars of the defendant and its employees had no authority to be there then more than merely to go past, and by their own negligence in not turning their switch, ran off their course, and into the private property of another.</p>

It is confined to those injured while employed in or about depots, or in or upon any car or train <em>therein </em>or <em>thereon. </em>That is upon a car or train of the railroad company on its railroad or in its depot. The boy was not employed in or about a railroad depot. He was simply unloading coal in the coal yard of a private citizen from a car that had passed all the perils of railroad and depots.</p>

To maintain such distinction is to fritter away the statute. If the party is injured while lawfully employed about a railroad company’s road or works, it matters not on whose car he may be, or whether on any car, he is within the express letter of the statute. That construction which makes the defendant’s liability depend upon a difference of a few feet in distance, is wholly inconsistent with the plain intent of the statute, which was to put all persons subject to risk from railway operation on the same footing, whether they were in the actual employ of the company causing the injury or not. Hence the language used: “ On or <em>about </em>the roads, works, depots and premises.”</p>
