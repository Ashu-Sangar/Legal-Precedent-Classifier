In a suit upon a mortgage given for purchase-money, the affidavit of defence alleged that in the deed of conveyance the plaintiff covenanted with defendant for the free use of a certain alley, and that defendant had never had the use of said-alley, and claimed to set-off damages for the loss of said use against the amount of the mortgage. Held, that as the affidavit did not allege that at the time of the conveyance the plaintiff had not a good title to the alley-way it was insufficient.</p>

As such, the vendee has surely the right to set it off. No more appropriate occasion offers, than - in the suit to foreclose the mortgage, given for the identical purchase-money. Equity will relieve from the effects of an act done, or contract made, under a mistake, or ignorance of a material fact. The mortgage sued on, was given to secure a part of the purchase-money of the property. After the deed is made and mortgage given, this defect is discovered ; and, when at last the mortgage is to be foreclosed, then properly does the defence of the loss of the alley privilege arise: Roland <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 390" data-case-ids="1854585" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0390-01">3 W. &amp; S. 390</a>; Jenks <em>v. </em>Fritz, 7 Id. 201.</p>

When a contract of sale has been executed by a deed, the vendee, in order to defend against a security for the purchase-money, must show a title positively bad. The representations made by the vendor at the time of the sale of her right to the alley-way, are clearly immaterial, unless they were false, and the mere fact of an obstruction then existing did not tend to prove them so.</p>
