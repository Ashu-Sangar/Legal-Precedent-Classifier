If the Christian names of the defendants are not entered on the judgment-docket, the judgment does not affect subsequent purchasers or judgment-creditors: 3 Harris 177. The entry of a wrong Christian name would be worse than its omission. The entire want of the name might invite inquiry, and lead to an examination, but when the record is complete in form, but wrong in fact, no suggestion of error is made. The creditor is not only thrown off his guard, but the only record which is evidence to him gives him assurance that it is perfect. Why should not he be protected? His only protection is to displace the former judgment erroneously entered.

It was there held that the omission of the middle letter of a name in the judgment-index was fatal to the lien. “It is certain,” say the court, “that an initial, standing with a name of baptism, is no part of it in pleading; but it follows not that an omission of it is to be disregarded as an index of notice to purchasers.” There can beAistinction between purchasers and subsequent judgment-creditors.
