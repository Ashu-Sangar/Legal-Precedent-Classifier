As a general rale, a mortgage of personal property, like a sale, is void as against creditors if a corresponding change of possession does not accompany the same. But where a removal of the property is impracticable, when all has been done that reasonably can be to mark the change of ownership and possession, the law is satisfied.</p>

A mortgage of personal property, in some respects, is like a pawn or pledge. Without delivery of possession to the mortgagee, it is a nullity as to creditors unless made under some statute; but if possession be given, the mortgagee may hold it till his debt is satisfied. At most, a creditor of the mortgagor can only sell it subject to the claim of the mortgagee, whose lien is not divested by the sale, and who is not entitled to share in the proceeds, and the purchaser at sheriff’s sale takes just the interest, if anything at all, which was left in the mortgagor.</p>

It is not the intendment of the Acts of September 23d 1783, March 28th 1820 and April 6th 1830, relating to mortgages, to include leaseholds in the words properly signifying freeholds. The Act of March 28th 1820 has no relation to mortgages of leaseholds, nor have any other acts which relate exclusively to mortgages of “real estate.”</p>

A mortgage of an estate for years may be recorded, any time within six months, where it does not come within the acts respecting collieries, mines and manufactories. If the mortgagee take and retain possession of the property it will be as free from liability to answer an execution against the mortgagor as would any other personal estate, and once free, because under his dominion, it would continue so. The mortgage is of such a nature that under no circumstances can it come into competition with the judgment for the proceeds of sale on the execution ; the claim is on a chattel, and notice to the purchaser supplies the place of recording.</p>

The fee-simple title in the lot is vested in Mrs. Mary E. Schenley, who leased the same to Dr. A. Weinmann, some twelve or fifteen years ago, for a term of years, which expired April 1st 1877. Weinmann erected the four dwellings at his own expense, and by the terms of the lease he had the right to remove the same <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>at the expiration of the lease. While Weinmann held this lease, he gave a mortgage thereon to the Bismark Building and Loan Association for money loaned. When this lease expired, a new one was granted to Weinmann for the term of twenty years from April 1st 1877, at the annual ground-r.ent of $69.75. Weinmann assigned this new lease to the Bismark Building and Loan Association on May 80th 1877, 41 as collateral for the payment of a debt.” The plaintiff in error claimed on the trial that this assignment was really intended as an absolute sale, but on this question the j ury found against it. This assignment was never recorded. From the time the houses were completed until after the sheriff’s sale, under which defendants in error claim title, the houses were occupied by tenants of Dr. Weinmann. On June 15th 1877, the Friendship Building and Loan Association of Allegheny City issued an execution on a judgment for $2605.68, which it had against Dr. Weinmann, entered at No. 581, January Term 1873, which execution was delivered to the sheriff of Allegheny county on the same day (June 15th 1877) by virtue of which the sheriff levied on the leasehold and dwelling in dispute, and sold the same to the defendants in error on July 23d 1877. The president of the Bismark Building and Loan Association of Allegheny City, plaintiff in error, John Born, and the secretary thereof, Anton Schmidt, were present at this sheriff’s sale, and gave notice that the association had a mortgage on the leasehold, and the secretary had a statement showing the amount which the association claimed, but they did not bid on the property. There were three prior executions in the sheriff’s hands in favor of two other associations against Dr. Weinmann, two of which were issued and delivered to the sheriff on June 8th 1877, for $754.15 and $708.75, respectively, and the third for over $1300, issued on June 12th Í877, and delivered to the sheriff on the same day, on which executions the same leasehold was levied upon, but before the sale rules to open these three judgments, and staying proceedings in the meantime, were obtained. Pending these rules, the sale was made on the execution of the Friendship Building and Loan Association. All the rules to open the judgments were afterwards discharged. Dr. Weinmann was a prominent stockholder in all the associations having executions against him, and his ownership of the property, and that the same was, and had been for years, in the occupation of his tenants, was well known to the said associations, and also to the defendants in error, the purchasers, all of whom lived in the immediate neighborhood of the property.</p>

When this prior lease expired, April 1st 1877, there was still due and unpaid o‘n this loan the sum of $8648, and at that time the property had become reduced in value, not being worth at most more than $2000. Dr. Weinmann had been unfortunate in business, had no money whatever and no means of raising any; indeed, was so reduced that he could not pay the ground-rent and taxes of this property then in arrears, which the Schenley estate required to. be done before it would again lease the property. On the 80th of May 1877, two months after the prior lease expired, it was agreed between the plaintiff in error and Dr. Weinmann that the plaintiff in error should pay the ground-rent and taxes then in arrears, and procure a lease of the property, to be made direct to it, the plaintiff in error, in discharge of the mortgage debt.</p>

The sheriff’s sale having been on a judgment prior in date, the <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>mortgage has no superior equity, and the purchasers can recover, unless the fact of possession in the mortgagees entitles them to hold the property till their debt shall be paid. If they were so entitled the defendants’ second point ought to have been affirmed, for there was sufficient evidence of possession, taken immediately under the -assignment, to warrant a finding of the fact. As a general rule, a mortgage of personal property, like a sale, is void as against creditors, if a corresponding change of possession does not accompany the same. But when a removal of the property is impracticable, when all has been done that reasonably can be to mark the change of ownership and possession, the law is satisfied. Here the property was occupied by tenants of Weinmann; and if the lease, at the time of its execution, was assigned and delivered to the mortgagees, with the knowledge of the lessor, and the lessee’s tenants were notified thereof, and that they should pay the rents accordingly, which they did, and the lessee, Weinmann, withdrew from the occupancy and control of the property, the transfer of possession was complete. Indeed, the learned judge of the Common Pleas deemed the evidence sufficient to submit, as shown by his instruction that if the defendants “took this property from Weinmann as absolute payment of what he owed them, and took possession of it,” the assignment would be good and they could hold it. He held, that if taken as collateral security — a mortgage —the plaintiffs could recover, even if the defendants had taken-possession.</p>
    <p id="b129-5" data-blocks='[["BL_129.4",129,[111,1486,1170,946]]]'>Mere possession of an estate for years is akin to that of an estate for life in fee. The term of a tenant is as immovable from a specific tract of land as is the freehold. Estates for years are often of greater value than life-estates, and not infrequently have been mortgaged. Anciently they were of little importance, and then those rules were established which still pervade our laws, marking the distinction between freeholds and estates less than freehold. A long term of years of very great value is not such an-interest in land as is subject to the lien of a judgment, it is a chattel, subject to seizure and sale by a constable on an execution issued by a justice of the peace. All kinds of property may be mortgaged to secure debts. A mortgage of personal property, in some respects, is like a pawn or pledge. Without delivery of possession to the mortgagee, it is a nullity as to creditors, unless made under some statute; but if possession be given, the mortgagee may hold it till his debt is satisfied. At most a creditor of the mortgagor can only sell it subject to the claim of the mortgagee, whose lien is not divested by the sale, and who is not entitled to share in the proceeds. The purchaser at a sheriff’s sale takes just the interest, if anything at all, which was left in the mortgagor. Whether the mortgage of a leasehold is within these familiar principles is the pivotal question in this cause.</p>

      <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>The Act of May 28th 1715, section 8, provides that, <em>“ No deed </em>or mortgage, or defeasible deed in the nature of mortgages, hereafter to be made, shall be good or sufficient to convey or pass any freehold or inheritance, or'to grant any estate therein for life or years, unless such deed be acknowledged or proved, and recorded within six months after the date thereof, where such lands lie, as hereinbefore directed for other deeds.” Section 9 of the same act provides for the entry of satisfaction by mortgagees “ of any real or personal estates.” It is observable that no personal estate is within that act save estates for years in lands. By Act of March 28th 1820, all mortgages for any lands, tenements or hereditaments, shall have priority according to the date of recording the same; “ and no mortgage or defeasible deed in the nature of a mortgage, shall be a lien until such mortgage or defeasible deed shall have been recorded or left for record as aforesaidexcept mortgages for purchase-money, which may be recorded within sixty days from their execution. The same terms — lands, tenements and hereditaments — omitting estates for years, were used in the Act of 1783, which provided for the validation of mortgages executed between January 1st 1776, and June 18th 1778. In the Act of 1830, and subsequent acts, providing, in case of judicial sale, for the preservation of the lien of a mortgage, when prior to all other liens on the same property, the subject of the mortgage is described as “real estate.” Section 8, of the Act of April 27th 1855, authorizes mortgages by the lessees of collieries, mines and manufactories ; and the Act of April 3d 1868, Pamph. L. 57, directs the remedy for collection in all cases of mortgages upon leasehold estates. The statutes relating to mortgages reveal, at a glance, that it is not their intendment to include leaseholds in the words properly signifying freeholds. A principal purpose of the Acts of 1783, of 1820 and of 1830, was to define liens of mortgages, their commencement, their preservation; and estates for years were omitted, for no judgment is a lien upon them. Had the various acts all used the words, “lands, tenements and hereditaments,” which technically do not embrace estates less than freehold, in stating the subjects of mortgages, then, for reasons given by Chancellor Kent in Johnson <em>v. </em>Stagg, <a href="/johns/2/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="2 Johns. 510" data-case-ids="6776179" data-case-paths="/johns/2/0509-01">2 Johns. 510</a>, <em>we </em>might adopt his conclusion that leaseholds are within their meaning. But the legislature having employed apt words for the different classes of estates, it would be a misinterpretation to confound one with the other. Therefore, the Act of 1820 has no relation to mortgages of leaseholds; nor have any other acts which relate exclusively to mortgages of <em>“ </em>real estate.”</p>
    <p id="b130-6" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[280,2248,1153,176]],["BL_131.1",131,[115,418,1169,1077]]]'>Unrecorded mortgages are good between the parties, and against a purchaser with notice, as settled by numerous decisions. It is manifest, that the Act of 1820 was passed for security of liens by judgment: there was no such reason respecting chattels, and they <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>were left under the terms of the Act of 1715. Consequently, it is unnecessary, for any purpose, to record a mortgage for an estate for yeai-s immediately; it may be done within six months, when it does not come within the Acts respecting collieries, mines and manufactories. If the mortgagee take and retain possession of the property, it will be as free from liability to answer an execution against the mortgagor, as would any other personal estate; and once free, because under his dominion, it would continue so. If levied on and sold, the claim of the mortgagee would be no more divested, than if the property were a horse and sold subject to the mortgage. The mortgage is of such a nature, that under no circumstances can it come into competition with the judgment for the proceeds of sale on the execution — the claim is on a chattel, and notice to the purchaser supplies the place of recording. An adverse claimant of a chattel, sold on execution against another, cannot take the money made, from the execution-creditor — his remedy is by action for recovery of the property or damages. It is so clear, that a mortgage of personalty must be accompanied by possession, to make it valid against an execution in favor of a creditor of the mortgagor, and that a sale on such execution is subject to the mortgage^ that it is perhaps, not singular that no case has been cited similar to this. Luckenback <em>v. </em>Brickenstein, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 145" data-case-ids="478804" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0145-01">5 W. &amp; S. 145</a>, is not in point, though it seems to have been understood, by court and counsel, that possession of a mortgaged leasehold was an essential as against creditors, and, that existing, it was good.</p>

When recorded within six months, possession not changed, of the effect of a sale on execution, before the date of record, we say nothing. Whether a mortgage of a leasehold, duly recorded, not accompanied by possession, is good against execution-creditors, is not a question in this cause. Possibly such mortgage is valid under the Act of 1715, the record standing for possession.</p>
