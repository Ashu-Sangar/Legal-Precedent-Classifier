On December 2d 1874, the bank closed its doors, owing its depositors over $39,000, and shoitly afterwards it made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors to the Hon. D. Newlin Fell. At the date of the assignment, George DeB. Keim ' was the vice-president, and Crawford Miller one of the directors of the bank, and both of them were stockholders. By the twelfth section of the charter of incorporation, it is provided, “ That the stockholders shall be personally liable to an amount equal to the capital stock in addition thereto.” Soon after the assignment a fund was created by contributions from a large number of the stockholders, for the purpose of purchasing the claims of the depositors against the bank. With this fund claims of the depositors to the amount of $24,182.65, were purchased by Keim and Miller, at a discount of fifty per cent., and they took assignments of the claims so purchased. October 25th 1875, the said assignee filed his account, which was referred to an auditor to adjust and settle the same, and to state a distribution of the funds. Before the auditor, Keim and Miller presented the claims so assigned to them, and contended that they were entitled to a pro rata distribution with the depositors, upon the face value of the said claims. The depositors objected to them participating in the distribution of the fund until the depositors had been paid in full, for the following reasons: 1. If the said Keim and Miller presented the said claims in their own right, they were not- entitled to any portion of the fund, because at the time of their purchase of the claims they were officers of the bank. 2. If they presented the claims as agents of the stockholders, they could not participate in the distribution until all of the depositors had been paid, because, by the charter of the bank, the stockholders accepted the position of sureties to the depositors.</p>

    <p id="b399-10" data-blocks='[["BL_399.10",399,[114,1514,1168,729]]]'>The case of Hill <em>v. </em>Frazier, 10 Harris 320, was very different from the case in hand. Not only when the claims were bought, but also at the time of the bringing of the suit and at its trial, Eldred, the equitable plaintiff, was the treasurer of the company, and it was we'll said that, as he was the confidential agent and trustee of the company, he could not create other relations which would put him in an attitude of hostility to his principal or <em>cestui que trust. </em>But had that relation been dissolved, either by operation of law or the act of the parties before the purchase of the claim, this rule would not have applied, since the reason for it would rhen have had no existence. Just so in the case in hand; by the act of the bank and the operation of law, the trust relation of the appellees had ceased to exist when the claims in controversy were purchased, and their relation to the corporation was that of stockholders and nothing else. Such being the case, they were as free to buy up outstanding claims against the corporation as any outside parties.</p>

If, indeed, the assumption of their suretyship were correct, this would be true. But they are not sureties ; their liability is special and <em>sub modo </em>only. It is limited to an amount equal to their subscriptions, and it accrues only when the assets of the bank have been exhausted, neither can it be enforced except by a judicial decree first had and obtained : Means’s Appeal, 4 Norris 75. The effort here, however, is to compel contribution from the appellees before such decree, and hence, before there is any legal liability. This cannot be done.</p>

We answer either by process analogous to that prescribed for the benefit of note-holders in the 32d and 33d sections of the Banking Act of 1850, or by a bill in equity; but however this may be, one thing is certain, that is, that an auditor has no such power. It is not his business to estimate the value of the property of the bank and apportion the deficit among stockholders; that power is by law committed to the assignee. If, however, the claims of these appellees may be pushed aside by other creditors, it is, in effect, imposing upon them an advance contribution which may far exceed that which the statute would compel them to pay. This, however, would be neither lawful nor just, and the court below did right in refusing its sanction to an attempt of this kind.</p>
