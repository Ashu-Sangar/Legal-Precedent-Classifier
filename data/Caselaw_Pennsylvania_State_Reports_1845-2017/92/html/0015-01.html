The policy contained, inter alia, the following condition : “ Or if the assured shall keep or have in any place on the insured premises, where this policy may apply, petroleum, naphtha, benzine, benzole, gasoline, benzine-varnish, or the product in whole, or in part of either; or gunpowder, fireworks, nitro-glycerine, phosphorus, saltpetre, nitrate of soda; or keep, have, or use, camphene, spirit-gas, or any burning fluid, or chemical oils, without permission in this policy, then, and in every such case, this policy shall be void.”</p>

A tough and gummy substance had accumulated on the cogs, journals, &amp;c., of the metal gearing, and the inside of the boilers had become heavily coated with rust. In removing these accumulations the assured had on previous occasions used benzine and carbon oil as solvents. Eor the purpose of cleaning in the same way, he purchased some eight or ten gallons of benzine, and a small quantity of carbon oil, and stored them in his bonded warehouse, situated some forty or fifty yards distant from the insured premises, and employed William Jacobs to do the work. Jacobs carried the benzine from the warehouse to the distillery in a small tin can, and used it to soften the gummy substances above mentioned, which had accumulated on the gearing of the machinery, and when thus softened he scraped it oif with a case-knife, and carefully removed it from the insured premises. He used the benzine and a little carbon oil in like manner to remove the rust from the inside of the boilers. About ten days were consumed in completing the work. Some weeks after the machinery was thus cleaned and put in good order, a fire occurred on the 30th of September 1874, which resulted in a total destruction of the property. It did not originate from the benzine used in cleaning, nor occur while the work was in progress.</p>

It only forbids the assured to keep or have it there. The words keep and have are employed in the disjunctive. They are synonymous terms in the connection used in this instance. They signify, to hold, to retain one’s possession or power. They were evidently intended to prevent the assured from the permanent and habitual holding and retaining the forbidden article in his possession, on the property insured, as a place of storage, and were not intended to prohibit him from having it there in such quantity as might be necessary to clean the machinery and keep it in good order. The contract does not forbid its use on the machinery or other parts of the property insured. In the absence of a stipulation against this, the assured had the undoubted right to use it for this or any other purpose. He could not exercise this right without the presence of the article. To keep or have it there ivas a necessary incident to the right to use it. Its presence for this purpose was not keeping or having it on the insured premises, within the meaning of the condition of the policy.</p>

It was contended that the court erred in instructing the jury in answmr to the defendant’s second point, that if Mears, the assured, purchased from eight to ten gallons of benzine, and used nearly the whole of it in cleaning the engine, boilers and machinery of the distillery, and such use extended over a period of about two weeks, there was a violation of one of the conditions of the policy in suit and avoids the same.</p>

    <p id="b19-6" data-blocks='[["BL_19.5",19,[151,838,1161,595]]]'>The words “keep or have,” as applied to the articles first enumerated, evidently were intended to prevent a storage of the prohibited articles upon the premises, either permanently or habitually. While the words are used in the disjunctive, they are evidently synonymous, and signify to retain in possession. It would be straining a point to say that bringing a prohibited article upon the premises upon a single occasion, and for the sole purpose of cleaning machinery, was keeping or having it there within the meaning of the policy. The evidence shows, and it is not denied, that the can of benzine used for the purpose above stated was not kept on the insured premises during the period of its use, but was stored in a bonded warehouse, fifty or sixty feet distant. The witness, William Jacobs, who cleaned the machinery, got it from the warehouse from time to time as he needed it.</p>
    <p id="b19-7" data-blocks='[["BL_19.6",19,[150,1442,1163,773]]]'>The assured did not keep or have benzine upon the insured premises within any reasonable view of the meaning of the. policy. But it is said he used it there, and that this avoids the policy. The <em>use </em>of benzine is not prohibited in terms. If prohibited at all it must be because benzine comes.within the description of burning fluid or chemical oils. We must ascertain the meaning of these general words, used in the latter portion of the condition of the policy, by referring to the preceding special words. Under this construction the words burning fluids or chemical oils must be held to mean only such burning fluids and chemical oils as are in their nature like camphene or spirit gas. This was the construction placed upon the identical words in Wheeler <em>v. </em>The American Central Insurance Company, decided by the St. Louis Court of Appeals, in March 1879, and reported in the Western Insurance Review, vol. 12, p. 252. The same rule is laid down in Wood <em>v. </em>The Northwestern Ins. Co., <a href="/ny/46/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="46 N.Y. 421" data-case-ids="2052613" data-case-paths="/ny/46/0421-01">46 N.

It must have a reasonable interpretation, such as was probably contemplated by the parties at the time the contract was entered into. Nearly every policy of insurance issued at the present time contains this condition, or a similar one. What is intended to be prohibited is the habitual use of such articles, not their exceptional use upon some emergency. The strict rule claimed by the defendants would prevent the assured from painting his house or cleaning his furniture, as it would be difficult to do either without using some of the prohibited articles. If the company intended the condition to cover such exceptional uses, it ought to have been plainly expressed, and probably would have been. That any one would knowingly accept a policy with such a clause is not probable. We are not without abundant authority upon this point.
