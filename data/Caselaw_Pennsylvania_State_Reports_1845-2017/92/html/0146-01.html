A less certain and formal mode of allegation is properly allowed in these claims than is tolerated in declarations, or by the rules of the common law. It is much more convenient and conducive to precision and dispatch to have the defect insisted upon alleged concisely in the language of pleading and tried as a fact, by the production of the claim as the existence or legal import of a record is established. This course is justified by the practice of Allegheny county. We have set forth the defect formally and at length by a plea concluding to the court. See Lewis v. Morgan, 11 S. &amp; R. 234; St. Clair Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Martz, 25 P. F. Smith 384; Howell <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20471" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Wright 471">2 Wright 471</a>; Richabauch <em>v. </em>Dugan, 7 Barr 394. The truth is that no forms have been prescribed, and form has consequently been disregarded. Phillips, M. L., sec. 417. Formal objections at the trial are discountenanced on the ground of suz-prise, and also, perhaps to allow the claimant an opportunity to amend, though since Dearie <em>v. </em>Martin, 28 P. F. Smith 55, there is very little in the last z-eason. However, this may be, we were not in default. The exception was taken in our affidavit of defence the first moment of our appearance in court. In the present unsettled state of the practice, we submit that our plea should be treated as a demurrer. There is no <em>substantial </em>difference.</p>
