It was for $125, and dated December 17th 1873. Sarah Tingle died in 1874. The scire facias to revive was returnable on the first Monday of February 1875. The defendants obtained a rule to set aside the scire facias, open the judgment and let them into a defence. This rule was discharged, and the court gave defendants five days within which to file affidavits of defence. Sarah Lewis and one of the executors filed affidavits of defence, alleging the coverture and minority of Sarah Lewis, and that the whole of the judgment had been paid by usurious interest. These affidavits the court thought were insufficient, and entered judgment for plaintiff. The defend^ ants took a writ of error, and the court reversed the court below, on the ground, that the judgment was improperly entered against the executors, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. The plaintiff then took a remittitur and ruled defendants to plead. The executors pleaded <em>non est factum, </em>coverture and payment, and Sarah Lewis <em>non est factum, </em>coverture, payment and infancy. The plaintiff replied coverture, <em>non solvit </em>and of age, and thereupon issue was joined.</p>

Not showing coverture on the record, is not proof that these women were sole. Under the pleadings, the offer was material and relevant. The judgment was only evidence of what it established, a debt between the parties. The only question for the court was, whether the evidence supported the issue: Thompson <em>v. </em>Barkley, 3 Casey 263. But granting that the pleas were bad, they were waived by the replications : Rankin <em>v. </em>Duncan, 5 Esp. 38. The jury here found the fact that the defendants were sole, and decided that issue without evidence. The special plea, alleging coverture of the plaintiff, should have been allowed.</p>

    <p id="b501-6" data-blocks='[["BL_501.6",501,[167,509,1159,386]]]'>It may be conceded as a general rule, that in case of a scire facias to revive a judgment, no defence can be made except matters arising subsequent to the judgment. The merits of the original judgment cannot be inquired into so as to admit a defence which might have been set up in the original suit: Cardesa <em>v. </em>Humes, 5 S. &amp; R. 65; Davidson <em>v. </em>Thornton, 7 Barr 128 ; Pitts., Cin. &amp; St. Louis Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Marshall, 4 Norris 187.

    <p id="b501-7" data-blocks='[["BL_501.7",501,[170,896,1160,815]]]'>The original judgment in this case was entered on a judgment note. It is claimed that when the note was executed, both the makers thereof were married women, and the judgment therefore void. Instead of an application to open the original judgment, the coverture of each of the makers of the note was severally pleaded and denied in the replication. The defendant in error did not demur to the sufficiency of this plea nor move to strike it off, but accepted the issue tendered. The question of coverture' was thus made one of the issues to be tried. It was substantially the same as if it had been framed in the original judgment. The defendant in error thereby waived her right to exclude the evidence of coverture. Under the pleadings it was admissible, and if found to exist at the execution of the note, that issue should have been found in favor of the plaintiffs in error. The first and second assignments are sustained. The language covered by the third assignment, although correct as a general proposition, was not applicable to the issue being tried. The fourth assignment is not sustained. The name of the husband might well have been added to the record, but he had no right of action in himself alone.</p>
