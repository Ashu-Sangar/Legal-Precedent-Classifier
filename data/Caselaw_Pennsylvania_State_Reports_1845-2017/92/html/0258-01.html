The levy was made on 3d October 1877, by a deputy-sheriff, who immediately thereafter informed the plaintiff that the defendant, before the levy was made, had advertised a public vendue of the property. The plaintiff and defendant then had an interview, and the result of their conference, was the conclusion that the property would sell to better advantage at the proposed vendue, than at sheriff’s sale. Miller at once notified the sheriff that under the circumstances he deemed it best to permit Shanor himself to sell the property (he, Shanor having agreed to apply the proceeds to his claim), and directed him not to advertise a sale. In consequence of this direction, the sheriff (having no other claims against Shanor in his hands), took no further action, “for the reason that he thought he had nothing more to do with the writ but receive the costs.”</p>

There was, therefore, no final and peremptory stay of the writ. It follows, that the sheriff having seized the defendant's goods, and afterwards allowed him to sell them and appropriate the proceeds as he saw fit, must be held, in law and equity, accountable to the landlady, as though he had himself sold the property levied, and realized therefrom a sum sufficient to satisfy her claim.”</p>

The directions of the plaintiff in the execution not to advertise a sale was a stay of the writ as to other execution-creditors: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Stremback, <a href="/rawle/3/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Rawle 341" data-case-ids="1822509" data-case-paths="/rawle/3/0341-01">3 Rawle 341</a>; Corlies <em>v. </em>Stanbridge, 5 Id. 286; Freeburger’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20247" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Wright 247">4 Wright 247</a>; Pary &amp; Co.’s Appeal, 5 <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20247" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 Wright 247">Id. 273</a>; Keyser’s Appeal, 1 Harris 409; Stern’s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 447. And the appellee could have issued a landlord’s warrant, and made a distress upon the property. If the levy still remained good as against the defendant it will not help the appellee, as she gave the sheriff no notice of her claim for rent until after the property was sold and beyond the reach of the sheriff. Had she given such notice before the sale it might have been the duty of the sheriff to have resumed the possession of the property under the execution, as the 85th section of the Act of 16th June 1836, provides that where any goods or chattels liable to the payment of rent are seized upon an execution, such writ shall not be stayed by the plaintiff therein without the consent in writing of the person entitled to such rent. Under the statute of 8 Anne, ch. 14, it was made the imperative duty of the sheriff to pay the landlord <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>one year’s rent, if the same was due, before he removed the goods from the demised premises. But in Pennsylvania, as was said in Ege <em>v. </em>Ege, <a href="/watts/5/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 Watts 134" data-case-ids="1844070" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0134-01">5 Watts 134</a>, under our statute, the sheriff is not estopped from removing the goods, and he is protected provided he pays over to the landlord one year’s rent, or the landlord neglects to give notice of his claim in proper time. It was said by Ro&amp;ers, J., in the case last cited: “It would jeopard the rights of the landlord to fix any other period than the sale as the limit of his right to give notice. In practice it is usual to sell goods taken in execution after the return-day of the writ. The sheriff is directed by the act to pay over after the sale, one year’s rent to the land-' lord; it would therefore seem that all the purposes of the act are answered if notice is given at any time before the money is paid over.” The sheriff here, as before observed, had no money in his hands or under his control when the notice was given. In the absence of a claim for rent he could not do otherwise than suspend proceedings upon the execution when ordered to do so by the plaintiff. There was no allegation that the action of the sheriff was the result of collusion, and a part of a scheme between the parties to the execution to defraud the appellee out of her rights as landlord. He appears to have acted in entire good faith, and ought not to be punished now to make good the <em>laches </em>of the appellee.</p>
