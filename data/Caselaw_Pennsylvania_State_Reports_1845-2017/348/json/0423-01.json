The learned trial judge denied the motion on the ground that defendants could not prove parol cancellation, rescission or modification of the written instrument. This ruling was approved by the court en banc, and defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial denied.. After the entry of judgment for plaintiff, the defendants took this appeal.\nThe learned court was in error. The parol evidence rule was in no way involved. The case is ruled by Mazer v. Kann, 343 Pa. 376, 379, 22 A. 2d 707, where we said: \u201cIt does not matter that the new agreement was proved by parol. \u2018It is always competent for the parties to a written contract to show that it was subsequently abandoned in whole or in part, modified, changed, or a new one substituted. And this may be shown by parol by showing either an express agreement or actions necessarily involving the alterations\u2019: Achenbach v. Stoddard, 253 Pa. 338, 343.\u201d See also Magazine Digest Publishing Co. v. Shade, 330 Pa. 487, 492, 199 A. 190.\nJudgment reversed and new trial ordered.",
