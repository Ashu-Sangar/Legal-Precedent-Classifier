The court below granted the prayer of the bill upon findings of fact and conclusions of law that the transaction had been induced by undue influence and false representations of the daughter. We are unanimously agreed that if this case were one in which the burden of proof rested upon plaintiff to establish by affirmative evidence the existence of coercion or fraud, or if the record showed that plaintiff had, of his own free will and with full understanding, created this joint account with the incident of survivorship, the evidence would not be sufficiently clear and precise to support the decree. In the <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>opinion of the majority of this court, however, the evidence is sufficient to show that the transaction was entered into by the father under a mistake of fact and was also sufficient to cast upon the daughter the burden of proving that the gift was the free and voluntary act of the father, which burden she has failed to sustain.</p>

Tests made by the hearing judge in the courtroom established that, “his hearing is so bad that it is difficult to make him understand what is being said”; and by the admission of the defendant, this deafness has existed for thirty years. For thirty-four years plaintiff and his wife kept the greater part of their savings in a joint bank account with survivorship at the Fourteenth Street Bank in Pittsburgh. At the time of the transaction here involved, the amount on deposit was $11,951.11. Apparently most of the banking was attended to by plaintiff’s wife because the bank officials testified that they remembered her but did not know the plaintiff by sight.</p>

In addition to her husband, she was survived by a daughter, the defendant, a son and six grandchildren, children of a deceased son. Plaintiff and his wife had lived alone. Defendant, a married woman, resided with her family about a mile and a half from her father’s home. Upon the death of his wife, plaintiff requested his daughter to come to his home and remain until after the funeral, which was held on Saturday, September 13, 1941. Defendant testified that she stayed overnight, and on Sunday afternoon, after family visitors had left, her father asked her to accompany him on the following morning to an attorney’s office, “to take the Avill [his wife’s] in” and “to see about his bank book.” She testified that this Avas the only conversation that took place between the father and daughter before they Avent to the laAvyer’s <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>office and the bank on Monday morning.

It is to be noted that nowhere in plaintiff’s testimony or in defendant’s testimony does it appear that plaintiff indicated prior to the transaction that the change was to be effected by substituting the name of the daughter for the mother. His testimony was merely that he went to change the account <em>from his wife’s name. </em>What transpired at the bank requires careful consideration. Of one thing there is no dispute; the account, then the exclusive property of plaintiff, was closed and a neAv account Avas created of Avhich plaintiff and defendant Avere joint owners with the right of survivorship. It is conceded that both plaintiff and defendant signed the card or application for the account in <em>its </em>present form. The daughter testified that when she and her father entered the bank, he stated to the bank officials that he “wanted to put my [defendant’s] name on that book the same as Mom’s, meaning my mother.” This testimony Avas partially corroborated by a bookkeeper, who said that plaintiff asked that defendant’s name be “added to the account.” Defendant asserted that this was done without any prompting upon her part. The president of the bank, who Avas called by the bookkeeper to assist in the transaction, admitted that he retained no recollection whatever concerning it, but said that because his name was affixed as a Avitness to the card, he felt certain that he had fully explained the transaction to plaintiff, as he had been accustomed to doing in similar transactions. He did say, however, significantly: “I imagine Mrs. Hanlon [the defendant] did the more talking because he [plaintiff] seems not to catch on quickly, and I thought he might not hear quite properly.” Both bank officials testified that they Avere not <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>then aware that plaintiff was extremely deaf or that he conld not read. The card containing the terms of the deposit was not read to him. The bookkeeper testified that the nature and effect of the transfer were explained to plaintiff. However, both he and the president admitted that they had not raised their voices above a normal conversational tone because they did not realize the extent of plaintiff’s impairment of hearing. Both “assumed” that plaintiff fully understood the transaction because he signed the card and “seemed agreeable.” There is no evidence that plaintiff said anything to indicate that he understood the transaction. Defendant herself said, regarding the statements of the bank officers to her father, “I don’t know what they talked about. I didn’t pay any attention.”</p>

He said that he knew he had such an arrangement in the joint account with his wife. As he said, however, “. . . me and Mom was always on, but <em>that was a horse of a different color, that was our own.” </em>The mutuality of the financial arrangements between plaintiff and his wife was consistent not only with their marital relationship, but with the fact that the land upon which plaintiff erected the farmhouse had been bought by her. He said, “She owned the ground. She bought it and we worked between us, me and Mom, we worked for fifty-five years.” Speaking of the account itself, he testified: “We worked for that together, me and Mom both for the last fifty-five years.” Plaintiff testified that he did not want originally to put his daughter’s name on the account but that “she preached my head full till I didn’t know what I was doing” and that he finally agreed to let her do so “after she had me so, I didn’t know what I was doing, and I <em>didn’t realize at the time, I didn’t realize at the time.” </em>He <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>denied that he knew defendant was to have the right of survivorship or that he so understood the transaction.

This withdrawal was made for the purpose of defraying the funeral expenses for plaintiff’s wife. Some time thereafter he discovered the terms of the deposit and went to the defendant to request that her name be removed from the account. The defendant’s reply was significant. She made no assertion that her father had made a gift to her or that she was entitled by past services, or particular affection, to the funds. Indeed, there is no evidence whatever that this daughter was her father’s favorite, or that she had rendered any considerable services to her parents. Her answer to her father was “Well, Pap, you put it [her name] there, and it is up to you to take it off . . .” Her attitude was also apparent in her testimony at the trial, “Q. Why wouldn’t you take it off? A. Well, because he put it on. Why should I go to that expense? Q. Expense, there is no expense. A. Why should I <em>bother </em>about it? He did it himself, not me. Q. Well are you willing to take it off? A. Well I feel this way. I should have my equal share the same as the rest of the children now because he has been influenced . . .” Such testimony is hardly consistent with the argument that she permitted her name to be added to the account out of solicitude for her aged father. The protection of a joint account could have been afforded him, of course, without a provision that this, the bulk of his estate, should pass absolutely to his daughter upon his death to the exclusion of his other heirs. According to the widow of the deceased son of plaintiff, defendant volunteered to her the information that she had caused the transfer to be made in order to prevent her brother, George, from receiving any of the money and to “protect” the wit<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>ness’s sons, although the manner of that protection was not explained. Defendant did not deny this testimony.</p>

Nothing further remained to be done to complete the transfer, and therefore the <em>primary </em>burden of establishing its invalidity rested with plaintiff. In <em>Weber v. Kline, </em><a href="/pa/293/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="293 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1111189" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0085-01">293 Pa. 85</a>, former Chief Justice Kephart said: “The chief grounds on which gifts or bequests are most frequently attacked are lack of capacity and undue influence. Generally speaking, the burden of showing both incapacity and undue influence rests on those asserting the facts. <em>But this rule does not apply where the relation of the parties to each other, or some vicious element in connection with the transaction, is such that the law compels the recipient of the bequest or gift to show that it was the free, voluntary and intelligent act of the person giving it. </em>Though there may be capacity to give, the law, nevertheless, casts this burden on the recipient. The factors which bring this rule into action are fraud, <em>confidential relation, </em>weakness of mind not otherwise incapable, and gross deception. <em>When these appear in the course of an investigation as to the validity of gifts, the burden of proof will immediately shift.”</em>

It is also clear that upon the facts of this case, plaintiff’s testimony was sufficient to cast the burden of proof upon his daughter to show that the gift was made of his own free will and with his full understanding. The record shows that plaintiff was aged and infirm, that his hearing was seriously impaired, that he was without schooling and illiterate. The transaction occurred within five days after the death of his companion for fifty-five years and within two days of her funeral. He testified that he did not intend to make this gift to defendant and that he was prevailed upon by her to do so through her repeated importunities. He testified (and it is conceded) that the card which he signed was not read to him, and he says that he did not understand what took place at the bank, and that he did not know that by the transfer she obtained the right of survivorship.

It is true that plaintiff’s testimony was uncorroborated, but there can be no doubt that it was competent and sufficient.

It is to be noted that this was in no sense a contract entered into between father and daughter. It was a gift by the father to the daughter, evidenced by a contract of deposit with the bank. The bank is not a party to these proceedings. Plaintiff has testified that he was unable to read the card, and defendant’s witnesses have admitted that it was not read to him. Even assuming that plaintiff could have understood the incident of survivorship, which is by no means certain in view of his advanced age and illiteracy, there is no evidence whatever to refute his testimony that he did not know the card contained a provision for survivorship. Obviously all joint accounts do not contain such a provision, and there is no reason to suppose that the addition of defendant’s name to his upon the new card should have conveyed to him the knowledge that he was thus disposing of the greater part of his estate. It is an elementary principle of law that a clear and unmistakable intention on the part of the donor to make a gift of his property is an essential requisite of a gift inter vivos: <em>App. of Waynesburg College, </em><a href="/pa/111/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="111 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="545446" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0130-01">111 Pa. 130</a>; <em>Walsh’s App., <a href="/pa/122/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="122 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1948389" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0177-01">122 </a></em><a href="/pa/122/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="122 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1948389" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0177-01">Pa. 177</a>; <em>Flanagan v.

This fundamental principle has been widely accepted in other jurisdictions: 28 C. J. 627. Here the only evidence of plaintiff’s intention to make the gift was his signature upon the card. This evidence is of little value in view of plaintiff’s admitted inability to read and in view of the evidence indicating that the card was not read-to him and that he did not understand its nature. The testimony of the bank officials, based upon assumptions, does not show that they were able to make them<a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>selves understood by him, but does show that they were unaware of his illiteracy and impairment of hearing. While it is true that the burden of proof is upon one who attempts to establish a mistake of fact as the grounds for setting aside an executed transaction, we are of the opinion that plaintiff’s testimony clearly shows that he never intended to make a gift to defendant of the fund upon his death. Upon this ground also the decree of the court below could be affirmed, but, as we have pointed out above, the circumstances of the case were such that the burden was upon defendant to establish the validity of the gift rather than upon plaintiff to show its invalidity.</p>

This Court speaking through Mr. Justice Linn so held in a similar case in <em>Mader et al. v.

On page 379 we referred to it as “a writing signed by the parties, completely expressing the intention to vest by assignment a present joint interest in the chose in action with the right of survivorship”. In that case an attempt was made to change the prima facie import of the contract by impressing a parole trust upon it, but we held that “the evidence is insufficient to support such a contract. The measure of proof required to show a trust of that character must be ‘clear, precise and unequivocal’. In this case the evidence does not meet that measure.” That case clearly rules this case.</p>

Lochinger knew exactly what having such a joint interest in a bank account meant, as to the right to withdraw from such an account and the right of survivorship in such an account.

Not only is this <em>basie assumption erroneous, but propositions 1 and 2 </em>are <em>also erroneous. </em>The assumption is erroneous for there certainly is a <em>written contract </em>in this case. The plaintiff’s evidence to nullify it on the ground of “coercion, intimidation and undue influence” (i. e., “fraud”) completely fails to measure up to the standard of proof always hitherto required by this Court in such cases. The majority opinion says: <em>“It is true that plaintiff’s testimony was uncorroborated.” </em>(Italics supplied.)

This plaintiff had only two surAiving children, a son and a daughter, and it is on <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>record that the mother left the son $4,000. She left the daughter the family farm, subject to this $4,000 legacy to the son. For this defendant to profit by this joint account she will have to survive her father, a thing she is likely to do, but there is no certainty that she will not precede her father in death as Henry Ford’s only son recently preceded his 81 year old father in death. There is nothing suspicious or unusual in an aged father having his bank account, after his wife’s death, placed in the names of himself and a child jointly. This was a natural thing to do here, for the account had been a joint one for 37 years. After a man loses his wife by death, an adult daughter often takes her mother’s place as her father’s counsellor, and frequently to his great benefit.</p>

Here the plaintiff is 77 years of age and it appears all through his testimony that he was neither “weak” nor “incompetent”. In the <em>McConville </em>case this court found that “at no time did defendant say the money was a gift to her, or deny her alleged promises to return it . . . She did not keep her promises, and hence plaintiff filed the present bill in equity.” In the instant case the testimony of the defendant, the plaintiff, and the bank officers clearly indicates that this father <em>intended </em>his daughter should hold the joint account with him and should take her deceased mother’s place in the joint account. Lochinger himself said so by his answer “yes” to the question his own lawyer put to him and which is quoted above. No one accuses the daughter in <em>this </em>case of breaking <em>any </em>promises. In the <em>McConville </em>case the 92 year old woman was at the time of the transaction “crying, which evidenced her mental distress”. Here the bank officers saw no indication that this father was in any kind of mental distress or that he was acting otherwise than on his own free will. In the McConville■ case we said: “There is no proof of the alleged gift except defendant’s unsupported declaration, which is discredited by the contradictions appearing in her testimony.” In the instant case the “proof of the alleged gift” is found in plaintiff’s admitted signature on the deposit agreement, i. e., <em>the contract, </em>and the only “contradictions” found in the record are in the plaintiff’s own testimony.</p>

For example, in <em>Appeal of Waynesburg College, </em><a href="/pa/111/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="111 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="545446" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0130-01">111 Pa. 130</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.%2019" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="3 A. 19">3 A. 19</a>, where an attempt was made to establish a gift inter vivos and a trust by making and delivering to the payee therein named a check for safe keeping as trustee for another, we said it could not be so established.

In <em>that </em>case there was involved only the interpretation of a somewhat dubious agreement. <em>Here </em>the agreement is explicit that “the survivor shall be the absolute owner of the balance”.

There we held that where an elderly woman went to a bank vault, took out her securities and in the presence of a bank officer executed transfers to her nephew, a valid gift of the securities to her nephew <em>was made, </em>even though the donor retained access to the box where the securities were kept. The court said: “Can there be any question as to the legal effect of this transaction?” It answered this question “No” by its decree directing the bank to transfer the securities <em>to the nephew. </em>In <em>Ashman’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/223/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="223 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="961004" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0543-01">223 Pa. 543</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.%20899" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="72 A. 899">72 A. 899</a>, we simply held that ■ where a father declared in writing that he gives certain bonds to his son but also provides in writing that the bonds are not to be used until after his own death and the father subsequently makes a will revoking all previous wills, the son was not entitled to the bonds.
