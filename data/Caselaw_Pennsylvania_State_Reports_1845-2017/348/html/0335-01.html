In the letter and minutes his employment was extended from time to time, and on April 28, 1936, it was extended “for an indefinite period so that it may he terminated at intervals of six months on the 30th day of June and the 31st day of December in each year, in Avhich case Dr. David shall receive contractual <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>dismissal pay in the sum of a year’s salary,” which in 1938 w;as 86,160 schillings.

    <p id="b391-4" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[151,978,1151,642]]]'>The plaintiff pleaded that three Austrian schillings have the value of two Reichsmarks and a Reichsmark is stated to be of the value of 40-1/8 cents in international exchange for conversion into the currency of the United States. The plaintiff claimed 53,080 schillings which he averred was equivalent to 35,386-2/3 Reichsmarks or the sum of $14,198.89. VMAG answered that the schillings claimed by the plaintiff are equivalent to $9,798.46. The judgment was computed in accordance with VMAG’s allegations concerning the value of the schillings and the actual valuation above that expressly admitted remained to be determined by trial.</p>

These laws were promulgated by the German-Government of Austria.” The first of these is a Decree to exclude Jews from the German economic life, dated at Berlin November 12, 1938, and executed by “Goering General Field Marshal”, the commissioner in charge of the Four Year plan. It <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>became effective in Austria on November 15, 1938, and provided in part that “(1) After January 1, 1939, a JeAV may not be a Manager (Betriebsfuehrer) in tbe sense of the laAv of January 20, 1934 regulating national labor (Reichsgesetzbl. I S. 45). (2) If a Jew is active as a managing executive in a business establishment he may be given six weeks to quit. Upon the expiration of the period of notice all rights based on the contract are extinguished, particularly the right to pensions and cancellation settlements.” VMAG pleaded that the plaintiff was a manager within the meaning of this law of January 20, 1934, and that he had been given due dismissal notice expiring prior to January 1, 1939. The second law was one on Foreign Exchange Control, which became effective in Austria about December 16, 1938, and provided in part that “Only subject to the issuance of a permit may an ‘inlander’ within the ‘inland’ (German Reich), make payments to a foreigner or in favor of a foreigner to an ‘inlander’, or in ‘inland’ or foreign payment media to a foreigner or, in favor of a foreigner, or an ‘inlander’.” VMAG averred that it is and always has been impossible for it to obtain such a permit. The third of these laws became effective about January 15, 1940, and designated persons resident in the United Kingdom of Great Britain as enemies and forbade any payment to them. Dr. David was such a resident.</p>

We are concerned solely with <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>the pleadings, and for the purposes of this appeal we assume the truth of the averments in the affidavit of defense and the “new matter” contained therein. We accept as true the allegations in the “new matter” that General Field Marshal Goering’s decree, prohibiting any Jew from holding the position of business manager in Austria after January 1, 1939, and requiring that one “active as a managing executive may be given six weeks notice to quit, and upon expiration of the period of notice all rights based on the contract are extinguished particularly the right to pensions and cancellation settlements,” became effective throughout Austria. That the Foreign Exchange Regulations, and the decree upon treatment of enemy property likewise became effective throughout Austria, we also accept as a fact. The question before us is the effect of these decrees and laws upon the plaintiff’s claim against VMAG. The defendant says they “have extinguished plaintiff’s cause of action and have made impossible compliance by VMAG with its former contractual liabilities, . . .” The plaintiff contends that “they do not actually apply in this case at all.”</p>

These created a liquidated debt. This debt was sufficient consideration for the new cause of action created on April 28, 1938, when VMAG stated an account in writing of this liability to the plaintiff and paid him all but the “remaining 50% of the contractual dismissal pay, which is established at one year’s salary,” and the monthly installment of his pension. The effect of this account stated is that “. . . a new duty arises to pay a sum so fixed.”: Restatement, Contracts, Sec. 422.</p>

Where the evidence tending to show the statement of account is not in dispute, the question as to whether the transaction amounts to an account stated, is for the determination of the Court . . .” Here the statement of the account is not challenged. The defendant disputes only the effect of the subsequent words “Will fall due” in this statement as they relate to the other half of the dismissal pay and the right to the installment of the pension. But these words are impotent to affect the then existing obligation as to the balance of the sum so fixed, or to affect the promised pension. Later laws in the form of dictatorial decrees or otherwise could not affect rights and obligations already matured. “It is the holding of all of the Pennsylvania cases, which we have cited, that, when an employee who is a member of any retirement system, whether it affects policemen, firemen, school teachers, or other public employees, has fully complied with all the requirements making him eligible to a retirement allowance, whether he chooses to ask for it then or later, <em>he has a vested right to such allowance which cannot be adversely affected by subsequent legislation, </em>except for a cause which we will refer to hereinafter.

What the applicable “law” is, is not a question of fact to be litigated, for the “law” appears in the defendant’s pleadings.

The rights which this decree attempt to destroy are those which our Declaration of Independence and the organic laws of this nation and of this state declare to be inalienable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> This Goering decree is characteristic of despotic governments of men but not of governments of law. However, American judges and statesmen recognize the impracticability of our nation’s attempting to impose on less civilized or uncivilized nations our own conceptions of right and justice in that nation’s treatment of its own nationals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> To do so would require force; force means war, and nations do not customarily go to war to protect <em>other </em>peoples from the oppressions of <em>their own </em>governments but only to protect <em>their own </em>people from the violence and aggressions of other nations. Since every government is sovereign within its own territorial limits, and since no independent nation is subject to any limitations, except those self-imposed, in the treatment of its own people it would be a vain thing for the courts of one nation to sit in judgment upon the validity of the acts of another nation done to that country’s own people in that nation’s <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>own territory. However, the <em>extraterritorial effect </em>of such acts and of the decrees of the courts of such a nation affecting private rights is a matter which other independent nations and their courts can determine for themselves. Even if American courts decide to recognize such a decree as the one now before us, its vicious and barbarous character entitles it to no liberality of construction ; it will be construed strictly.</p>

Appellant concedes “that a creditor to whom a debt is owed but to whom the debt is not paid at the place where it was <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>to be paid may enforce his right in any court which can obtain jurisdiction over the debtor, but only where such creditor has an enforceable cause of action by the law of the place whére the obligation was to be performed.” Having found that the Goering decree has not extinguished the plaintiff’s cause of .action and that it is enforceable it is admittedly enforceable anywhere. To its enforcement here in Pennsylvania, the appellant pleads that the provisions of this law prohibits it, an “inlander” from making any payments to a “foreigner” without first obtaining a governmental permit, which it has been unable to obtain, and that therefore, it is excused in any action from performance of its obligation anywhere. Without entering into any discussion as to whether this law does not limit payments to a foreigner solely “within the ‘inland’ ”, namely, Austria, and does not prohibit payments outside of Austria, it cannot be given effect here. “The courts have held that if the statute is one of a foreign government, nonperformance of the contract will not be excused on the ground that performance thereby became unlawful or impossible.” 12 Am. Jur. 379. The appellant also says that at the place of performance it would be impossible to perform and that no recovery could be had by the plaintiff. It contends that the place of performance here is Austria and Austria alone. To support this theory it contends that the action is an action on the contract. The cause of action, whether on the account stated or upon the contract with VMAG, is a case of a debt and “. . . there are numerous assertions in the cases that in the case of a debt, the place of payment is presumably the residence or place of business of the creditor even though it be out of the jurisdiction where the contract was made; . . 2 Beale-Conflict of Laws (1935) 1260. If, therefore, the place of performance in this case is the residence of the creditor at London, the law of Great Britain and not that of Austria is controlling. The law of Great Britain has laid down no such proscriptions as those <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>invoked by defendant and the latter has pleaded no impossibility of performance under its laws.

This question has been ably discussed by Judge Patterson in the last cited case. There Judge Patterson said: “It is the law of the place of performance that controls matters relative to legality of performance, impossibility of performance, and other excuses for nonperformance” (Citing cases) . . . “The argument is made that impossibility of performance created by foreign law is coming to be recognized both here and in England as a form of impossibility in fact and consequently as a defense to an action for breach of contract. The rule has frequently been laid down that impossibility due to change in foreign law is no excuse for breach of contract. (Citing cases) .<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> As, in the case cited, “the impossibility ... or excuse relied on here is impossibility ... or excuse by German Law.

This last decree was promulgated after this suit was instituted and after the original affidavit of defense was filed. This decree relating to a contract tó pay money to be performed outside of the German Reich “is of no legal significance in the courts of this country.” There is no impossibility or excuse for its nonperformance. The debt was and is a valid obligation of this defendant and its payment cannot be evaded by the invoking of a mere fictional “impossibility of performance”.
