Covington and Helen M. Covington, husband and wife respectively, who on October 27, 1942, were found dead by suicide in the kitchen of their home in Eddystone. While the bodies Avere being removed from the kitchen the wife’s sister noticed a sealed envelope on the kitchen table. It contained three sheets of paper identical in form and apparently taken from a pad which contained bill heads used by the husband in his plumbing business.</p>

H. &amp; Helen M. Covington, Eddystone, Pa.” The papers contained devises of two houses and some lots and bequests of diamond rings and jewelry and a provision for the payment of the proceeds of $7,000. life insurance. They also provided for the payment of funeral expenses. The second <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>page contained a devise of certain real property and bequests of certain personal property. The third page provided for the disposition of $1,000. of insurance proceeds and diamond rings and also gave the combination of the safe. At the end of the third page was the following: “Signed, J. H. Covington, Helen M. Covington, Oct. 25, 1942.”</p>

The sister of Mrs. Covington gave him a sealed envelope which she had found on the kitchen table near the bodies and which was addressed to Mrs. Covington’s father. It contained the three sheets of paper described, all identical in physical form and texture. The Chief of Police turned these sheets over to the Deputy Coroner, an undertaker, and he later delivered them to the attorneys for the appellees, and they delivered them to the Eegister of Wills. Counsel for appellees filed Caveats. At the hearing due proof was made of the handwriting of both of the decedents by qualified witnesses. The challenge against the probate of the will was based upon its execution as to form, i. e., as to its being on three physically disconnected and so allegedly unrelated sheets of paper. The court below in its opinion denying probate of these papers said: “It has been held by our Appellate Tribunals that a valid will may be made on more than one page, even though signed on but one page if the internal sense and coherence of the subject matter can be related. Looking towards the context there is nothing at the bottom of any of these pages which is in any sense connected with the context on the following page. They are all independent instruments . . . The basic principle of our courts is that while a will may be made on separate pieces of paper, signed at the bottom or end of the last thereof, none the less the pieces must be connected in their internal sense or coherence or adaptation of parts.” The court added: “It is the personal conviction of the writer of this opinion that these decedents intended to have this document adjudicated to be their last Will.”</p>

In that case there was offered for probate “four separate, loose, disconnected slips of paper”. One of them “had the testator’s name written thereon”. A second paper contained “the attestation clause”. A third paper was headed “eighth”, and the fourth paper is described in the opinion as “introductory”. We said in our opinion: “It was stated that sections or paragraphs had been cut from a complete will by the testator, who adopted this means of cancelling the sections or paragraphs thus cut out. There is no evidence that a complete will was in existence prior to the time the four papers were given to the decedent’s niece; nor is there anything before the court, to show that the parts in question were taken from such will, or that the papers handed to the appellant were a part of a will that had been duly signed by the testator.”</p>
    <p id="b56-5" data-blocks='[["BL_56.4",56,[233,1240,1150,360]]]'>We held that “there is nothing in any one of the papers, that refers to a matter or thing in the others; nor is there anything by reference, history or recital that would have a tendency to connect the papers; nor is there anything of itself that would support the conclusion that all the papers were intended as a last will and testament.”</p>

Justice Coulter speaking for this court said: “It is also contended <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>that the court erred in not instructing the jury, as requested, that, in order to have made the will valid in this case, it ought to have been signed by the testator, at the bottom of each leaf. It is true that such precaution might be useful, together with an assertion at the end of the will, that each sheet or leaf had the signature of the testator. I would recommend such precaution in practice, to prevent doubt or uncertainty. But it is not a statutory requirement, and this court cannot make it essential. The statute requires that the will shall be signed at the end thereof. If it were an essential element of a valid execution, then each signature would have to be proved, according to the statutory requisition. Many wills have been written on separate leaves attached at the top by tape, or tacked, with but one signature of the testator, to wit, at the end of the will, and one probate. If this court were to declare such wills invalid, independent of and without proof of fraud, to be determined by a jury, vast mischief would follow, many estates be disturbed and unsettled, and the direct words of the statute would be disregarded.”</p>

The testator’s name appeared on the first page in signature, with those of the subscribing witnesses. The other pages followed. One might take any of the pages, after what may be called the proper first page, and omit it from the collection, and the balance would make a complete will . . . Standing alone, the pages contained no words of a testamentary character, <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>except the last, and the same pages could be used in any other will, and it would be just as logical . . .

These papers consisted of five sheets. “The property attempted to be given by the decedent was set forth in numbered paragraphs, but apparently those denominated as three, on page one, and seven, on page two, were cut off . . . An attestation clause was found on both numbers four and five, and there was also found in the [safe-deposit] box a sealed instrument, being a letter to Byron, in which reference was made to the fact that he had been named as executor of her estate.” We said, “The court below was fully justified in finding that Miss Fisher [the testator] had prepared the first four pages at some date after the signature had been executed on the last, for no marks appeared which would lead to the belief that they had ever been attached to page five, or to the cover, both of which showed well defined holes, evidently made by an eyelet machine . . . The paper presented was rightfully rejected as a last will, there being nothing to indicate that it was the completed expression of the intention of the testatrix, the various papers not being connected properly by their internal sense, or ‘by coherence or adaptation of their various parts’ (Gibson, J., in <em>Wikoff’s App., </em>supra), but showing, on the contrary, that sections had been removed.” We said in that case: “Though separate papers may be joined and probated as a will, provided it clearly appears they were intended to be used as a finished whole <em>[Wikoff’s Appl.], </em>the real desire of <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>the decedent must be made to appear, and the facts proven must eliminate the possibility that any alteration in the written words had been made.” We said further, quoting from <em>Maginn’s Estate, </em>supra, that if the several sheets “can be coherently read as a will, that is, contain nothing incongruous or out of harmony in the general conception as a will, or if the several parts suit, fit in and are adaptable as a will, it will be given effect, provided the several pages be connected by their internal sense . . . This rule cannot apply where it is apparent that soznething has been omitted which the decedent znay have intended to include ... In the present case the envelope containing the various alleged testamentary pages was open when reznoved by the person named as executor, and two paragraphs of the numbered writings Avere cut off Avhen the papers were offered for probate. There was thus disclosed such chance of mistake as to fully justify the court in sustaining the complaint of the caveator.”</p>

With these two papers was found a bank book showing bank deposits. This book was in the fold of the letter and the three things had a rubber band about them. The decedent handed these over to her housekeeper, saying: “Turn my bank book over to Sister Mary and if I should die I want Thelma Moore to get my money in the bank.” The latter person offered the papers for probate. The court speaking through Mr. Justice Parker said: “The letter and card offered here are not connected or correlated in their internal sense. The only completed thought in the letter is a request that the bank book be placed in the care of Sister Mary and the card expresses no thought, with the result that there cannot be and is not any connection between the two. There is nothing in either letter or card that refers to any matter or thing in the other.

Each page had been torn from the same <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>pad. The probate was allowed. The Supreme Court of California said, “The case actually presented may be stated by the question whether the evidence upholds the finding of the court that the three sheets of paper form a single continuous instrument constituting the last will of the deceased. That the evidence is sufficient for this we think no doubt can be entertained. There was no other writing upon the sheets saving that of the testatrix. The sheets themselves were arranged and folded together in proper sequence. If testatrix had believed that the last page alone was her will, it is not probable that she would have preserved the first and second pages with such care, and would so have enfolded them as to evidence her belief that they were a part of and incorporated in her will. The omission of words and the repetition of ideas are not unusual in the writings of a person of advanced years and unskilled in the art of exact legal expression. The fact that the will is written upon more than one sheet of paper is immaterial. <em>Estate of Taylor, </em><a href="/cal/126/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="126 Cal. 97" data-case-ids="2002307" data-case-paths="/cal/126/0097-01">126 Cal. 97</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20P.%20454" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="58 P. 454">58 Pac. 454</a>.

It apparently believed (as its quoted language indicates) that the three pages could not be legally integrated into a will unless there were words on the bottom of one page which were parts of a sentence or a paragraph at the beginning of the next page. There is no such rule of law, and such a rule would not preclude that “possibility of fraud” which is so frequently mentioned in opinions in cases of this character. In these days when most wills are typewritten the fact that a sentence or a paragraph is partly on one page and partly on another would not obviate <em>all </em>possibility of fraud. For example, the last word on page one of such a “loose-leaf” will might read: “I bequeath to my brother John Smith”, and the words on the top of page two might read “five thousand dollars”. No one could be <em>certain </em>that page two of the will as originally written had not been taken out and a new page two inserted, substituting the words five thousand for five hundred. The “possibility of fraud” test is obviously without practical value. New long wills are written on a single unit of paper. Most long wills are now typewritten on several sheets of paper, bound together by “fasteners”. Such wills if signed at the end thereof are customarily admitted to probate without question, yet even with such wills it is a simple matter to remove the fasteners, substitute other pages and place new fasteners in the exact spots the old ones were. The best security against fraudulent substitution of typewritten pages is to have each page of the several sheets completing a will signed or initialed. Even this measure <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>of security is not infallible, for some signatures contain only a few letters and are easily forged.</p>

There is nothing in any of the pages which is a repetition of or inconsistent with, anything on the other pages, as was the case in <em>Bryen’s Estate, </em>supra.

The first words on page 2 are, “$200. paid on house at . . . to be refunded to . . .” The first words on page 3 are, “Insurance of Helen M. Covington . . .” Page 1 at its top contains the names of Joseph H. and Helen M. Covington, obviously written by the latter. Page 3 contains the signatures of husband and wife. There is not the slightest intimation of any fraudulent substitution of page 2. This page contains over seventy holographic words. The word “Covington” appears twice on that page and obviously it is in the same handwriting as Mrs. Covington’s signature on the last page. “Money in safe” is mentioned on page 2, and on page 3 the “safe combination” is disclosed. The Covingtons — husband and wife — are unmistakably identified by their handwriting and otherwise with <em>each </em>of these three pages and that they <em>intended </em>these three papers to constitute their last will is so clear as to be incontestable.

The “possibility of fraud test” is one that is utterly impracticable and no legislature has ever been found in Pennsylvania (or elsewhere so far as we know) so unwise as to lay down any such inept and trouble-making test. To argue that “there is nothing in this will to show that originally there were not four or five sheets”, is simply to bring forth a unique specimen of casuistical interpretation. With equal “logic” the same thing and more could be said of thousands of <em>typewritten </em>wills which are not signed or initialed or finger-printed on each page. Even if every two sheets of a will divided a sentence or a paragraph, <em>that fact </em>would not eliminate all possibility of fraud, for fraud may be perpetrated by the substitution of even one name or one word. A typewritten sentence beginning on a genuine first page might show perfect “continuity” on a second <em>substituted </em>typewritten page.

Fraud is possible even with the most carefully drawn wills, for the man who signed the will is dead when it is offered for probate.

We should realize that in applying that mandate to individual cases we must navigate carefully between Scylla and Charybdis, for, while too great a liberality in the construction of the rule may open the door to fraud, an excessive rigidity in its interpretation is apt to encourage even greater fraud albeit of a different nature. To allow wills to be probated if they consist of unconnected typewritten sheets bearing no apparent relation to one another would be to invite the abstraction of genuine pages and the insertion of fraudulent ones; but, on the other hand, to hold that separate pages cannot constitute a valid will unless a sentence runs over from each page to the next would be to permit evildoers in many instances to take apart a will made up of several sheets more or less loosely fastened together and thus, without the insertion or alteration of a single word by pen or pencil, destroy the genuine will of the testator. Moreover, there are literally hosts of testators who, writing their wills on <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>several pages (often using their letter paper for that purpose), fold and place them in an envelope which they mark $.s their last will and testament; to hold that a will thus written is invalid unless hy sheer accident it happen that a sentence is incomplete at the end of each page, or unless the pages happen to contain cross-references, would result in disappointed heirs attacking great numbers of such wills and preventing their probate although they conformed in every respect to the provisions of the Wills Act. It must be remembered that probably the majority of wills are not prepared under legal guidance, and I doubt if any layman would ever dream that his will would probably be of no validity if he wrote it on separate pieces of paper, folded them as he would a letter, and sealed them in an envelope.

It cannot be established by extrinsic evidence . . .” This we followed in <em>Maginn’s Estate, <a href="/pa/278/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="278 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1080644" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0089-01">278 </a></em><a href="/pa/278/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="278 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1080644" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0089-01">Pa. 89</a> (recently cited with approval by Mr. Justice Parker in <em>Davis’ </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/344/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="344 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="1210932" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0520-01">344 Pa. 520</a>, 522, a very similar case), where in holding that an alleged will consisting of seven loose pages fastened together by a sliding clip was improperly admitted to probate, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Kepiiart, said (p. 96) : “While a will need not be signed at the physical or spatial end, and pages need not follow in numerical order, there must be a sequence of pages or paragraphs which relates to its logical and internal sense, and the signature must be placed at the sequential end. And this end must not permit the substitution or interpolation of pages in advance unless they are connected as indicated. As stated in <em>Stinson’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/228/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="228 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="969911" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0475-01">228 Pa. 475</a>, 479, 'The order of connec<a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>tion must manifestly appear upon the face of the will.’ ” The language of these cases is precisely applicable to the instant situation, where it would have been possible for the finder of the papers to remove the middle page without disturbing the sense of the remainder, or to insert one or more pages which were in the handwriting of one of the testators but discarded by them and not destroyed. The holding of the majority that all three pages are internally connected because taken together they result in a complete disposition of all of testators’ property cannot be supported without violating the rule above stated. There is nothing in the papers to show that they dispose of all testators’ estate, and only extrinsic evidence can make that fact known.</p>
    <p id="b74-4" data-blocks='[["BL_74.4",74,[210,1037,1150,754]]]'>In seeking to find an internal connection, the majority refers to the fact that “money in safe” is mentioned on the second page, and that the combination of the safe is given on the third page, but in my opinion no help can be gained from this, because the third page also contains a gift of property to be found in the safe. Another conclusion of the majority, which seems to be erronéous, is that because the writing is not forged, it constitutes a valid will. This is a non sequitur. A person ignorant of the law can execute a writing intending it to be a will, but if he does not comply with the provisions of the Wills Act, as for example by failing to sign it at the end, or by not signing it at all, it must be refused probate regardless of its genuineness.</p>

The purpose of the Act was to remove all <em>possibility </em>of fraud. It is most evident that there exists a <em>possibility </em>of fraud in such insertions. Even if the testamentary intention of this particular testatrix is frustrated, it is much wiser to refrain from weakening the sound and well-established mandate of the legislature.
