These inferences, with <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>the admitted facts stated in the opinion of the Superior Court, clearly show that the jurisdictional fact of a Nevada domicil was lacking.</p>

His wife was not served in Nevada and did not appear though notified in accord with Nevada law. In the Nevada proceeding he testified: “Q. When you came to Nevada you came with the intention of making Clark County, Nevada, your permanent place of residence? A. Yes, sir. Q. Have you retained that intention ever since? A. Yes, sir. Q. And you have it now? A. Yes, sir.” He gave that testimony on September 8th, received the decree on the same day and left Nevada immediately. His acts spoke louder than his words. If his testimony that on September 8th he had the “intention” of residing in Nevada, had been supple-* mented by the fact that he would leave the state immediately afterward, the court would have been justified in declining to make a finding that his Nevada domicil was bona fide. The court might very well have said, had it known the additional fact, that while the six-weeks residence required by the Nevada statute was established, his intention to leave immediately afterward prevented a finding that his domicil was in good faith. The prima facie inference is, and the Superior Court was authorized to make it, that, notwithstanding his testimony, he had no intention of making his domicil in Nevada. His Nevada case is no different in legal effect from what it would have been if he had never been in that state but had arranged to have someone falsely impersonate him at the hearing. In our inquiry into the legal effect of the record, a more difficult factual question might have been presented if Mr. Esenwein had given evidence in the County Court to the effect that notwithstanding his testimony in Nevada on September 8th, conditions developed immediately afterward which made it desirable that he should again change his domicil from Nevada to <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>some other state. But he gave no such evidence; though he was the moving party, he produced nothing to rebut the facts clearly inferable against him on the whole case. The Superior Court was therefore justified in adopting the natural or normal inference that appellant’s proceeding in Nevada was a sham and fraud for the purpose of evading the order of the County Court of Allegheny County.</p>

Our conclusion is not inconsistent with the decision in <em>Williams v. North Carolina, </em><a href="/us/317/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="317 U.S. 287" data-case-ids="303872" data-case-paths="/us/317/0287-01">317 U.

We thus have no question on the present record whether a divorce decree granted by the courts of one state to a resident, as distinguished from a domiciliary, is entitled to full faith and credit in another state. Nor do we reach here the question as to the power of North Carolina to refuse full faith and credit to Nevada divorce decrees because, contrary to the findings of the Nevada court, North Carolina finds that no <em>bona fide </em>domicil was <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>acquired in Nevada.” The question thus reserved in the <em>Williams </em>case is the one decided by the courts below against the appellant.</p>

The record shows that appellant sold his business in the City of Pittsburgh, abandoned his domicil in Pennsylvania and took up one in Nevada, which he later changed to Ohio, and there has resided now for more than two years.

Y. 261</a>, on facts quite analogous to those of the instant case, upheld the validity of a Nevada decree in divorce which was there being challenged. Prom the agreed state of facts there before the court, it appears that respondent-husband left New York State and went to Nevada in June, 1937, and there commenced an action for divorce against his wife, who was a domiciliary of New York, on the ground of extreme cruelty; that the wife did not appear by attorney or in person and was not served personally with a summons, but merely by publication; that respondent obtained a decree in Nevada on September 18, 1937, and on the same day remarried; that in December, 1937, after respondent and his second wife had moved to New York State, the first wife commenced an action against respondent for a divorce on the ground of adulterous conduct with the second wife; that respondent filed an answer averring that he had already obtained a decree in Nevada; that the referee, to whom the case was referred in New York, found that respondent and his first wife had been residents of New York from the date of their marriage to the time of trial; that because of the adultery of respondent, the first wife was entitled to a <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>decree; that a judgment in her favor became final in September, 1939, and no appeal therefrom was ever taken; that the second wife continued to reside in New York State until her death in January, 1942; that thereafter one Frances M. Lawson applied to the Surrogate’s Court for letters of administration upon the estate of the second wife and the respondent-husband filed an answer alleging in substance that he was the husband of the deceased and entitled to letters. On the issue as to whom letters should be granted, the Surrogate held that respondent was not the legal husband of decedent at the time of her death and, therefore, denied his petition, and the Appellate Division reversed and held that the Nevada decree must be recognized in New York Staté. In upholding the action of the Appellate Division, the Court of Appeals, speaking through Chief Judge Lehman, said: “In the case we are now reviewing, the appellant [Frances M. Lawson] has not, in the agreed statement of facts, or by presentation or offer of evidence, except the decision of the referee in the divorce action, challenged the decision of the Nevada court that the plaintiff had acquired a domicile in Nevada sufficient to support the jurisdiction of that court to adjudicate his marital status. Though the appellant has consistently contended that the courts of this State may refuse to give full faith and credit to the Nevada decree he bases that contention primarily, if not exclusively, upon the decision of the Supreme Court of this State in the divorce action instituted here that the Nevada decree was invalid. Since that decision is, as we have said, not binding upon the respondent and since there is no other affirmative proof that the respondent was not domiciled in Nevada when he brought an action for divorce there, we must apply the rule long authoritatively established by the Supreme Court of the United States: ‘There can be no doubt that if full faith and credit were denied to a judgment rendered in another State upon a suggestion of want of jurisdiction, without evidence to warrant the finding, this court would enforce <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>the constitutional requirement. See <em>German Savings and Loan Society v. Dormitzer, ante, </em>page 125.’ <em>(Rogers v. Alabama, </em><a href="/us/192/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="192 U.S. 226" data-case-ids="360335" data-case-paths="/us/192/0226-01">192 U. S. 226</a> at p. 231, opinion by Holmes, J.) We have found no case in which this court has heretofore attempted to define the scope of the rule that a judgment of a sister state granting the plaintiff a divorce from a spouse not domiciled in that state nor appearing in the action nor personally served with process there imports that the court had acquired jurisdiction to render a valid judgment <em>in rem </em>changing the status of the plaintiff. In many decisions the court has, however, assumed the existence of a presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the court had jurisdiction to render judgment, though, doubtless, the validity of the judgment may be impeached by extrinsic evidence. (See <em>Kerr v. Kerr, </em><a href="/ny/41/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="41 N.Y. 272" data-case-ids="2045748" data-case-paths="/ny/41/0272-01">41 N.

Y. 62</a>, 68.) Instinct in these and other decisions of this court is the rule that the foreign judgment of divorce will be given full force and effect as a judgment <em>in rem </em>dissolving the marriage of the plaintiff until impeached by evidence which establishes that the court had no jurisdiction over the <em>res. </em>That rule is in accord with the great weight of judicial authority in this country.
