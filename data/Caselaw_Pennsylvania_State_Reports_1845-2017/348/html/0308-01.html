L. 358, provides “. . . the provisions of this section shall not apply to the tax<a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>ation for mercantile license purposes of (a) manufacturers or mechanics vending goods of their manufacture from their factories or workshops . . .” Appellee has a plant equipped with machinery for making potato chips. Only a particular type of potato adaptable for this particular product is used. Potatoes are stored over a long period of time at a constant temperature between 40 and 50 degrees during which time a chemical change takes place, the starch content being changed to a sugar content. The temperature is then increased to 60 or 70 degrees, during which time tests are made to determine the proper relationship between the starch and sugar content. When the proper relationship has been reached the potatoes are prepared for making chips. After passing through various processes, during which the potatoes are cleaned, sliced and washed, they are dried thoroughly and delivered to a chipping or frying machine. They first come in contact with a temperature of 450 .to 475 degrees and leave the machine at a temperature of 300 to 325 degrees. This machine contains hot fat and vegetable oils through which the chips are passed. They are then conveyed through an oven which drains off the fat and dries them. After further drying they pass through an automatic salting machine and are conveyed to an automatic packing machine from which the chips emerge packed and ready for shipment.</p>

The form and content of the finished product are entirely different. This is not a cáse where there has been a mere chemical change in the article itself. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Weiland Packing Company, </em><a href="/pa/292/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="292 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="1109680" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0447-01">supra.</a> In <em>Commonwealth v.

While the potato chip is still basically a potato product, yet it has no resemblance to a raw potato, either in appearance or texture, and it is useful in that it is ready for instant consumption without any further preparation. Chemically, too, there has been a complete change . . .” Appellee is engaged in manufacturing within the meaning of the exemption provided in the Act.</p>
