    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.7",294,[193,656,1166,1611]]]'>On November 2,1942, Vibration Specialty Company, appellant, and the Federal Home Improvement Co., a business owned and operated by Edna Ulick, and duly registered of record under and pursuant to the Pennsylvania Assumed or Fictitious Names Act, entered into an agreement for a construction and certain improvements upon appellant’s property. The contract contained a warrant of attorney to confess judgment, and was executed on behalf of the Federal Home Improvement Co. Appellant having defaulted, the warrant of authority to confess judgment was exercised in the name of “Edna Ulick, trading as Federal Home Improvement Co.” Entry of judgment was accompanied by an averment of default and a suggestion filed of record that the business was duly registered under the Assumed or Fictitious Names Act and recorded as such prior to the date of the contract. Appellant filed a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be stricken off. The court, below entered an order discharging the rule provided appellee would file an affidavit identifying herself as. the real party in interest. An affidavit setting forth that Edna Ulick, trading as Federal Home Improvement Co., was the person with whom appellant had contracted; that she was the sole, true and lawful owner and holder of■ the claim against appellant; and, that she was the real party in interest, was filed forthwith. This appeal is from an order discharging a petition to show cause why the rule to strike off the judgment should not be made absolute. The order appealed from must be affirmed.</p>

      <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>Relying upon the existence and nse of the name Federal Home Improvement Co., Inc. in the body of the contract, and designation therein of the contracting party as a private corporation, appellant contends that the contract was not made with the Federal Home Improvement Co. This contention fails to consider that at the top of the contract the word “Inc.” is crossed out; that the Federal Home Improvement Co., Inc. ceased to transact business in this Commonwealth on July 1,1941, one year and five months prior to the execution of the contract; that there was at the time no corporation in this Commonwealth doing business under that name; that since July 1,1941, appellee has been the sole owner of the business conducted under the trade name of Federal Home Improvement Co.; and, that appellee had registered under the Assumed or Fictitious Names Act prior to the execution of the said contract. The registration being on record was constructive notice to appellant of the nature of the person or business with whom it was negotiating and with whom it contracted: <em>Houser v.

Superior Ct. 318</a>, judgment was entered by confession in favor of R. G. Eddy individually. The record showed a warrant of attorney to confess judgment in favor of The R. G.

The court said (p. 319) : “The agreement between the defendant and the Marble &amp; Granite Company does not . . . indicate whether the latter was a partnership or a corporation, and the record in any action upon the agreement should be made to clear up that uncertainty. <em>This plaintiff cannot recover upon the written agreement without in some manner connecting himself with the company with which defendant entered into covenants.” </em>In <em>Boggs v.
