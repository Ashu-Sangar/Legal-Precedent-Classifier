United Gas agreed “to take possession of and to operate for it . . . its gas works . . . with its mains, pipes, and all and singular the appurtenances, rights, privileges, and appliances belonging thereto, and all its corporate property, real and personal, and to manufacture, distribute, and sell gas, and to collect moneys therefor, for the full term of ninety-nine years from the 30th day of June, 1900.” It agreed “to perform said services for and during the term aforesaid, and to pay from the receipts of the said business to be carried on by it as aforesaid to [Northern Liberties], the sum of thirty-<a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>eight thousand dollars ($38,000) per annum in [specified installments] and also to provide and furnish the [Northern Liberties] the money required to pay and discharge all taxes and assessments in the nature thereof, whether federal, state, or municipal, of whatsoever kind or nature which may at any time hereafter be imposed upon said property, and also all taxes which the said Northern Liberties Gas Company may be compelled to pay at any time hereafter during the continuance of this contract upon its capital stock or business of any kind or in any manner. . . and also to pay to said [Northern Liberties] the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.) per annum, . . . for the expenses of maintenance of the organization of [Northern Liberties].

The provision is that United Gas shall “pay and discharge all taxes and assessments in the nature thereof, whether federal, state or municipal, of whatsoever kind or nature, which may at any time hereafter be imposed upon said property . . .” We interrupt at this point to observe that income and excess profits taxes are not taxes on the property (compare <em>Reese Inc. v. U. S., </em><a href="/f2d/75/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="75 F.2d 9" data-case-ids="961430" data-case-paths="/f2d/75/0009-01">75 F. 2d 9</a>, 10 (C. C. A. 5th, 1935) turned over to United Gas and subsequently maintained, which, as preceding sections of the contract show, was the plant, etc., to be operated, etc., by United Gas. After the word “property,” the contract continues that United Gas shall pay “. . . all taxes which the said Northern Liberties Gas Company may be compelled to pay at any time hereafter during the continuance of this contract upon its capital stock or business of any kind or in any manner . . .” It will be conceded, we assume, that the taxes in question are not on capital stock; This leaves for consideration whether the words “or business of any kind or in any manner” considered with the other provisions of the contract outlined above, clearly and specifically include an obliagtion to pay income taxes. The word “business” in that phrase means the business theretofore described in the contract as the business of Northern Liberties, which was to be conducted by United Gas and, subsequently, was in fact conducted by <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>it. “In general, a word used by the parties in one sense is to be interpreted as employed in the same sense throughout the writing in the absence of countervailing reasons.” 3 Williston, Contracts, (Rev. ed. 1936) section 618, p. 1780. Here there is no such reason for giving the word “business” two meanings. Shortly stated, the parties agreed that United Gas should pay the taxes on the property, capital stock and business of Northern Liberties conducted and operated by United Gas. There was no agreement, certainly none expressed in clear and specific terms, to pay any tax on the yearly payment of $39,000 to be made to Northern Liberties. Appellant’s suggestion is that its receipt of the yearly payment constituted doing business within the meaning of the tax covenant. We must reject the contention as ignoring the meaning attributed throughout the contract to the word “business.” A similar suggestion was rejected in <em>Boston &amp; Providence R. R. v. Old Colony R. R., </em><a href="/mass/269/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="269 Mass. 190" data-case-ids="3826237" data-case-paths="/mass/269/0190-01">269 Mass. 190</a>, 197, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20N.E.%20157" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="169 N.E. 157">169 N.

If so, it seems to us that this case is indistinguishable from those cases construing an agreement to pay taxes on the business carried on on the demised premises. If that be true, the obligation does not include the payment of income taxes, but contemplates only the payment of taxes imposed upon the operation of the business by the lessee or agent so that the annual payment turned over to the lessor or principal is the. full amount specified in the agreement.”</p>
