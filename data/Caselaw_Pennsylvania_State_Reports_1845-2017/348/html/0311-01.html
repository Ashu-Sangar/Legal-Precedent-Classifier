Those inter<a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>ested in the estate contended, and the orphans’ court found as a fact, that the husband' had, for one year and upwards previous to the death of his wife, wilfully neglected or refused to provide for her, and for that period wilfully and maliciously deserted her. The rights, of the husband, in such circumstances, are barred by the Intestate Act of June <em>7-, </em>1917, P. L. 429, section 5, 20 PS section 41. Our sole inquiry therefore is whether the court below had sufficient proof to support its findings.</p>

The burden was therefore placed upon the husband to establish that during the intervening periods of freedom from imprisonment the husband did in fact support his wife, and that his failure to support his wife <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>for a year or upwards previous to her death was not wilful neglect or refusal to provide for the wife, but was due solely to his incarceration.
