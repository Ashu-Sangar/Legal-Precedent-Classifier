The minor died before trial and his mother, Barbara Smith, was substituted. The jury found for the plaintiff, Barbara Smith, as administratrix of the minor’s estate, in the sum of $2,353.60, and in favor of the parent plaintiffs in the sum of $10,000.00. Defendant moved for judgment n.o.v. in both cases and, in the case of the parents, for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was excessive; this motion for a new trial was granted. The court of its own motion then granted a new trial in the case of the administratrix on the ground that the verdict was inadequate. As defendant had presented a written point for binding instructions and, subsequently, motions for judgment n.o.v. based on the refusal to affirm the point for charge, defendant is entitled to a review of the whole record: <em>Fornelli v.

The minor, aged nineteen, was employed as a member of a WPA gang working on township roads. At the trial, the parties stipulated that the WPA was an independent contractor. The township furnished its truck which was used by the contractor about 16 days a month and by the township the rest of the time; it was kept in the township garage, and the township had agreed to keep it in repair. The truck was used, inter alia, to haul workmen to and from jobs. In that capacity the minor, with other employes, was on the truck as it approached a descending grade to cross a ditch or gully; before descending, the driver stopped at or about the top of the slope, and directed the men to get off the truck. While the minor ivas alighting, the brakes failed, the truck started and injured him. There is evidence that the brakes had been out of order for a number of months. As the truck was used during that time by the township, as well as by the contractor and was kept in the township garage, the evidence supports a finding of the township’s knoAvledge of the defect. Furnishing the defec<a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>tive truck, resulting in plaintiff’s injury, was a breach of duty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

A second class township elects three supervisors. “The general supervision of road affairs in every township” is imposed on the supervisors; the statute requires the township to keep its roads in repair: Act of May 1, 1933, P.L. 103, Art V, sections 510, 516, 53 PS sections 19093-510 and 516.

The supervisors are authorized to make contracts for the repair of roads and may themselves work on the roads. Act of May 1, 1933, P.L. 103, Art. Y, section 517, 53 PS section 19093-517. Appellant’s contention comes to this: that Porter, one of the three supervisors, by acting as the contractor’s foreman, divested himself, for the time, of responsibility to perform the duties of the township office to which he was elected. We must reject that contention. During the entire term of his office, Mr, Porter was charged with the statutory duty to keep the roads in repair; his office required him to familiarize himself with the condition of the roads and the equipment maintained for the performance of his public duties. The township was entitled to the benefit of whatever knowledge on this subject he acquired during the term. <em>Plats v.

The mere fact the truck driver informed the supervisor of the defective brakes at a time when the gang was engaged on the public roads was therefore immaterial. The evidence was admissible.
