Patrick, was Financial Secretary of the Union of Russian Societies of St. Michael &amp; St. George, Incorporated. The society has as one of its functions the making of small loans, not exceeding $300.00, to its members, upon application. Patrick was also President and one of the stockholders of the Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated.</p>

This action was not authorized by the Society. The Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated, received the proceeds of the check. At the time of the delivery of the $1,000.00, a series of twenty-two consecutively numbered checks, each in the sum of $50.00, payable each successive week thereafter, was drawn by the Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated, and delivered to John Koss. The money was paid to Koss as Treasurer of the Society and for its account. During the year of 1935 and the month of January, 1936, eight additional loans were similarly made to the Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated, which, together with the first, totaled $5,850.00. In each instance, when the Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated, received the Society’s check, it delivered to Koss a series of post-dated consecutively numbered checks in an amount sufficient to repay that loan. No report of the loans was made to the Society, and it was in contravention of the constitution and bylaws of the Society. The Philadelphia Iron Works paid the checks and John Koss retained the proceeds of all the checks drawn to his order. The Society received none of this money. The money was paid by the Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated, to Koss as Treasurer of the Society.</p>

When it subsequently developed that the Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated, repaid all of the money it received from the Society to Koss, the Society amended the bill in equity, releasing the Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated. The amendment was finally made at trial by agreement. The Society also agreed with the Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated, to accept from it the sum of $3,800.00 in settlement of its liability, and on <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>December 22, 1941, when the payment was made, gave the Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated, a general release, acquitting it and the defendant Patrick of all liability in the premises.</p>
    <p id="b631-4" data-blocks='[["BL_631.4",631,[105,487,1153,207]]]'>The court found that Koss was bound to account to the Society in the sum of $6,321.80, and that any sum in excess of that due it should be held .by the Society for the benefit of Stephan A. Patrick and Theodore Duda.</p>
    <p id="b631-5" data-blocks='[["BL_631.5",631,[102,707,1155,858]]]'>The statement of the case, under Supreme Court Rule 56, does not say in what respect the bill in equity was amended. It was apparent to the trial judge that as of December 22, 1941, the Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated, Patrick, Koss, and Duda had made restitution to the Society of the funds wrongfully taken. This money having been paid by the Philadelphia Iron Works, Incorporated, to Koss as Treasurer of the Society, Koss, after receiving the repayment of the funds, then converted the funds of the Society to his own use. His tortious act was entirely independent of the wrongful acts committed by the Philadelphia Iron Works, Patrick, Koss and Duda in paying out the money. The money so paid out had already been returned to Koss, the treasurer of. the company, and it was after its return that he converted it to his own use.</p>

Nor is it material whether the tortfeasors involved committed a joint tort or concurrent or successive torts, because the principle which underlies the rule is that the injured person is given a legal remedy only to obtain compensation for the damage done to him, and when that compensation has been received from any of the wrongdoers, his right to further remedy is at an end.” And we conceive in this case that the trial judge so concluded, for he dismissed the bill as to Julia Koss, Theodore Duda, Philadelphia Iron Works, Inc., and Stefan Petrikovicz,also known as Stephan A. Patrick, and held “John Koss is hereby declared a trustee ex maleficio for the use and benefit of the plaintiff in the sum of $6,321.80.”</p>

      <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>The court required “John Koss to account to the plaintiff society for the sum of $6,321.80 received by him from the Philadelphia Iron Works, Inc. with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent from the time the moneys were received by him.” The appellant contends that the lower court had no right to award a greater sum than would make the society whole, to wit, $2,321.80. In its amended decree the court provides: “That any sum paid by the defendant John Koss to the plaintiff society in excess of $2,321.80, in accordance with this decree, shall be held in trust by the plaintiff society for the benefit of Stephan A. Patrick and Theodore Duda as their interests may appear in accordance Avith the .conclusions of law herein.” We believe this order was proper. In an action of account, a defendant may be decreed a balance found to be due, even though no cross bill Avas filed (1 C. J. 639; <em>Anthracite Lumber Co. v.
