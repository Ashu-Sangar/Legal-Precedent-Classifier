The court below held that this burden was not met. Among the pertinent findings of fact are the following: “11. The plaintiff company never made any written complaint that Johnston and Harder, Inc. was not complying with the contract.” “12. On February 3, 1936, at 5:30 P.M. the plaintiff company without any prior notice whatsoever or without stating any reason, notified Johnston &amp; Harder, Inc. that its general agency contract was cancelled.” “13. The cancellation notice referred to the defendant’s ‘violation of your obligations thereunder’, i.e. under the contract, but gave no specifications of the alleged violation.” In its 36th finding of fact the Chancellor said, inter alia: “There is no claim of any active wrongdoing on the part of Johnston and Harder, Inc. as an entity. The plaintiff company undertakes to justify the summary cancellation because the best interests <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>of the plaintiff company were not being conserved due to Johnston’s dissatisfaction with the Affiliated Insurance Agencies, Inc. contract and the limitation of his income; that the premiums for October, 1935, writings had not been remitted before February 3, 1936; that Johnston and Harder, Inc. were permitting contra accounts ; that it also was threatening to obtain a general agency with another surety and insurance company; that there was no prospect that the dissatisfaction of Johnston, as President of Johnston and Harder, Inc., would be corrected. The evidence offered to support these alleged reasons are not sufficient to find as a fact that the plaintiff company was justified in its summary cancellation of the agreement.” In his third conclusion of law the Chancellor said: “Johnston and Harder, Inc., in a legal manner and with good faith, substantially carried out and performed all the duties and obligations placed upon it by its general agency contract with the Massachusetts Bonding and Insurance Company from February, 1924 to and including February 3,1936.”</p>
    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.4",569,[125,1348,1151,319]]]'>The Court below properly found that there was no design on the part of the plaintiff to seize and confiscate the business of the defendant, and “that J-H, as a corporate entity, never had any difficulties nor was it charged with any variations of its obligations to the plaintiff company.”</p>

In the opinion <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>filed in this case in 343 Pa. we cited <em>Weinglass v. </em>Gibson, <a href="/pa/304/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="304 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="1132410" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0203-01">304 Pa. 203</a>, 207, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.%20439" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="155 A. 439">155 A. 439</a>, to the effect that “Where there is a basis in the evidence for a reasonable computation of the damages suffered considering the nature of the transaction, a verdict may be based thereon, though there may be involved some uncertainty about it”, citing numerous cases. We also quoted Williston on Contracts, Revised Edition, Vol. 5, Sec. 1345, p. 3776, as follows: “But though there must be evidence of substantial damage in order to justify recovery of more than a nominhl sum, the exact amount need not be shown. Where substantial damage has been suffered, the impossibility of proving its precise limits is no reason for denying substantial damages altogether.” Williston in Section 1346A, p. 3781, says: “Various methods are used in proving prospective profits. The evidence of experts if based on anything more than individual opinion or conjecture has also been admitted.” Williston also says, Section 1346, p. 3781: “Where a breach of contract involves deprivation of a chance which has value in a business sense, a just reluctance will be felt by most courts to deny altogether the recovery of substantial damages.”</p>

Hewitt, called as an expert witness by the defendant to testify as to its damages, was asked: “What is your opinion as to the value of the business of Johnston and Harder, Inc. on February 3, 1936, as a going concern?” He answered: “I would say it was worth approximately ninety thousand dollars, which would be twice the net commission, — the average annual net commission.” He was also asked: “Is 30 days a sufficient time for an agent to secure a new contract, or a new principal, in the event he has notice his contract is to be cancelled at the end of the 30 days?” He answered: “In this particular I think it undoubtedly was sufficient time.”</p>

He was asked: “You have also said that the Agents Association considers that the individual agent is the owner of his business?” A. “Yes.” He was asked: “Do you know of a case where somebody paid one and one-half times the figures you have mentioned for a corporate agency, when the only man in it producing went out and competed with the purchaser?” He answered: “Well, I can’t just-recall one.” He based his valuation of $42,000. on one and one-half times the total income for 1935 of the business Johnston and Harder did with the Massachusetts Bonding and Insurance Company.</p>

McKelvey, another expert called by the defendant to testify as to the value of the agency, testified that it had “a sale value on February 3, 1936 as a going concern of $90,000.” On cross-examination the following questions and answers appear: “If you have a going agency and somebody wants to buy it, the main thing that he buys is this list, isn’t it?” A. “Yes.” Q. “And a chance to solicit the renewals of that business; is that correct?” A. “That is part of what you are buying. . . . If you could not eliminate the competition [of the former owner] you might advise the purchase without the elimination of competition of the former owners. . . . Well, you wouldn’t pay a nickel for a business if the owner is going to continue in the same business.” Q. “As we understand your former testimony, in thirty days the agent could replace the company?” A. “Yes”. Q. “Isn’t it your contention in the business that a live, <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>progressive agent, with no alternative, where there has been a list of insured, can replace the company, perhaps in a' day or two?” A. “It couldn’t be done.” Q. “You say it can be done in thirty days?” A. “Yes. It would be quite inconvenient to do it in that period of time, but it can be done.”</p>
    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[230,617,1150,1622]]]'>In support of the award of damages the brief of the defendant says: “The findings of fact by the Chancellor and affirmed by the Court en banc showing that for the five years prior to February 3rd, 1936, J-H had done an average annual premium business of $243,167.00 with an average net commission return of $45,358.00 for each of said years and that, after February 3,1936, the business vanished except for a nominal amount, is a complete answer to Appellant’s argument that the unlawful cancellation of the contract and unlawful seizure of J-H’s business was ‘damnum absque injuria’.” The weakness of this contention is that it is apparently based on the assumption that plaintiff had <em>no </em>right to cancel its agency contract with defendant, whereas it is established that it could do so <em>upon thirty days’ notice. </em>What we are concerned with here in assessing damages is this: To what extent was the defendant damaged by the cancellation which was unlawful only to the extent that the plaintiff <em>effected </em>the cancellation summarily on February 3,1936; instead of thirty days later, as it had a clear right to do if on February 3rd it had given notice of the proposed termination thirty days hence? The value of an agency contract with a long period of life before it is one thing; the value of such contract which can be terminated on thirty days’ notice is quite another thing. For example, a lease on a building might be very profitable to the lessee as long as the lease exists, but if the lease is terminable by the lessor on thirty days’ notice, the fact of such possible termination at any time within thirty days would enter into the sale value of that lease.</p>

No matter how high the earnings may be under an agency contract, the earnings will end when the contract ends. All of defendant’s witnesses as to the value of this contract based their testimony on this agency as a “going concern” on February 3, 1936, without taking into consideration that at the will of the plaintiff it could lawfully cease to “go” thirty days thereafter. The only witness who considered this latter factor was plaintiff’s witness, Scott Harris. On direct examination he said he could not place a value on this general agency because he “had not been presented with sufficient data”; thére was lacking data as to “the premium cost to the agency or the sub-agent, the production out-go . . . and an analysis of the casualty business [which was the kind of business the agency did for the plaintiff], as to how much is represented by the higher commission income, and how much by the lower commission income class and compensation. . .” When asked on cross-examination what value he would place on this agency based on the net commissions paid to defendant by plaintiff in 1935, of $28,854., he replied: “The valuation, subject to the contingent, upon examination of this business in detail, as to its classification, and as to the other conditions I have mentioned, including the relationship of the Agency with its companies and the accounts receivable and payable now, then there might be the value there of forty-eight to fifty thousand dollars; contingent. . . <em>It would depend entirely on what the prospectives were for the continuation of this income, </em>represented partly by the approximately twenty-five per cent on direct business.” (Italics supplied.)</p>

In support of this it cites the testimony of Hewitt, who was asked: “Isn’t this correct, that in January, 1936, all of the renewals for'February, 1936, were sent out?” He answered: “I hardly think that is correct. Undoubtedly a great many of them had been written by the office, and possibly given to Mr. Johnston, or may have been mailed to the agents. . '. [ Normally we tried to keep about a month ahead, as nearly as'we can.” Mr. Hewitt was one of the directors of Affiliated Insurance Agencies, a co-defendant. His testimony would not warrant a finding, as plaintiff contends that Johnston and Harder, Inc. “got the full benefit of commissions thereon” [February 1936 business]-. Plaintiff calls attention to defendant’s Exhibit “Y” in support of its contention that-no loss rvas occasioned the defendant in February. This Exhibit “Y” shows, the total premiums produced by Johnston and Harder, Inc. for the plaintiff' for the years 1930, 1931, <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>1932,1933,1934 and 1935, and for the year 1936 it shows these figures for each individual month, and then the total for the year 1937 and for the year 1938. For January 1936 the total of such premiums was $22,340. and for February 1936 it was $14,396. For March it was $3,509., for April it was $1,029., for May $914., and for June $44. These figures for February indicate that the renewals for February 1936 which had been sent out in January brought in substantial commissions for the defendant <em>; </em>but it seems to us that if on February 3,1936, the defendant had received notice of the termination of its contract <em>thirty days </em>later it could have sent out in February the renewals for March, exactly as it had sent out in January the renewals for February, and it would have received commissions on them. We think the defendant Johnston and Harder, Inc. is fairly entitled to recover the profits which would have resulted to it from the performance by the plaintiff of its promise to give thirty days’ notice of the cancellation of the agency contract unless it was terminated summarily for just cause. In other words, the plaintiff illegally deprived this agency of thirty days of existence and its damages are what it could have made under its agency contract with plaintiff during that period.</p>

On the basis of its past history, a reasonable prediction can be made as to its future.” Among the illustrations cited is No. 9 on p. 519, as follows: “A contracts with B to make the latter his exclusive agent for the sale of sewing-machines in a specified territory and to supply him with machines at a named price.

Swank, Secretary of Johnston and Harder, Inc., (the official who filed its answer) testified that “when an order is given for the issuance of a policy contract . . . the company furnishes the general agent with policies. . . .

    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[138,358,1151,422]]]'>Since tbe cancellation of tbe contract did not force tbe defendant to discontinue tbe business of writing casualty insurance, and since it represented other companies, and since an established agency can always find insurance companies to represent,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> we do not find that defendant lost any such “good will” by tbe cancellation without notice as would justify an award of damages for such .loss.</p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.6",577,[140,796,1152,1192]],["BL_578.1",578,[216,246,1148,209]]]'>Tbe most that defendant is entitled to under this record is tbe loss of thirty days’ net profits by reason of tbe failure of the plaintiff to give it due notice of tbe cancellation. Defendant’s Exhibit “X” shows tbe following net commissions paid to Johnston and Harder, Inc. by tbe Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Insurance Company for, inter alia, tbe following years: 1933 — $40,-048.00; 1934 — $32,313.00; 1935 — $28,854.00. This makes an average of $33,738.33 for each year, or an average of $2,811.50 for each month. We find that by tbe plaintiff’s cancellation of tbe agency contract with defendant Johnston and Harder, Inc. without giving tbe required notice defendant was damaged to tbe extent of the loss of one month’s net profits, or $2,811.50. We: will also allow interest on this sum from February 3, 1936,- at tbe rate of <em>SV2 % </em>per annum. Damages for the detention of money under tbe circumstances here present should be measured by what tbe money so detained would probably have produced if it had been paid to those entitled to it. (See our discussion of this question of damages for detention in <em>Kenin’s Trust Estate No. 1, </em><a href="/pa/343/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="343 Pa. 549" data-case-ids="1208350" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0549-01">343 Pa. 549</a>, at 564.) At p. 560, sec. 71, C.J.S. states this “general <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>rule”: “The measure of compensatory damages is such sum as will compensate the person injured for the loss sustained, with the least burden to the wrongdoer consistent with the idea of fair compensation.”</p>
    <p id="b578-4" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[218,465,1149,1014]]]'>Johnston and Harder, Inc. also took an appeal in this case to No. 183, March Term 1943. It claims .in its appeal that the amount which the court below awarded it “is only a fraction of the amount placed thereon by the uncontradicted testimony of all the witnesses testifying to value”. The appellant defendant’s fundamental error as to valuation is that for the opposing party’s breach of its promise to give the defendant thirty days’ notice of the termination of its agency, the defendant demands as damages what the agency would be worth to a prospective purchaser (1) if the agency had been legally assured of a long tenure and (2) if the defendant guaranteed the purchaser that it would not compete with it in the same field. Its own witness McKelvey, who testified that the agency “as a going concern, had a sale value on February 3,1936, of $90,0.00.”, stated on cross-examination, as above noted, that “you wouldn’t pay a nickel for the business if the owner is going to continue in the same business”.</p>
