The petition averred that nine days after such oral agreement decedent did execute his will, wherein the foregoing bequest was made. It also stated that appellant performed her contract for a period of over two years, when decedent, of his own accord, left the home of appellant. Decedent subsequently revoked his early will, and a later one, without such provision, has been probated. The executor of the estate filed an answer to appellant’s petition raising questions of law.</p>
    <p id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[135,1137,1158,1079]]]'>The relief sought was properly denied by the learned court below. Appellant relies on an <em>oral </em>contract to devise lands and to be enforcible, it must comply with the statute of frauds. A will may constitute supporting evidence of an oral contract and therefore comply with the statute: <em>Brinker v. Brinker, </em><a href="/pa/7/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="957894" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0053-01">7 Pa. 53</a>; <em>Smith v.

However, <em>a will which makes no reference to the contract does not satisfy the statute: Sorber v. Masters et al., </em><a href="/pa/264/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="264 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="1048501" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0582-01">264 Pa. 582</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20A.%20892" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="107 A. 892">107 A. 892</a>. In that case Justice Moschzisker, later Chief Justice, wrote (page 588): “. . . while an alleged will of plaintiff, produced at the trial, shows two of the farms devised to her sons, the document makes no reference whatever to any special consideration for such devises, and shows no connection between these testamentary dispositions and the bargain, or contract, averred by defendants; it is an ordinary will, subject to be revoked at any time before testator’s decease, which, as a written memorandum, fails to satisfy the requirements of the statute of frauds.”</p>

Moreover, the words of the clause are as consistent with a conditional gift as they are with the confirmation of the alleged oral agreement. Any attempt to connect, by parol, the written clause of this will with an alleged oral agreement is precisely 'what the Statute of Frauds prevents. ■ ■</p>
