The burden of either coming forward with defensive evidence of a convincing character or suffering an adverse verdict then shifted to the defendant. The defense offered was that the wreck which caused the derailment of the train was due exclusively to sabotage. This proof of sabotage was not controverted. Seventeen witnesses who examined the track at the place of derailment at periods varying from a few minutes after the wreck to an hour or more thereafter, testified that they found lying in the middle of the track on which the train had been running a loose rail, in a position parallel to the tracks, and with its west end immediately opposite the east end of the last rail remaining in place, and that this loose rail showed unmistakable evidence, inherent in the surrounding physical, conditions, of having been deliberately removed from its former position by some agency in no way connected with the defendant company. The facts which tended to show that the rail had been deliberately misplaced were “clean and even” bolt holes, clean spike holes at the point of the rail’s original location, marks of scraping along the other edge of the base of the rail as it lay on its side, “the batter on the west end”, indicating that it had been partially loosened before the passage of the next preceding train, and the finding in a location directly opposite to their normal position in the track of the undamaged angle bars, spikes and bolts as well as the finding, in the same location, of the claw bar and wrench with which the loose rail had obviously been removed. Five witnesses testified to circumstances which clearly indicated that the displaced rail had been removed prior to the wreck. All this uncontradicted oral testimony if credited showed that the derailment <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>was caused by the malicious removal of a rail by unknown felons.</p>

Whether the evidence offered by the defendant sustained its position, that it used due care, and that it properly inspected and oversaw its roadway, was a question which could be determined only as a factual one by a jury.” Our decision is that while the testimony offered by the defendant was uncontradicted, the credibility of the testifiers was for the jury, and under our established procedure the entry of judgment for the defendant n. o. v. was error.</p>

It is properly applied “when with the certainty of an infallible mathematical test applied to the testimony of a witness, he is found to be mistaken in a material matter, it would be a travesty upon justice to allow a jury to consider such testimony and a license to them to render a false, instead of a true finding . . <em>Bornscheuer v.

It is customarily applied in those actions in trespass where the testimony of a plaintiff (or in his behalf) would carry the case to the jury if it was not completely discredited by some <em>physical fact </em>introduced into the case with mathematical certainty or open to visual inspection or both. This rule appears to be invoked successfully only in support of a challenge to plaintiff’s freedom from contributory negligence. It was so invoked in the following three cases cited by the appellee: <em>Hawk v. Pennsylvania R.

The “physical facts” Avhich the railroad company relied upon in this case, such as the condition of the displaced rail and the pulled out spikes, were facts <em>which were testified to by witnesses. </em>Before the jury could accept the statements made by these witnesses, they had to credit them. It is true that the jury could inspect the rail and the spikes produced by the defendant, but that these were the very physical things whose displacement by human hands caused the wreck of defendant’s train depended on the truthfulness of the witnesses who vouched for them. In a “grade crossing” case, the map showing the distance for which a clear view may be had has to be made and vouched for by a witness but if the map is erroneous that fact is easily demonstrable by the opposing party; he can also ask that the tribunal view the locus of the accident and “see for itself” the physical situation.</p>

These proofs, however conclusive, did not take away from the jury its immemorial function of returning a verdict.

Wigmore on Evidence (3d Ed. Vol. 9, sec. 2487, p. 278), says: “Each party must first with his evidence pass the gauntlet of the judge; . . .

This presumption was “a conclusion based upon the generally known results of wide human experience” (quoting the language of the <em>Watkins </em>case). This presumption cast upon the defendant, if it wished to forestall a verdict in plaintiffs’ favor, the burden of producing evidence to neutralize the inference which the jury in the absence of countervailing evidence would draw legitimately from the evidence produced by the plaintiff. As Thayer says in his “Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law” (page 339) : “The essential character and operation of presumptions, so far as the law of evidence is concerned, is in all cases the same. . . . They throw upon the party against whom they work the duty of going forward with the evidence, and this operation is all their effect, regarded merely in their character as presumptions.”</p>

This evidence rested largely on oral testimony and the genuineness of the physical exhibits was attested by the same kind-of testimony. All this made the case one whose submission to the jury was required. The judicial remedy for the jury’s capricious disregard of this evidence was a setting aside of the verdict and the granting of a new trial. Instead of doing this, the court entered that judgment for the defendant n. o. v., from which this appeal was taken. The Act of April 22, 1905, P. S. 286, gives the reviewing tribunal the right upon such appeal to “enter such judgment as shall be warranted by the evidence. . . .”</p>
