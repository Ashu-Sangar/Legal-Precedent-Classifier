She directed payment of her debts and funeral expenses; devised one piece of real estate to Edna and another to Viola; by the fifth item she bequeathed her <em>residuary per</em>

By the sixth clause, the <em>residuary real estate </em>was devised to three named trustees, of whom the appellant is the surviving trustee. This item is the only one in question. Its applicable words are as follows: “Said property is to be sold as soon as it can be sold without sacrificing the same, and the proceeds, . . . are to be divided between my two daughters, share and share alike; provided, however, that the then living lawful issue of either daughter shall take their Mother’s share in the event of her death, . . . Until said real property is sold I direct that the said Trustees shall manage the same, collect the rents and distribute the net proceeds monthly between my two daughters, share and share alike; provided, however, that the then living lawful issue of either daughter shall take their Mother’s share in the event of her death. . . .” By item eight she directed : . In the event the provisions of my Will are questioned, and it is legally determined that the disposition of property hereinabove set forth is not in accordance with the law, then I give, devise and bequeath all of my property, of every kind, whether received from my late husband or not, to my two daughters absolutely. . .</p>

She was survived by her husband (appellee) who was bequeathed her entire estate and named as executor. Appellee petitioned for, and secured, an order upon appellant (his wife’s surviving sister) as surviving testamentary trustee under her mother’s will, for an accounting of the rents from the trust of the residuary real estate.

She contended that her brother-in-law possesses no interest in the trust. Appellant maintains that her deceased sister, who died <em>after </em>the death of testatrix without issue, possessed but a <em>contingent </em>interest, which lapsed because of her death without issue before the proceeds were realized and distributed, and which under Section 15 (c) of the Wills Act of 1917, P.

The question is one of substance and not of form. Such intent must be gathered from the <em>entire will. </em>The inquiry is not restricted to the particular words in which the gift is made. Thus in <em>McClure’s Appeal, </em>infra, the bequest was to the widow for life and upon her death . . my real estate to be sold and equally divided amongst my nephews and nieces. , , ,” It was held that the remain<a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>ders were <em>vested </em>because it was <em>“manifest from the whole face of the will” </em>that a division upon the widow’s death was <em>not </em>intended to be a <em>condition precedent to vesting </em>but was merely a postponement of the time fixed for enjoyment.

Neither can such gift be <em>implied </em>therefrom. True a gift of income without limit of time is an absolute vested bequest of the corpus itself: <em>McKinstry’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/296/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="296 Pa. 185" data-case-ids="1116703" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0185-01">296 Pa. 185</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.%20806" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="145 A. 806">145 A. 806</a>; <em>Estate of Henry Osborn, </em><a href="/pa-super/88/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="88 Pa.

But the gift in this will <em>is </em>limited in time. The income was given only <em>ciuntil said real property is sold’’. </em>Furthermore, it is provided that if a daughter dies, her share is to be paid to her “then living lawful issue”. Thus such payment of income to a daughter is only to be continued until the real estate is sold, and pending such sale, is limited to the <em>life </em>of the daughter.</p>
    <p id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[118,1865,1153,540]]]'>However, from a careful consideration of the language of the entire will, we are convinced that the court beloAV correctly concluded that testatrix’s deferments in distribution was <em>not intended to operate as a condition precedent to vesting. </em>The estates bequeathed to the daughters, as above indicated, were vested, subject to be divested should either die leaving issue after the death of testatrix but before the real estate \vas sold and the proceeds divided.

Furthermore, <em>the absence of a gift over </em>upon the decease of a daughter without leaving issue is an indication of vesting, especially if intestacy would result: <em>Mc-Cauley’s Est., </em>supra, at 381. It is likewise significant that in disposing of her residuary <em>personal estate </em>testatrix passed an <em>absolute vested estate </em>to her two daughters in the event that they survived her — as they did.</p>
