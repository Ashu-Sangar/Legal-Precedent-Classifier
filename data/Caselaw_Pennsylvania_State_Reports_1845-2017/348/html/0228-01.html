It appears most plain that under this language the gift of such income <em>was </em>for a limited period, viz: <em>the natural lives </em>of the wife and son. “The whole of the said one half” obviously refers to the last-mentioned half of the net income which was to be paid to the wife or son for life, and not to any part of the undivided <em>res. </em>(b) the trustees had active duties to perform. They were empowered to sell and convey the real estate, exchange investments, pay debts of the settlor, and pay part of the principal to settlor and his wife, (c) we decided in <em>Schuldt v. Reading Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/292/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="292 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1109637" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0327-01">292 Pa. 327</a>, 332, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.%20152" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="141 A. 152">141 A. 152</a>, that to warrant the implication of a fee from a devise of income, there must be a gift of <em>gross </em>as distinguished from <em>net </em>income.
