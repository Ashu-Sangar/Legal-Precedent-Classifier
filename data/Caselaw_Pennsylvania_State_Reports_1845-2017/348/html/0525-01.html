    <p id="b580-6" data-blocks='[["BL_580.8",580,[224,552,1153,1463]]]'>These appeals are taken from the refusal to grant a new trial or to enter judgment non obstante veredicto. On the morning of October 26, 1940, about 7:30 a.m., a coal truck owned by John Olivia and driven by his employee, Thomas Pagano, attempted to pass a two-ton G. M. O. truck owned by Harold Levan and driven by his employee, Ernest Schiele. Claude Parsons, another employee of Levan, was riding in this truck. Both these trucks were traveling easterly from Reading toward Boyertown over a 16-foot concrete highway which had shoulders four feet wide. The atmosphere was misty, but at or near the scene of the accident a pocket of dense fog lay over the road. Schiele was traveling about 35 miles an hour, but as he approached the fog pocket he reduced his speed and Pagano, driving a coal truck, attempted to pass to the left of Schiele. When Pagano was almost alongside of the G. M. C. truck driven by Schiele, and fully occupying the left lane of the highway in the direction they were traveling, the truck of the Motor Freight Express, Inc., driven by Holtzer, emerged from the fog. Pagano, driving the coal truck, turned to the left, went over the berm, and down into a field. Holtzer drove to his right, getting his right wheels on the berm, and after so proceeding for 36 feet, swerved back across the concrete highway onto the left side of the road and collided with the G. M. O. truck driven by Schiele, injuring Schiele and killing Parsons.</p>

He further states that as he came to the scene of the accident he met a somewhat heavier blanket of fog, he could not see more than 50 or 75 feet, and at that time he was going 25 to 30 miles an hour. He first saw the coal truck 50 to 75 feet from him and on his side of the highway. He states he never saw the G-. M. C. truck, driven by Schiele, yet no testimony ever places the coal truck in advance of the G. M. O. truck. To travel into a pocket of heavy fog with vision limited to 50 or 75 feet, driving a ten-ton truck and trailer carrying a load of six or seven tons and going at a speed of 25 to 30 miles an hour, would be sufficient evidence to submit to the jury, from which they might find the driver negligent. Such celerity of movement under the conditions which he describes could not be determined to be with due care: <em>Mason v. C. Lewis Lavine, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/302/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="302 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1129047" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0472-01">302 Pa. 472</a>, 477, <a href="/citations/?q=153%20A.%20754" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="153 A. 754">153 A. 754</a>. In driving his truck through a fog bank, which was clearly visible in advance, at a speed of 25 to 30 miles an hour, it must be held he was testing a manifest danger: <em>Janeway v. Lafferty Bros., </em><a href="/pa/323/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="323 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1169579" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0324-01">323 Pa. 324</a>, 328, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20827" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="185 A. 827">185 A. 827</a>. “Cautious movement in fog is required of motorists (as it always has been of navigators). To take ‘a leap in the dark’ is to invite self-injury or self-destruction. On the night of this unfortunate accident the plaintiff had been well aware of the presence of fog on the highway. Even though he characterized this as Tight fog’, he should nevertheless have proceeded with the utmost caution both from fog bank to fog bank and through them. * * * Eog is fog and its obseurative qualities are known to all individuals who possess even the slight amount of intelligence legally required to qualify one to drive an automobile on the public highways.”: <em>Shoffner v.

The whole of the court’s charge on this point must be considered, and therein it is pointed out that the driver of the truck must use such care as a reasonable driver is likely to use “in a sudden emergency”; that he was not ■necessarily negligent if “he showed bad judgment” or “did not do the thing which upon cool judgment after-wards might be seen to have been the best thing to have done.” The charge of the court covered the rule we have laid down, that “negligence cannot be imputed because of the failure to perform a duty so suddenly and unexpectedly arising that there is no opportunity to apprehend the situation and act according to the exigency” : <em>Eastburn v.

The doctor further testified that Schiele had three fractured ribs and a ruptured kidney, and that he gave “treatment, of course, to his left extremity, where he complained of a lot of weakness and pain, [which] continued even to the time that I last saw him.” This medical testimony was supplemented by proof that Schiele could no longer drive a truck on account of the weakened muscular condition of the abdomen which requires him to wear a belt. He now has a job as a janitor at considerable less pay than for the work he was doing before the accident. The trial judge charged: “He now has a rupture which may I believe call for an operation. I don’t think there was any testimony that he has an incurable rupture, but he does have a weakened muscular condition there which causes him to wear a belt and which was testified to by the doctor as existing, and there is evidence from which you may find that it has apparently caused him some loss of earning power.” In <em>McCaffrey v.
