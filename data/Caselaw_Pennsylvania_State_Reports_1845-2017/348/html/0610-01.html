The money came from illegal business conducted in violation of the then existing prohibition laws of the United States and of the Commonwealth. New Century Realty Company held title to the land, brewery buildings, plant and equipment situate at the northeast corner of 10th Street and Montgomery Avenue, Philadelphia, which it leased, in 1923, to Standard Brewing Company, a partnership. Two months later Standard Brewing Company assigned the lease to Atlantic Brewing Company, a corporation organized for the purpose of operating the brewery, and that Company also succeeded to the ownership and possession of all the assets and business of the partnership of Standard Brewing Company, which thereupon “entirely ceased the conduct and carrying on of any business and was terminated,” the partners who had constituted it becoming the stockholders of Atlantic Brewing Company. The unlawful brewery business was conducted from 1923 to November 2,1926, during which period Binenstock, “as agent or trustee”, received $173,-525, being rents payable to New Century Realty Company, and $782,399.01, being the net proceeds of the illegal sale of beer by the brewery. He has never accounted to anyone and retains the funds which “are without any <em>lawful </em>or <em>rightful </em>owner or owners.” The holder of a mortgage on the land, buildings and plant foreclosed it and bought in the property at sheriff’s sale in 1926; <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>thereafter neither Atlantic Brewing Company nor New Century Realty Company has conducted any business whatsoever. New Century Realty Company had held the title to the premises for the benefit of Atlantic Brewing Company, its own alleged stockholders being merely “strawmen” or “dummies”; no certificates of stock were ever actually issued to them or to anyone else. In 1926 the stockholders of Atlantic Brewing Company surrendered and assigned in blank to that Company the stock certificates which they had held therein, and all officers and directors resigned, so that thereafter there were no stockholders, officers or directors of Atlantic Brewing Company.</p>

    <p id="b667-3" data-blocks='[["BL_667.4",667,[135,419,1153,758]]]'>The learned court below sustained the objections and dismissed the petition for the following reason stated in its opinion: “. . . there is the fatal defect in the proceeding that the petition for the escheat is directed, at the instance of escheators, to a number of funds alleged to belong, as stated, to two different named corporations and a partnership. This cannot be done on petition of an escheator, but must be prosecuted ‘by action in the nature of a bill in equity by the Commonwealth under the direction of the Attorney General’ as provided by Section 7 of the Act of June 7, 1915, P. L. 878.

Pennsylvania Company, </em>to which the learned court referred, we said (page 518) that the Act of 1889 did not contemplate “. . . that the issues arising in a number of escheat proceedings concerning property of unrelated owners should be tried in a single suit.” But the petition has not stated a case of unrelated owners. The Petitioners aver that the partnership transferred all its assets to the corporation and “thereafter . . . was terminated.” That drops the partnership out of the case, and leaves for consideration the two corporations, Atlantic Brewing Company and New Century Realty Company. The petition shows that the activities of these two companies were united to accomplish a single purpose and for that reason are not within the rule announced in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Reno v. Pennsylvania Company. </em>Not only does the petition show that the two corporations constituted the legal equipment by which the unlawful business was conducted, but we have held that to be a fact which cannot now be ignored.

New Century Realty Co., </em><a href="/pa/304/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="304 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1132413" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0271-01">304 </a><a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a><a href="/pa/304/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="304 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1132413" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0271-01">Pa. 271</a>, 273, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.%20110" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="156 A. 110">156 A. 110</a>, it appeared that on November 2, 1926, Tucker and Binenstock were “. . . officers and sole stockholders of the New Century Realty Company . . . and they likewise owned the capital stock of the brewing company.” When, some years later, Tucker asked Binenstock to account, Binenstock defended on the ground of illegality. <em>Tucker v. Binenstock, </em><a href="/pa/310/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="310 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1144243" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0254-01">310 Pa. 254</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%20247" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="165 A. 247">165 A. 247</a>. In that case it was necessary to examine the relation of the two men to the two corporations; in denying relief to Tucker, we recognized, at page 262, that “. . . in the corporate landlord, and the operating corporation, [the brewing company] we have an absolute identity of parties in interest.”</p>
