The total was $133,175.27. The appellant replied that the statement was not in accord with its interpretation of the statute and objected that the registered taxes specified in the statement included penalties authorized by city ordinance that had been added to the taxes before they were registered as delinquent, and that appellant was entitled to a statement of the tax assessed for each year without addition of the penalties imposed by ordinance. The appellant then brought this mandamus proceeding to require the Receiver to comply with its request. The alternative writ issued and the Receiver moved to dismiss on the ground that the petition did not state a cause of action but, on the contrary, showed that defendant had complied with the Act.

L. 9, No. 10, 53 PS section 4924, imposing penalties and interest on the tax registered as delinquent. Did the legislature use the word “penalty” in the Act of 1943 as referring to the penalty imposed by the city ordinance plus the penalty imposed on delin<a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>quent taxes by tbe Act of 1883? In using tbe words “unpaid delinquent taxes,” the legislature knew that it had been decided that in Philadelphia taxes become delinquent on registration. It could of course change the definition by specifying another date when taxes should be considered delinquent for the purposes of the Act. The fact that the legislature abated both “penalties and interest” upon unpaid delinquent taxes, may indicate that it had in mind the Act of 1883 which imposes both penalties and interest and not the city ordinance because no interest on current taxes is provided for in Philadelphia during the taxable year. Additions or penalties imposed by the ordinance may be regarded as having become part of the current tax.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The argument then proceeds that the words “delinquent taxes” include all taxes to which a penalty <em>has been added </em>either by ordinance or by the Act of 1883. To reach that conclusion the words of the definition must be changed so that they read: For the purposes Of this act a tax shall be deemed to <em>have become </em>delinquent on the date when a penalty <em>was attached </em>to the tax. We cannot make that change in the phraseology used by the legislature. It gives a retrospective operation <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>to tlie phrase “when a penalty attaches to the tax.” The Receiver contends that the words were used prospectively to require the taxpayer, during the future five-year period, to pay his current taxes before a penalty attaches for delinquency thereafter occurring. He also contends that, as the Act required him to furnish a statement of all penalties and interest imposed <em>upon </em>unpaid delinquent taxes, the provision could not have been intended to apply to the ordinance penalties which had become part of the current tax, due at the time of registration as delinquent; that such penalties were not imposed <em>upon </em>delinquent taxes but were included <em>in </em>current taxes as registered; that the provision was intended to condition the immediately preceding privilege of paying the delinquent taxes in five annual installments. This condition is that “the respective current taxes . . . levied . . . for the years subsequent to the year 1943 during such installment periods shall be paid before they become delinquent”; or, stated in other words, the taxpayer may not allow current taxes to be registered as delinquent during any of the five years. The Receiver’s interpretation gives full effect to the words of the sentence as relating to the time of paying the current tax during the five years, and fully accords with the context; in fact, without some explanation of the word “delinquent,” as used at the end of the preceding sentence, the time of paying the current taxes during the specified period might have been regarded as uncertain. The provision in question completes or supplements the expression of the conditions prescribed in the immediately preceding sentences.</p>
