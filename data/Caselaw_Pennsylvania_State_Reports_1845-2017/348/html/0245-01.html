Lessee hereby, in consideration of the rent herein specified, accepts and assumes such responsibility and liability . . .” This covenant is valid and enforceable. “It is a contract be<a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>tween persons conducting a strictly private business and relates entirely to their personal and private affairs, and so cannot be opposed to public policy”: <em>Cannon v.

    <p id="b299-3" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[178,487,1151,752]]]'>Appellant bases its right of recovery entirely upon Clause 17 of the lease which provides: “Lessee hereby releases Lessor from all liability for damages which.may arise from any kind of injury to any person^ persons or property on account of the use, misuse or abuse of all or any elevators, hatches or openings of any kind whatsoever that may exist or hereafter be erected or constructed on the said premises or from any kind of injury that may rise from any other cause on the said premises, unless such damage, injury, use, misuse, or abuse be caused by or result from the negligence of Lessor or. its agents ...”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It relies upon the latter portion of the clause which it says is sufficiently broad to cover all negligence on the part of the lessor.</p>

Clause 16 provides for damage resulting from water in any manner.. Clause 17 provides .for damage or injury resulting from the use or misuse of elevators, hatches, or openings of any .kind whatsoever. Since lessee has contracted to assume all responsibility and liability arising from damage as. a <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>result of water it is bound by its covenant and cannot now seek to impose that liability upon tbe lessor. “Where the language is plain and unambiguous, the rights of the parties must be determined by the provisions of the instruments wherein they committed their agreement to writing”: <em>Musselman v.
