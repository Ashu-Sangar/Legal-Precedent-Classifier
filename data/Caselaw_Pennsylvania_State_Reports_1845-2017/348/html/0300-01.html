Other legal proceedings followed — a habeas corpus action in which Michael sought custody of their children, a suit in replevin brought by Mary to recover some household goods, and an action, also by Mary, to obtain support for the children. In connection with this last proceeding a hearing was had in the court of quarter sessions at which both parties were present, and a support order was made. After Mary left the courtroom Michael followed and shot and killed her as she reached the front steps of the building. He was tried and convicted of first-degree murder and the jury affixed the penalty of death. The verdict was amply justified by the evidence, the only defense offered, that of insanity, being wholly unconvincing.</p>

It is true that a complaint or information must contain all the essential elements of the offense sought to be charged, <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>and, if it fails in this respect, it is not sufficient that the indictment supply them, because a defendant should not be required to answer a charge different from, and unrelated to, the one for which he was arrested and held to bail.

This was vigorously opposed on the ground that it would be impossible, by reason of the animosities engendered in the litigation between defendant and his wife, for such private counsel to participate in the trial with the fairness and high sense of responsibility required of a prosecuting attorney as a quasi-judicial officer. The court, however, granted the permission requested, and private counsel assisted the district attorney to some extent in the examination of witnesses, but he conducted himself in a manner which admittedly conformed to all ethical requirements and there is nothing in the record to indicate <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>that he said or did anything during the course of the trial which in any way prejudiced defendant’s rights.

His counsel found fault <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>with this proceeding on the ground that it constituted a violation of defendant’s constitutional right not to be compelled to give evidence against himself. While the exact question thus presented has apparently not been ruled upon by either of our appellate courts, it has arisen in many other jurisdictions, and these have quite uniformly held that the constitutional immunity from self-incrimination does not apply to a compulsory examination to determine the prisoner’s physical or mental condition for the purpose of testifying in regard thereto, provided, of course, that he be not compelled to answer any questions propounded to him by those making the examination.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The purpose of the constitutional provision is to prohibit the compulsory oral examination of the prisoner either before or at trial, — to prevent his being required to incriminate himself by speech or the equivalent of speech: <em>Commonwealth v.

As defendant in the present instance refused to convérse with the alienists, but merely kept repeating to them that he wanted to see his counsel, the result was that no worthwhile examination could be made or testified to at the trial, so that the question raised as to defendant’s rights under such circumstances is largely theoretical.</p>
    <p id="Aqq9" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[168,857,1159,1032]]]'>Defendant said on the witness-stand that he loved his wife and children and had instituted the habeas corpus proceeding to gain custody of his children because of his affection for them. The district attorney, in cross-examination, asked him whether the real purpose was not “so that you wouldn’t have to go into the Army of the United States.” Defendant’s motion to withdraw a juror was overruled. It is argued that this was a viola-, tion of his rights under the Act of March 15,1911, P. L. 20, which provides that a defendant shall not be asked any question tending to show that he has committed some other offense. That act is not relevant, for defendant was not guilty of a criminal offense in seeking possession of his children even though his motive in doing so may have been to escape the draft. Since he tried to establish before the jury that his feeling toward his family was one of affection, it was permissible for the Commonwealth to refute this by attempting to show that he was actuated by a selfish and not a loving motive.</p>
