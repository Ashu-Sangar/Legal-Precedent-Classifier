The appellant owns a dwelling house at 1306 Bedford Avenue in that district and ward. It contains eight rooms, four of them being bedrooms. It is occupied permanently by James Suriano, his wife, two young sons and two young daughters. The children range in age from one year to nine years. Suriano gets ‘-‘rent free” but he maintains the home and the contracts for gas and for electricity are in his name. It is conceded that at this address the appellant resided all his life up to 1930. He claims that this has been his legal residence since 1930 also, except for a brief period when he resided in a hotel. He never voted from any other residence. In 1930 he purchased a home in Mount Lebanon Township, where, so he testified, his children had lived “practically all their time.” He has domestic help there but has none at the Bedford Avenue house. Mrs. Suriano manages <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>the latter home and Stabile and his wife are privileged to sleep, dine and entertain in that home whenever they choose to do so.</p>

Lebanon and that since 1930 he has attempted to maintain a “voting residence” at 1306 Bedford Avenue, Pittsburgh. <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>The Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, sec. 704, declares that “the place where the family of a married man or woman resides shall be considered and held to be his or her place of residence, except where the husband and wife have actually separated and live apart” . . . Stabile and his wife have <em>not </em>separated and do <em>not </em>live apart. They and their family are a unit and their only family home is in Mt. Lebanon. Stabile calls his Mt. Lebanon home his “summer home,” but his three children reside there <em>all the year around </em>and go <em>to </em>school from that home. There is the only place where this family “keeps house”, as Mrs. Stabile’s testimony indicates. The Bestatement of Conflict of Laws, Sec. 13, declares as follows: “A home is a dwelling place of a person, distinguished from other dwelling places of that person by the intimacy of the relation between the person and the place.” Sec. 13, comment g, “When a person has his family living with him in a dwelling-place, it is strong evidence that the dwelling-place is his home.” By every test laid down by the law this appellant’s home in Mt. Lebanon township is his <em>legal residence.</em>

An individual’s legal residence is a question of fact which the state has a paramount interest in determining. A voter can vote only where his legal residence is; he can hold public office only if he resides in the political division his office serves. For example, the TJ. S. Constitution declares that a member of Congress must be an inhabitant of the state in which he shall be chosen and our State Constitution declares that a judge of the court of Common Pleas must reside in the district for which he shall be elected. The Pennsylvania Election Code of 1937, P. L. 1333, at page 1362, declares as one of the prerequisites of the right to vote in any election district, the following (Art. 7, sec. 701 (3)) : “He or she shall have resided in the election district where he or she shall offer <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>to vote at least two months immediately preceding the election.” For purposes of certain kinds of taxation, particularly inheritance taxes, each state has a vital interest in the question of the legal residence of the person on whom or on whose estate the tax is to be levied. The <em>fact </em>of any person’s residence, for any legal purpose, whether for voting, or for holding office, or for taxation, has never been determined merely by that person’s “say so”. In determining that question the state brushes aside all colorable pretences and finds the reality behind the guise.</p>

We said: “It is clear that appellant wished to make his family home in the ninth ward yet retain a legal residence in the seventh ward. But the actuality of a man’s residence is often better determined by his conduct than by his words”. In <em>Fry’s Election Case, </em><a href="/pa/71/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="71 Pa. 302" data-case-ids="1031286" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0302-01">71 Pa. 302</a>, this court quoted with approval from Story’s Conflict of Laws, sec. 41, as follows: “By the term ‘domicil’ in its ordinary acceptation, is meant the place where a person lives or has his home. In a strict legal sense that is properly the domicil of a person where he has his true, fixed, permanent home and principal establishment, and to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning.” Justice Agnew added: “The term residence [as used in the Constitution] . . . means the place where the elector makes his permanent or true home, his principal place of business, and <em>his family residence, </em>if he have one.” (Italics supplied.)</p>

Dorrance, the decedent, was Pennsylvania, though he owned a home in New Jersey which he occasionally occupied and where he had previously legally resided, and where he maintained some household servants. He had continued to receive his personal mail at a New Jersey post office, paid a poll tax in that state until his death and he and his wife voted in that state. He maintained church affiliations in New Jersey. In the will he declared New Jersey to be the state of his domicile and during his life-time he made many declarations to the same effect. We held that these facts could not prevail against the fact that his family life centered in his Pennsylvania residence, that <em>most </em>of his household servants were on duty at that residence, that the expenses of the household in Pennsylvania greatly exceeded those of the New Jersey residence, that Dorrance’s children made the Pennsylvania home the center of their social activities and they “were entered in schools” as residents of Pennsylvania; Mrs. Dorrance’s accounts with merchants and department stores carried the address of his Pennsylvania residence; all of which we adjudged to be proof that the Dorrance residence in Pennsylvania was “the principal residence and main establishment of the family” and that the tax on the Dorrance estate was therefore collectible by Pennsylvania. We declared that Dorrance’s affiliations with his New Jersey house were merely to “give color to his asserted intention to retain New Jersey as the place of his domicile”, and we declared further that the “expressions of a man to the effect that he desires to retain a domicile of choice” in one place cannot prevail over acts which indicate that another abode “is [his] the principal residence and establishment”. In other words, we decided that the “home” where a man’s family life centered was his legal residence.</p>

There his young children, with whom he and his wife <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>stand in intimate relation, spend the entire year. From that home they go to school in the morning. To that home they return from school at night. For that home only, family groceries are purchased. In that home alone does Mrs. Stabile cook for her family. In that home only are family dinners served. The Bedford Avenue home in Pittsburgh is the home of another family, the Suriano family, where Suriano and his wife and child center their domestic life. When Stabile and his wife come to <em>that </em>home they come as they would come to a lodging house where they have the right to sleep and to eat and to entertain friends. It is not their permanent home, their place of domestic abode. It is a place where they are only transients, exactly as they would be at a hotel where they had similar privileges.</p>

Four states: Texas, Florida, New York and Massachusetts each claimed that the inheritance tax on Mr. Green’s property should be paid to it. The opinion of the court was written by Justice, now Chief Justice, Stone. The following excerpts from Justice Stone’s opinion apply in principle to the instant case: “If declarations were alone sufficient to establish domicile, the record Avould leave no doubt that Green was domiciled in Texas until the time of his death.” “Mrs. Green . . . asserted . . . that Texas was the domicile of herself and her husband”. “. . . When he [Green] had established himself there [Massachusetts] all the circumstances of his life indicated that his real attitude and intention with respect to his residence there were to make it his principal home or abiding place to the exclusion of others . . .” “. . . His conception of legal residence or domicile as a mental state whereby he could obtain certain political advantages and freedom from taxation does not weigh against this conclusion.
