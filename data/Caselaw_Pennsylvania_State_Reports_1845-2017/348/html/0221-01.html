    <p id="b274-4" data-blocks='[["BL_274.4",274,[224,598,1154,1675]]]'>Appellant had driven his car from SewickLey with his wife, her sister and their parents, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart, as guest passengers, to their home, on Route 258, in Butler County, arriving about 11.30 P.M. This highway, at the point in question, extends north and south and was surfaced with what a witness called “black-top macadam” to a width of twenty-four feet. The Stewart property abuts on the highway but the house is a short distance from the east side of it. Twentier stopped at a point opposite the house, his car facing south, lights on. The evidence of plaintiffs was to the effect that he parked off the paved surface; McGarvey testified the car was on the paved surface.' Twentier and his guests alighted and all the Stewarts except the plaintiff, Margaret, went in the house. Mr. Stewart returned to the car with a lantern to furnish light while Twentier ascertained whether his car needed oil. While that was in process, Stewart holding the lantern, and Margaret Stewart standing beside them, McGarvey approached from the south. Instead of continuing northward on the highway (there was ample room for the purpose, as two other cars had passed) and keeping Twentier’s car on his, McGarvey’s right side, McGarvey ran off the highway and in attempting to pass Twentier’s car on his left, struck the Stew-arts' and TwCntier, killing Mr. Stewart and' injuring Miss Stewart. His car came to rest on a bank in front of a pole off the highway. Twentier’s car was very slightly damaged and was used immediately to obtain assistance. The verdict against McGarvey, who has not appealed, establishes his negligence and the Stewarts’ freedom , from contributory negligence.</p>

The appellees contend the verdict establishes that the car was parked on the highway in violation of the Motor Vehicle Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> If this were a suit by Twentier against McGarvey we should be required to discuss the contention; we lay it aside as unimportant in determining whether there is evidence of actionable breach of duty owing by Twentier to the Stewarts, which is the question raised by these appeals.</p>
