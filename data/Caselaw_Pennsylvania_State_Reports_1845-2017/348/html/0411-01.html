Of late years it was always inimical, she was always demanding more money and running overdue accounts, unpaid bills. It was impossible for me to keep her supplied with money, until finally I came to the end, after repeated warnings by letter. I asked her please to do certain things that anybody would ask, to send me receipted bills, and to give me estimates of things that had to be done, and she didn’t see fit to do that.

In many ways. On one occasion I remember quite well, she told me it was up to me, and my duty, to give her $10,000 a year, and she intended to make me do so; and when I said no, I wouldn’t do it, she threw herself on the floor and screamed, and threatened <em>‘I </em>will make you give me $10,000 a year.’ Q.

If an officer has private means entitling his family to maintain an establishment requiring greater expenditure than his government pay will support, he should of course supply the difference, but defendant has at present no other income from which to make any such additional provision.

The difficulties of marketing future interests, not certain of enjoyment such as defendant’s are equally well known. The forced sale might be disastrous, not only to him but to plaintiff and their children. It is well known that purchasers of, or lenders on the security of, such interests require life insurance as collateral security. Even if Jones could get temporary leave for the purpose of looking after the sale or pledge of his interests, the duties of his Naval service would prevent furnishing standard life insurance as security; he could only furnish policies restricted in consequence of his hazardous occupation. At the present time Commander Jones, as well as his wife and children, should not be subjected to risks of almost certain loss incident to the execution proposed by the decree. We must assume that he will comply with the order because counsel will doubtless advise him that default may be followed by supplementary proceedings ultimately resulting in execution against his interests in the trusts.
