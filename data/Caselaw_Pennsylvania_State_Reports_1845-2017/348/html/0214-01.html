It represented one-half of the amount which claimant admittedly advanced to purchase a mortgage secured upon the real estate owned jointly by decedent and her daughter. Decedent had been the wife of one MeKim who died leaving a substantial estate, in trust, for his widow (this decedent) and their daughter. Decedent elected to take against her husband’s will. She was awarded one-half of the estate absolutely. The other half was thereupon held in trust for the daughter, for life, with remainder to the daughter’s issue. Among the assets of the estate was a piece of real estate upon which was secured a first mortgage of $25,000. The mortgagee <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>demanded payment. Decedent and tlie trustee for the daughter were unable to meet the obligation. Claimant thereupon paid the amount of the mortgage and took an assignment therefor. Subsequently claimant assigned the mortgage as collateral for his own individual loan. Later claimant paid off the loan but directed the satisfaction of the mortgage. The reason assigned by claimant for the satisfaction of the mortgage was “he wanted to be relieved of paying taxes on the loan. It was a family matter”. Decedent later executed her will, in which she bequeathed one-half of her estate to her husband (the claimant) absolutely, and named him as the executor of her estate. The other half of her estate, decedent placed in trust, naming a corporate trustee, for the benefit of her daughter for life, with remainder to her issue, or, in default thereof, to her brothers and sisters and their issue.</p>
    <p id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[194,1207,1150,315]]]'>When the claimant (appellant) filed his account, he presented a claim at the audit for <em>one-half </em>of the $25,000. which he had advanced to purchase the mortgage which he later satisfied. He also claimed interest from the date of the satisfaction to the date of the death of the decedent, which amounted to $12,812.50.</p>

There was also testimony by decedent’s attorney. The auditing judge found as a fact that the claimant had abandoned his claim against his wife and her daughter’s trust estate when he satisfied the mortgage. He also ruled that the evidence relating to any claim or revival thereof, in whole or part, against this estate was not sufficiently definite, precise and certain to sustain an award.</p>

He stated that he had no knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding its subsequent satisfaction. He did, however, testify that decedent told him “this was an obligation that had not been taken care of”. - He also said, and with some significance, “It doesn’t strike me now that those conversations establish a claim”.</p>

Appellant maintains that the court below was without authority to appoint a trustee ad litem, since a testamentary trustee and guardian had been named in the will and was functioning. Although appellant possessed no interest in the testamentary trust, we are of opinion that appellant has the status to question the propriety of the trustee ad litem’s appointment since the latter successfully interposed objection to the allowance of appellant’s claim.</p>

Claimant was decedent’s executor. The testamentary trustee was entrusted with the care of one half the estate. No inventory was filed by the executor for over two years after probate of the will and no account until over two months thereafter. There was a tremendous difference in value between what this decedent inherited in 1924 and what this appellant accounted for in 1942; no effort was made by the trustee to require an accounting by the executor and no explanation was made for its failure so to do; the testamentary trustee was the executor of the estate of decedent’s first husband ; the attorney witness was the attorney for the late husband’s estate and was also the attorney for this estate, until his withdrawal in order to testify; the other witnesses were relatives of decedent and interested in the estate; all were friendly to claimant; the record does not disclose exactly how the testamentary trustee participated in the loan, mortgage and satisfaction by claimant, but counsel in his brief states (p. 30) “. . . the testimony disclosed that the Trustee was present at the time the indebtedness was incurred, knew of the facts and circumstances surrounding it, and knew that the loan to the Testatrix had never been repaid”. Allowance of the claim would absorb almost the entire estate.
