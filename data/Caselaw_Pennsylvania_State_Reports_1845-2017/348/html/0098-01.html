    <p id="b151-6" data-blocks='[["BL_151.9",151,[128,642,1154,309]]]'>This is an appeal from the refusal of the court below to declare void a Certificate of Occupancy issued by the Superintendent of the Bureau of Building Inspection of the City of Pittsburgh, permitting the use and occupancy of a certain dwelling as a synagogue and a residence for the Rabbi.</p>
    <p id="b151-7" data-blocks='[["BL_151.10",151,[127,973,1154,805]]]'>On November 13,1942, the Superintendent of the Bureau of Building Inspection, acting pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Pittsburgh, issued a Certificate of Occupancy to the Kahal Chasidim Congregation authorizing the use of premises No. 5807 Bartlett Street as a synagogue and as a residence for the Rabbi and his family. The premises are situate in a class “B” residential district. An appeal was filed by Berthold Floersheim and others, appellants, with the Board of Adjustment. After public hearings on the appeal, the Board refused to revoke said certificate. Appeal was taken to the Court of Common Pleas, where the Kahal Chasidim Congregation was permitted to intervene. The decision of the Board of Adjustment was affirmed. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b151-8" data-blocks='[["BL_151.11",151,[127,1798,1151,205]],["BL_152.1",152,[222,262,1150,156]]]'>The Zoning Ordinance classifies residential districts in classes “A”, “B”, and “C”. Section 9 of said Ordinance enumerates the permitted uses of land in class “B”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The uses here involved are for a “One Family Dwell<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>ing” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and for a “Church”. Appellants contend that a Certificate of Occupancy cannot lawfully be issued which authorizes a combination of these permitted uses.</p>

The definition of a “One Family Dwelling” is broad.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> A building “designed for” one family may very readily be used as a “church”. Nowhere in the Ordinance is there an express limitation upon the powers of the Board which prevent it from permitting a combination of authorized uses. It cannot be said as a matter of law that the Board does not have that power. The courts will not interfere with the exercise of an administrative duty by the officials entrusted therewith unless it is shown that the action taken has been arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable or clearly in violation of positive law: <em>Jennings’ </em>Appeal, <a href="/pa/330/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="330 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1182961" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0154-01">330 Pa. 154</a>, 157; <em>Hasley’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa-super/151/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="151 Pa.
