For the reasons discussed below, we find that the arbitrator’s award satisfies this court’s circumscribed standard of review, the “essence test.” Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the arbitrator’s award.</p>
    <p id="b302-6" data-blocks='[["BL_302.7",302,[225,898,1160,628]]]'>On May 13, 1992, Judith Walter, a teacher who served the Danville Area School District (“School District”) for twenty-four years, notified the School District of her plan to retire, effective at the termination of the 1991-92 school year. Mrs. Walter’s decision to retire was evidently motivated by the General Assembly’s 1992 retirement incentive legislation which amended section 8302 of the Public School Employees’ Retirement Code (“Retirement Code”). 24 P.S. § 8302(b.2). This piece of legislation was colloquially termed the “Mellow Bill.” Specifically, the Mellow Bill was to inspire employees to retire by bestowing upon them an extra ten per cent of their credited service.</p>

This section provided those retirees with at least thirty “years of service in public education” with additional benefits which consisted of a lump sum payment and payment for continuation of hospitalization and medical services for an extended period of time. As Mrs. Walter’s years of service were tabulated to be only 28.9 years of service, she could not enjoy the enhanced benefits offered in section 18.01.</p>
    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[211,771,1155,514]]]'>Thereafter, on July 8, 1994, the Public School Employees’ Retirement System (“PSERS”) informed Mrs. Walter of subsequent legislation known as “Son of Mellow,” which amended the Mellow legislation and retroactively extended the retirement incentives contained in the Mellow Bill to former employees who had retired between May 15, 1992 and July 1, 1992. Based upon this act of the legislature, at least pursuant to the Retirement Code, Mrs. Walter was credited with over 30 years of service by PSERS, retroactive to her time of retirement.</p>
    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.6",303,[210,1316,1154,568]]]'>Based upon this new information, Mrs. Walter contacted the Superintendent of the School District and requested an adjustment to her retirement benefits under the collective bargaining agreement. According to Mrs. Walter, the School District had used the PSERS’ calculation of “years of service” rather than actual service time to compute eligibility for retirement benefits under section 18.01 of the agreement. Therefore, she was entitled to the section 18.01 benefits. This request was denied. As a result, Mrs. Walter filed a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement regarding her entitlement to the enhanced retirement benefits.</p>
    <p id="b303-6" data-blocks='[["BL_303.7",303,[211,1916,1155,467]],["BL_304.1",304,[230,344,1159,570]]]'>Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, the grievance was resolved through a three-step process that culminated in final and binding arbitration. Ultimately, a hearing was held before Arbitrator Scott E. Buchheit. At the center of the dispute between the parties was the meaning of the phrase “years of service in public education” found in Article XVIII, Section 18.01. The School District argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that this phrase meant actual years of service, i.e., time actually worked. Since Mrs. Walter had not actually worked thirty <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>years for the School District, she was not entitled to the additional retirement benefits found in section 18.01. Conversely, the Education Association, on behalf of Mrs. Walter, contended that the phrase “years of service” has included time beyond that actually spent in teaching and has included military service and maternity leave. Moreover, section 18.01 had always been interpreted to mean that the years of service would be the same as those years credited to an individual by the PSERS and that other teachers had received the retirement benefits under section 18.01 when the PSERS credited the individual with additional years of service.</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[227,938,1159,521]]]'>Arbitrator Buchheit, after considering the differing interpretations, found the phrase to be ambiguous and looked to the past practice of the parties to discern their intent as to the meaning of the provision. After finding that two other teachers had been credited for years of work outside of actual teaching time,, including one teacher who had service time credited under the original Mellow legislation, Arbitrator Buchheit concluded that Mrs. Walter should be entitled to additional retirement benefits offered under Article XVIII of the collective bargaining, agreement.</p>
    <p id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.6",304,[228,1482,1154,194]]]'>The School District appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Montour County. The trial court upheld the arbitrator’s award. The School District then appealed this decision to the Commonwealth Court.</p>

The primary reason for reversing the arbitrator’s award was the Commonwealth Court’s determination that use of the Son of Mellow amendments to calculate entitlement to the retirement benefits provided for in section 18.01 of the collective bargaining agreement violated the Pennsylvania Constitution’s, and the United States Constitution’s, prohibition against the impairment of contracts through retroactive legislation. According to the Commonwealth Court, the award constituted an unconstitutional impairment of contract because laws that are in effect at the time the parties entered into the <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>contractual relationship are merged with the rights and obligations of the parties as set forth in the agreement and cannot legally impair the contract.</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[202,527,1152,584]]]'>The Commonwealth Court also suggested that because the collective bargaining agreement did not expressly incorporate the Retirement Code into the collective bargaining agreement, the parties could not have intended to be bound by subsequent changes implemented by the PSERS pursuant to the Mellow amendments. The court deemed the arbitrator’s reference to the Retirement Code to be a unilateral modification of the collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the Commonwealth Court reversed the order of the trial court and vacated the arbitrator’s award. We granted the Education Association’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

Under this standard, an appellate court will first determine if the issue, as properly defined, is encompassed within the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. If so, the court will uphold the arbitrator’s award if the arbitrator’s interpretation may be rationally derived from the collective bargaining agreement. We made clear that the court does not inquire into whether the arbitrator’s decision is reasonable or even manifestly unreasonable; rather, the question is whether the award may in any way be rationally derived from the agreement between <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>the parties. <em>State System of Higher Education, </em><a href="/a2d/743/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="743 A.2d 405" data-case-ids="11487623,95778" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/0405-01,/pa/560/0135-01">743 A.2d at 413</a>.</p>

This intent was derived from the agreement, viewed in light of the School District’s past practice with respect to other similarly-situated employees. The arbitration award simply required the School District to treat Mrs. Walter the same as other bargaining unit members with regard to calculation of retirement benefits.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[236,840,1178,1363]]]'>The School District argues that these past actions were not typical or authorized by the School Board, and thus, they should not have been considered as past practice. These arguments, while forceful before an arbitrator, are largely lost before a reviewing court applying the essence test. The ■ School District fails to recognize that it is not an appropriate role for an appellate court to immerse itself into the fray and ' to reassess the. judgment 'of the arbitrator. True to the deferentiál essence test, we will merely see if the interpretation can in any way be rationally derived from the agreement. That is, we will see if the arbitrator applied the terms of the agreement and discerned the intent of the parties viewed in light of the language, its context and other indicia of the parties’ intent. The arbitrator considered the School District’s argument regarding past practice and rejected it, find-. ing that the School District’s prior actions dictated that Mrs. Walter be treated in the same manner. Moreover, the arbitrator noted that no evidence was offered as to a counter situation in which a teacher was denied Article XVIII benefits because the School District refused to recognize years of service credited to an individual by the PSERS. Finally, the arbitrator found that the Superintendent of the School District, the Board’s primary agent, authorized these increased retirement benefits. This is more than sufficient for our review. Thus, the arbitrator’s award satisfies the essence, test.</p>

In that case our court upheld an arbitrator’s award that arose from a grievance that was based upon the job security provisions of the Public School Code. In a savings clause, the collective bargaining agreement made reference to rights under the School Code and Act 195, but it did not expressly reference the School Code’s job security provisions. Our court determined that although the intention of the parties to incorporate the job security provisions was not clearly set forth in the agreement, and the parties had not expressly set forth reference to the job security provisions, the language employed was sufficient for the arbitrator to conclude that these provisions of the School Code were incorporated into the agreement. Based upon <em>Juniata-Mifflin, </em>the School District asserts that the Retirement Code must be expressly incorporated into the agreement to be given effect.</p>
    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[192,1219,1153,1055]]]'>
      <em>Juniata-Mifflin </em>is obviously distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>First, the grievance in <em>Juniata-Mifflin </em>was based solely upon the job security provisions found in the School Code. Thus, it was absolutely critical for the School Code to be expressly incorporated into the agreement for the grievance to be resolved by the arbitrator. Unlike the grievance in <em>Juniata-Mifflin, </em>in this case, the grievance was premised upon a provision in the collective bargaining agreement, viz., section 18.01. Moreover, it is of no moment that the collective bargaining agreement in this case does not expressly state that the parties intended that the Retirement Code govern calculation of retirement benefits pursuant to section 18.01. This is because the arbitrator found in considering the School District’s past practice that the District had <em>in fact </em>relied upon the Retirement Code to calculate benefits under section 18.01. As noted above, reliance upon past practice in the face of an ambiguous contract provision is not only permissible, but is an important tool through which an arbitrator may discover the intent of the parties. Thus, <em>Juniata-Mifflin </em>does not alter the result reached today.</p>

One reason an appellate court may give such deference to an <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>arbitrator’s award is that if an arbitrator’s interpretation is contrary to one party’s understanding of the agreement, at the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, the negotiating table will assume center stage and the agreement can be renegotiated to reflect the “true” intention of the party.

On appeal to the Commonwealth Court, the School District raised additional reasons why the arbitrator’s award should be vacated. First, the School District argued that Mrs. Walter had no standing on the basis that she was not an employee in the bargaining unit. Second, the School District contended that Mrs. Walter’s grievance was untimely. Finally, the School District submitted that the arbitrator’s award was manifestly unreasonable. As the Commonwealth Court found the arbitrator’s award to be violative of, <em>inter alia, </em>constitutional dictates, it did not address these issues.

He indicated that the agreement did not limit the grievance process to “employees” but permitted “persons” to initiate a grievance. Article VIII. Furthermore, the agreement specifically addressed retirement benefits and made reference to “retirees” in Article XVTII(c) of the agreement. Thus, the arbitrator concluded that Mrs. Walter had standing <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>to file a grievance. Applying the essence test, the arbitrator addressed an issue within the terms of the agreement and resolved the issue by applying the terms of the agreement.

    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[206,635,1156,955]]]'>Furthermore, according to the School District, the grievance was untimely. The arbitrator found that the grievance was not time-barred. Specifically, the arbitrator determined that Mrs. Walter did not receive formal notification from the School Board that the Article XVIII benefits that she sought were being denied until the letter to her dated July 15, 1994. Thereafter, the instant grievance was filed on July 25, 1994. The collective bargaining agreement required at step one that a grievance be filed “within seven (7) working days after its occurrence.” The arbitrator found that because there were four weekend “non-working” days between July 15 and July 25, it was apparent that the grievance was filed within the seven working day requirement. Again, the arbitrator addressed an issue covered by the agreement. He considered terms of the collective bargaining agreement, applied the facts of the case to these terms, and rendered his conclusion. Thus, applying the essence test, we are compelled to uphold the arbitrator’s determination.</p>

When parties agree to arbitrate disputes, surely they do not contemplate a circumstance where unreviewable, manifestly unreasonable decisions will result.
