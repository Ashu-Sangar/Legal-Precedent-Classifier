While we rejected this argument, we did not assess the burden that must be borne by a claimant seeking total disability benefits under these circumstances.

The claimant testified to and presented medical evidence regarding the deterioration of his physical condition; the medical testimony included the concession that the claimant had the ability to perform some forms of sedentary work; and no vocational or other evidence was offered to further demonstrate the effect of the deterioration of his physical condition upon his earning ability. The Commonwealth Court found that such evidence was insufficient to meet Section 413(a)’s requirement of increased disability (or loss of earning power), reasoning that the assessment of disability has a physical component (physical capacity to work) and a vocational one (availability of suitable employment), and mere deterioration of a claimant’s medical condition addresses only the first of these. <em>See Meden, </em>167 Pa.Cmwlth. at 72-73, <a href="/pa-commw/167/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="647 A.2d 620" data-case-ids="1466764,7867066" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/167/0068-01,/a2d/647/0620-01">647 A.2d at 623</a> (stating that “simply arguing that a claimant’s physical condition has changed without presenting evidence of its effect on his ability to work at his light duty job cannot satisfy a claimant’s burden of proof’).

On the other hand; Volk still had 123 weeks of eligibility for partial disability benefits, and he could have prevailed on his petition by establishing that the deterioration of his physical condition resulted in either total disability or that his earning power, although not reduced to zero, was now reduced more than it had been at the time that the [workers’ compensation judge] originally awarded him partial disability benefits. If Volk had made such a showing, he would have demonstrated that he was then presently partially disabled to a greater degree than he had been at the time he was originally awarded partial disability benefits and could have received partial disability benefits at a higher rate for the remainder of the 123 weeks.

Second, <em>Dillon </em>presents an attractive construct for application in the post-500-week setting, at a minimum presenting a logical starting point, since a claimant seeking modification after the expiration of the 500-week period certainly must prove at least as much as a claimant seeking modification within such period. <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>The <em>Dillon </em>standard, however, is designed with a degree of inherent flexibility that is inappropriate to the post-500-week setting, since <em>Dillon </em>will accommodate instances of increased partial disability that are not cognizable after the expiration of the 500-week period. Third, the post-500-week cases often involve occupational disease, where the disability is long-term and progressive, such that if the claimant is not now totally disabled, he may be in the future; thus, claimants will have an especially strong incentive to vigorously pursue their continuing entitlement, particularly in light of the three-year limitation on the assertion of their claims. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 772. Additional complications may arise in these cases as well; for example, a claimant may not assume light-duty employment during the period during which he receives partial disability benefits, and in such circumstances, there will be no convenient point of reference from which to measure further loss of earning capacity.</p>

Perhaps the Commonwealth Court in <em>Burton </em>was attempting to achieve some sort of parity among all claimants suffering from a physical impairment that permits light duty or sedentary work. Under our current system, although two claimants may have an identical physical impairment, based upon work availability one may receive partial disability benefits and the other total. The former is subject to the 500-week limitation on benefits; whereas, the latter is not, since the General Assembly has established no cap on total disability benefits. While this schelne may seem to contain an aspect of arbitrariness, it provides employers with an incentive to accommodate a claimant’s restrictions by any of a number of means, including provision of light-duty work and pursuit of outside employment opportunities with diligence. To the extent that the system results in uneven treatment, such is a consequence of the clear legislative design, pursuant to which disability is conditioned not directly upon the nature of a claimant’s injury, but rather, on the effect of such injury upon the specific claimant’s ability to generate earnings. <em>See generally </em>77 P.S. §§ 511, 512; <em>Dillon, </em><a href="/pa/536/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="536 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1843144" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0490-01">536 Pa. at 501</a>, 640 A.2d at 391 (stating that “we determine the degree of a worker's disability by reference to how the injury affected his earning power” (citation omitted)).
