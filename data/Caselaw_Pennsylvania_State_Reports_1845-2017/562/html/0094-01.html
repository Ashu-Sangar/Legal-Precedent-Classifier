    <p id="b158-10" data-blocks='[["BL_158.10",158,[256,923,1159,365]]]'>This is a direct appeal of appellant’s 1996 conviction of criminal homicide, robbery, aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person and theft by unlawful taking or disposition. The jury returned a sentence of death. On April 8,1996, the court sentenced appellant to death on the homicide conviction, and three consecutive sentences of ten to twenty years for the robbery and aggravated assault convictions.</p>
    <p id="b158-11" data-blocks='[["BL_158.11",158,[254,1318,1160,690]]]'>The facts established at trial are as follows. On June 30, 1994, at about 10:00 a.m., Michael Elder arrived at Valor Hi Adventure Shop, a sporting goods store in Baldwin Borough, where he worked. He saw two cars in the store parking lot, “a primer station wagon” and a car belonging to John Calabro, Elder’s co-worker. As Elder approached the store, he noted that the door was open. When he went inside the store, however, it seemed as if something was wrong. He walked to the back of the store in order to put his lunch in the refrigerator and was confronted by appellant holding a chrome plated autoloading pistol pointed at his face. Within three seconds, appellant shot Elder in the face, knocking him unconscious, but not killing him.</p>
    <p id="b158-12" data-blocks='[["BL_158.12",158,[253,2038,1157,311]],["BL_159.1",159,[190,312,1151,314]]]'>Minutes later, two other customers arrived in the store and discovered not only Elder’s body, but the body of John Calabro, who had been shot dead. Elder was conscious but unable to speak. The customers called for help. When police and paramedics arrived, Elder was taken to the hospital and Calabro’s dead body was found in a. kneeling position behind <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>the counter. Calabro had a single gunshot wound to the forehead with powder burns. The glass case containing guns was smashed. The store owner subsequently determined that several guns were stolen, including a number of handguns, a rifle and a shotgun. The handguns, including a Colt .380 pistol, were stored in the glass case without magazines.</p>
    <p id="b159-4" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[191,661,1151,196]]]'>Elder identified appellant at the preliminary hearing and at trial. Both Elder and the store owner identified appellant as a person who had been in the store on several previous occasions.</p>
    <p id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.6",159,[190,901,1151,473]]]'>Reginald Brown, who had grown up with appellant, testified that appellant sold him a number of handguns for $1,500 in the summer of 1994. The serial numbers had been obliterated, but an expert was able to raise most of the obliterated serial numbers from these guns. These numbers were the same as those for the weapons stolen from Valor. Brown indicated that some of the guns he purchased from appellant, particularly the .380 Colt pistols, did not have magazines and appellant told Brown that he would get him magazines.</p>
    <p id="b159-6" data-blocks='[["BL_159.7",159,[189,1409,1151,312]]]'>After the crime, police requested local gun stores to take notice of anyone purchasing magazines for handguns. Harry Moore, a manager of Braverman Arms Company in Wilkins-burg, testified that on July 13, 1994 appellant purchased two magazines for a Colt .380 pistol. Moore recorded appellant’s driver’s license at the time of the purchase.</p>
    <p id="b159-7" data-blocks='[["BL_159.8",159,[189,1756,1149,150]]]'>An ATF agent testified that the only handguns registered to appellant at this time were two .380 caliber Lorsen pistols and a .40 caliber Niberia. No Colts were registered to appellant.</p>

He determined with reasonable scientific certainty that they had been fired from the same .380 caliber Lorsen pistol. This pistol was recovered by police after the shooting and Harry Moore, of Braverman Arms, testified that appellant had purchased this gun on June 13, 1994. Brown testified that this Lorsen pistol was similar to one of the guns appellant sold him and which <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>he, Brown, gave to one Chris Williams to clean.

    <p id="b160-6" data-blocks='[["BL_160.6",160,[265,562,1156,197]]]'>Thus, appellant purchased the Lorsen pistol used in the crime on June 13, 1994, shot the two victims with this gun on June 30, 1994, and sold the gun to Reginald Brown in the summer of 1994.</p>
    <p id="b160-7" data-blocks='[["BL_160.7",160,[263,796,1160,419]]]'>Blood stain analysis concluded that blood from the broken counter was consistent with appellant’s blood and that Elder and Calabro were eliminated as being the source of this particular stain. Additional analysis of this blood by the manager of the DNA laboratory for the Pennsylvania state police in Greensburg indicated that the blood taken from the broken gun case matched the genetic profile of the blood of appellant.</p>
    <p id="b160-8" data-blocks='[["BL_160.8",160,[261,1244,1161,581]]]'>Appellant did not testify, but presented a diminished capacity defense. Appellant’s mother testified that appellant had been hospitalized twice before for mental disease. Dr. Bernstein, a psychiatrist, testified that he examined appellant on three occasions, and that his conclusion was that appellant was schizophrenic and was, for that reason, unable to form the specific intent required for first degree murder. He testified that appellant was unresponsive to powerful anti-psychotic drugs because of the severity of his condition, and that appellant heard voices which drove him to commit the crimes in question.</p>

It is the specific intent to kill which distinguishes murder in the first degree from lesser grades of murder. We have held that the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of a human body is sufficient to establish the specific intent to kill.

In addition, Justice Castille’s proposed interpretation of the term “offense” within (d)(7) as referring to crimes other than murder is in contravention of the well-known canon of statutory construction that penal statutes must be construed strictly. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928; <em>Commonwealth v.

The majority concludes that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of the § 9711(d)(7) aggravating circumstance on the basis that “the Commonwealth presented no evidence that Elder was nearby or within the zone of danger when Calabro was killed.” Even more disturbingly, the majority cites with apparent approval appellant’s argument that, at a minimum, the Commonwealth was required to show that the second victim, Elder, could have been struck with the bullet that killed Calabro in order for this aggravating circumstance to <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>apply.

    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.5",168,[243,563,1162,839]]]'>In determining that appellant did not create a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim, the majority focuses its inquiry on the instant that the killing shot was fired.

In <em>Paolello, </em>the Court surveyed cases decided under § 9711(d)(7) and noted that the circumstance had been found in those instances where the “other persons” put at grave risk were “in close proximity” to the decedent “at the time” of the murder “and due to that proximity are in jeopardy of suffering real harm.” <em>Id. </em>at 80, 665 A.2d at 456. <em>Paolello </em>later extrapolated from the cases it surveyed a rule that this aggravating circumstance arises only in those factual situations where a “nexus exists connecting the ‘other persons’ to the zone of danger created by the defendant’s] actions in killing the victim.” <em>Id. </em>at 82, 665 A.2d at 457.</p>

In <em>Paolello, </em>the defendant beat two men on October 3, 1991. One of the men went to the hospital and survived. The second man refused to seek treatment for his injuries and began ingesting large quantities of vodka that were administered to him by the defendant who said, “the only doctor your [sic] going to see is this vodka.” <em>Id. </em>at 63, 665 A.2d at 447. Eighteen hours later, the second man died as a result of a combination of blunt force trauma and alcohol poisoning. No general rule was necessary to decide <em>Paolello. </em>The survivor in <em>Paolello </em>was never exposed to the alcohol poisoning that killed the decedent.

Indeed, there is a line of cases, relied upon by the trial court and the Commonwealth, but ignored by the majority, in which this Court has held that there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of the § 9711(d)(7) aggravating circumstance when the defendant’s behavior either <em>before </em>or <em>after </em>the act of killing created a grave risk of death to someone other than the victim.</p>

Even though the victim was stabbed to death with no others in the vicinity, this Court held that the offense posed a grave risk of death “to the other residents of the home.” <em><a href="/pa/528/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="528 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1829826,1829847" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0546-01,/pa/528/0546-02">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/528/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="528 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1829826,1829847" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0546-01,/pa/528/0546-02">at 552, 555</a>, <a href="/pa/528/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="528 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1829826,1829847" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0546-01,/pa/528/0546-02">599 A.2d at 627-28</a>.</p>
    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.6",170,[220,1648,1160,627]]]'>Based on the theory espoused in these cases, there plainly was sufficient evidence to permit the jury here to consider the § 9711(d)(7) aggravating circumstance, even though the bullet that killed Mr. Calabro posed no specific danger to Mr. Elder and Mr. Elder was not shot until after Mr. Calabro was murdered. The killing of Mr. Calabro occurred in the course of appellant burglarizing the premises. At the time that Mr. Elder entered the store, appellant had yet to make his escape. I see no significant difference between appellant’s shooting Mr. Elder in the face, to facilitate his getaway, and the shooting at pursuers in <em>Johnson, </em>or the separate shootings in <em>McNair </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>or the inchoate danger in <em>Mitchell.</em>

As Judge Cercone noted:</p>
    <blockquote id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[246,623,1110,854]]]'>We believe that Mr. Elder unquestionably was within the zone of danger, and was in close proximity to the decedent at the time of the murder. Elder arrived at the store within minutes of its opening. Defendant, who had shot and killed Mr. Calabro, had not yet completed his robbery and getaway. Mr. Elder arrived within minutes o[r] perhaps seconds of Calabro’s murder. The murderer/robber was still in the store. If Defendant was to succeed, complete his robbery and effect his escape from his vile deeds, he had to eliminate the only other person present, a co-worker who had arrived within minutes or seconds of Bolden’s coldblooded act. One last witness would need eliminat[ion] in order for defendant to make good on his escape. Unfortunately for Defendant, however, he failed to complete that task, leaving a witness who would help bring justice down upon him.</blockquote>

Counterman, </em><a href="/pa/553/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="553 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="356273" data-case-paths="/pa/553/0370-01">553 Pa. 370</a>, <a href="/a2d/719/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="719 A.2d 284" data-case-ids="11673805,356273" data-case-paths="/a2d/719/0284-01,/pa/553/0370-01">719 A.2d 284</a> (1998). In <em>Counterman, </em>the defendant murdered his three children by setting fire to his house and preventing their escape. We held that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding of the § 9711(d)(7) aggravating circumstance because, by setting the fire, the defendant created a grave risk of death not only to his wife, who was also in the house, but also to firefighters and his neighbors, who were not. Obviously, by so holding, we recognized that, by setting the fire, the defendant created a zone of danger that remained not only until the blaze was extinguished, but also extending to individuals who entered this zone after the initial setting of the fire. Similar<a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>ly, in the instant case, the zone of danger remained until appellant made his escape from the store.</p>
    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[221,457,1160,572]]]'>But even if it could be said that the rule <em>Paolello </em>found in its survey of earlier cases supported the result reached by the majority here, I would still dissent. We are concerned with the construction of a <em>statute. </em>The cases construing the statute are a testament only to the “factual situations” that generated them. <em>Paolello, </em><a href="/pa/542/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="542 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="458844" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0047-01">542 Pa. at 82</a>, 665 A.2d at 457. The mere happenstance that a majority of the cases that have arisen involve a certain type of “factual situation” does not mean that other fact patterns do not fall within the statutory rule. In other words, the case law cannot operate to amend the statutory language.</p>
    <p id="b172-6" data-blocks='[["BL_172.6",172,[214,1053,1164,1052]]]'>The plain language of § 9711(d)(7), no less than the case law cited earlier, fully supports the trial court’s decision to submit this issue to the jury. The statutory aggravating circumstance in (d)(7) governs factual situations where, “In the commission of the <em>offense </em>the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the <em>offense.” Id. </em>(emphasis added). It is notable that the legislature employed the broad term “offense” for, elsewhere in the same statute, the legislature used narrower terms such as “a killing,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), or “homicidal conduct” or “homicidal acts,” § 9711(e)(6), (e)(7), in defining various aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Had the legislature intended to confine the grave risk of death aggravator to risks caused by the circumstances surrounding only the killing blow itself as the majority suggests, surely it would have employed one of the narrower terms it proved capable of employing elsewhere. By using the term “offense,” rather than “killing” or “homicidal act,” the statute requires that the (d)(7) inquiry should not be limited to the instant that the killing took place.</p>
    <p id="b172-7" data-blocks='[["BL_172.7",172,[211,2130,1160,256]],["BL_173.1",173,[201,337,1152,1126]]]'>Finally, this case provides a prime example of the wisdom of this aggravating circumstance. Aggravating circumstances exist to provide the appropriate punishment for the most heinous of murders or murderers. Appellant’s conduct here went well beyond that necessary to commit a first degree <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>murder. The “offense” was not simply the intentional shooting of Mr. Calabro, it was a robbery in which appellant displayed an easy willingness to kill anyone in his path. Appellant entered the sporting goods store at 10:00 <em>a.m. </em>— i.e., at a time when it was open, and when other employees and customers were likely to enter. Indeed, the door to the store was left ajar. During the course of the robbery, appellant smashed a glass display case, shot Mr. Calabro in the head and left his body behind a counter in the front of the store. It was easily foreseeable, even likely, that someone would enter the store during the course of the robbery/murder, notice the smashed display case, look for employees and discover the body of Mr. Calabro before appellant could make his escape. Until that escape occurred, anyone who entered the store, such as Mr. Elder, was in grave danger. Thus, implicit in the offense appellant elected to commit was a grave risk of death to anyone else who might enter the sporting goods store. The second victim was such a person. This grave risk distinguishes this from other first degree murders. I believe it is precisely the type of aggravating circumstance contemplated by § 9711(d)(7). Accordingly, I dissent.</p>
