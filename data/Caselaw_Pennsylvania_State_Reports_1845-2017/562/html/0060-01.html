Terraciano argued that the seven-year delay was attributable to PennDOT and that she was prejudiced by the delay because she had since obtained a commercial driver’s license and was employed as a school bus driver. The trial court concluded that the delay in prosecuting the matter was not attributable to PennDOT given the fact that the trial court was under a remand order from the Commonwealth Court.

PennDOT issued Terraciano’s commercial driver’s license, which would certainly lead her to believe that her driving privileges were no longer impaired. <em>See Rea v.

      <p id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.6",127,[193,1888,1152,351]]]'>. Relying on <em>Koller v.

In <em>Koller, </em>the court found that PennDOT was not responsible for moving an appeal forward in the trial court because it was the licensee who had filed the appeal. <em><a href="/a2d/682/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="682 A.2d 82" data-case-ids="7858859" data-case-paths="/a2d/682/0082-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/682/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="682 A.2d 82" data-case-ids="7858859" data-case-paths="/a2d/682/0082-01">at 84</a>. Here, unlike in <em>Koller, </em>the seven-year delay occurred after PennDOT’s appeal to the Commonwealth Court, and not after any appeal made by Terraciano.

PennDOT argues that the trial court was responsible for the delay, and correctly notes that judicial delay may not be attributable to PennDOT when determining whether there was an unreasonable delay. <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>
        <em>See Turner, </em><a href="/pa-commw/155/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="624 A.2d 759" data-case-ids="1445806" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/155/0106-01">624 A.2d at 761</a>. The rule that judicial delay may not be attributable to PennDOT in license suspension matters, however, stems from the underlying principle that PennDOT is unable to suspend a driver’s license until it receives a certified record from the court system that the licensee has been convicted of an offense for which a suspension may be imposed. <em>Walsh v. Department of Transp., </em>137 Pa.Cmwlth. 549, <a href="/pa-commw/137/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="586 A.2d 1034" data-case-ids="1410883" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/137/0549-01">586 A.2d 1034</a>, 1036-37 (1991). Such a situation differs markedly from an appeal from a suspension matter, because the conviction or event for which a suspension may be imposed has already been established. <em>See <a href="/pa-commw/137/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="586 A.2d 1034" data-case-ids="1410883" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/137/0549-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa-commw/137/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="586 A.2d 1034" data-case-ids="1410883" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/137/0549-01">at 1037</a>. Thus, despite PennDOT’s assertions to the contrary, the judicial delay rule is simply not applicable here. Rather, as discussed above, the delay in the instant case resulted from the laxity of PennDOT, an active party in the appeal proceedings, in allowing this case to languish for seven years.</p>

PennDOT also argues that Terraciano has unclean hands because she received the automatic supersedeas granted by 75 Pa.C.S. § 1550(b) and continued to enjoy the use of her driving privileges during the seven-year lapse in this matter. We reject PennDOT’s contention that Terraciano somehow acted unfairly, or with fraud or deceit, by accepting the statutory reprieve available to all appellants under the Vehicle Code.</p>
