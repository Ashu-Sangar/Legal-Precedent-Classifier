The court found that no mental illness had been established on the record, and the court certified the record to this court with a finding that, based on psychiatric and other evidence, Michael was competent to withdraw his PCRA appeal, despite his definite awareness that to discontinue the appeal would most likely lead to his execution.</p>

A PCRA petitioner must also plead and prove that the allegation of error has not been waived.

    <p id="b422-6" data-blocks='[["BL_422.7",422,[243,1862,1162,522]],["BL_423.1",423,[203,339,1151,525]]]'>The first issue based on ineffectiveness is whether it was error for the trial court to deny Michael’s request to withdraw his guilty plea prior to trial, and whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance with respect to this issue. Michael argues that the trial judge, in refusing the request, violated the holding in <em>Commonwealth v. Forbes, </em><a href="/pa/450/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="450 Pa. 185" data-case-ids="1947087" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0185-01">450 Pa. 185</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20268" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="299 A.2d 268">299 A.2d 268</a> (1973), that a petition to withdraw a guilty plea should be granted liberally, and <em>must </em>be granted if there is any fair and just reason therefore and if it will not substantially prejudice the prosecution. Michael claims that the trial court erred in <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>denying withdrawal of his guilty plea based on the court’s insufficient finding that the prosecution would be prejudiced “to some extent” or “in any way” or that there would be a “great financial burden to the Commonwealth,” or that withdrawal of the plea “would result in substantial delay.” <em>Forbes, supra, </em>requires substantial prejudice; appellant argues that the trial court ignored the requirement that prejudice be <em>substantial, </em>and claims that the examples of “prejudice” cited by the court do not rise to the level contemplated by the supreme court in <em>Forbes.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[203,896,1154,1491]]]'>Two omissions require rejection of appellant’s argument. First, it ignores the dual requirements of Forbes— there must first be an allegation of a fair and just reason for the withdrawal of the guilty plea before the question of prejudice arises. At the time of Michael’s request to withdraw his plea, he alleged nothing that would justify withdrawal. His petition was based only on allegations that he was incompetent at the time of entering the guilty plea and that he was experiencing an inability to communicate with trial counsel. These claims are belied by the record and have been litigated adversely to Michael. It was not error to deny a petition which failed to allege any good ground for withdrawal of the plea. Second, appellant argues ineffectiveness in a vacuum. He suggests nothing that trial counsel should have done to obtain permission for appellant to withdraw his guilty plea. There are no allegations with respect to this issue which would satisfy the requirements of <em>Commonwealth v. Peterkin, supra, </em>that counsel’s act or omission was substandard, that there was no reasonable basis for it, and that appellant was prejudiced, <em>i.e., </em>the outcome of trial would likely have been different were it not for the questionable act or omission. Failure to allege what course counsel should have pursued in order to provide effective assistance precludes review by an appellate court. <em>Commonwealth v. Pettus, </em><a href="/pa/492/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="492 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1767206" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0558-01">492 Pa. 558</a>, 563, <a href="/pa/492/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="492 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1767206" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0558-01">424 A.2d 1332</a>, 1335 (1981) (“Assertions of ineffectiveness in a vacuum cannot be ineffectiveness.”).

      <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>Michael’s next argument is that trial counsel was ineffective in assisting him to obtain different counsel and that the trial court erred in denying him new counsel.</p>
    <p id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[251,518,1162,578]]]'>Again, Michael fails to specify what course his counsel could or should have pursued which would have constituted effective assistance. This omission cannot support a finding of ineffectiveness as it fails to fulfill the prefatory, foundational need to demonstrate that counsel’s course of conduct was actually substandard or questionable. This constitutes a violation of <em>Pettus, supra, </em>as it provides the court with no basis to evaluate counsel’s performance and destroys che argument of ineffectiveness. Without ineffectiveness, the issue has been waived for failure to raise the issue on direct appeal. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b).</p>
    <p id="b424-6" data-blocks='[["BL_424.6",424,[249,1135,1161,626]]]'>Michael’s next contention is that his guilty plea was the product of ineffective assistance of counsel. The gist of the argument is that, after he had confessed that he committed the murder and had provided corroborating evidence, when he decided a year later to change his story and claim he had nothing to do with the crime counsel was somehow remiss in refusing to assist him in presenting the new story at trial and thereby unlawfully inducing Michael’s guilty plea, which was rendered involuntary by counsel’s ineffectiveness. The crux of counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness was in concluding, without any investigation, that the exculpatory story was a complete fabrication.</p>

He argues that counsel was or should have been aware that Michael had been a failure in school, had “learning problems,” had “attempted suicide” and “suffered depression,” was “very emotional,” “cried,” was “withdrawn,” “moody,” “isolated,” “defensive,” and “upset,” experienced “major mood swings,” and “suffered an abusive and neglectful childhood.” The argument is that <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>all these factors should have alerted counsel to the possibility that Michael might have been incompetent, obligating counsel at least to conduct an investigation including evaluation by mental health experts, in order to protect the accused from being subjected to criminal proceedings when he may have been incompetent.</p>

Moreover, counsel’s stipulation that there were no mitigating factors was a knowingly false representation which violated the rules of ethical conduct, according to Michael.

Fahy’s appointed counsel subsequently requested a remand to determine whether Fahy was competent to waive all collateral proceedings. We remanded the matter for a colloquy to determine whether Fahy fully understood the consequences of his request to withdraw his appeal and to waive all collateral proceedings. On remand, the PCRA court conducted a full colloquy during which Fahy testified consistently with his petition, ie., he did not want any further petitions filed by his appointed counsel or by counsel from the Center for Legal Education, Advocacy and Defense Assistance (CLEADA), who had involved themselves in the case. After conducting a full colloquy, the PCRA court found that Fahy was competent and that he knowingly waived his right to further collateral and appellate review. <a href="/pa/549/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="549 Pa. 159" data-case-ids="17949" data-case-paths="/pa/549/0159-01">549 Pa. at 164</a>, <a href="/a2d/700/1256-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="700 A.2d 1256" data-case-ids="11907938,17949" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/1256-01,/pa/549/0159-01">700 A.2d at 1259</a>.</p>

CLEADA’s position was based upon a non-record “declaration” purportedly made by Fahy, as well as a “declaration” from CLEADA counsel, both dated after the waiver hearing, which would impeach the record evidence of waiver. Upon review, we affirmed the finding of waiver. We noted that the trial court had conducted a colloquy during which Fahy “clearly and unambiguously” waived his right to further review and stated that he did not want his attorneys to file any further appeals or petitions on his behalf. Fahy’s representations, we noted, led the PCRA court to accept his waiver. We determined that the PCRA court’s waiver colloquy was adequate.

But, as I have detailed above, there in fact is <em>record </em>evidence of appellant’s desire to pursue the appeal in this case. That is because the January 28 affidavit- was actually introduced at the February 23 hearing and, more importantly, appellant testified at that hearing to a desire to pursue the appeal.

The record evidence regarding appellant’s desire to pursue this appeal is equivocal at best. At one hearing, appellant insisted that he did not wish to pursue his appeals. At the next hearing, he stated the opposite. Shortly thereafter, he purportedly wrote another letter reverting to his waiver position. Moreover, given the nature of our remand orders, we do not have a finding regarding waiver at any particular point in time; instead, we have fully supported findings that appellant is competent to make that determination, and that he understands the consequences of a decision to waive.</p>

But, given appellant’s established track record, I see little prospect that this course would resolve the matter since, before we could review the finding, appellant could change his mind again. Since there is no finding of a valid waiver to review at this point (unlike in Fahy), and since appellant’s last <em>record </em>expression was to pursue the appeal, I agree with the majority’s determination to review the claims presented in this appeal.</p>
