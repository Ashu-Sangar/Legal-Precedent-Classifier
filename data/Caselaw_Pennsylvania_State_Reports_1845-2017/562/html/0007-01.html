    <p id="b72-6" data-blocks='[["BL_72.6",72,[229,953,1161,521]]]'>On June 29, 1994, Wesley entered the apartment of Jill Creighton (the victim) through the bedroom window. After binding the victim’s wrists and ankles with twine and tape, Wesley raped and sodomized her. Wesley then cut the victim several times with a variety of knives, including a meat cleaver, a serrated kitchen knife, and a utility knife. Then, Wesley inflicted cuts to the victim’s arms, face, and neck. After that, he struck the victim four to six times on the head with a baseball bat, fracturing her skull and exposing her brain.</p>
    <p id="b72-7" data-blocks='[["BL_72.7",72,[228,1507,1161,582]],["BL_73.1",73,[207,342,1153,465]]]'>At trial, Dr. Abdulrezzak M. Shakir, a forensic pathologist employed by the Allegheny County Coroner’s Office, testified that an autopsy revealed that the victim died of one of the blows to her head. Dr. Shakir also opined that, prior to sustaining the head injuries, while the victim was still alive, she suffered a fractured nose, several knife wounds to her face, including the destruction of her right eye, and defensive wounds to her hands. The autopsy disclosed additional evidence of extreme violence, including the broken tip of a utility knife blade in the victim’s neck and a severe skull fracture. The jury heard the expert opinion of Thomas C. Myers, a <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>criminalist in the serology unit of the Allegheny County Department of Laboratories, that the rape probably occurred while the victim was alive because of the condition of the sperm samples taken from the victim. Mr. Myers also testified that blood splatters on the walls and ceiling of the bedroom evidenced severe and repeated trauma to the victim. Other expert evidence from a molecular biologist indicated that the DNA from the semen deposits taken from the victim was consistent with Wesley’s DNA.</p>
    <p id="b73-5" data-blocks='[["BL_73.5",73,[208,831,1155,736]]]'>After killing the victim,. Wesley took her ear keys and her purse, drove around the Pittsburgh area, stopped at two different banks, and used the victim’s Money Access Card (MAC) at Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). Security cameras photographed Wesley using the victim’s MAC. Within twenty-four hours, Wesley made more than fifteen attempts to withdraw money from the victim’s account, but bank safeguards allowed him to withdraw only $230.00 from her bank account. Although investigators were unable to recover any of Wesley’s fingerprints at the crime scene, the police found two fingerprints on a bank deposit envelope at one of the ATMs. A fingerprint expert from the Allegheny County Crime Lab identified the prints on the envelope as belonging to Wesley.</p>
    <p id="b73-6" data-blocks='[["BL_73.6",73,[209,1591,1153,574]]]'>Following a call initiated by Wesley to the police on June 30, 1994, the police drove him from his apartment to the police station, interviewed him about the crime, and released him without arrest. Later that day, Wesley called the police to offer additional information, and the police conducted a second interview at his parents’ house. On July 1, 1994, Wesley contacted the police again, and they conducted a third interview. Five days later, on July 6, 1994, the police arrested him, pursuant to an arrest warrant. The Commonwealth charged Wesley with homicide and one count each of rape, robbery, burglary, and theft by unlawful taking or disposition.</p>

On January 23, 1996, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. The following day, at the conclusion of the penalty hearing, the jury found four mitigating circumstances (no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1); commission of homicide out of character, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8); remorse, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8); and contributions in prison, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8)); and two aggravating circumstances (the killing was perpetrated during the commission of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); and the offense was committed by means of torture, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(8)) and determined that Wesley be sentenced to death. The trial court sentenced Wesley to death for the crime of first-degree murder and two consecutive terms of imprisonment of ten to twenty years plus fines for the charges of rape, robbery and burglary, imposing no further penalty for the theft.</p>

Responding immediately to the challenged comments, the trial court declared a recess and held an in-chambers conference with defense counsel and the prosecutor.

First, Wesley argues that only an instruction that specifically addressed the right of a defendant not to testify could have prevented prejudice. Second, according to Wesley, but for the prosecutor’s comments, the jury could not have returned a guilty verdict because he alleges that there was not enough evidence to convict him of first-degree murder. Assuming that Wesley has not waived this issue because his counsel failed to preserve it with a timely objection, there remains no constitutional violation. Clearly, it was not the intention of the Commonwealth to remark on Wesley’s decision whether to testify. Taken in context of the entire dialogue, it is more likely than not that the assistant district attorney was reacting to Wesley’s impromptu interjection in an attempt to gain control over the courtroom to give his closing argument. Furthermore, we are not convinced that the comments in question were so significant as to have any measurable influence on the jury’s deliberation. <em>See id. </em>at 1090. As we have noted earlier, the jury had sufficient evidence to find Wesley guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of first-degree murder. Even if the comments had some prejudicial effect, the cautionary instruction supplied by the trial court cured any potential harm to Wesley. A trial court has wide discretion in phrasing jury instructions, and absent an abuse of discretion or an inaccurate statement of law, there is no reversible error. <em>Commonwealth v.

Courts must not allow procedural defects by the Commonwealth to undermine the right of a defendant to a fair trial. The Commonwealth claims that it had given the defense actual oral notice of its intent to prove torture, but the record belies the delivery of actual notice. Guilt stage counsel lacked certainty throughout the trial that the Commonwealth was proceeding on torture. Because Wesley’s penalty stage counsel had only one day to prepare a defense against torture, Wesley suffered prejudice in his original trial. It was precisely for this reason, to give defendants adequate time to prepare a defense against specific aggravating circumstances, that the Criminal Procedural Rules Committee proposed, and we adopted, the 1995 amendment that required the Commonwealth to file its Rule 352 notice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> Regarding the reliance of the trial court on construc<a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>tive notice, we decline to address that rationale.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">20</a> It was an error of law to permit the Commonwealth to amend its Rule 352 notice at such a late stage and to present evidence on torture, when it was aware of the aggravating circumstance before arraignment and offered no sufficient justification for its untimely notice.</p>

Because the Commonwealth has argued actual oral notice and has expressly abandoned its argument concerning the existence of constructive notice, we decline to address the finding of the trial court of constructive notice.

This restriction seems not only unnecessary but also unfair given that a new sentencing hearing will cure the prejudice Appellant suffered because of the Commonwealth’s inadvertent failure to include torture in its original Rule 352 notice.

The majority indicates that the exclusion of evidence sanction it imposes here is compelled by this Court's decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

I cannot agree. In <em>Williams, </em>the Commonwealth claimed that it had failed to file timely notice of its intent to prove that the defendant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence as an aggravating circumstance because it lacked evidence of the defendant's prior felony history until after trial had started. The Court rejected the Commonwealth's argument on the basis that the Commonwealth clearly had access to the defendant’s records before the time it was required to file its Rule 352 notice. Here, unlike the situation in <em>Williams, </em>the Commonwealth's failure to include torture in its Rule 352 notice was due to a scrivener error.</p>
