The Bakers amended their complaint and reactivated their case on March 31, 1995. The trial was reverse-bifurcated, with the medical causation and damages phase being tried before a jury. On June 2, 1995, the jury entered an award of $2,000,000.00 in favor of Mr. Baker and $200,000.00 for Mrs. Baker’s loss of consortium claim.</p>

Additionally, the Bakers settled with four of the remaining defendants. The joint tortfeasor settlement agreements the Bakers executed with Owens-Coming Fiberglass Corporation (“Owens-Corning”), Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”), and Asbestos Claims Management Corporation (“ACME”) (formerly known as National Gypsum) specified that they were <em>pro rata </em>releases.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Mrs. Baker, as administratrix of Mr. Baker’s estate, was thereafter substituted as a party for Mr. Baker. At the liability phase of the trial, the only remaining defendant was ACandS, against whom Mrs. Baker proceeded on a strict liability theory only. The trial court, sitting without a jury, found ACandS, Owens Corning, Pfizer, ACME, and the Man-ville Trust jointly liable. The trial court proceeded to apportion the damages among each of these defendants, determining that each was responsible for an equal, one-fifth share of the award, or $440,000.00.</p>

Mrs. Baker claimed that the terms of the <em>pro tanto </em>release between her and the Manville Trust should be enforced. The effect of enforcing the terms of the release would be that ACandS would be liable for the $410,000.00 shortfall between the consideration the Manville Trust paid in settlement (i.e., $30,000.00) and the Manville Trust’s allocated share of the damages awarded to the plaintiff (i.e., $440,000.00). ACandS appealed to the Superior Court on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to show that it was liable.</p>

Initially, a three-judge panel of the Superior Court filed an opinion on May 18, 1998; this opinion was withdrawn by order of the court on June 1, 1998. On June 2, 1998, another opinion was filed in this matter which affirmed the order of the trial court. Subsequently, on July 30, 1998, the court granted reargument on the motion of Mrs. Baker. Our analysis of this matter is limited to a discussion of the Superior Court’s <em>en banc </em>opinion which was filed on March 30, 1999. In that opinion, the Superior Court rejected ACandS’ claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict; it therefore affirmed that portion of the trial court’s order which denied ACandS’ motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>

Thus, the Superior Court directed that Mrs. Baker could recover from ACandS the shortfall between the consideration she received from the Manville Trust in the <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>settlement and the amount of the Manville Trust’s share of the damages.</p>

    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.6",356,[232,789,1166,740]]]'>At the outset of our review, we note that the parties agree that they are bound by the terms of the TDP. The TDP, in turn, contains a rather involved mechanism for determining how set-off is to be calculated. TDP § H.3. Mrs. Baker and ACandS disagree about which particular subsection of TDP § H.3 applies to this matter. These arguments are fairly complicated. Yet, it is not necessary for us to resolve the rather thorny issue of which of these particular subsections of the TDP applies as both of these subsections declare that the method for performing the set-off calculation is to be made with reference to state law. <em>See </em>TDP H.3.(c) and (f). Thus, we can now turn to the crux of this dispute, which is whether state law mandates that ACandS should receive a <em>pro tanto </em>or <em>pro rata </em>set-off.</p>
    <p id="b356-6" data-blocks='[["BL_356.7",356,[230,1555,1162,419]]]'>To answer this question, we turn to the Uniform Contribution Among Tort-feasors Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8321-8327 (“UCA-TA”). This is a comprehensive act which dictates the effect of a release as to other tortfeasors, the method for computing set-off, and under what circumstances an action in contribution is to be allowed.

    <p id="b357-6" data-blocks='[["BL_357.6",357,[205,573,1151,469]]]'>Thus, in Pennsylvania, the UCATA contemplates three separate set-off scenarios. First, if the settlement agreement is silent, the set-off mechanism defaults to a <em>pro tanto </em>set-off and the nonsettling defendant is entitled to have the verdict reduced by the amount of consideration paid by the settling tortfeasor. In the second scenario, where the settlement agreement specifically provides for a <em>pro tanto </em>set-off, the UCATA envisions that such a specific election will always control.</p>
    <p id="b357-7" data-blocks='[["BL_357.7",357,[206,1077,1155,963]]]'>The third scenario is where the settlement agreement specifies a form of set-off other than a <em>pro tanto </em>set-off. As stated above, § 8326 provides that the settling parties may opt for another set-off “in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced if greater than the consideration paid.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 8326. In other words, the settling parties may opt for a set-off mechanism such as a <em>pro rata </em>set-off. Application of such a <em>pro rata </em>set-off would allow the nonsettling tortfeasor to reduce the amount of money owed to the plaintiff in an amount equal to the settling defendant’s apportioned share of the verdict. For example, suppose that there are two joint tortfeasors and one settles prior to trial pursuant to a <em>pro rata </em>release. It is subsequently determined that each joint tortfeasor is liable for 50% of a $100,000.00 verdict. The nonsettling tortfeasor is entitled to have the $100,000.00 verdict, the entirety of which it is obligated to pay as a joint and severally liable tortfeasor, reduced by $50,000.00, or 50% of the verdict.</p>

Section 8326 specifies that such a choice will become operative only if such a <em>pro rata </em>set-off would yield a set-off figure which is higher than the consideration paid by the settling tortfeasor. To employ the same example used <em>supra, </em>if the consideration <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>actually paid for the settlement was $60,000.00, the <em>pro rata </em>election would not become operative because the <em>pro rata </em>share of $50,000.00 is less than the amount paid in settlement. In such a scenario, the <em>pro tanto </em>set-off figure would apply.</p>
    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[238,566,1164,578]]]'>Application of 42 Pa.C.S. § 8326 to the matter <em>sub judice </em>reveals that ACandS should receive a <em>pro tanto, </em>rather than a <em>pro rata, </em>set-off. The settlement agreement entered into by the Bakers and the Manville Trust specified that it was a <em>pro tanto </em>release. Furthermore, the release stressed that it “does not provide, and shall not be construed to provide, for a reduction, to the extent of the pro rata share of the [Manville] Trust, of [the Bakers’] damages recoverable against all other tortfeasors.” Bakers-Manville Trust Settlement Agreement, dated May 31,1995, at 3. Thus, set-off is capped at the amount of consideration paid by the Manville Trust to the Bakers.</p>
    <p id="b358-6" data-blocks='[["BL_358.6",358,[236,1177,1163,469]]]'>ACandS, however, argues that the only form of set-off allowed in this matter is <em>pro rata. </em>It presents several arguments in support of this point. Its first such argument is that the UCATA, which would compel a <em>pro tanto </em>set-off under the facts of this case, applies only in negligence cases, and has no application to strict liability matters. In support of this argument, ACandS relies on the Superior Court’s decision in <em>Ball v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em><a href="/pa-super/425/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="425 Pa.

    <p id="b358-7" data-blocks='[["BL_358.7",358,[236,1673,1159,206]]]'>We reject ACandS’ argument for several reasons. First, our own reading of <em>Ball </em>leads us to conclude that the Superior Court in that matter did not hold that the UCATA applies only to negligence, rather than strict liability, actions.</p>
    <p id="b358-8" data-blocks='[["BL_358.8",358,[232,1902,1161,476]],["BL_359.1",359,[208,336,1152,366]]]'>Second, to the extent that <em>Ball </em>can be read for the proposition that the UCATA has no application in strict liability actions, it was wrongly decided. This court has never interpreted the UCATA as applying only to negligence actions. The portion of <em>Ball </em>which ACandS claims stands for the proposition that UCATA does not apply in strict liability actions is nothing more than a direct quote from Mr. Justice Papadakos’ concurring opinion in <em>Walton v. Avco Corp., </em><a href="/pa/530/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="530 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1833060" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0568-01">530 Pa. 568</a>, <a href="/pa/530/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="530 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1833060" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0568-01">610 A.2d 454</a> (Pa.1992).

Furthermore, even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the concurring opinion did stand for such a proposition, such a conclusion would be of no moment. That concurring opinion was not joined by any other justice, and thus clearly is of no precedential value.</p>
    <p id="b359-5" data-blocks='[["BL_359.5",359,[210,727,1151,370]]]'>Finally, we can find no support in the UCATA itself for the proposition that it applies only in negligence actions. The language of the UCATA is very broad and clearly applies to all types of actions. If we were to adopt ACandS’ analysis, and limit the UCATA to negligence actions, we would essentially be engrafting a limitation on the statute which the legislature did not see fit to impose. This we decline to do.</p>
    <p id="b359-6" data-blocks='[["BL_359.6",359,[209,1130,1153,744]]]'>Next, ACandS contends regardless of what the UCA-TA provides, set-off in strict liability actions can only be pro <em>rata. </em>In support of this conclusion, ACandS asserts that joint tortfeasors in a strict liability action are liable only for their respective, equally apportioned shares of the verdict; they cannot be compelled to pay more than their equally apportioned shares and have no right to contribution. As a corollary, ACandS claims that “settlement by one joint tortfeasor reduces the liability of a non-settling defendant by the settling defendant’s <em>pro rata </em>share and not the consideration paid for a release.” ACandS’ Brief at 21. In support of its argument, ACandS relies heavily on this court’s decisions in <em>Walton, supra, </em>and <em>Charles v.

First, ACandS misapprehends the interaction between apportionment of liability for the injury and the principle that one joint tortfeasor may be compelled to satisfy the entire money judgment pursuant to the doctrine of joint and several liability. In strict liability actions, liability is indeed apportioned equally among joint tortfeasors. <em>Walton, <a href="/pa/530/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="530 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1833060" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0568-01">supra.</a> </em>In a strict liability action, apportionment based upon fault is impermissible as this tort theory does not contain an element of fault. <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>This is in contrast to negligence actions where liability is allocated among joint tortfeasors according to percentages of comparative fault. 42 Pa.C.S. § 7102.</p>
    <p id="b360-5" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[242,521,1160,628]]]'>Yet, the declaration that liability is to be apportioned equally in a strict liability matter is not synonymous with the proposition that a tortfeasor may be compelled to pay only its share of the judgment and no more. In Pennsylvania, joint tortfeasors, including those in strict liability actions, are jointly and severally liable. <em>See Incollingo v. Ewing, </em><a href="/pa/474/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="474 Pa. 527" data-case-ids="1732097" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0527-01">474 Pa. 527</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="474 Pa. 527" data-case-ids="1732097" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0527-01">379 A.2d 79</a>, 85 (1977). Thus, the plaintiff may recover the entire damages award from only one of the joint tortfeasors.

These two principles seem irreconcilable. The UCATA provides that a non-settling defendant is not entitled to a set-off in light of the settling defendant’s release unless the settling and non-settling defendants are both deemed to be joint tortfeasors. 42 Pa.C.S. § 8326. Therefore, ACandS would not be entitled to a set-off unless the Manville Trust is deemed a joint tortfeasor.

I write, however, because, in light of the binding class action settlement effectuated among the Manville Trust, asbestos health claimants, Manville codefendants and others, I consider this case to be, first and foremost, a “Trust” case. The majority concludes that all paths through the operative Trust instrument (the Trust Disposition Process or “TDP”) lead to the same destination, namely, the direct application of Pennsylvania law to the <em>pro tanto </em>release consummated between the Trust and the Bakers; therefore it is able to avoid, a detailed review of the TDP. As a central point of their arguments, however, Appellant ACandS, Inc. and its <em>amicus curiae </em>contend that a provision of the TDP implicated by following the single, proper pathway through the document engrafts additional substantive terms upon the Baker/Trust release <em>prior to </em>the application of Pennsylvania law, and thus, that the true question presented in this appeal is: what effect does Pennsylvania law give to the Baker/Trust release <em>as modified by the TDP? </em>As I agree with ACandS’s position on <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>this point, I would address its argument and answer the question that it presents as follows.</p>

Judge Schiller, writing for the Superior Court majority, initially framed the primary issue as “whether in the context of a strict liability action pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act ..., and applicable case law, a <em>pro tanto </em>release executed by the plaintiffs in favor of the Manville Trust should be enforced according to its express terms to reduce the plaintiffs’ recovery against the non-settling tortfeasor.” <em>Baker v.

In summary, in response to the assertion of massive claims, Johns-Manville Corporation, manufacturer and distributor of asbestos products, filed a bankruptcy petition, and the Trust was established to succeed to Johns-Manville’s massive asbestos-related liabilities. The Trust was subsequently restructured in light of the fact that the value of Trust assets (no more than $2.5 million) was dwarfed by projected claims (between $21 and $25 billion). In connection with such restructuring, the district court certified a mandatory, non-opt-out class of asbestos health claimants, codefendants, distributors and certain others as beneficiaries. <em>See In re Joint Eastern and Southern Districts Asbestos </em>

The TDP allows a claimant, upon meeting certain threshold requirements, to treat the Trust as a “legally responsible tortfeasor” without introduction of further proof; deems the Trust to be a settled joint tortfeasor; limits the rights of co-defendants to obtain contribution against the Trust to a narrow set of circumstances; and, in some instances, permits co-defendants to obtain a reduction of a verdict in respect to the Trust, whether or not the claimant’s direct claim against the Trust has been resolved. <em>See generally In re Joint Asbestos Litig., </em><a href="/br/193/0764-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="78 F.3d 764" data-case-ids="6464072,94330" data-case-paths="/br/193/0764-01,/f3d/78/0764-01">78 F.3d at 770-71</a>.

In such states, a claim is classified under the TDP as several liability for economic claims and joint liability/apportionment for non-economic damages.

This assessment, however, overlooks the fact that Section H.3.(c) contains specific rules that engraft additional terms upon any settlement and release (discussed further below) <em>prior to the ultimate application of state law. </em>Such rules are not found in Section H.3.(f); therefore, although both sections may ultimately lead to the same result (the application of state law), the terms of the contractual arrangement of rights and interests which must be assessed under applicable law is different depending upon whether Section H.3.(c) applies. Thus, I view the determinations of the proper pathway through the TDP, the applicability of Section H.3.(c), and the éffect of Section H.3.(c)’s additional rules as critical to the disposition of this appeal.</p>

Rather, I would also consider and adopt the portion of ACandS’s argument positing that Section H.3.(f)’s directive that “applicable law shall govern which set-off rules apply to each cause of action or party thereof and each element of damages” requires a separate threshold assessment categorizing the segment of state law governing the pertinent cause of action (or element of damages) within the four remaining categories enumerated under Section H.3.(c) of the TDP <em>(pro tanto, pro rata, </em>apportionment, or several liability). I believe that this procedure is an appropriate interpretation of the written terms of Section H.3.(f) of the TDP, and effectuates the likely shared intentions of the parties to the TDP and the courts that approved it to provide some degree of standardization in the treatment of similar claims. The approach taken by the Superior Court majority results in the application of different principles governing setoff depending upon whether the jurisdiction treats all forms of tort claims on a <em>pro rata </em>basis (in which case Section H.3.(c) of the TDP clearly governs), or only the ones at issue in the case (in which case the Superior Court majority would apply state law without reference to Section H.3.(c)).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_10" id="ref_footnote_2_10">10</a>

In this regard, preliminarily, and as further discussed below, for the reasons stated by this Court’s majority, I would not adopt the view of the Superior Court dissent that Pennsylvania jurisprudence converts any form of release in a strict liability action into a <em>pro rata </em>one. <em>See Baker, </em><a href="/a2d/729/1140-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="729 A.2d 1140" data-case-ids="11627446" data-case-paths="/a2d/729/1140-01">729 A.2d at 1159</a> (Eakin, J., dissenting). Such a conclusion, however, is not a prerequisite to categorizing strict liability actions within the H.3.(c) <em>pro rata </em>category. States (and causes of action) falling within the <em>pro rata </em>category are those in which “total liability is divided among all defendants found by the fact finder (or agreed by the parties) to be legally responsible tortfeasors including released parties.” TDP § H.3.(c). Moreover, it is clear that this definition contemplates only the equal allocation of liability for purposes of contribution (rather than for the ultimate purpose of verdict setoff), as the sentence that follows speaks directly to setoff, specifying that, in <em>pro rata </em>states, judgments are reduced, as provided by applicable law, by <em>either </em>the released party’s <em>pro rata </em>share or the <em>pro tanto </em>settlement figure. <em>See </em>TDP § H.3.(c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_11" id="ref_footnote_2_11">11</a> As noted by ACandS’s <em>amicus, </em>such provision of <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>the TDP essentially mimics the general rule for apportionment of liability in a strict liability action as stated in the decisional law: “liability is divided proportionately in accordance with the number of joint tortfeasors.” <em>Ball, </em><a href="/pa-super/425/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="425 Pa.

The provision set forth <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>above simply does not accomplish this effect, since an agreement to indemnify the Trust in the event that it is required to make payment to codefendants (subject, of course, to the restrictive rules applicable to the assertion of codefendant claims), is, in neither form nor substance, a commitment on the part of asbestos health claimants to accept a diminished verdict from codefendants in the first instance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_12" id="ref_footnote_2_12">12</a> Where a <em>pro rata </em>release is conferred, the settling defendant’s immunity from contribution results from the fact that the plaintiff has expressly agreed to surrender his right to pursue the claim against the non-settling defendants. This reasoning, however, does not work in reverse - because a settling codefendant such as the Trust otherwise possesses limited exposure to contribution claims does not mean that the plaintiff has expressly agreed to release the non-settling codefendants from joint and several liability for the full amount of a verdict. Indeed, in such circumstances, the plaintiff possesses a strong incentive <em>not </em>to release the non-settling codefendants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_13" id="ref_footnote_2_13">13</a>

It is significant, however, that the complained-of exposure is not a consequence of the TDP, but results instead from the application in Pennsylvania of the principle of joint and several liability, which substantially advantages plaintiffs over solvent codefendants in a situation involving one insolvent defendant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_14" id="ref_footnote_2_14">14</a> The TDP simply does not <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>relieve Pennsylvania strict liability codefendants from this effect. In addition to entering the class action settlement with this burden, the Manville codefendants must have appreciated the protections afforded to Johns-Manville under the federal Bankruptcy Code; the finite assets possessed by the Trust created to resolve the flood of asbestos-related claims; their relative position in relation to the asbestos health claimants in terms of priority; and the corresponding likelihood that they would be foreclosed from achieving substantial contribution from Johns-Manville or any entity succeeding to its liabilities. Thus, it is not surprising that they would have compromised their rights against the Trust substantially in furtherance of the Trust’s objective to achieve a fair overall distribution and their own desire to attain some degree of contribution and/or setoff in relation to their claims. This appears to be the purpose and effect of the TDP — a balanced division of Trust funds consistent with the existing rights and interests of the parties, with overlaying terms providing additional protection for the Trust corpus. There does not, however, appear to have been an incentive for the asbestos health claimants to effectuate a wholesale restructuring of their core rights and remedies vis-a-vis the Trust’s codefendants. Indeed, neither ACandS nor its <em>amicus </em>has identified any valuable consideration tendered (or right surrendered) to asbestos health claimants in connection with the class action settlement commensurate with the highly valuable right of the claimants to pursue full recovery under a theory of joint and several liability under applicable law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_15" id="ref_footnote_2_15">15</a>
