The act plainly interferes with the sheriffs interest in the management and operation of his office as it limits his ability to supervise his employees, his ability to determine whether certain employees should be terminated, and his ability to utilize appropriated funds. The causal connection is also clear. The interference with the sheriffs management and operation of his office result directly from the mandates of the act.

    <p id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[189,569,1152,637]]]'>Here, the Attorney General argues that the legislative classification of Allegheny County as a second class county and the unique function of the sheriffs office rest upon just such a “ground of difference” justifying the classification and the different treatment. However, the legislation in question goes beyond merely singling out Allegheny County as a class to be treated differently and in essence has effectively created a new sub-classification, that of the sheriffs of second class counties. Plainly such a sub-classification bears no relationship either to the distinction of Allegheny County as a county of the second class or to any unique function of the office of county sheriff.</p>
    <p id="b497-6" data-blocks='[["BL_497.7",497,[189,1235,1153,520]]]'>We find appellant’s arguments to the contrary unpersuasive. While the legislature can treat different classes of counties differently, that is not what has occurred here. One particular county officer may not be treated differently from the other similar officers throughout the commonwealth merely because that officer is within a certain class of county. The distinction created by this legislation bears no fair or reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation and bears no relationship to the distinction of Allegheny County as a county of the second class.</p>

There is no rational basis for the sub-classification and different treatment of sheriffs of second class counties either from the sheriffs of all counties or from the other officers of second class counties. This legislation singles out the sheriff of Allegheny County, designating him the only county official in the commonwealth without some discretion in the hiring, termination or promotion of his employees. One particular county officer may not be treated differently from the other officers of that county unless the difference in treatment bears some reasonable relationship to <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>some unique characteristic of that particular office. Here, appellant points to the sheriffs office interaction with the public and the judicial system as features which distinguish it from the other county offices. While to some extent this distinction may exist, it is insufficient to justify different treatment from other offices which have, to varying extents, the same types of interaction, e.g., the county police, the district attorney, and others who must relate to both the public and the courts.</p>
