Smyth conducted hearings in which the Annenbergs, the County of Montgomery and the Intervenor-Counties (collectively the Counties) participated. After the close of healings, President Judge Smyth filed his Interim Report with this Court on October 7,1998. President Judge Smyth found that the Counties had not met their burden of proving that the stock clause is a compensatory tax and thus concluded that the exclusionary language in the stock clause was unconstitutional. Interim Report at 22. However, President Judge Smyth reasoned that the statute need not be struck down in its entirety. Rather, he posited that the language of the statute which excluded from taxation stock subject to the capital stock or franchise tax could be severed from 72 P.S. § 4821, leaving a personal property tax which applied to all classes of stock, whether they be held in out-of-state or in-state corporations. Interim Report at 25. Finally, President Judge Smyth declared that the Counties should be able to keep the tax which had been previously collected under the stock clause. Interim Report at 26. In arriving at this conclusion, President Judge Smyth stated that once the unconstitutional exclusion was severed from the stock clause, leaving a tax which was applicable to stock held in either out-of-state or in-state entities, then a valid tax remained; President Judge Smyth reasoned that in that event, the “[C]ounties should be permitted to retain and collect the personal property tax on stock that is not subject to the capital stock or franchise taxes.” Interim Report at 26.</p>

Of that, 12 mills went into a general fund which was distributed on a state-wide basis, while the remaining .75 mills were specifically allocated to the Lottery Fund and the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Fund.</p>

This is highly problematic for, as noted, not all counties collect the personal property tax. In order to give an accurate representation of whether the taxes collected by the personal property tax are in parity with the portion of the capital stock and franchise taxes the counties receive from the general fund, the witness would have had to calculate how much the counties which collect the personal property tax receive from the general fund, and exclude from his calculations how much the general fund distributes to the counties which do not collect the personal property tax.</p>

In arriving at this conclusion, the witness testified that the personal property tax is based on the value of shares on one day, while the capital stock and franchise taxes are determined by measuring economic flow. Also, the witness noted that the taxes are imposed and utilized by different levels of government. The personal property tax is imposed at the <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>county level and is utilized for county purposes.

The Annenbergs, however, contest this, arguing in essence that the passage of time has altered the severability analysis, and claim that the personal property tax on stock must be stricken in its entirety. In support of their argument, they point to the fact that the legislature has recently rejected a proposed bill which included a provision which would have extended the personal property tax to all classes of stock. Amendments to Senate Bill No. 2, 11/18/1996, A-7450, Printer’s No. 2328. The Annenbergs claim that when the legislature rejected this proposed bill, it sent the clear message that it did not desire the stock clause of the personal property tax to apply to all classes of stock. They contend that were this Court to sever the statute so that the personal property tax would apply to all classes of stock, we would be altering the contours of the personal property tax in a fashion which the legislature specifically rejected three years ago. They con-<a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>elude by stating that in doing so, we would be thwarting the demonstrated intent of a contemporary legislative body and would thus be overstepping the powers allotted to us to sever statutes.</p>
    <p id="b656-5" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[234,578,1162,457]]]'>The Annenbergs’ argument fails for two reasons. First, as noted by the Intervenor-Counties, only a miniscule portion of the rejected bill concerned the stock clause of the personal property tax. Thus, in the absence of any evidence from the legislative history which would establish that the bill was voted down because of the expansion of the scope of the stock clause, it cannot necessarily be inferred that the current legislature would be opposed to severing the void portions of this statute.</p>
    <p id="b656-6" data-blocks='[["BL_656.6",656,[231,1068,1164,945]]]'>Second, and far more importantly, the Annenbergs’ argument is inapt as it requests that we focus not on the intent of the legislature which enacted the void provision of this statute, but rather on the intent that can possibly be inferred from the rejection of a bill by a legislative body more than one hundred years after the statute was enacted. We find such an analysis not in accord with our rules of statutory construction. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1925 demands that we sever the void provision of the statute unless “it cannot be presumed the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void, one.... ” Clearly, Section 1925 funnels our inquiry to examining what the enacting legislature would have done had it known that the exemption it placed in the stock clause was unconstitutional. The statute does not, as the Annenbergs would have us interpret it, instruct us to examine what subsequent legislatures would have intended vis-a-vis the personal property tax. Thus, we reject the Annenbergs’ argument on this point.</p>
    <p id="b656-7" data-blocks='[["BL_656.7",656,[229,2037,1161,360]],["BL_657.1",657,[194,353,1150,204]]]'>Next, the Annenbergs argue that were we to sever the void provision from the stock clause, thereby expanding the stock clause to encompass classes of stock which had previously eluded the tax, we would be violating the separation of powers doctrine as the power to tax lies solely with the legislature. We reject this contention. When this Court severs a void provision from a statute, it is doing so to attempt to effectuate <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>legislative intent. We are therefore not arrogating to ourselves the power to tax but rather are attempting to determine how the legislature would have exercised its taxing power had it known, in 1889, that the exclusion was void.</p>
    <p id="b657-4" data-blocks='[["BL_657.5",657,[193,587,1155,800]]]'>The Annenbergs’ final contention regarding severability is that the unconstitutional portion of the stock clause is an exclusion rather than an exemption; from this point, the Annenbergs apparently argue that this Court can never sever an unconstitutional exclusion from a taxing statute. Whether the phrase in question is deemed an exemption or an exclusion, the severability analysis is unaffected.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">11</a> Regardless of how the void provision is classified, our task is to determine whether the legislature would have enacted the remainder of the statute without the void portion had it known that the void portion was unconstitutional. There is no rule of statutory construction which forbids us from severing void exclusions. Furthermore, such a narrow and arbitrary rule would be most peculiar in light of the strong public policy favoring severability.</p>

In making the argument that our discretion in fashioning a suitable remedy is limited by Section 5566b, the dissent implies that it is improper, upon concluding that a portion of a taxing scheme is unconstitutional, to allow the taxing authority to keep the taxes previously levied and collect back taxes from those who benefited from the unconstitutional portion. In doing so, the dissent suggests that the United States Supreme Court countenanced an improper and unlawful remedy in <em>McKesson. </em>The final two remedies outlined by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McKesson </em>allow the taxing authority to retain the taxes, or a portion thereof, previously levied under an unconstitutional taxing scheme as long as back taxes are collected from those who benefited from the unlawful exemption, so as to "create in hindsight a nondiscriminatory scheme.” The dissent’s conclusion implies that the United States Supreme Court sanctioned a remedy in <em>McKesson </em>which would allow the state of Florida to retain taxes which it was not entitled to as a matter of law. We find it quite unlikely that the United States Supreme Court committed such a glaring oversight.
