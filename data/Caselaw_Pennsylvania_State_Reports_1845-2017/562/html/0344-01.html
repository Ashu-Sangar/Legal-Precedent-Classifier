Plumbing Company (“Bozzelli”) and Dual Temp. Co. Inc. (“Dual Temp”) (collectively, the “Contractors”) appeal from the order of the Commonwealth Court. The Commonwealth Court concluded that the Contractors were not entitled to a refund of construction permit fees paid to the Borough of Wilson (“Borough”) even though the ordinances and resolution pursuant to which the permit fees were collected were found <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>to be unlawful and unenforceable.

In order to begin their work, three local ordinances and a resolution imposed upon the Contractors permit fees, ostensibly for the purpose of regulating and inspecting the construction of the high school. These fees are designed for the purpose of reimbursing the municipality for the necessary expense of enforcing and administering oversight or control of the construction project. In this case, the fees amounted to approximately ten percent of each Contractor’s bid or contract price with the School District to the Borough. The Contractors paid the permit fees, but did so under protest.</p>

The Borough notified Skepton that the cost of a construction permit, under the applicable Borough ordinance and resolution, totaled $88,838.00, based on Skepton’s estimated construction cost of $8,883,375.00 for the project. Likewise, Dual Temp, as the supplier and installer of the heating, ventilation, and cooling equipment, entered into a contract for its work in the amount of $2,201,621.00. Pursuant to the applicable ordinance and resolution, Dual Temp paid a permit fee of $22,021.00 based on its contract price of $2,201,-621.00. Finally, Bozzelli, as the plumbing contractor, and pursuant to the applicable ordinance and resolution, paid a permit fee of $9,120.00 based on its contract price of $890,-000.00.</p>

The matters were consolidated and proceeded on a stipulation of facts pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1038.1 and on submitted briefs. On August 6, 1997, the trial court issued findings of facts and conclusions of law finding for the Contractors. Specifically, the trial court concluded that the ordinances and the resolution violated the Borough Code, 53 P.S. § 46202, because the fees imposed were primarily for the purpose of raising revenue and were grossly disproportionate to any costs incurred by the Borough. In fact, the documented expenses incurred by the Borough in enforcing the ordinances for the construction project totaled only $1,234.00, or approximately J/iooth of the fees imposed by the Borough. Accordingly, the trial court found that the ordinances and resolution could not be enforced and the Contractors were entitled to a full refund of the monies paid to the Borough.</p>

Furthermore, the Commonwealth Court found that because the Contractors had included the relevant fee expenditures in their bids and had been reimbursed this amount by the School District, the Contractors had suffered no injury, and to order a refund would be to grant them a windfall.

The Borough failed to object to the type of claim made at any stage of the proceedings. Furthermore, the Borough made no argument on this issue either at trial or before the Commonwealth Court. Finally, there were no findings of fact on the type of claim asserted and whether it satisfied the mandates of § 5566b. Thus, because the Borough never contested the validity of the Contractors’ refund claim, we find that the Commonwealth Court inappropriately injected this issue into the matter sub judice and reject this as a basis to deny the Contractors a refund. <em>Knarr v.

Here, the Borough imposed upon the Contractors fees to which the Borough was not legally entitled. Pursuant to the plain and unambiguous terms of the Local Tax Collection Law, the Contractors are entitled to a refund. In its analysis, the Commonwealth Court has stymied the statutory mandate of a refund and instead has engrafted upon the clear language of the statute a pre-condition, viz., the wronged taxpayer is entitled to a refund <em>only </em>if the taxpayer has not recouped its loss from some other entity. If so, the governmental unit does not have to return its improperly collected taxes. Simply stated, there is no pre-condition contained in the statute which denies a taxpayer a refund of wrongfully imposed taxes if that taxpayer has somehow mitigated or recovered its loss from another source. The Commonwealth Court erred in constructing such a statutory overlay.</p>

In <em>Girard, </em>personal property taxes were paid by the Girard Trust Company to the City of Philadelphia on money and securities held in a trust that was created for a Scottish insurance company. Part of the tax was levied upon bonds of corporations that, in the trust indentures creating the bond issue, agreed to reimburse any taxes imposed on the bonds. The trust company made a claim for a refund after it was determined that the trust was not subject to the tax. As to the refund, our court construed the very statute before us now and determined that the governmental unit which had illegally collected the tax was not entitled to a reduction in the amount of the refund because the taxpayer was reimbursed by the corporations which had is<a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>sued the bonds. Rather, it was the full amount of the tax paid to which the aggrieved taxpayer was entitled as a refund.</p>

Nor do we believe that the fact that this case involves a total reimbursement rather than a partial recovery of monies or that this case involves a contract providing services rather than a trust agreement is of distinguishing legal significance. In sum, if a taxpayer establishes that it paid taxes or fees to which the government is not entitled, the taxpayer is entitled to a refund.</p>

To preclude these commercial enterprises from the protection that a refund provides from illegal taxation because of its ability to pass that burden onto other shoulders is illogical. Such a policy would only encourage illegal taxing schemes aimed at commercial enterprises. This is because there will be no incentive for commercial enterprises to challenge the wrongfully collected taxes, and thus, no incentive for a municipality to discontinue abusive tax and fee collecting practices.</p>

Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that equitable concerns would alter the plain meaning of the statute, it is not apparent that equity is on the side of the Borough. Even if the Contractors receive a complete windfall, the return of the illegally appropriated funds to the Contractors, rather than to the Borough, will be the lesser of two evils.

The Borough does not even raise this issue in its briefs before this Court. I thus agree that the Commonwealth Court inappropriately injected the issue into this matter. However, I dissent from the Majority’s disposition because I agree with the Commonwealth Court that Contractors are not entitled to a refund since in reality, the School District, not Contractors, paid the excessive permit fees. Therefore, the Contractors are not really the person “aggrieved” and are not entitled to a refund pursuant to 72 P.S. § 5566b and 72 P.S. § 5566c.</p>
