Appellant argues, however, that the lower courts erred in finding that the PCRA’s timeliness requirements apply to his claim that his trial coimsel was ineffective for failing to timely file a direct appeal, because the claim, if proven, would establish that Appellant was denied his federal and state constitutional right to the assistance of counsel, as well as his right, pursuant to Article V, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania State Constitution, to a direct appeal.</p>

To the contrary, a plain reading of the PCRA’s timeliness requirements indicates that they are intended to apply to all PCRA petitions, regardless of the nature of the individual claims raised therein. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b); <em>see also Commonwealth v. Owens, </em><a href="/a2d/718/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="718 A.2d 330" data-case-ids="11684913" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0330-01">718 A.2d 330</a> (Pa.Super.1998) (noting that, under the plain language of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545, the substance of a PCRA petition is irrelevant to its timeliness). In addition, given the fact that the PCRA’s timeliness requirements are mandatory and jurisdictional in nature, no court may properly disregard or alter them in order to reach the merits of the claims raised in a PCRA petition that is filed in an untimely manner. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Fahy, </em><a href="/pa/558/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="558 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="838539" data-case-paths="/pa/558/0313-01">558 Pa. 313</a>, 328-29, <a href="/a2d/737/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="737 A.2d 214" data-case-ids="11567898,838539" data-case-paths="/a2d/737/0214-01,/pa/558/0313-01">737 A.2d 214</a>, 222 (1999); <em>Commonwealth v.

In essence, Appellant contends that a defendant’s conviction can never be considered final for purposes of triggering the PCRA’s timeliness requirements until the defendant has fully litigated a direct appeal. As noted by the Superior Court, Appellant’s contention in this regard is devoid of merit, as the plain language of the PCRA clearly provides that a judgment becomes final for purposes of triggering the commencement of the one-year filing period provided for at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1) “at the conclusion of direct review, including discretionary review in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, or at the expiration of time for seeking the review.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(3)(emphasis added). Appellant had thirty days following the entry of the Superior Court’s January 3,1996 order dismissing his direct appeal as untimely filed to seek discretionary review in this Court by filing a petition for allowance of appeal. Pa. R.A.P. 1113(a). Since Appellant never filed a petition for allowance of appeal to this Court from that order, <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>his judgment became final for purposes of triggering the commencement of the PCRA’s one year filing period on February 2, 1996. As noted above, Appellant did not file his <em>pro se </em>PCRA petition until July 3, 1997, well after the expiration of his one year filing period under the PCRA. Thus, Appellant’s alternative argument that his <em>pro se </em>petition meets the PCRA’s timeliness requirements affords him no relief.</p>
    <p id="b66-5" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[244,716,1163,854]]]'>In short, the PCRA’s timeliness requirements leave the courts without jurisdiction to consider the merits of a PCRA petition that is filed in an untimely manner, unless the petition alleges, and the petitioner proves, that one or more of the enumerated exceptions to the timeliness requirements applies to the claims raised therein. Given the fact that Appellant’s PCRA petition was not filed within a year of the date that his judgment became final on February 2,1996, and given the fact that Appellant has never alleged that any of the exceptions to the timeliness requirements apply to his claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a timely direct appeal on his behalf, the PCRA court did not err by dismissing Appellant’s petition as untimely filed without first holding an evidentiary hearing regarding his ineffectiveness claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Superior Court affirming the dismissal of Appellant’s PCRA petition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to file a timely direct appeal is similar to the ineffectiveness claim brought by the petitioner in <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Lantzy, </em>this Court held that a claim brought in a PCRA petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to file a requested direct appeal constitutes a cognizable claim for relief under the PCRA. <em>Id. </em>at 226-27, <a href="/a2d/736/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="736 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="11575941,838560" data-case-paths="/a2d/736/0564-01,/pa/558/0214-01">736 A.2d at 572</a>. However, unlike <em>Lantzy, </em>Appellant filed his <em>pro se </em>PCRA petition outside of the one year filing period provided for in the PCRA’s timeliness requirements. Thus, we emphasize that it is Appellant's failure to file his PCRA petition in a timely manner, and not the nature of his ineffectiveness claim which is fatal to the success of his appeal from the dismissal of his petition.</p>

In short, our decision in <em>Stock </em>applies only to those rare instances where a defendant <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>seeking nunc pro tunc relief is not, and never was, eligible to seek collateral relief under the PCRA because he could not satisfy the PCRA's custody requirement. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(1)(i) — (iii) (in order to be eligible for relief under the PCRA, a petitioner must be currently serving a sentence of death, imprisonment, probation, or parole for the conviction(s) that he wishes to appeal from, or must be currently serving a prior sentence which must expire before he may commence serving the disputed sentence). In the instant appeal, the issue presented involves the application of the PCRA’s timeliness requirements to a PCRA petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to file a direct appeal in a timely manner.
