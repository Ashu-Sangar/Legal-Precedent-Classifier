At the time of his arrest, Vasquez had no prior convictions for drug offenses. A single criminal information was filed against Vasquez, charging him with various counts related to the delivery of cocaine. On January 6,1998, Vasquez pled guilty to two charges related to separate drug transactions, one occurring on June 16, 1997, and the other on June 26, 1997. The Commonwealth filed a notice of intention to seek the mandatory sentence applicable to the case pursuant tó ,18 Pa.C.S.A. § 7508.

    <p id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.6",183,[182,572,1155,1506]]]'>In this matter, we are called upon to determine whether a conviction within a multiple count complaint can be counted as a “prior conviction” such that the enhancement provision of Section 7508 applies. The Commonwealth argues that the statute unambiguously states that if at the time of “sentencing” the defendant has been “convicted” of another drug offense, the defendant’s sentence is enhanced. <em>See Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/539/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="539 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="474170" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0249-01">539 Pa. 249</a>, <a href="/pa/539/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="652 A.2d 283" data-case-ids="474170,474223,7865895,7865981" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0249-01,/pa/539/0248-01,/a2d/652/0283-01,/a2d/652/0283-02">652 A.2d 283</a> (1994) and <em>Commonwealth v.

It is irrelevant that the prior conviction arises from one count within a multiple count complaint, or that the offenses are from a single arrest and charge. Vasquez counters that Section 7508 does not indicate that a defendant would be subject to an enhanced sentence because of a multiple count offense. Here, his guilty pleas occurred in the same proceeding, were a result of one warrant and one complaint for the sale of drugs to the same undercover officer. Vasquez argues that the case is distinguishable from <em>Plass </em>and <em>Williams </em>because in those cases there were two separate offenses, with two separate arrests. Vasquez also seems vaguely to imply that these two drug offenses are part of a single criminal episode and thus cannot be considered separate convictions for purposes of the enhancement statute. While Vasquez appears to argue that we should treat this single indictment and arrest as a single conviction for purposes of the enhancement statute, he does not present any record facts or any language in the statute to support this assertion.</p>

They should not be treated as a single criminal act simply because the transactions involved sales to the same undercover officer. Thus, the facts properly support the conclusion that we are confronted with two convictions for two separate crimes, although contained within one indictment and one arrest. Moreover, even if we were to conclude that these transactions could be construed as a single criminal episode, the statute at issue specifically focuses on a defendant’s prior “convictions” at the time of sentencing, and makes no distinction between convictions that arise from a multiple count complaint, or a separate complaint. We are bound by the unambiguous language of the statute and cannot read language into it that simply does not appear. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(b). The wording of the statute is unambiguous, and clearly requires that as long as <em>at the time of sentencing, </em>a defendant “has been convicted” of another qualifying “offense,” the defendant shall receive the enhanced sentence.</p>
    <p id="b184-4" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[235,1378,1161,461]]]'>Moreover, this matter is not significantly different from our decision in <em>Williams, </em>where the defendant committed a drug offense in November of 1988 and another drug offense in May of 1991. On October 11, 1991 Williams pled guilty to <em>both </em>offenses and was sentenced for both offenses on November 26, 1991.

It says that ‘if at the time of sentencing the defendant has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense;’ he must receive an enhanced sentence.

    <p id="b187-8" data-blocks='[["BL_187.8",187,[195,1466,1153,800]]]'>I concur with the dissent when it expresses dissatisfaction with the sentencing enhancement provisions at 18 Pa.C.S. § 7508. Like the dissent, I believe that the legislative enactment at issue ignores the recidivist philosophy of sentencing in favor of a mechanical application of enhanced penalties, which serves merely to add increased jail time at the whim of the prosecuting authority. As a jurist, I believe sentencing is an individualized procedure wherein the sentencing judge must balance multiple factors before imposing sentence on the defendant, which reflect the nature of the crime, its impact on the community, the particular victim, and the degree of culpability of the defendant. That is why I, like most jurists, advance the recidivist philosophy, as it best reflects the need for focusing on the individual defendant’s capability for rehabilitation when imposing sentence.</p>

Other recognized goals of sentencing include protection of society, general deterrence of criminal activity, and retribution. <em><a href="/pa/539/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="652 A.2d 283" data-case-ids="474170,474223,7865895,7865981" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0249-01,/pa/539/0248-01,/a2d/652/0283-01,/a2d/652/0283-02">Id.</a> </em>In <em>Williams, </em>we examined the same statutory section at issue in this case, and found that the legislature left no ambiguity as to the clear intent to impose a mandatory enhancement without consideration of the recidivist philosophy. The dissent attempts to distinguish the holding in <em>Williams </em>by focusing on the distinct procedural postures of the two cases. In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant was arrested and indicted separately for two drug sales. He pled to both indictments on the same day and was sentenced on the same day. In the instant case, the defendant was charged in one indictment for four distinct drug sales occurring on different dates. I cannot agree that these distinctions impact the outcome regarding the application of the enhancement provision. The differences between these two cases are immaterial to discerning the nature of the penal provision at issue.</p>

Instead of arresting Appellee after any of these sales, the officer scheduled a fourth sale with Appellee and on June 25, 1997, he attested to these transactions in an affidavit of probable cause and requested an arrest warrant. On June 26, 1997, the officer purchased more cocaine from Appellee and <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>Appellee was arrested for all four drug sales that day. Appellee subsequently pled guilty to two counts on January 6,1998.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> As the majority notes, the trial court sentenced Appellee to one to two years on the first count (the June 16 th sale) and then applied § 7508(a)(3)(i), which enhances a defendant’s sentence if he has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense at the time of his sentencing, to the second count (the June 26th sale).</p>
    <p id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.4",189,[194,800,1151,548]]]'>I cannot agree with the majority that the trial court properly applied § 7508(a)(3)(i) to the instant case since the “prior conviction” here was the charge arising from the sale on June 16 th. Rather, I believe that since the officer opted not to arrest Appellee after the first three illicit sales, as he clearly could have done, the enhancement in § 7508(a)(3)(i) should not apply. In my view, the enhancement provision should apply only to those defendants who have already been given an opportunity to be rehabilitated, which Appellee was clearly never given in the instant case.</p>

Williams, </em><a href="/pa/539/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="539 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="474170" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0249-01">539 Pa. 249</a>, <a href="/pa/539/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="652 A.2d 283" data-case-ids="474170,474223,7865895,7865981" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0249-01,/pa/539/0248-01,/a2d/652/0283-01,/a2d/652/0283-02">652 A.2d 283</a>. <em>Williams, </em>however, is readily distinguishable. In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant committed the first offense on November 2,1988 and was arrested. Two and one-half years later, on May 21, 1991, the defendant committed a second offense and was again arrested. Though the defendant was ultimately convicted of both offenses on the same day as a result of fortuitous circumstances, he clearly had the opportunity to be rehabilitated since he was arrested on two separate occasions, two years apart. Thus, it made sense to apply the enhancement provision to that situation. The circumstances in the instant case are significantly different. Here, the officer bought cocaine from Appellee on four separate occasions, and only arrested him after the last <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>transaction. Therefore, unlike in <em>Williams, </em>the police did not arrest Appellee after the first illicit sale, and consequently Appellee was never given the opportunity to be rehabilitated. Instead,' after pleading guilty to both offenses on the same day, Appellee received the enhanced sentence. This outcome clearly undermines what I believe to be the purpose of § 7508(a)(3)(i).</p>
    <p id="b190-5" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[263,740,1160,1092]]]'>Moreover, the majority opinion ignores the fact that after the first three sales (May 5 th, June 2ndand June 16 th), the police had sufficient probable cause to either (1) arrest Appellee during the commission of the crime or (2) obtain an arrest warrant for Appellee’s immediate arrest. The police did neither. Instead, they set up another undercover buy, waited for Appellee to commit another crime, and only then did they arrest Appellee for the sales. While the majority holds that the enhancement provision is applicable to these circumstances, such a holding, in my view, risks endangering the public by allowing a known drug seller to continue selling drugs, thereby impacting the public at large. Moreover, this holding gives police the option of watching a person sell drugs numerous times before arresting the offender, solely for the purpose of making the enhancement provision applicable to the offender’s sentence. This practice offers offenders no opportunity for rehabilitation and in effect, grants police the discretion to determine the length of an offender’s sentence. Because I cannot agree that these were the intended consequences of § 7508(a)(3)(i), I must respectfully dissent.</p>
