Grimaud, et al., introduces several procedural challenges to the amendment’s enactment, including alleged violations of the amendatory provisions in Article XI of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Appellants, however, did not raise these issues below and have not raised them here. An <em>amicus curiae </em>is not a party and cannot raise issues that have not been raised or preserved by the parties. <em>See </em>Pa. R.A.P. 531(a) <em>(amicus curiae </em>may file brief regarding only those questions that are before the Court). Thus, these issues are not properly before the Court and we therefore decline to address them.</p>

We also cannot agree with Appellants’ contention that Article I, Section 6 vests the right to a jury trial solely in individual defendants. Article I, Section 6 actually reserves this right in the people of the Commonwealth. <em>See Gondelman, </em><a href="/pa/520/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="520 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1815553" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0451-01">520 Pa. at 467</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="520 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1815553" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0451-01">554 A.2d at 904</a> (quoting R. Woodside, <em>Pennsylvania Constitutional Law </em>(1985)) ("The provisions of a constitution specifying the rights reserved and retained by the people are generally referred to as the 'Bill of Rights’ or in Pennsylvania the 'Declaration of Rights’ [Article I]”). Here, it was the people of this Commonwealth who voted to support the amendment granting the right to a jury trial to the Commonwealth, which serves as the people's representative during criminal prosecutions.</p>

We note that even though Appellants were charged in June of 1998, they continued to indicate a desire to be tried by jury until June of 1999, several months after the amendment to Article I, Section 6 passed in November of 1998. (Indeed, Appellants both filed a petition for a change in venue/venire as late as March 1, 1999). It was not until June of 1999— when Appellants requested a waiver trial for the first time on record, and after the amendment had already passed — that the Commonwealth sought to invoke its right to a trial by jury pursuant to the Article I, Section 6 amendment.</p>
