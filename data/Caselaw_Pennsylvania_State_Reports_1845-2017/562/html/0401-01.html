On September 29, 1994, Claimant filed a petition for modification, seeking total disability benefits, effective April 30,1994.

The WCJ subsequently issued a decision denying modification, finding, among other things, that Claimant was not totally disabled, but rather, had voluntarily retired and removed himself from the workforce. Although Employer had asserted that, by virtue of his receipt of partial disability benefits for 500 weeks, Claimant was barred under the Act from receiving total disability benefits, the WCJ did not address this argument. Claimant filed an appeal in the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (the “Board”), which found that the WCJ had improperly disregarded Claimant’s uncontroverted evidence establishing that his total disability was a direct result of his acknowledged work-related lung disease, and erroneously deemed Claimant to have voluntarily retired. The Board, however, agreed with Employer’s argument that Claimant’s rights and remedies under the Act had been exhausted, since Claimant had received the full measure of available partial disability benefits. A three-judge panel of the Commonwealth Court affirmed, both as to the conclusion that the WCJ disregarded competent evidence concerning the extent of Claimant’s physical disability and cessation of work, and as to the holding that Employer was relieved from any liability. <em>Stewart v.

Both base this interpretation upon the final sentence of Section 413(a) to the effect that, where compensation has been suspended because the claimant has returned to work with earnings equal to or in excess of his pre-injury wages, benefits may be resumed at any time during the 500 weeks. Employer all but acknowledges that the relied-upon provision, on its terms, applies only to cases in which a claimant’s benefits are sus<a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>pended because he has regained the ability to generate his time-of-injury wages, which simply is not the case here. Employer contends, nonetheless, that the provision should be made applicable to cases in which no suspension has occurred but partial disability benefits have been afforded for 500 weeks, since there is no rational basis on which to differentiate between claimants who are partially disabled but whose earnings result in a suspension and partially-disabled claimants who obtain limited benefits, in terms of who should have access to relief upon experiencing total disability subsequent to the expiration of 500 weeks. Employer cites to dictum from this Court’s decision in <em>Dillon v. WCAB (Greenwich Collieries), </em><a href="/pa/536/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="536 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1843144" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0490-01">536 Pa. 490</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="640 A.2d 386" data-case-ids="1843144,7861845" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0490-01,/a2d/640/0386-01">640 A.2d 386</a> (1994), as also supportive of the asserted limitation. Claimant emphasizes that the final sentence of Section 413(a), by its express terms, is limited to cases involving <em>suspensions </em>of benefits; argues that the provision merely serves to exempt such cases from the effect of the three-year limitation on the filing of a modification petition after <em>termination </em>of benefits; and contends that his construction of Section 413(a) is supported by the decisional law of the Commonwealth Court and by public policy.</p>

In interpreting the final sentence of Section 413(a), the Commonwealth Court has long drawn a distinction between claimants who have received the full statutory allotment of partial disability benefits, and those whose benefits were suspended during the applicable 500-week period based upon their ability to generate a pre-injury wage. As to the former category (those who have received partial disability benefits for 500 weeks), the Commonwealth Court’s published opinions consistently indicate that total disability benefits are in fact available upon demonstration of deterioration in the claimant’s condition, and subject to Section 413(a)’s three-year limitation commencing upon receipt of the final payment of partial disability compensation. <em>See French v.

Employer’s interpretation, however, cannot abide a plain reading of the final sentence of Section 413(a), which opens with the phrase: “[Wjhere compensation has been suspended because the employe’s earnings are equal to or in excess of his wages prior to the injury____”. Thus, the words that follow (“payments under the agreement or award may be resumed at any time during the period for which compensation for partial disability is payable”) cannot operate to foreclose the receipt of total disability benefits by claimants, such as Claimant herein, who have never regained the ability to generate wages at the pre-injury level and as to whom, accordingly, compensation has never been suspended for such reason. .</p>

Additionally, such distinction would appear difficult to maintain in cases in which the claimant has received partial disability benefits as well as experienced suspension of benefits in various time increments throughout the pertinent 500-week period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Nevertheless, we are not free to disregard the express limitation in scope attached to the final sentence of Section 413(a) under the pretext of pursuing the spirit of the enactment. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). As important, we are not convinced that the legislative purpose underlying Section 413(a) would support Employer’s interpretation. Indeed, the unexplained disparity in treatment between claimants based upon the extent to which their disabilities have abated during the 500-week period would seem to present a more appropriate basis for questioning those decisions which interpret the expiration of the 500-week period as a bar to the assertion of total disability claims by employees who have experienced a suspension of benefits (for example, <em>Edgewater, Deppenbrook </em>and Roussos), since such construction is less solidly grounded in the plain meaning of Section 413(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Significantly, an employee with a fixed and stable, but partially-disabling, condition may receive the protection of a substantial period of subsidy (approximately nine and one-half years), within which to adjust to his disability and maximize his earning capacity consistent with his physical limitations. At a minimum, assuming no worsening of the employee’s condition, the employee retains his physical capacity to generate the amount of earnings previously subject to supplementation. The same cannot be said, however, where an employee’s condition deteriorates to the point of total disability, or work within the claimant’s restrictions ceases to be available, such that the employee no longer retains the ability to support himself and his dependents in any fashion. Since these circumstances diverge substantially in terms of the impact of cessation of benefits upon the injured employee, it is not surprising that the legislative scheme of compensation allows for differential treatment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The Commonwealth Court has held that, in a case involving suspension of benefits, the 500-week period begins as of the effective date of the suspension. <em>See, e.g., Roussos, </em>157 Pa.Cmwlth. at 588, <a href="/pa-commw/157/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="630 A.2d 555" data-case-ids="1449095" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/157/0584-01">630 A.2d at 557</a>. This could be read to suggest that, in a case where partial disability benefits have been received and are subsequently subject to suspension, a fresh 500-week period begins upon suspension. We reject such an interpretation, however. Section 413(a) refers, in the singular, to “the period for which compensation for partial disability benefits is available,” which is the period commencing upon the earlier of the commencement of compensation for partial disability <em>or </em>suspension. <em>See generally Goodrich v. WCAB (Shenango China), </em>165 Pa.Cmwlth. 217, 220, <a href="/pa-commw/165/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="645 A.2d 302" data-case-ids="1463101,7861750" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/165/0217-01,/a2d/645/0302-01">645 A.2d 302</a>, 304 (1994).</p>

Thus, its primary, direct application is to permit a claimant whose benefits are in suspension to avoid the effect of Section 413(a)’s three-year'limitations period applicable to claimants whose benefits have been <em>terminated. See Bellows v. WCAB (Shabloski), </em><a href="/a2d/663/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="663 A.2d 267" data-case-ids="7867683" data-case-paths="/a2d/663/0267-01">663 A.2d 267</a>, 269-70 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995); <em>USX Corp. v.

Underlying this substantive effect is a clear and sound policy justification — since a suspension for economic reason benefits an employer, the employer would be ill-heard to complain if a claimant’s subsequent loss of earnings power triggers restoration of benefits within the statutory period of eligibility. <em>See Goodrich, </em>165 Pa.Cmwlth. at 220, <a href="/pa-commw/165/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="645 A.2d 302" data-case-ids="1463101,7861750" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/165/0217-01,/a2d/645/0302-01">645 A.2d at 304</a> (quoting <em>D &amp; T Brooks, Inc. </em>v. <em>WCAB (Knight), </em>38 Pa.Cmwlth. 223, 228, <a href="/citations/?q=392%20A.2d%20895" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="392 A.2d 895">392 A.2d 895</a>, 898 (1978)). Certainly by implication, the statute also requires that periods of suspension be included within the 500-week calculation for purposes of determining when partial disability benefits have expired. <em>See generally id.; Dillon, </em><a href="/pa/536/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="536 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1843144" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0490-01">536 Pa. at </a>504 n. 3, <a href="/pa/536/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="640 A.2d 386" data-case-ids="1843144,7861845" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0490-01,/a2d/640/0386-01">640 A.2d at </a>392-93 n. 3. A further inference is required, however, to support the conclusion that all post-500-week claims (including those for total disability) on the part of a claimant whose benefits have been suspended are precluded. Moreover, as noted, this would not appear to be as reasoned an inference, as we perceive no apparent sound policy justification for distinguishing be-, tween partially-disabled claimants who have received a full complement of partial disability benefits and those who have experienced some period of suspension, in terms of the effect of the expiration of 500 weeks upon potential future claims. We decline to resolve this question in the present appeal, however, since the appropriate facts are not before us; we merely note that the opinion in this case should not be read as an endorsement of the pertinent reasoning from <em>Edgewater, Deppenbrook </em>and <em>Roussos.</em>

Employer argues that the Court’s suggestion was that an employer’s liability for all forms of disability ceases absolutely after 500 weeks if no petition seeking compensation for total disability has been filed. While <em>Dillon </em>did not specifically state to the contrary, the context of the quoted statement renders its meaning plain, as the Court was elaborating upon a comparison of suspension of benefits to partial disability compensation in connection with its clarification of the standard of proof required to obtain an increase in benefits sought <em>within </em>the 500-week period. It is also clear from the related text that the Court was not suggesting that all forms of compensation were entirely foreclosed, since the Court was addressing a claimant’s respective burdens in <em>overcoming </em>a suspension versus a termination. <em>See generally Shipley Oil Co. v.
