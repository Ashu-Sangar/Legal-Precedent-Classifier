Appellant aimed a nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol at Gunnet and forced her into the passenger seat. He then drove the car to Indian Rock Dam Road, an isolated area, while his girlfriend, Christina Noland, followed him in a car they had stolen from June Ohlinger in Schuylkill County. While the two ears were stopped on Indian Rock Dam Road, Noland heard three gunshots. Soon afterwards, appellant sped off in Ms. Gunnet’s car.

At that time, appellant informed Maldonado that he had a nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol that was “dropping them like flies.” Michelle Rhinehart, appellant’s ex-wife, testified that less than 24 hours after the murder of Ms. Gunnet appellant gave her several rings that were later identified as belonging to Ms. Gunnet. Appellant also offered her several credit cards at the same time. Charles Carothers, another of appellant’s acquaintances, testified that he heard appellant offer Rhinehart credit cards that appellant said would have to be used the next day. Carothers further testified that appellant confessed that he had shot his brother and had killed “these other ladies.” Appellant told Carothers that he had thrown one woman off of a bridge and “the other lady he ran over with her ear and she got stuck under it.” Carothers also testified that appellant was in possession of the silver nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol that was later identified as the weapon that fired at least two of the three nine-millimeter bullets recovered from Ms. Gunnet’s car.</p>

Specifically, they forced June Ohlinger into the passenger seat of Ohlinger’s car at gunpoint, drove her to a remote, wooded area and shot her in the back of the head.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Commonwealth witness Dr. Richard Bindie, a board certified anatomical and clinical pathologist and forensic pathologist, testified that Mrs. Ohlinger had sustained a gunshot wound to the back of the head consistent with the use of a full-metal-jacket bullet.

Specifically, appellant claimed that his appointed counsel were in fear of him to such an extent that rendered them incapable of representing him properly. In response, counsel informed the court that, while there was a level of distrust, they would represent appellant to the best of their abilities. Notably, counsel never asked to withdraw.</p>

Appellant then requested that new standby counsel be appointed, renewing his claim that counsel’s alleged fear of him would prevent them from adequately acting as standby counsel. That request was denied, and appellant proceeded to repre-. sent himself in jury selection, assisted by appointed standby counsel.</p>

In response to appellant’s threats and attempts to manipulate, the court took appropriate measures to ensure the safety of counsel and appellant’s right to effective, conflict-free representation.

We further noted that the Rule recognizes the “inherent discretionary power left to the district attorney, including the discretion as to which individuals shall be prosecuted and which shall not.” <em>Spotz I, </em><a href="/pa/552/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="552 Pa. 499" data-case-ids="559493" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0499-01">552 Pa. at 520</a>, <a href="/a2d/716/0580-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="716 A.2d 580" data-case-ids="11702884,559493" data-case-paths="/a2d/716/0580-01,/pa/552/0499-01">716 A.2d at 590</a>. Logically, since the rule recognizes some degree of deference to the Commonwealth’s decision whether to consolidate a case, deference should also be given to the Commonwealth’s decision <em>not </em>to proceed with consolidation. In addition, appellant cites no authority, and our research has uncovered none, which supports the notion, essential to his argument, that once cases have been consolidated, they must be tried together unless one of the defendants, rather than the Commonwealth, successfully moves for severance. Such a rule would be inadvisable to say the least, considering that a co-defendant may elect to plead guilty before trial or the Commonwealth may elect not to proceed against a co-defendant at all. It would be nonsensical for the trial court to insist that a co-defendant proceed to a joint trial merely because a remaining defendant prefers that course. This is especially so where one co-defendant becomes a cooperating witness on behalf of the prosecution.</p>

It was not. The Commonwealth’s motion to sever could not have come as a surprise to appellant; in the eleven months preceding trial, neither Noland nor her counsel were present at any proceedings related to appellant’s case. Furthermore, appellant was well aware that Noland was going to testify for the Common<a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>wealth just as she had in <em>Spots </em>I — indeed, there was evidence that he was plotting to kill her in order to prevent her from testifying against him. Finally, the granting of the motion did not prejudice appellant in his attempt to shift the blame to Noland for this particular murder. Noland was the Commonwealth’s key witness and appellant had a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine her under oath. Throughout the trial, appellant sought to persuade the jury that it was Noland, rather than he, who had murdered Penny Gunnet. Had the jury accepted that defense, it could have assigned blame accordingly. The fact that appellant stood trial alone did not in any way hinder his ability to present his defense. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting the Commonwealth’s motion to sever.</p>

He also asserts that the videotapes cemented the Commonwealth’s theory of the case without requiring the Commonwealth to cure unidentified “hearsay” issues or to prove the facts as narrated in the videotapes prior to their being shown.

There is no reason to doubt the veracity of this statement. But even if the trial court had not conducted a preliminary <em>in camera </em>review, that fact would not automatically entitle appellant to relief. The purpose of <em>in camera </em>review is to determine admissibility.

The Commonwealth articulated several reasons for admission, not the least of which was the fact that the tapes would help the jury, which had been drawn from Delaware County, better understand the area in which the crime occurred, the time frame and the course of events. In addition, the Commonwealth made a proffer showing that the tape of the route the cars traveled was made under conditions that were substantially similar to those obtaining when the crime occurred. Appellant was free to argue why this proffer, and the evidence introduced in support of the tapes, was insufficient to prove their authenticity and relevance.

Even if it is assumed that the disclosure here could be deemed tardy, appellant has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced. Appellant had already been tried in Clearfield and Schuylkill Counties for the crimes that were the subject of the discovery. Therefore, he was familiar with the testimony of the witnesses in those cases. In fact, the Schuylkill County trial had ended just one month before the commencement of appellant’s trial in the instant case. Furthermore, as appellant concedes in his brief, the materials that he was seeking were in the hands of <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>the attorneys who represented him in the Clearfield and Schuylkill County cases. If prompt acquisition of the materials were imperative, he could have obtained the transcripts from his former attorneys, or could have asked his standby counsel in the instant case to obtain the transcripts for him. He did not do so. In light of these facts, any claim of prejudice rings hollow. Furthermore, even three years after the trial, appellant points to nothing specific in the transcripts that the alleged tardy disclosure prevented him from developing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> It is clear that appellant was not prejudiced by the fact that he did not receive the transcripts sooner.

Dr. Bindie testified that Ohlinger had “an obvious injury on top of her head and [that he] checked for rigor mortis and other signs of post mortem interval at the scene.” He further testified that Ohlinger’s skull “was open like an exploding type injury and the skull underneath the scalp was all exposed.” The doctor also gave detailed testimony about the entrance and exit wounds.

But, as we have already held, evidence of the killing of June Ohlinger was relevant and admissible, and its relevance was not confined to the rather euphemistic fact that she was “shot.” It was also relevant that appellant shot her after stealing her car, just as he did Ms. Gunnet. Furthermore, Dr. Bindie’s testimony established that Ms. Ohlinger died from a “pass-through” wound to the head caused by a large caliber “full metal jacket” bullet. This information was clearly relevant because it tended to show that appellant intended to kill Ms. Gunnet, whom he also shot with a large caliber full metal jacket bullet. It also tended to prove appellant’s identity as the killer, a point he disputed at trial. Thus, appellant’s claim that the evidence was admitted solely to establish his propensity to commit violent crimes is baseless.</p>

Appellant represented that these “mugshots” were necessary to his defense because they showed that his appearance differed from that of the witnesses’ descriptions of the white male they saw near the crime scene on the day of the murder. The trial court ultimately concluded that it would not be necessary to delay the trial until appellant had received these materials.

Initially, we reject appellant’s suggestion that, merely because certain evidence of appellant’s previous crimes was <em>relevant and admissible </em>in this prosecution, the crimes must be deemed to be part of the same criminal episode. Other crimes evidence may be admissible, as it was here, for a wide variety of evidentiary purposes; but that fact alone does not prove such a logical connection between the acts so as to constitute a single criminal episode. This is particularly so where, as here, the evidentiary purpose and relevance of the other crimes testimony differs from its use in the previous prosecution. For example, the evidence that appellant shot his brother in Clearfield County was admissible here to, <em>inter alia, </em>complete the story and to explain the motive — the need to escape — for the killing here. When evidence of the killing was introduced in the Clearfield County prosecution, however, it was not for <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>that attenuated point of relevance; instead, it was direct evidence of appellant’s guilt for killing his brother.</p>
    <p id="b593-5" data-blocks='[["BL_593.5",593,[183,483,1155,1177]]]'>Although evidence of the previous two killings was certainly relevant here, that fact does not alter the essentially independent nature of the crimes. These were three different homicides, occurring in different counties, on different days, and generating separate criminal investigations in the separate counties. The first killing occurred on January 31, 1995, in Clearfield County, when appellant shot and killed his brother, Dustin Spotz, following a family argument. The second killing occurred a day later, in Schuylkill County, where appellant and Noland had fled after the first killing. In need of an automobile to facilitate their escape, they randomly selected June Ohlinger as their victim, stole her car, robbed her of her jewelry and money, murdered her, and then fled to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The murder in this case then occurred only after appellant and Noland had returned to Pennsylvania on February 2, 1995. They proceeded to York County and, fearing that they might be caught and arrested in Ohlinger’s car, proceeded to abduct another person whose misfortune it was to randomly venture across their murderous path, Penny Gunnet. After duping Ms. Gunnet into stopping, appellant abducted her at gunpoint, killed her, and then stole her rings, credit cards, and other valuables.</p>
    <p id="b593-6" data-blocks='[["BL_593.6",593,[183,1702,1157,683]]]'>What connects the three killings is not the sort of temporal or logical relationship that requires joinder under § 110. Rather, the common denominator is appellant. But the proof as to each of the killings was largely independent. For example, appellant killed his brother during a heated family argument, during which appellant himself suffered stab wounds. Consistent with the unique circumstances attending the first killing, appellant faced charges in Clearfield County, not of murder, but of manslaughter. That trial focused only on what happened in the family home. The subsequent crimes appellant committed once he fled from Clearfield County had little to do with evaluating that already-completed scenario.</p>

      <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>Similarly, the subsequent abductions and killings in Schuylkill and York Counties were confined to those counties, and independent investigations were conducted by local law enforcement officials therein. Although Noland was a key witness in both prosecutions, she was hardly the only witness. For example, in this case, the Commonwealth called numerous witnesses to establish that appellant was seen on Indian Rock Dam Road near the time of the murder. Further, the Commonwealth called Ms. Gunnet’s husband and auto mechanic to the witness stand as well as the police officer who investigated the Gunnet crime scene. There was also a great deal of evidence presented relating to the wound to appellant’s leg, which helped to prove his guflt here. This evidence was not relevant to the two previous trials. Thus, this is not a case in which the' Commonwealth relied solely upon the same witnesses) to prove each ■ of the killings.’ Instead, the cases generated testimony of different lay and police witnesses as well as the establishment of separate chains of custody. <em>See Bracalielly, </em><a href="/pa/540/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="540 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="472136" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0460-01">540 Pa. at 473-74</a>, <a href="/pa/540/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="658 A.2d 755" data-case-ids="472136,7872367" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0460-01,/a2d/658/0755-01">658 A.2d at 762</a>.

The trial court also refused to admit evidence that, following the murder of Penny Gunnet, appellant murdered another woman in Cumberland County. Nor did it allow in evidence that Dustin Spotz had died as a result of the gunshot wounds inflicted by appellant. Thus, the trial court took seriously its responsibility to balance the relevancy and evidentiary need for the other crimes evidence against its prejudicial effect.</p>

Appellant abducted June Ohlinger, drove her in her car to a rural area, shot her with a large caliber weapon loaded with full metal jacket bullets, and threw her body off of a bridge. In this case, appellant abducted Penny Gunnet, drove her to a rural area, shot her with a large caliber weapon loaded with full metal jacket bullets, and ran over her body. The similarity in these crimes was relevant to show both the identity of the killer and that appellant intended to kill Penny Gunnet.</p>

The killing of Penny Gunnet did not occur in a vacuum, and the jury should hot have been left with a misimpression that it did. Evidence of the prior crimes was admissible so that the jury could have an accurate understanding of the natural development of the facts here.</p>

The only specific assertion made by appellant is that “there is information contained in the discovery regarding statements made by the co-defendant about looking through one of the victim’s purses.” According to appellant, this information contradicts the co-defendant’s trial testimony on page 223 where, appellant says, "the co-defendant claimed, she did not touch the victim’s purse.” Brief of Appellant p. 36. Appellant has mischaractcrized Noland’s testimony. Noland never stated whether or not she touched the purse. All that she said was: “and he (appellant) went through the lady’s purse and stuff.” Furthermore, this portion of Noland’s testimony concerns the murder of June Ohlinger, not the murder of Penny Gunnet.</p>

However, he does not explain why he thinks this is so, nor does he cite any authority in support of his contention.

We noted in <em>Brown </em>that the language employed by the prosecution was distinctive; indeed, it could be found in each of the three synoptic gospels. <em>See </em>Matthew 18:6 ("But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea”); Mark 9:42 ("And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea”); Luke 17:2 ("It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones”). From the distinctive language and the reference to "that book,” it was clear that the prosecutor was invoking the New Testament.</p>

Appellant cites <em>Brown </em>as prohibiting reliance upon the Bible in any manner during a penalty phase closing. <em>Brawn, </em>of course, was merely applying <em>Chambers. </em>The "reliance” prohibited by the cases — a reliance explicitly invoked by the prosecutor in those two cases — is a reliance upon the Bible as a source, independent of Pennsylvania law, for returning a verdict of death. Moreover, we note that <em>Brown </em>was decided two years after the trial here. The prosecutor did not commit misconduct by making an argument that was not at the time disapproved by this Court. No doubt, that is why appellant failed to object to the innocuous reference, if he even recognized its origin in the first place.</p>
