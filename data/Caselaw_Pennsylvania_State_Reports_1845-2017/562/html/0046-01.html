She recounted that Appellant would awaken her in her bedroom and then take her into the bathroom and remove her clothes. He would <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>have her wring out his wet jeans by walking on them in the bathtub. Afterwards, appellant would have V.M. step out of the tub and face away from him, and then he would touch her and engage in anal intercourse with her.

V.M. testified that appellant told her that if their mother learned about the incidents, she would abandon her just as their father had. The girls’ mother stated that Appellant moved out of the home in 1985; they divorced in 1987.

Dr. Carver testified that she found no evidence of physical trauma to the girls’ genital or anal areas. N.T. at 114-15. According to Dr. Carver, the absence of physical trauma did not prove that the abuse had never occurred. N.T. at 115.

Finally, the dissenters argued that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its probative value, especially since it was introduced on direct, á situation which only confused or prejudiced the jury; the dissent did indicate, however, that if “the defense has asserted that the evidence of physical trauma is an element that must be proven in an assault case”, then it would be proper for the Commonwealth, on rebuttal, to introduce the expert testimony. <a href="/a2d/690/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="690 A.2d 274" data-case-ids="11923077,11980799" data-case-paths="/a2d/690/0274-01,/pa-super/456/0251-01">690 A.2d at 279</a>.</p>

The jurors, as factfinders, are entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating the evidence and rendering a decision based on the evidence presented and the inferences deduced therefrom.

Given this passage of time, Dr. Carver’s testimony was relevant to explain to the jurors the absence of physical trauma.

He, asserts that since Dr. Carver rendered two opposing opinions, her testimony is speculative and thus does not help jurors, but rather confuses them and forces them to speculate. Initially, we note that Dr. Carver in fact rendered only one opinion, viz., the examination results were inconclusive. Moreover, we recently addressed a similar issue in <em>Hawk, supra, </em>in which we determined that the trial court abused its discretion in precluding the defense from admitting testimony of a forensic scientist regarding the negative test results of a rape kit. We rejected the lower court’s concern that the testimony was speculative, stating “[t]he inconclusiveness of the negative test results does not render the scientist’s testimony inadmissible.” <a href="/a2d/709/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="709 A.2d 373" data-case-ids="11830600,507862" data-case-paths="/a2d/709/0373-01,/pa/551/0071-01">709 A.2d at 377</a>.

Appellant’s counsel cross-examined the expert witness in order to explore the reliability of her findings, and in fact was able to elicit an explanation of the results that was helpful to the defense. The jury, upon hearing all of these theories, was able to accept or reject any part of the expert’s testimony.

Specifically, he claims that apart from the examination of the children in 1989, there <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>was no new evidence of abuse. Appellant reasons that Dr. Carver’s conclusions were based on facts not of record, and argues that without the facts, the jury is unable to determine the validity of the expert’s opinion. Thus, appellant concludes, the prejudicial impact of the evidence outweighs its probative value and the jury is forced to speculate. In <em>Commonwealth v. Rounds, </em><a href="/pa/518/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="518 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1811666" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0204-01">518 Pa. 204</a>, <a href="/pa/518/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="518 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1811666" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0204-01">542 A.2d 997</a> (1988), we held that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the testimony of an expert that a child had been abused, since the expert’s testimony was based on a case history which was not before the jury.

N.T. at 113-15. Additionally, the victims themselves testified as to the sexual abuse. As a result, the jury was able to properly evaluate Dr. Carver’s testimony.

Appellant reasons that the jury essentially is asked to conclude that the assaults occurred because the expert stated that there was no physical evidence to prove the assaults, thereby allowing the Commonwealth to prove its case through “non-evidence.” This claim has no merit. Dr. Carver did not offer only one biased view of the physical evidence; to the contrary, defense counsel elicited an explanation which was equally favorable to appellant. Moreover, the trial judge clearly advised the jury that they were not bound to accept the expert’s testimony merely because she possessed special skill or knowledge. N.T. at 253. The law presumes that the jury follows the court’s instructions. <em>Commonwealth v.
