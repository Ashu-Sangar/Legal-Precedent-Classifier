The kidnappers threw the victim into a waiting van and took him to the apartment of Rasheema Washington (Washington), who was a close friend of Malik Bowers (Bowers), one of Appellant’s co-conspirators.</p>
    <p id="b320-7" data-blocks='[["BL_320.7",320,[253,1032,1169,682]]]'>Washington, who expected nothing other than that Bowers would soon present himself at her apartment, was stunned at rthe group’s unannounced arrival. She watched the kidnappers throw the victim onto the floor of her apartment, beat him and demand money. In addition, she noticed that the group had tied the victim’s hands behind his back, bound his legs, gagged him and pulled a hat over his face to prevent him from seeing them or his surroundings. Washington further observed Appellant and another member of the group, Allistar Durrante (Durrante), enter her bedroom and use the telephone there. After about a half-hour, and at Washington’s insistence, the kidnappers left Washington’s residence, bringing with them the still bound and gagged victim.</p>

The caller identified <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>himself as the man who had robbed Hall several weeks prior to that evening. Additionally, the caller responded affirmatively when Hall asked him if he was “Rasheed.” The caller, whom Hall now recognized as Appellant, informed Hall that he and his co-conspirators had the victim and that they intended to kill him if they were not paid $20,000.00 within fifteen minutes.</p>
    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[204,704,1153,736]]]'>Following this initial conversation, Hall telephoned the house of the victim’s mother and described the details of the ransom call to the victim’s brother, Selvan Haynes (Haynes). Alarmed, Haynes immediately went to his brother’s apartment. Subsequent to arriving at the victim’s apartment, Haynes received a second telephone call placed by the kidnappers about fifteen minutes after the initial call. Again, the group declared that they had the victim and that they intended to kill him if they did not receive $20,000.00 in ransom. Haynes attempted to reason with the caller, pleading that obtaining such a large sum of money in such a short time would be impossible for him. The caller responded by exclaiming that the group was not joking, after which he abruptly hung up the telephone.</p>
    <p id="b321-5" data-blocks='[["BL_321.6",321,[206,1464,1154,681]]]'>Before returning to his mother’s house, Haynes arranged to have the incoming telephone calls to the victim’s apartment forwarded to his mother’s house. Shortly after that, Haynes received a forwarded call at his mother’s residence, the third placed by the group. The caller repeated the group’s demands. In response, Haynes offered the kidnappers $3,000.00 in cash and his two vehicles; the kidnappers rejected this offer. The kidnappers called again, and in this instance, they allowed Haynes to speak with the victim. The victim begged his brother to do something to save his life. The group called one final time and repeated their demands; and following that, neither Haynes nor Hall had any further contact with the group.</p>

While the group was in the movie theater, a police officer patrolling the parking lot noticed that the vehicle in which the group had been riding did not have a license plate. In searching the car’s dashboard for a vehicle identification number, the officer noticed a gun jutting out from under the front seat of the car. The officer called for backup and three additional officers joined him in his surveillance of the vehicle. When Appellant, Bowers, Washington and the others returned and entered the automobile, the officers ordered the group from the car.

      <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>On appeal to this Court, Appellant raises six issues for our review. First, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to grant a mistrial after the prosecutor elicited a witness’ subjective feelings concerning her belief that Appellant was a violent person. Second, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in its jury instruction regarding the need for an accomplice or co-conspirator to have the individual specific intent to kill to support a conviction of first-degree murder. Third, Appellant asserts that the trial court erred by not granting a mistrial at the penalty stage when the prosecutor asked a defense witness about the possibility that Appellant could be pardoned. Fourth, Appellant believes that the trial court erred in not granting a mistrial due to the prosecutor’s purportedly unfair reference to the murder as an execution in his closing argument at the guilt stage of trial. Finally, Appellant’s last two arguments are attacks on the sufficiency and on the weight of the evidence. Because we find that Appellant is not entitled to relief on any of his claims of error, we must affirm the sentence of death.</p>

The record establishes that Appellant and three other men abducted the victim and brought him to Washington’s apartment. While there, Washington observed the group beat the victim and demand money. Also, as evidenced by the testimony of the victim’s brother, Haynes, and the victim’s friend, Hall, the group placed telephone calls threatening to kill the victim if they did not receive $20,000.00. In at least one of these calls, Appellant acknowledged that he was the person whom Hall knew as Rasheed. Sometime later that evening, the victim’s dead body was discovered with four bullet wounds to the back of the head in a vacant lot close in proximity to both the site of the abduction and Washington’s apartment. Moreover, about a week after the murder Appellant was with Bowers, one of his co-conspirators, when Mont<a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>gomery County authorities arrested Bowers and confiscated a gun.</p>
    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[239,452,1161,884]]]'>Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prosecution presented evidence to the jury to support a finding that Appellant willingly and consciously participated in the intentional killing of the victim. The evidence demonstrated that the Appellant took part in a conspiracy to abduct the victim for ransom. The evidence further confirmed the Commonwealth’s theory that the group followed through on their threat to kill the victim when the victim’s brother failed to surrender the requested amount of money. While the police were unable to deduce exactly which of the kidnappers ultimately killed the victim, the prosecution still managed to produce evidence to support a finding that Appellant, on his own, whether he actually pulled the trigger or not, maintained the requisite specific intent to take the victim’s life. This clearly satisfies the statutory elements of first-degree murder, and the evidence is therefore sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>

Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor’s statement and moved for a mistrial. The trial court overruled the objection and permitted the prosecutor’s reference to the defendant’s alleged drug use.

At the end of trial, however, the trial judge found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that drug use served as the motive for the defendant’s actions. Thus, in his closing charge, the trial court cautioned the jury to ignore any statements or testimony regarding the defendant’s purported drug use, including the prosecutor’s statement in his opening remarks.</p>

The nature of the challenged statement in <em>Satzberg, </em>as compared with the one challenged here, is completely different. In <em>Satzberg, </em>the prosecutor made a direct and unambiguous comment in his opening statement that the defendant had a history of drug use. This is unlike the vague statement made by the Commonwealth’s witness here. More important, the jury in <em>Satzberg </em>was permitted to contemplate the prosecutor’s statement during the entire trial, as the statement was made in opening argument and the trial judge only cautioned the jury at the end of the trial after it became apparent that the evidence did not support drug use as a motive. The Superior Court believed that this tainted the entire trial to a point where a cautionary instruction in the closing charge would be ineffectual. By contrast, the trial judge in the present matter immediately discounted the witness’ statement and instructed the jury to disregard the statement because there was no evidence in the record to support Washington’s purported fear of Appellant.

In addressing that matter, we noted that under general principles of conspiratorial liability a defendant can be held criminally responsible for the entirety of the acts of his eo-eonspirators performed in furtherance of the conspiracy, regardless of whether the defendant intended that certain acts be undertaken. Stated differently, a defendant can be held accountable for the actions of his or her co-conspirators al-. though the defendant did not specifically intend for the co-conspirators to perform these acts. This Court went on to contrast this rule of law with the specific intent requirement of first-degree murder. We stressed that the specific intent to kill was the particularly heinous element that made first-degree murder the only crime punishable by the imposition of death. We recognized in <em>Wayne </em>that there is a patent incongruity between conspiratorial liability, where a defendant • can be held criminally responsible for acts he or she did not specifically intend to take place, and first-degree murder, where a defendant must maintain the specific intent to kill.</p>

Defense counsel asked Bowers’ mother during his <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>direct examination: “You understand the other option is life imprisonment without parole, <em>he’ll never be released from jail? ” </em>(N.T. 12/18/97, p. 49 (emphasis added).)
