    <p id="b238-10" data-blocks='[["BL_238.11",238,[221,1241,1161,680]]]'>This is an appeal from an order of Superior Court which vacated a judgment of the court of common pleas and remanded for a new trial in a medical malpractice case involving claims of negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, lack of informed consent, and misrepresentation. The case was brought by the parents of a deceased child. Malpractice is the alleged cause of the child’s death. We granted allowance of appeal on the issue of whether a parent’s contemporaneous sensory perception of an intentional tort inflicted upon a child is necessary before recovery can be obtained by virtue of the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46(2) for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The factual background of the case is as follows.</p>

Approximately six hours later she was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with a tentative diagnosis of pneumonia. Her condition deteriorated, and, at approximately 10 a.m. she was intubated and placed on a ventilator. A chest x-ray <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>taken at 11 a.m. revealed that the endotracheal tube inserted earlier had been misplaced into her right main stem bronchus. Another x-ray, taken at 1:30 p.m. showed that the tube had been properly repositioned. The tube had been in an improper position for somewhere between one and three hours.</p>
    <p id="b239-4" data-blocks='[["BL_239.5",239,[212,613,1152,854]]]'>Later that day, Dr. Peter Trinkaus, the physician in charge of Ka-Rin’s care at Einstein, determined that in order to provide proper treatment it would be necessary to gain information obtainable only through an invasive diagnostic procedure known as a Swan-Ganz catheterization of the heart. Dr. Trinkaus consulted a cardiologist, Dr. John Wertheimer, who agreed that such a procedure was warranted. Drs. Trinkaus and Wertheimer spoke with the patient’s mother, Margaret Taylor, who then consented orally to performance of the catheterization. Testimony at trial differed as to whether she consented only to having Dr. Wertheimer perform the procedure, or whether her consent included Dr. Trinkaus, who admittedly had less experience with the procedure than Dr. Wertheimer. The procedure was in fact performed by Dr. Trinkaus, but Ka-Rin died at approximately 6:25 p.m. while the procedure was in progress.</p>

The jury also found that the conduct of Dr. Trinkaus had been outrageous and that it had been a substantial factor in causing emotional distress to Margaret Taylor. The jury awarded Margaret Taylor $500,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress. Judgment on the verdict was entered by the trial court. An appeal was taken to Superior Court. That court held that the trial court erred in refusing to submit to the jury the issues of lack of consent, misrepresentation, and punitive damages. It vacated the judgment and remanded for a new trial on all issues.</p>

Superior Court held that Margaret Taylor could recover damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress for conduct directed at her daughter even though she did not observe the conduct at the time it occurred. During the allegedly wrongful performance of the catheterization, Margaret Taylor was in another room of the same hospital .building. In that sense, she was not “present” when the procedure was performed. The issue of “presence” arises from a requirement expressed in the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46(2) that, where distress caused by wrongful conduct directed at a third person is claimed, the plaintiff must have been “present at the time” of the conduct in order to recover damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Moreover, the actor can reasonably be expected to know of the emotional effect which-his or her conduct is likely to produce where the person is present. By way of comparison, the emotional effects are generally lessened where the individual learns of the outrageous- conduct long after its occurrence and by means other than through his or her own personal observations.

The cases thus far decided, however, have limited such liability to plaintiffs who were present at the time, as distinguished from those who discover later what has occurred. The limitation may be justified by the practical necessity of drawing the line somewhere, since the number of persons who may suffer emotional distress at the news of an assassination of the President is virtually unlimited, and the distress of a woman who is informed of her husband’s murder ten years after<a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>ward may lack the guarantee of genuineness which her presence on the spot would afford.</blockquote>

The mistreatment of a corpse tort has no such requirement, under either the Restatement or the caselaw. This is not surprising given the nature of the conduct at issue when mistreatment of a corpse is alleged. Such mistreatment is extremely unlikely to occur in the presence of the deceased’s family.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> In short, presence is not required because, as a practical matter, such a requirement would almost always nullify the tort itself.</p>

I agree that, as in the case of negligent infliction of emotional distress torts, presence requires, at a minimum, a contemporaneous sensory perception of the outrageous act. <em>See Mazzagatti v. Everingham, </em><a href="/pa/512/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="512 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1800448" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0266-01">512 </a><a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a><a href="/pa/512/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="512 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1800448" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0266-01">Pa. 266</a>, 279-80, <a href="/pa/512/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="516 A.2d 672" data-case-ids="1800408,1800448,1800458" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0265-01,/pa/512/0266-01,/pa/512/0265-02">516 A.2d 672</a>, 679 (1986). Appellees claim that Mrs. Taylor was “present,” even though she was not in the room where the surgical procedure occurred, because she could hear the electronic tone of the defibrillator from the nearby waiting room while the surgical procedure was being performed. But, as the majority notes, the outrageous conduct that was alleged to have caused Mrs. Taylor severe emotional distress consisted of Dr. Trinkaus operating on Ka-Rin in violation of the consent to operate provided by Mrs. Taylor to the more experienced Dr. Wertheimer. As distressing as it undoubtedly must have been for Mrs. Taylor to hear the defibrillator alarm sound as Ka-Rin’s heart stopped beating, neither that sensory perception, nor her learning the devastating fact that Ka-Rin had died, conveyed the identity of who performed the procedure. There was no way to discern by any sensory perception, from outside the room, which doctor had performed the procedure. The primary tragedy here was Ka-Rin’s death. Mrs. Taylor did have time to steel herself to that tragedy before learning the entirely separate and, at least for purposes of this tort, unrelated fact that Dr. Trinkaus performed the procedure. Accordingly, appellees failed to establish that Mrs. Taylor was present when the alleged outrageous conduct occurred.</p>
    <p id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[230,1558,1163,728]]]'>Finally, the majority does' not state one way or other whether it would adopt § 46, noting only that the section sets forth “the minimum elements” necessary to sustain such a cause of action. I must admit to having some reservation about the section, a reservation only heightened by the facts of this case. Although the fact that Dr. Trinkaus performed the procedure may have been distressing to the plaintiffs, I am uneasy with the notion, accepted by the jury here under the Restatement test, that that conduct can be deemed “outrageous” conduct which “intentionally or recklessly” caused “severe emotional distress” to Ka-Rin’s mother. The propriety of the jury’s findings on these points, however, is not before us. Thus, I would leave to another day the question of the adoption, and contours, of the tort described in section 46(2).</p>

Subsection 46(1), which governs situations where the outrageous conduct is directed at the person who suffered the emotional distress, does not have a presence requirement. Appellees argue that they satisfied this subsection because Margaret Taylor gave consent only for Dr. Wertheimer to perform the surgery; when Dr. Trinkaus performed the surgery instead, appellees claim, that was outrageous conduct aimed at Mrs. Taylor. The viability of a claim under subsection 46(1), however, was not the basis for the Superior Court’s opinion, nor was it the <em>subject </em>of the allocatur grant.</p>
