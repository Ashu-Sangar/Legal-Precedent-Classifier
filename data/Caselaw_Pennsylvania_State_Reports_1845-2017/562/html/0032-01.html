However, that discretion, like the discretion provided to juries under the death penalty statute, is guided by the specific factors that must be considered in making that determination. That the relevant factors may weigh in favor of different results is neither surprising nor problematic; rather, it reflects reality. Although each juvenile is an individual, he is also a member of a community. The needs of an individual are often at odds with the needs of society. The exercise of discretion routinely requires a balancing of competing concerns. Furthermore, nothing in the Juvenile Act countenances or encourages arbitrariness in the balancing process. In contrast, the interpretation that appellant suggests is constitutionally required would essentially eliminate discretion entirely. But the constitution does not disfavor discretion. Therefore, the transfer provisions of the Juvenile Act are not unconstitutional merely because they provide for flexibility and discretion rather than for the rigid assignment of a <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>specific weight to each of the factors to be considered in determining whether transfer is in the public interest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

But there is nothing unconstitutional in the legislature determining, in light of continued experience with violent juvenile crime, that other serious conduct also warrants criminal court treatment. In <em>Williams, supra, </em>this Court, in addressing the propriety of the legislature’s determination that a juvenile charged with murder should be prosecuted as an adult, noted that ‘‘[mjurder is a heinous and serious crime, and the legislature’s assumption that one who commits murder is in need of adult discipline and restraint is a reasonable one.” <em>Williams, supra </em>at 71, <a href="/pa/514/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="514 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1804587" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0062-01">522 A.2d at 1063</a>. That rationale is equally applicable to the violent offenses that were excluded from the definition of a delinquent act under the most recent amendments to the Juvenile Act. Armed robbery, too, for example, is a heinous and serious crime, and the legislature’s informed determination that juveniles fifteen years of age and older who commit such offenses are not initially amenable to rehabilitation under the Juvenile Act, unless they prove otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence, is equally reasonable.

In <em>Williams, </em>the Court held, over this author’s objection, that 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9791-9799.6 ("Megan’s Law”) violated federal due process requirements by imposing a presumption that a person convicted of a sexually violent offense is a sexually violent predator, placing the burden on the offender to rebut that presumption, and providing for significantly enhanced penalties, up to a mandatory life term of imprisonment, if the offender failed to rebut the presumption. The transfer provision of the amended Juvenile Act is distinguishable from Megan’s Law’s sentencing procedure in several respects.</p>
      <p id="b105-8" data-blocks='[["BL_105.6",105,[230,991,1123,1122]]]'>First, Megan’s Law created a statutory presumption that persons convicted of certain crimes were sexually violent predators. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9794(b). The Juvenile Act, on the other hand, does not create any statutory presumption about the juvenile, but merely excludes certain violent offenses from the definition of delinquent acts and provides a transfer provision that places the burden of proof on the defendant. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6302. More significantly, the <em>Williams </em>Court concluded that the "full panoply” of due process protections, including placing the burden of proof on the Commonwealth, <em>see </em><a href="/pa/557/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="557 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="56718" data-case-paths="/pa/557/0285-01">557 Pa. at </a>304 n. 12, <a href="/a2d/733/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="733 A.2d 593" data-case-ids="11546868,56718" data-case-paths="/a2d/733/0593-01,/pa/557/0285-01">733 A.2d at </a>602 n. 12, was required because the enhanced punishment proceeding was "a separate factual determination, <em>the end result of which is the imposition of criminal punishment ....” Williams, supra </em>at 304, <a href="/a2d/733/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="733 A.2d 593" data-case-ids="11546868,56718" data-case-paths="/a2d/733/0593-01,/pa/557/0285-01">733 A.2d at 603</a> (emphasis added). In such a circumstance, this Court held that the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Specht v.

The transfer proceeding in the Juvenile Act is not a separate factual proceeding leading to punishment. Even if the defendant fails to establish that it would serve the public interest to transfer his case to juvenile court, <em>punishment </em>will result only if and when the defendant is convicted. That conviction, in turn, will only occur following a trial at which all due process protections are afforded. As this Court noted in <em>Pyle, </em>because the Commonwealth continues to bear the burden of establishing every element of the crime charged before any punishment will result, there is no due process infirmity. <em>Pyle, supra </em>at 623 n. 12, <a href="/pa/462/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="462 Pa. 613" data-case-ids="485197" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0613-01">342 A.2d at </a>107 n. 12.
