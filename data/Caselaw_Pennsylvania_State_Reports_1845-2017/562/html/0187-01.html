Merritt of the Pennsylvania State Police Tactical Narcotics Team. The affidavit related that, on May 2, 1996, while executing a search warrant at a residence in Dauphin County, Trooper Merritt found a large quantity of controlled substances, as well as various receipts, paraphernalia, and records chronicling drug trafficking activity. The documentation revealed the location where controlled substances were being distributed, the quantity, and the amount of money related to the distribution. At this residence, Trooper Merritt also encountered a person identified in the affidavit only as “C.I. [confidential informant] # 1,” who was later identified at the suppression hearing as Richard David Osborne.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Osborne decided to cooperate with the police. As part of his cooperation, Osborne explained that, on April 29, 1996, he had delivered four (4) pounds of marijuana to appellant, Michael Glass, at a price of $1,500 per pound. Appellant still owed Osborne $6,000 for the marijuana.</p>

Trooper Merritt and two other troopers searched Osborne and his vehicle. Finding no cash or drugs, the troopers then followed Osborne to appellant’s residence and watched him enter the residence. Approximately one hour later, Osborne met the troopers at a predetermined location and Osborne handed the troopers $6,000 in cash that appellant had paid him. Osborne relayed to the troopers that appellant stated that he wished to purchase as much additional marijuana as Osborne could secure, <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>and that the marijuana should be delivered to appellant’s residence on May 9th.

    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[259,614,1160,360]]]'>Trooper Merritt also related that members of the Pennsylvania State Police Strike Force and members of the Attorney General’s Bureau of Narcotics Investigations informed him that they were familiar with appellant and knew that he was involved in drug trafficking. A criminal history check of appellant revealed that appellant had a previous arrest for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance.</p>
    <p id="b250-6" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[254,999,1161,733]]]'>Trooper Merritt further noted in the affidavit that he had secured a large quantity of marijuana through state police sources and had made arrangements with Osborne to deliver the marijuana to appellant on May 9, 1996 — the same day on which he was seeking the search warrant. The trooper concluded the affidavit by noting that he was requesting an anticipatory search warrant to be served and executed upon delivery of the marijuana by Osborne to appellant at appellant’s residence, and that the request was being made in order to keep appellant from using or distributing the drugs that were to be delivered. A district justice authorized the warrant on May 9, 1996, at 3:15 p.m., with the directive that it be served as soon as practicable but no later than within the next two following days.</p>

Trooper Merritt gave Osborne a quantity of marijuana and an alert pager, a device similar to other pagers but which sends out a radio signal when activated, and instructed Osborne to activate the pager as soon as he delivered the marijuana. Osborne entered appellant’s residence with the marijuana and, approximately five minutes later, Trooper Merritt’s alert pager sounded. After troopers met with Osborne at a pre-determined location, they searched him and his vehicle, and finding no marijuana, proceeded to execute the search warrant at appellant’s residence.</p>

The Superior Court found that appellant waived the latter two issues, since they were not presented to the suppression court, and rejected on the merits his broad state constitutional challenge to anticipatory search warrants. <em>Glass, </em><a href="/a2d/718/0804-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="718 A.2d 804" data-case-ids="11688215" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0804-01">718 A.2d 804</a>.</p>

In <em>Baker, </em>the search warrant affidavit recited, <em>inter alia, </em>that, between the 5th and 12th of March, 1981, the defendant had a controlled substance, T.H.C.,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> in his possession, and had delivered a substance containing T.H.C. to an informant on numerous occasions. The previous deliveries were made to the informant inside the defendant’s residence while the informant was under the control of police surveillance officers. The defendant told the informant and others that, he was expecting a larger quantity of T.H.C. on or about the 11th or 12th of March. On the basis of this information, a magistrate issued a search warrant on March 12th. In upholding the magistrate’s finding of probable cause, we noted that “[p]robable cause exists when the magistrate is presented with evidence which would cause a reasonable man to believe that a crime is being, <em>or is about to be committed.” Id. </em>at 28, <a href="/pa/513/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="518 A.2d 802" data-case-ids="1802517,1802545,1802568" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0023-01,/pa/513/0023-02,/pa/513/0022-02">518 A.2d at 805</a> <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>(emphasis supplied). Such a belief was warranted in <em>Baker </em>because there was evidence not only that a crime (possession of a controlled substance) was being, or had recently been, committed, but also because there was reliable information “that <em>another crime was about to be, </em>or had been, committed, <em>i.e., </em>the delivery of [the controlled substance].” <em>Id. </em>at 29, <a href="/pa/513/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="518 A.2d 802" data-case-ids="1802517,1802545,1802568" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0023-01,/pa/513/0023-02,/pa/513/0022-02">518 A.2d at 805</a> (emphasis added).</p>

To Professor LaFave, approval of anticipatory search warrants is the “better view.” “As one court put it: ‘The probable cause doctrine does not require that the contraband to be seized must presently be located at the premises to be searched, only that there is probable cause to believe ... that evidence [of crime] can likely be found at the described locus at the time of the search.’ ” LaFave, <em>supra </em>at 364, <em>citing U.S. v.

LaFave goes on to note that, “[i]f it is believed desirable that whenever possible the police should obtain advance -judicial approval before making a search of private premises” — a belief that has been embraced in much of this Court’s separate search and seizure jurisprudence under Article I, § 8<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> — “then there is good reason to uphold the anticipatory warrant procedure.” LaFave, <em>supra </em>at 364.</p>

So long as a factual averment is reliable and probative of the likelihood that evidence will be found where and when the warrant is to be executed, there is no reason why it may not be considered. A showing that contraband recently <em>was </em>at a location is one way of predicting that it will likely still be there in the future. But it is not the only way, nor is it even the most reliable way. Reasonable persons routinely undertake affairs of conse<a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>quence based not only upon what <em>has </em>happened, but also upon what they reasonably expect <em>will </em>happen. Were it otherwise, appellate lawyers and judges, for example, would see no reason to prepare for a scheduled oral argument. . Furthermore, evidence of anticipated future events often is far more reliable in a probable cause analysis than evidence concerning past observations precisely because they avoid the often troublesome question of staleness. <em>See </em>LaFave, <em>supra </em>at 366 (“it may fairly be said that as a general proposition the facts put forward to justify issuance of an anticipatory warrant are more likely to establish that probable cause will exist at the time of the search than the typical warrant based solely on the known prior location of the items to be seized at the place to be searched”). <em>See also Glen, </em><a href="/citations/?q=331%20N.Y.S.2d%20656" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="331 N.Y.S.2d 656">331 N.Y.S.2d 656</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20N.E.2d%20614" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="282 N.E.2d 614">282 N.E.2d at 617</a> (“In cases like these the certainty of future possession is greater or is often greater than that based on information of past and presumably present possession.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> It would be the height of impracticality to ignore such evidence.</p>

Similarly, a magistrate considering an anticipatory warrant is assessing whether there is <em>then </em>probable cause to believe that evidence will be found when the warrant <em>is to be </em>executed. Our analysis simply recognizes that, in making the practical determination of <em>what </em>amounts to probable cause, the magistrate may consider likely future events, subject to the sorts of specificity and reliability strictures attending all probable cause evaluations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

Nothing in a prospective or “anticipatory” warrant poses any more threat to the warrant and probable cause requirements of the Pennsylvania Constitution than the “conventional” warrant appellant prefers. To the contrary, the warrant furthers the concern for privacy which those provisions protect. This is not only because the future-oriented information is often more reliable — such as here, where it involves the certain delivery of contraband within the control of the police — but also because anticipatory warrants interpose the review of a neutral magistrate <em>before </em>the intrusion will occur — a practice we have consistently encouraged.</p>

At that point, police are forced to choose <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>between attempting to obtain a search warrant, or conducting a warrantless entry and search immediately after the delivery in the belief that sufficient exigent circumstances exist to justify that action. The former course risks distribution or destruction of the contraband, while the latter runs the risk of suppression if the courts disagree with the on-the-spot police assessment of probable cause and exigency.
