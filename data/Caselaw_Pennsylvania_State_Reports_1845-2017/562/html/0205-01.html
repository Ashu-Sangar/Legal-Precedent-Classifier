Rich also stated that USX had not provided earplugs until 1990. Rich acknowledged that his nonoecupational activities and pre-USX employment in the U.S. Army exposed him to loud noises.

Dr. Duerksen conducted an audiogram of Rich and determined that he had suffered a 30% binaural hearing loss according to the AMA Guides. Dr. Duerksen attributed the entire hearing loss to Rich’s long-term exposure to noise at USX. A medical expert hired by USX, Douglas Chen, M.D., presented different results. Dr. Chen, also board certified in otolaryngology, testified in his deposition that an examination of Rich revealed a 20.5% hearing loss, pursuant to the AMA Guides. Dr. Chen attributed 6.8% of his hearing loss to presbycusis and 13.7% of the hearing loss to occupational noise.

Because Act 1 expressly provides for use of the AMA Guides to determine degree of hearing impairment, without mentioning any other standards; the AMA Guides do not discuss or apply any methodology to factor aging into hearing loss calculations; and the ISO 1999 employs a general statistical formula based only on the age of individuals, the WCJ ruled that it could not consider the effects of presbycusis when evaluating claims of work-related hearing loss. Furthermore, the WCJ noted that Dr. Chen admitted that long-term industrial exposure was the most important cause of Rich’s hearing loss. Applying the statutory formula for compensation for occupational hearing loss, the WCJ awarded a benefit of $509.00 per week for 53.3 weeks plus costs and attorney’s fees to Rich.</p>

It concluded that the legislature did not intend to “vitiate the normal principle that an employer is responsible for a disability caused by a combination of work-related and [nonwork-related] factors if the work-related factors were a substantial contributing factor to the injury even though a claimant may have been more susceptible to that type of injury because of his age or preexisting condition.” <em>USX Corp., </em>727 A.2d at 166. It stated that the phrase “at or prior to the time of employment” in Section 306(c)(8)(vi) merely demonstrates the legislature’s intent to eliminate the application of the “last injurious exposure rule” in situations where two or more employers were responsible for an employee’s hearing impairment. The Commonwealth Court conveyed that prior to Act 1, the last employer who employed an employee, who suffered any work-related injury, including loss of hearing could be liable for the total work-related injury. The Commonwealth Court has explained that the purpose of applying the “last injurious exposure rule” to hearing loss disabilities was to assure compensation for an injury that usually occurs progressively and stems from cumulative exposure to occupational noise. <em>See Sellari v.

The consideration of the history of Section 306(c)(8)(iii) and the fact that the plain language of Act 1 does not allow for an age-related deduction indicates that the General Assembly did not intend to allow an age-related deduction from the total percentage of hearing impairment. Because the General Assembly knew how to provide for a deduction for normal aging and did not, and the legislature specifically provided that the AMA Guidelines were to be used, we can only conclude that the General Assembly intended to exclude ISO 1999 as a standard of measurement, even if it allowed an age-reduction. Just as in a case where an employee suffers a back injury, absent a clear expression from the General Assembly, we would not terminate or suspend benefits simply because a claimant could have returned to work in half the time but for the normal wear and tear of life as a result of aging.

Finding Katz’s testimony to be credible, the WCJ found that LTV Corporation completed its stock purchase of J &amp; L by November of 1974. Katz testified that when LTV acquired J &amp; L, LTV assumed all of the decision-making powers at the Aliquippa plant but continued to operate the facility under the J &amp; L name, with the addition of the LTV name. In 1978, LTV acquired Youngstown. In 1981, LTV merged J <em>&amp; </em>L with Youngstown, with J &amp; L as the surviving company. In 1984, LTV purchased Republic and merged it into J &amp; L, with Republic being the surviving entity. LTV then changed the name of Republic to LTV Steel Company. Katz conceded on cross-examination that, as the successor-in-interest of J &amp; L, LTV assumed all of J &amp; L’s assets, as well as all of its liabilities, including workers’ compensation claims existing at the time of the 1974 merger. LTV became responsible for paying all claims that arose before 1974. From Katz’s testimony, the WCJ determined that LTV was the only employer responsible for the injuries suffered by Mozena.</p>
