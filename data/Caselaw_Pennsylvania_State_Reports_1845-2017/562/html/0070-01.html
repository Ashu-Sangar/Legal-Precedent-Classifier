Appellant, armed <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>with this hammer and a kitchen knife, first went to the bedroom of his sleeping mother-in-law, Donna, and hammered her three times in the head and then slit her throat and face with the knife, killing her. Leaving her blood-soaked body, he turned his attention to Donna’s two-year-old baby, Lance.

Neither child survived.

The trial court conducted a degree of guilt hearing on January 10, 1992. At the commencement of the degree of guilt hearing, the trial court engaged in a second colloquy, which addressed Appellant’s decision not to present any defense to the Commonwealth’s charges. After entry of the Commonwealth’s evidence, the trial court found Appellant guilty of five counts of first-degree murder. During the penalty phase proceedings on Appellant’s capital murder convictions that followed, the trial court conducted a third colloquy, this time addressing Appellant’s decision not to present any evidence of mitigating circumstances or to in any way defend the Commonwealth’s request for a sentence of death. After hearing the Commonwealth’s evidence regarding aggravating circumstances, the trial court determined that a penalty of death was appropriate for four of the murder convictions and that a penalty of life imprisonment was appropriate for the remaining murder conviction. In his automatic direct appeal to this Court, Appellant presented no claim of error and, on December 9, 1993, this Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v.

In the amended PCRA petition, Appellant alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to override Appellant’s decisions as to trial strategy at the penalty stage, specifically, Appellant’s demand that trial counsel not present mitigating evidence or defend the Commonwealth’s request for the imposition of a death sentence. The PCRA court conducted hearings on the matter, at which Appellant and trial counsel testified. The PCRA court denied Appellant’s PCRA petition concluding that trial counsel had advised Appellant properly concerning all aspects of the criminal proceedings, and in particular, that trial counsel informed Appellant that the trial court would likely impose a death sentence if Appellant chose not to present mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial. Furthermore, the PCRA court noted that the trial court had required psychological and psychiatric evaluations of Appellant prior to the entry of his guilty plea, which evaluations established that Appellant was competent to stand trial and was able to fully comprehend the consequences of not presenting evidence as to mitigating circumstances. The PCRA court concluded that Appellant did not present evidence to establish that he was incapable of making knowing and intelligent decisions and that trial counsel could not be deemed ineffective for not overriding Appellant’s directives. This Court affirmed the decision of the PCRA court on August 20, 1998. <em>Commonwealth v.

The PCRA court dismissed the petition without a hearing. The PCRA court, however, vacated its initial order and conducted a hearing solely for purposes of addressing the issue of timeliness.

      <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>Appellant’s argument on this issue has various dimensions. To begin, Appellant maintains that he has a right to effective assistance of counsel during the post-conviction process. Appellant then makes the layered claim that the attorney who represented him in his first PCRA petition (PCRA counsel) was ineffective for failing to raise numerous issues before both the PCRA court and this Court concerning trial counsel’s ineffectiveness. With regard to trial counsel’s ineffectiveness, Appellant specifically points to trial counsel’s alleged failure to appreciate Appellant’s diminished mental state when Appellant directed trial counsel to refrain from presenting mitigating circumstances at the penalty stage of trial. Against this backdrop, Appellant presents numerous aspects of what he considers to be newly discovered evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> According to Appellant, this evidence, which he believes establishes that he was not mentally competent when he directed trial counsel not to present mitigating circumstances, should have been further explored by PCRA counsel, and therefore, PCRA counsel’s failure to do so constituted ineffectiveness. Finally, Appellant adds that he filed the current petition within 60 days of the discovery of the facts upon which his claim is based. Appellant argues that the 60-day proviso is satisfied because he filed his current petition within 60 days of current counsel’s receipt of the PCRA file and discovery of the new evidence that highlights PCRA counsel’s ineffectiveness.</p>

Although Appellant formulates his assertions here in terms of the discovery of new facts not previously known to him, it is readily apparent that Appellant’s argument, at its essence, is a claim for ineffective assistance of PCRA counsel layered on top of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness.

Nevertheless, hoping to gain the benefit of the exception, Appellant fashions the argument that the basic facts concerning PCRA counsel’s representation, which allegedly highlight that PCRA counsel was ineffective, were not . known to Appellant until current counsel reviewed the file. However, subsequent counsel’s review of previous counsel’s representation and a conclusion that previous counsel was ineffective is not a newly discovered “fact” entitling Appellant to the benefit of the exception for after-discovered evidence. In sum, a conclusion that previous counsel was ineffective is not the type of after-discovered evidence encompassed by the exception.</p>

In <em>Pursell, </em>the appellant argued before this Court <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>in support of his second PCRA petition that because he possessed only a layman’s knowledge of the law he could not have been aware of prior counsel’s ineffectiveness until his current counsel undertook his representation. Like Appellant here, the appellant in <em>Pursell </em>also asserted that he satisfied the 60-day requirement because he filed his second PCRA petition within 60 days of current counsel’s receipt of the his file.

    <blockquote id="b141-5" data-blocks='[["BL_141.5",141,[247,893,1110,570]]]'>[T]he allegation of ineffectiveness of counsel for failure to put forward available claims does not excuse compliance with the timeliness requirements of the PCRA. Therefore, the 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(ii) exception does not apply where the petitioner merely alleges that more competent counsel would have presented other claims based on a better evaluation of the facts available to him or her at the time of trial, and we reject [the ajppellant’s contention that the “facts” which form the bases of these claims were not knowable until he was advised of their existence by present counsel.</blockquote>

The rationale of our <em>Pursell </em>decision is equally applicable to the present discussion.
