For the reasons that <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>follow, we hold that DOT can suspend a driver’s license under these circumstances.</p>

    <p id="b399-5" data-blocks='[["BL_399.6",399,[204,570,1150,533]]]'>On March 5, 1995, Charles R. Schrankel (Appellant) was arrested for DUI in Ohio. At the time of his arrest, Pennsylvania had not yet enacted the Compact; but on December 10, 1996, our legislature did make the Compact the law of this Commonwealth. Then, on March 21, 1997, Appellant was convicted in Ohio for his previous DUI arrest. Ohio is a party to the Compact and accordingly, reported Appellant’s conviction to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (DOT). DOT, in turn, suspended Appellant’s driving privileges based upon the reported conviction.</p>
    <p id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.7",399,[204,1127,1155,692]]]'>Appellant appealed this suspension to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (trial court), challenging DOT’s authority to suspend his license under the Compact because the Ohio incident occurred prior to Pennsylvania’s enactment of the Compact. The trial court held that the “Ohio crime and conviction transpired well before” the effective date of the Compact and determined that the suspension acted as a retroactive application of law. The trial court mistakenly assumed that Appellant’s conviction, in addition to the arrest, pre-dated enactment of the Compact. The Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that the trigger date for purposes of the Compact is the date of conviction, which in this case indisputably occurred after the enactment of the Compact.</p>

Pointing to Article TV of the Compact, he asserts that the provisions of the Compact regarding suspension of licenses are triggered on the date an offense occurs, not on the date of conviction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> DOT, on the other hand, contends that the application of the <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>Compact for conduct occurring before the effective date of the Act is not an improper retroactive law because Article IV of the Compact specifically indicates that the event that triggers the suspension provisions is the driver’s conviction.

Indeed, the Compact captions Article III, “Report of Conviction” and Article IV, “Effect of Conviction.” Further, the Compact at Article III quite succinctly states that the authorities “shall report each conviction” to the home state. It is only after the report of conviction is received in the home state that the authorities, pursuant to Article IV, look to the <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>conduct involved to assess what effect that such conduct shall have in the home state. We find this matter substantially similar to that presented in <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Zdrok, </em><a href="/pa/538/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="538 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="475546" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0041-01">538 Pa. 41</a>, <a href="/pa/538/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="645 A.2d 830" data-case-ids="475546,7867118" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0041-01,/a2d/645/0830-01">645 A.2d 830</a> (1994), where an attorney challenged his license suspension for criminal conduct that occurred before his admission to the bar, but whose conviction occurred after such admission. In rejecting his arguments that his suspension was an <em>ex posto facto </em>law, we stated that:</p>
    <blockquote id="A4S" data-blocks='[["BL_401.5",401,[239,772,1110,794]]]'>This argument is wholly without merit. The constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws does not apply to statutes which do not involve imposition of penal sanctions. We do note that retroactive application of the adoption of a statute or a change in the statute can offend due process. Here, however, the conduct for which (the attorney) is being disciplined was the conviction, not the commission of the crime, although the commission was of course a necessary component. Moreover, that conduct was subject to discipline when it was committed, assuming a conviction thereon; it is only (the attorney’s) status that changed. He is being disciplined not as a result of an adoption of a rule or a change in the rule, but as a result of his admission to the profession of law. Thus, there is simply no retroactive application of a law.</blockquote>
