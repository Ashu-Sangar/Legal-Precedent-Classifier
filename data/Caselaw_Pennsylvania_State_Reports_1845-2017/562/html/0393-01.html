    <p id="b455-4" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[204,464,1154,1239]]]'>Appellee, Virginia McCann (“McCann”), was employed by CR’s Friendly Market (“Employer”) until April 30, 1996, when she was discharged for allegedly looking through a co-employee’s purse. McCann subsequently applied for unemployment compensation benefits, which were initially denied by the Job Center upon a finding of willful misconduct. At the ensuing hearing before the unemployment compensation referee, Employer’s manager, Gregory Golden, testified that McCann had searched the purse of another employee, Katina Fisher, looking for a two-dollar bill that had previously been in the drawer of the cash register. Mr. Golden explained that, although he did not personally observe the incident, the circumstances of its occurrence were conveyed to him by Ms. Fisher and another employee, John Watts. Mr. Golden specifically stated that McCann was discharged for “looking through another employee’s personal property without their permission.” Employer also offered an unsworn statement signed by Mr. Watts explaining the incident. McCann, acting <em>pro se, </em>testified that she had tried to purchase the two-dollar bill from the cash register only to learn that it was missing. McCann denied having searched Ms. Fisher’s purse, explaining that she had accidently observed the two-dollar bill in the side pocket of the purse while picking it up and showed the subject bill to her coworker, Mr. Watts.</p>
    <p id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.6",455,[205,1725,1154,562]]]'>Following the hearing, the referee awarded benefits upon concluding that Employer offered no evidence of willful misconduct by McCann. On Employer’s appeal, rejecting McCann’s testimony as not credible, the Board found that McCann intentionally and purposefully looked into Ms. Fisher’s purse, thus invading the privacy of a co-worker, without good cause. Concluding that McCann’s conduct violated the standards of behavior that Employer could rightfully expect from its employees, the Board held that McCann engaged in willful misconduct disqualifying her from receiving unemployment compensation benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

During the pendency of that appeal, counsel for McCann unsuccessfully sought agreement from the Board for a remand, again raising the hearsay nature of Employer’s evidence, and arguing that such evidence could not be corroborated solely by the Board’s disbelief of McCann’s testimony. The Board maintained that its adjudication was sustainable on the ground that McCann engaged in willful misconduct, not only by looking into Ms. Fisher’s purse, but also by showing the two-dollar bill to her co-worker.</p>

The Commonwealth Court then rejected the Board’s alternative theory of affirmance, explaining that:</p>

Instead of agreeing with Claimant’s arguments and withdrawing its <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>opposition thereto, the Board contends that Claimant had nevertheless engaged in willful misconduct by showing the two dollar bill to her co-worker. However, Employer did not raise Claimant’s showing the two dollar bill to a coworker as a basis for her discharge, there was no work rule prohibiting such conduct on the part of Claimant, and the Board, in its decision, did not state that such conduct was the basis for its determination that Claimant had engaged in willful misconduct. As such, the Board is precluded from raising that issue as a grounds for discharge for the first time on appeal, and we refuse to consider the Board’s argument on that issue.</blockquote>

Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, </em><a href="/a2d/723/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="723 A.2d 246" data-case-ids="11756207" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0246-01">723 A.2d 246</a>, 250 (Pa.Cmwlth.1999). The majority proceeded to examine the Board’s conduct during the appellate process, concluding that the advancement of a different but unsupported theory for affirmance, made in the Board’s capacity as an advocate, constituted vexatious and obdurate conduct warranting the imposition of counsel fees under Rule 2744. <em>See <a href="/a2d/723/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="723 A.2d 246" data-case-ids="11756207" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0246-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/723/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="723 A.2d 246" data-case-ids="11756207" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0246-01">at 251</a>. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Smith, joined by Judge Doyle, explained that attorney’s fees may only be awarded against a state agency if expressly authorized by statute. <em>See McCann, </em><a href="/a2d/723/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="723 A.2d 246" data-case-ids="11756207" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0246-01">723 A.2d at 252</a> (Smith, J., dissenting). Judge Smith found no express statutory authority pertaining to adjudicative agencies, such as the Board, and reasoned that the majority’s distinction between the Board’s actions as a quasi-judicial entity and its conduct as a respondent on appeal was too subtle and would lead to applications for fees under Rule 2744 whenever a party disagreed with an agency decision or argument. <em>See <a href="/a2d/723/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="723 A.2d 246" data-case-ids="11756207" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0246-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/723/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="723 A.2d 246" data-case-ids="11756207" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0246-01">at 253</a>. In a separate dissenting opinion, Judge Leadbetter agreed that an adjudicative tribunal can be subject to fees under Rule 2744 for conduct undertaken in defense of its decision during appellate review, but would have concluded that the Board’s conduct in the present case was not obdurate, dilatory or vexatious. <em>See McCann, </em><a href="/a2d/723/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="723 A.2d 246" data-case-ids="11756207" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0246-01">723 A.2d at 253</a> (Leadbetter, J., dissenting). Judge Leadbetter viewed the Board’s advocacy, like that of any other party on appeal, as permissibly seeking affirmance on an alternative ground.</p>
    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[228,1967,1159,419]],["BL_459.1",459,[198,339,1152,747]]]'>Presently, the Board argues that the imposition of attorney’s fees under Rule 2744 encroaches upon its quasi-judicial immunity; penalizes its adjudicative functions; renders those functions subject to the threat of external pressures; and compels the Board to admit error in its decision-making process. The Board further contends that the award of attorney’s fees violates the doctrine of sovereign immunity, as there exists no express statutory authorization for the assess<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>ment of fees against an administrative agency defending its adjudication on appeal. McCann, on the other hand, following the reasoning of the majority opinion of the Commonwealth Court, explains that attorney’s fees were not awarded against the Board for actions occurring in the adjudicatory process, but rather, for its conduct as an appellate litigant, thus negating any claim of quasi-judicial immunity. Regarding the Board’s assertion of sovereign immunity, McCann posits that the Legislature’s authorization of the underlying action against the Board for unemployment compensation benefits constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity, rendered the Board a party subject to an award of benefits, and sanctioned the imposition of counsel fees under Rule 2744 as an exercise of judicial authority.</p>
    <p id="b459-4" data-blocks='[["BL_459.5",459,[199,1128,1156,800]]]'>Resolution of these competing arguments would necessarily implicate questions touching upon the respective roles and interests of coordinate but constitutionally separate branches of government. Quasi-judicial agencies should be afforded the ability to perform their administrative and adjudicative functions as part of the executive branch of government free from excessive interference by the judiciary. At the same time, however, courts possess an inherent authority to guard the integrity of judicial proceedings by sanctioning egregious conduct of litigants. In determining whether and under what circumstances this latter power can be invoked to impose sanctions against the Commonwealth and its agencies, courts must be particularly circumspect, as, in our systems of checks and balances, this is one area in which the judiciary by necessity must render the final pronouncement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The undisputed facts, arising primarily from McCann’s own statements, establish that McCann did look in her co-worker’s purse; the only controverted issue centered upon whether she did so accidentally or intentionally. Although Employer offered no direct evidence of McCann’s intent, such direct proof of an actor’s state of mind, often being impossible to obtain, is frequently inferred from the circumstances surrounding the actor’s conduct. The circumstantial evidence associated with the incident at issue, including McCann’s frustrated desire to purchase the missing two-dollar bill, suggests a course of conduct that provides arguable support for the Board’s inference that McCann deliberately looked into the purse. Furthermore, although the Board’s alternative argument for affirmance, namely, that McCann knowingly conveyed private information in pursuit of a personal economic interest, was contrary to the Commonwealth Court’s precedent because it was not a reason for discharge specifically raised by Employer, the Board could, quite properly, have argued that McCann’s admitted showing of the contents of her co-worker’s purse to another employee constituted some corroborating circumstantial evidence that McCann’s actions were not inadvertent. Viewed in this light, the Board’s formulation of its arguments, although ultimately unavailing, was not so egregious as to warrant the imposition of monetary sanctions.</p>
