The charges of theft by unlawful taking or disposition and of receiving stolen property were nolle prossed prior to trial. On December 4, 1995, Lussi was convicted on the remaining charges.</p>

A concurrent imprisonment term of months to 23months was imposed on the conviction under the Local Tax Collection Law. Post-trial motions were filed by Lussi asserting, inter alia, that the Commonwealth was barred from prosecuting him on the general charge of theft by failure to make required disposition of funds when he was charged with the specific offense involving embezzlement under the Local Tax Collection Law.

Further, the official must <em>intentionally </em>take property for his own use, <em>and intentionally </em>fail to make a required payment. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3927(a). The specific statute, 72 Pa.C.S. § 5511.39, has no requirement that the official violate a known duty and does not have a mens rea for intentional conduct. Further, improper conduct can include appropriating monies for use as an “investment.” <em><a href="/pa/504/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="504 Pa. 600" data-case-ids="1787788" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0600-01">Id.</a> </em>While I would apply the analysis set forth in the Opinion in Support of Affirmance in <em>Parmar </em>to conclude that 72 Pa.C.S. § 5511.39 must have some element of culpability pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 302, it does not require “intentional” conduct. Instead, it can include merely negligent conduct. <em>See Parmar, </em><a href="/a2d/710/1083-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="710 A.2d 1083" data-case-ids="11841839,507805" data-case-paths="/a2d/710/1083-01,/pa/551/0318-01">710 A.2d at 1088-90</a>. I accordingly agree with the arguments of the Commonwealth that 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3927 contains a more stringent mens rea requirement than that required by the offense defined under the Local Tax Collection Law. Further, like in <em>Parmar, </em>I believe that the general statute has the additional element of intentionally violating a known duty, whereas the specific statute contains no such element. Because the general statute has elements outside of the specific statute, the trial court appropriately allowed the Commonwealth to proceed under both.</p>
