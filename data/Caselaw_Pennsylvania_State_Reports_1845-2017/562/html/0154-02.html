Appellant asserts that the jury was given written instructions in violation of our holding in <em>Commonwealth v. Karaffa, </em><a href="/pa/551/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="551 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="507796" data-case-paths="/pa/551/0173-01">551 Pa. 173</a>, <a href="/a2d/709/0887-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="709 A.2d 887" data-case-ids="11836992,11837105,507796,507853" data-case-paths="/a2d/709/0887-01,/a2d/709/0887-02,/pa/551/0173-01,/pa/551/0172-01">709 A.2d 887</a> (1998). A review of the record, including the transcript of the proceedings as well as the other documents that form the record, indicates that the jury was given a verdict form while still in the jury box. The court then requested that the jury read the form while sitting in the box. When the jury completed reading the verdict form, the court verbally instructed the jury as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b232-6" data-blocks='[["BL_232.5",232,[283,1474,1118,308]]]'>I’m now going to give you a booklet. In the booklet there are instructions on how to fill out the sheet that you will take out with you, and the reason I’m doing it now is to make sure that everybody reads it, so read it and when you’re done reading, look up. When I see everybody looking up, I’ll give you the final couple of paragraphs. (Pause).</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b232-7" data-blocks='[["BL_232.6",232,[280,1901,1117,306]]]'>I ask that the verdict slip that you take with you that is similar to the pages that were in your booklet that you just read, do not fill it out until after you finished discussing the case.

We also note that the verdict form used by the court was titled “FIRST DEGREE MURDER SENTENCING VERDICT SLIP.” Immediately below that was the sub-title “GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.” This sub-heading only informed the jury as to the actual time and manner in which the verdict form itself was to be completed. This form gave no instructions regarding legal issues, or the manner in which the jury would conduct its deliberations. Thus, we have no basis for doubting the lower court’s opinion which stated, “no such ‘written instructions’ [on the elements of a crime] were submitted to the jury, only a verdict slip listing aggravating and mitigating circumstances.” Slip. op. at 9. This Court has allowed printed verdict forms and understands the use of such forms to be standard practice in this situation. Since we do not find that written instructions were given to the jury, we cannot find trial counsel ineffective for failing to object.</p>
    <p id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[206,1441,1154,815]]]'>Appellant also argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the court’s instruction, based upon <em>Mills v. Maryland, </em><a href="/us/486/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="486 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6217594" data-case-paths="/us/486/0367-01">486 U.S. 367</a>, <a href="/us/486/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="486 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6217594" data-case-paths="/us/486/0367-01">108 S.Ct. 1860</a>, <a href="/us/486/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="486 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6217594" data-case-paths="/us/486/0367-01">100 L.Ed.2d 384</a> (1988). Again we find that the underlying claim, that there was a violation of the mandate of <em>Mills, </em>is without merit and therefore counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to object. In <em>Mills, </em>the United States Supreme Court found that jurors must be free to consider any mitigating evidence regardless of whether the jury unanimously agrees on the mitigating evidence. The jury must be clearly instructed on this point. In the present case, despite Appellant’s claims that the court did not instruct the jury to weigh the mitigating circumstances against the aggravating circumstances in a qualitative instead of quantitative manner, we note that the transcript shows the court gave the following instruction:</p>
    <blockquote id="b233-6" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[252,2291,1107,96]],["BL_234.1",234,[269,335,1115,94]]]'>In deciding whether aggravating outweigh mitigating circumstances, do not simply count their number.

    <blockquote id="AR5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[266,508,1120,416]]]'>you are to regard a[sic] aggravating circumstance as being present only if you all agree that it is present. On the other hand, each of you is free to regard a particular mitigating circumstance as present despite what the other jurors may believe. This different treatment of aggravating and mitigating circumstances is one of the law’s safeguards against unjust sentences. It gives the defendant a full benefit of any mitigating circumstances.</blockquote>

He presented Appellant as a man who had multiple “existences,” a repeatedly convicted criminal who was also a caring father. Counsel suggested to the jury that by sentencing Appellant to life in prison, they would be removing him from the elements that led to his criminal conduct, while allowing him to continue, at least in a limited role, as a father. At the time of counsel’s summation, Appellant already was convicted of first degree murder by the same jury , that counsel was addressing. The Commonwealth presented conclusive and undisputed evidence of Appellant’s other violent convictions, including rape and robbery. We find no error in counsel’s use of the phrase “outlaw existence” under these circumstances. For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the verdict of first degree murder and the sentence of death.</p>
