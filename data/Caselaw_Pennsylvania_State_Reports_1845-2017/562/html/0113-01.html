For the reasons that follow, we now affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b176-4" data-blocks='[["BL_176.6",176,[225,560,1155,258]]]'>The facts of this matter are not in dispute. Officer Matthew Schrum was hired by Upper Makefield Township (Township) as a full-time police officer in August 1991. He was placed on a one-year probationary status. On July 15, 1992, the Township terminated Officer Schrum’s employment.</p>
    <p id="b176-5" data-blocks='[["BL_176.7",176,[220,842,1161,903]]]'>Thereafter, the Upper Makefield Police Association (Association) filed a grievance on Officer Schrum’s behalf, demanding arbitration. After the Township refused to arbitrate, the Association filed a charge of unfair labor practices with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (PLRB). The PLRB ultimately ordered the Township to arbitrate the grievance. The arbitrator issued an order on June 2, 1994, in which he refused to reach the merits of the matter, finding that the parties had not exhausted the four-step grievance procedure listed in the 1990-1992 CBA. This four-step grievance procedure required the complaining officer to bring his grievance first to his immediate ranking officer. If he didn’t gain the relief he wanted at this first level, the grieving officer was required to pursue his grievance with increasingly senior officials, with the fourth and final step being an appeal to the Township Board of Supervisors (Board). The CBA grievance procedure did not provide for grievance arbitration.</p>
    <p id="b176-6" data-blocks='[["BL_176.8",176,[218,1770,1158,205]]]'>The parties proceeded through all four steps of the CBA grievance procedure, with the Board ultimately denying the grievance. On December 21, 1995, the Association made a demand to arbitrate this matter. The Township refused.</p>

The PLRB found in favor of the Association, on the basis that <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>our Court, as well as the Commonwealth Court, has recognized that Act 111 mandates binding arbitration of all grievances arising under collective bargaining agreements negotiated pursuant to Act 111. Thus, the PLRB concluded that the Township’s refusal to arbitrate constituted an unfair labor practice and ordered the Township to make an offer to proceed to grievance arbitration<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> over the discharge of Officer Schrum.</p>
    <p id="b177-4" data-blocks='[["BL_177.5",177,[194,765,1152,351]]]'>The Township then appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which found that Act 111 contains no specific directive requiring grievances to proceed to arbitration and that there was no controlling case law on the issue. The Commonwealth Court therefore concluded that Act 111 does not compel a public employer to proceed to arbitration, and thus reversed the order of the PLRB.</p>
    <p id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.6",177,[194,1155,1152,302]]]'>The PLRB filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal. We granted allocatur and this appeal followed. Initially we note that, as the issue before us is whether the Commonwealth Court erred as a matter of law, our scope of review is plenary, <em>Phillips v.

    <p id="b177-6" data-blocks='[["BL_177.7",177,[196,1482,1151,405]]]'>Since Officer Schrum was a probationary employee at the time of his dismissal, we find that we need not reach a decision as to whether Act 111 compels the Township to proceed to arbitration or whether the grievance process bargained for and agreed to in the parties’ CBA controls the final disposition of the dispute. Rather, we find that a probationary police officer such as Officer Schrum is not entitled to appeal his dismissal.</p>

Implicit in the term “probationary” is that the employee is being tested or evaluated on the job. The time limit signals that the evaluation period will not last forever before a decision is made pursuant to which the employee will either be retained and thereby vested with the full rights and responsibilities of the non-probationary employee or will be terminated, having not completed the probationary period satisfactorily. As this creates' a strictly “at will” relationship between the employer and employee' during the probationary period, a probationary employee is not entitled to register a grievance should he or she not be retained past the probationary period.</p>
    <p id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.4",178,[233,1149,1160,469]]]'>This is what distinguishes those police, and firemen who come within the ambit of Act 111 protections and those who do not. Those officers covered by the umbrella of Act 111 have passed their probationary period satisfactorily and assume a status protected by the right to bargain collectively and to have their' grievances heard. Unless the terms of an officer’s probationary period specifically grant him avenues of redress, thé relationship is strictly at will and terminable by either side for the duration of the probationary period.</p>
    <p id="b178-5" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[229,1649,1160,521]]]'>Here, there is nothing in the CBA contract between the Township and its non-probationary police that would refute the at-will status of probationary officers. That being the case, and as the language of Act 111 doés not explicitly define the police arid fire fighters it was enacted to protect to' include probationary employees, we look to evidence of legislative intent to either include or segregate such officers from the rest of the force.
