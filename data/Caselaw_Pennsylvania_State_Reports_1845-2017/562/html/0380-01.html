      <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>On May 15, 1991, Lobolito, Inc., (Lobolito) and the school board of the North Poeono School District (School District) entered into a written agreement, entitled “Joint Development Agreement.” Under this initial agreement, Lobolito proposed to construct, own and operate a sewage treatment plant (STP). The STP would provide sewage disposal services to a new elementary school that the School District proposed to construct on eighteen acres of its own property located in Clifton Township. The STP would also provide sewage disposal services to a residential subdivision, which Lobolito would construct on 220 acres of its own property located in Lehigh Township. Pursuant to the Joint Development Agreement, over the next several years, Lobolito and the School District proceeded to obtain and share the costs of the necessary planning and permit approvals for the proposed STP.</p>

On December 7, 1994, while still awaiting the approval of needed permits, Lobolito and the old school board entered into a second written agreement, entitled “Memorandum of Agreement” — the agreement at issue in the present appeal. Based on the record before this Court, it appears that the newly elected board members were not yet in place at the time of the second agreement.</p>

Under this agreement, Lobolito and the School District would no longer share costs associated with attaining the remaining approvals and permits. Rather, the parties agreed that “all costs incurred in the connection with obtaining permits and approvals for the proposed sewage treatment plant shall be paid by Lobolito ... and shall be recovered by rates and charges as set forth in the Service Agreements.... ” Memorandum of Agreement ¶ 8.

The trial court granted the School District’s preliminary objections and dismissed the case with prejudice. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed, finding that the succeeding school board could not be bound by a contract executed by the predecessor board which encompassed a governmental as opposed to a proprietary function. <em>Lobolito v.

That court has recently explained, for example, that a multiyear custody and securities lending agreement between the Commonwealth’s treasurer and a bank encompasses a governmental function (safekeeping the Commonwealth’s assets) and thus was unenforceable against the succeeding Commonwealth treasurer. <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Commonwealth Treasury Dep’t, </em><a href="/a2d/712/0811-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="712 A.2d 811" data-case-ids="11820028" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0811-01">712 A.2d 811</a>, 815 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1998). The Commonwealth Court has also explained that an employment contract between a township’s supervisors and a police chief encompasses a governmental function (ensuring public safety) and thus was unenforceable against future supervisors who wanted to appoint a new police chief. <em>Falls Township v. McManamon, </em>113 Pa.Cmwlth. 504, <a href="/pa-commw/113/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="537 A.2d 946" data-case-ids="1369317" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/113/0504-01">537 A.2d 946</a>, 947 (1988). The Commonwealth Court has also found, however, that a contract between a county’s commissioners and a private contractor to operate a free-standing drug and alcohol treatment facility encompassed a proprietary and not a governmental function, and thus could be enforced against successor commissioners. <em>County of Butler v. Local 585, </em>158 Pa.

We first note, as the Commonwealth Court observed below, that the Memorandum of Agreement cannot reasonably be construed only as an agreement to provide sewage treatment services, which is arguably a proprietary function. <em>See Lobolito v. North Pocono Sch. Dist., </em><a href="/a2d/722/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="722 A.2d 249" data-case-ids="11768287" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0249-01">722 A.2d 249</a>, 253 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1998).

We find that it does. The creation and operation of public schools have traditionally been governmental functions in Pennsylvania. Our Commonwealth’s Constitution expressly charges the General Assembly with the duty to “provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education....” Pa. Const. Art. III, § 14. Moreover, our courts have noted that the right to education is a statutory entitlement in Pennsylvania and that the government has a duty to provide for and enable public education. <em>See Lisa H. v.

Indeed, the Public School Code gives local school boards the exclusive authority to decide whether and where to establish new schools. The Code provides that “[t]he board of school directors of each district shall provide the necessary grounds and suitable school buildings to accommodate all of the children between the ages of six and twenty-one years, in said district, who attend school.” Section 701 of the Public School Code of 1949, Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, as <em>amended, </em>24 P.S. § 7-701.

It also averred that through this action it sought to recover certain damages, including “costs and expenses [incurred] ... for the purpose of obtaining planning approvals for the proposed STP.” Complaint ¶ 43(a).

Since these allegations outline a theory of recovery in promissory estoppel the Complaint should survive the preliminary objection stage. <em>See Sinn, </em><a href="/pa/486/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="486 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="1757610" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0146-01">486 Pa. at 149</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="486 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="1757610" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0146-01">404 A.2d at 674</a> (demurrer cannot be sustained where cause of action entitling plaintiff to relief is properly pled); <em>Fraternal Order of Police, E.B.

The historical basis for this distinction stems from the nineteenth-century view that local governmental bodies or municipal corporations were both private corporations that engaged in proprietaiy actions and public entities that performed governmental functions. In those days, it was commonplace for municipalities to be involved in proprietaiy enterprises such as constructing wharves, building jetties, operating markets and entering into all types of joint ventures with the private sector. Agreements entered into by the municipalities that encompassed these business functions, therefore, were naturally viewed as distinct from those agreements that encompassed the municipalities’ police powers or other interests and functions of general public importance. <em>See </em>Janice G.

Since it appears that the successor municipal authorities involved in those cases never challenged the enforceability of the contracts on the basis of the governmental-proprietary distinction, and since that distinction is never discussed in those cases, we find them inapplicable here.
