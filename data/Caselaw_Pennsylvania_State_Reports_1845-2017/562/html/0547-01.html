In 1990, when Nicole was fifteen years old, her mother was diagnosed with <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>skin cancer and breást cancer for which she was successfully treated. At the same time, Nicole’s paternal grandmother was diagnosed with diabetes and pancreatic cancer, which ultimately proved fatal. Nicole apparently began to suffer emotional and psychological difficulties resulting from these family illnesses. One of Nicole’s high school teachers offered Nicole emotional support and assisted Nicole in contacting a cancer support group. Nicole soon developed a rapport with a social worker associated with the cancer support group and discussed the changes in her family life caused by her mother’s illness and her grandmother’s death. At some point in her conversations with the social worker, Nicole disclosed that her father had inappropriately touched her. Eventually, Nicole reported “flashbacks” of her father being in bed with her and on top of her. The social worker then reported this information to the local office of Children and Youth Services (“CYS”), as required by 23 Pa.C.S. § 6311.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

No physical evidence of sexual activity or sexual abuse was discovered. Pursuant to FIC’s custom, a clinical psychologist interviewed Nicole and found Nicole credible, noting that sexual abuse cannot entirely be ruled out due to a lack of physical evidence. FIC then referred Nicole to appellant, Judith A. Cohen, M.D., associated with the Child and Adolescent Sex Abuse Clinic of the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. Dr. Cohen <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>began treating Nicole for parental sexual abuse based on FIC’s referral.</p>

During the course of her treatment with Dr. Cohen, Nicole’s allegations of sexual abuse expanded to include other family members, her father’s coworkers and eventually complete strangers. Nicole also embellished her descriptions of the abuse to include ritualistic torture, multiple pregnancies and the murder of babies resulting from the pregnancies. With respect to Nicole’s increasingly outlandish accusations, Dr. Cohen stated that direct confrontation only seemed to increase the vehemence with which Nicole propounded further allegations. Dr. Cohen also attended various criminal proceedings where Nicole testified to events that could never have occurred.</p>
    <p id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.6",611,[198,1258,1154,624]]]'>Eventually, after Nicole’s increasingly bizarre allegations, the trial court held a hearing to determine Nicole’s competency to testify at the criminal proceedings. As Nicole’s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Cohen testified that, in her opinion, Nicole was unable to distinguish fact from fantasy, after which the Commonwealth dismissed the criminal charges against Nicole’s parents. The trial court then ordered that Nicole and her parents undergo family reunification therapy, which was administered by a team of mental health experts that did not include Dr. Cohen. Over the course of her new treatment, Nicole recanted her sexual abuse allegations and returned to her family home.</p>

Therefore, we hold that the non-patient parents cannot sustain a medical malpractice cause of action against their child’s psychiatrist under the circumstances of this case.</p>

There is a duty if the court says there is a duty; the law, like the Constitution, is what we make it.

When we find a duty, breach and damage, everything has been said. The word serves a useful purpose in directing attention to the obligation to be imposed upon the defendant, rather than the causal sequence of events; beyond that it serves none. In the decision whether or not there is a duty, many factors interplay: The hand of history, our ideas of morals and justice, the convenience of administration of the rule, and our social ideas as to where the <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>loss should fall.

    <p id="b614-4" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[257,912,1162,1004]]]'>Next, we must weigh the social utility of Dr. Cohen’s actions against the nature of the risk and foreseeability of harm. Unfortunately, child sexual abuse is a troubling reality in our society and reports of sexual abuse have substantially increased. <em>See </em>Third National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1996. Our legislature has responded to this socially destructive situation. <em>See 23 </em>Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq. (Child Protection Services Law). The need for prevention of child abuse is unquestionable, as is the importance of adequate psychological treatment for children who have been sexually abused. Thus, therapists who treat sexually abused children perform a valuable and useful activity to society. Here, social utility disfavors expanding therapists’ duty of care to non-patients, especially where the non-patients are the accused victimizers. However, we must also weigh this factor against the potential risk and foreseeability of harm stemming from improper treatment for children who have been sexually abused.</p>

Thus, this factor weighs in favor of imposing a duty of care. However, in this <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>matter, we must determine whether Dr. Cohen either created or foresaw the possibility of this harm. Under the facts presented, Dr. Cohen did not create the harm that was suffered by Nicole’s parents. As stated previously, Dr. Cohen did not participate in the original criminal investigation and played no legal role in Nicole’s initial accusations against her parents. Dr. Cohen was not called as a witness against the Althauses in the criminal proceedings against them. This is not a case where “false memories” were implanted by a therapist.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Dr. Cohen started treating Nicole only after CYS informed police of Nicole’s accusations and after FIC referred Nicole to Dr. Cohen. Thus, by the time Dr. Cohen became involved therapeutically, the harm to Nicole’s parents had already occurred. Although Dr. Cohen attended hearings related to the criminal charges, she did so at Nicole’s request in her professional role as her therapist. Therefore, after weighing the social utility of effective therapeutic treatment for the child against the nature and foreseeability of the harm, we find that these factors weigh against imposing a duty of care to non-patients upon a therapist who treats sexually abused children.</p>

The foundation for any successful psychiatric treatment is trust by the patient and confidentiality in communications with the provider. In treating patients who have been subjected to sexual abuse, the therapist must be able to rely upon professional confidentiality to facilitate candid discussion. Imposing an additional duty of care upon the therapist to an alleged abuser, parent or otherwise, would certainly alter this important therapeutic relationship. Initially, such an additional duty may cause mental health professionals to <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>avoid providing treatment in sexual abuse cases. Also, victims of sexual abuse may be reluctant to seek treatment if confidentiality of communications is not guaranteed. Finally, such a duty would necessarily change the very nature of the therapeutic treatment in that the therapist would have to constantly evaluate conflicting duties of care to determine the appropriate manner in which treatment should proceed. Tort law considerations should not interfere with a therapist’s job in this manner, particularly in the area of the psychological treatment of victims of sexual abuse. Accordingly, this factor weighs heavily against imposing a duty of care beyond that owed to a patient.</p>

The term "false memory” has been used in lawsuits filed by former patients and their parents against psychotherapists who utilize a controversial technique know as recovered memory therapy that critics claim permits the therapist to implant in the patient's mind false memories of sexual abuse. <em>Tuman v.

We emphasize that under the particular facts of this case Dr. Cohen’s actions did not create a duty of care owing to Nicole's parents. Thus, we disagree with the Superior Court’s conclusion that Dr. Cohen’s conduct extended far beyond the negligent treatment of Nicole. <em>See Althaus v. Cohen, </em><a href="/a2d/710/1147-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="710 A.2d 1147" data-case-ids="11844371" data-case-paths="/a2d/710/1147-01">710 A.2d 1147</a>, 1151 (Pa.Super.1998). We note that other jurisdictions that have imposed a duty of care upon therapists that extends to parents accused of sexual abuse have done so in “false memory” cases. <em>See Sawyer v.

There, we held that the mental health professional who knows of a specific and immediate threat of serious bodily injury to a third party must warn that third party of the possible future harm. Here, the harm to Nicole’s parents occurred prior to Dr. Cohen’s involvement in the case, and the ultimate dismissal of charges against Nicole’s parents was due, at least in part, to Dr. Cohen’s belated testimony that Nicole was unable to distinguish between truth and falsehoods. Thus, we decline to impose the duty appellees urge that would require a mental health professional to attempt to remedy a harm that has already occurred because we find that such a duty would thwart the treatment process.</p>
