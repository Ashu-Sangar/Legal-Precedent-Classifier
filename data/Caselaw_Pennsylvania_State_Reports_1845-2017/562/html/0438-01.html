A three-member board of arbitrators (the Board) held hearings on Daiello’s written grievance on August 2 and August 19, 1996. To support its claim that Daiello committed willful misconduct by requesting and receiving pay for hours not worked in November of 1995, the City presented documentary evidence at the hearings consisting of its own daily time records, several weekly time sheets that Daiello himself filled out and signed, and time records from the Coley Security Agency, which employed Daiello on a part time basis in 1995. The City’s daily time record for November 17, 1995 and Daiello’s corresponding weekly time sheet indicated that Daiello worked a shift at the City’s water treatment facility from 7:00 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. on that day. In addition, the City presented documentary evidence at the hearing consisting of time records from the Coley Security Agency. One of those time records, which was ostensibly filled out. by Daiello while he was patrolling various businesses and buildings on behalf of the Coley Security Agency, indicated that he was working for the Coley Security Agency from 9:00 p.m. on November 17, 1995 to 4:00 a.m. on November 18, 1995. The City of Easton also presented documents and testimony from City employees which established that Daiello repeatedly <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>failed to add the proper amount of chemicals to a chemical feed bin, failed to properly fill out chemical feed reports and failed to obtain permission before leaving the water treatment facility while on duty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The majority of the Board further concluded that although Daiello had neglected his duties on several occasions by failing to fill a chemical feed bin with the proper amount of chemicals, failing to properly complete chemical feed reports, and leaving the plant without <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>permission, his repeated neglect of his job duties did not constitute just cause for his termination because the City of Easton was not adversely affected by it.</p>

On February 27, 1998, the Court of Common Pleas entered an order denying the petition. The City of Easton then proceeded to appeal to the Commonwealth Court, arguing that the Board misinterpreted the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and that its determination that the City had failed to prove that Daiello had committed “willful misconduct” warranting his immediate termination was not supported by its finding of fact that Daiello had indeed stolen time from one of his two employers in 1995.

Judge Leadbetter, however, authored a dissenting opinion in which she reasoned that, under the facts of this case, the question of which employer Daiello was stealing from when he filled out concurrent time sheets for both of his jobs (with the City of Easton and with the Coley Security Agency) was immaterial to the question of whether he committed “willful misconduct” while he was working for the City of Easton. <em><a href="/a2d/722/1111-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="722 A.2d 1111" data-case-ids="11783138" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/1111-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/722/1111-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="722 A.2d 1111" data-case-ids="11783138" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/1111-01">at 1115</a> (Leadbetter, J., dissenting).

    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[244,1309,1162,676]]]'>Initially, we note that the issue of whether Daiello committed “willful misconduct” providing just cause for his immediate termination by stealing time from one of his two employers on November 17, 1995 is within the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, since the Disciplinary Policy contained within Sideletter A to the agreement clearly encompasses the issue in question. Therefore, the question before this Court becomes whether the Board’s award reinstating Daiello can in any rational way be derived from the disciplinary policy contained in Sideletter A to the collective bargaining agreement. If it can, then our inquiry ceases and the Commonwealth Court must be affirmed. If it cannot, then an opposite result attains.</p>

The City’s argument in this regard is based on the language contained in the disciplinary policy section of the collective bargaining agreement, which provides that any employee engaging in “willful misconduct or neglect of duty that results in significant adverse consequences to ... the City ... may be immediately dismissed....” The City contends that the Board misinterpreted this language to mean that an employee’s “willful misconduct” would only constitute just cause for his immediate dismissal if the misconduct adversely affected the City in a significant way. This contention was properly put to rest by the Commonwealth Court, which correctly determined that the Board of Arbitrators never concluded that “willful misconduct” on Daiello’s part would constitute grounds for his termination only if his misconduct adversely affected the City in a significant way. <em>City of Easton, </em><a href="/a2d/722/1111-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="722 A.2d 1111" data-case-ids="11783138" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/1111-01">722 A.2d at 1113</a>. Rather, the Board found that the City had failed to prove that Daiello had committed “willful misconduct” providing just cause for his termination because it failed to establish that it was the employer whom Daiello actually stole time from, regardless of whether or not his theft of time had a significant adverse effect on the City.</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.5",505,[188,1594,1153,461]]]'>Next, the City argues that the Board’s determination that it had failed to prove that Daiello committed “willful misconduct” is not rationally derived from the collective bargaining agreement because it is not supported by the Board’s finding of fact that he stole time from either the City or the Coley Security Agency while he was on the clock at the City’s water treatment facility. While the City’s argument in this regard is somewhat awkwardly phrased, we nevertheless find it to have merit.</p>
    <p id="b505-5" data-blocks='[["BL_505.6",505,[189,2086,1151,314]],["BL_506.1",506,[261,352,1166,954]]]'>As noted above, the Board specifically commented in its findings of fact that: “Clearly, there was a theft of time from one of the employers, however, the evidence presented was not conclusive as to whom. While the city alleged this theft occurred at the expense of the city, Coley Security could just as easily have been the victim of this theft.” Adopting the <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>reasoning of Judge Leadbetter’s dissent, the City contends that the question of which employer Daiello was stealing time from is immaterial to a determination of whether he committed willful misconduct-by claiming that he was working for both employers at the same time. In essence, the City argues that once it established that Daiello committed a theft while he was supposed to be working at the City’s water treatment facility, the Board should have found that he committed “willful misconduct” justifying his termination. In support of its argument, the City cites to several cases where this Court overturned arbitrators’ awards of reinstatement based on the notion that governmental entities/agencies do not have the freedom to bargain away those powers that are essential to the proper discharge of their functions. <em>See, e.g., Pennsylvania Liquor Control Bd., </em><a href="/pa/520/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="520 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1815573" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0266-01">520 Pa. 266</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="520 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1815573" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0266-01">553 A.2d 948</a>; <em>Musser, </em><a href="/pa/519/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="519 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="1813584" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0380-01">519 Pa. 380</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="519 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="1813584" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0380-01">548 A.2d 1194</a> (1988); <em>Philadelphia Housing Auth. v.

In rendering its decision on the merits of Daiello’s grievance, the Board did not, as the majority of the Commonwealth Court improperly assumed, have absolutely unfettered authority to interpret the term “willful misconduct” as it saw fit.

In its brief to this Court, the Union argues that the decision of the Board satisfies the essence test because the Board simply found that the City failed to prove that Daiello committed the specific infraction of which he was accused — stealing time from the City while he was actually working for the Coley Security Agency. We disagree with the Union’s myopic view of the proceedings below. Before the Board, the City was required to prove that it had just cause under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement for terminating Daiello. During the course of the hearings before the Board, the City proved the crux of its charge that Daiello committed willful misconduct justifying his termination by presenting evidence which clearly established that he filled out time sheets and collected pay from both the City and the Coley Security Agency for the same hours on the same day. In so doing, the City affirmatively established that Daiello either: (1) applied for and eventually collected pay from the City for hours when he was actually working for and being paid by the Coley Security Agency; or (2) applied for and eventually collected pay from the Coley Security Agency for hours when he was actually working for and being paid by the City. In either instance, Daiello committed a theft while he was supposed to be working at the City’s water treatment facility. Therefore, we find no merit to the Union’s argument that the City failed to establish that Daiello’s misconduct bore a close relation to his employment at the water treatment facility. To the contrary, as noted by Judge Leadbetter in her dissenting opinion below, Daiello’s successful attempt to claim entitlement to two salaries for working in two places at the same time constituted an act of dishonesty directed at both the City and the Coley Security Agency, regardless of which employer he actually stole from.</p>

Finally, we fail to see how any governmental agency could ensure the proper discharge of its official functions if it lacked the power to discharge employees (like Daiello) who were proven to have committed a theft either from the governmental agency itself or from a third party while they were working for the governmental agency.</p>

In <em>PLRB v. State College Area School Dist., </em><a href="/pa/461/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="461 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="483897" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0494-01">461 Pa. 494</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="461 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="483897" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0494-01">337 A.2d 262</a>, 268 (1975), this court proclaimed that “where an item of dispute is a matter of fundamental concern to the employes’ interest in wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, it is not removed as a matter subject to good faith bargaining....” Obviously, the parameters of discipline or dismissal are at the core of the employment relationship, and clearly fall into the category of terms and conditions of employment, and thus, are a proper subject of collective bargaining. <em>Mars Area School Dist., </em><a href="/pa/480/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="480 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1745072" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0295-01">389 A.2d at 1075</a>; <em>see also Pennsylvania State Police v.

As cogently noted by Justice Zappala in his dissent in <em>Independent State Stores Union, </em>while there may be strong policy reasons why the legislature, or the Governor, may seek to impose limitations upon agencies with respect to bargaining over discipline for, <em>inter alia, </em>theft, they have not done so. Thus, in the absence of any such dictate, or any limitation found in a collective bargaining agreement, it appears that the rights and obligations regarding discipline and dismissal remain matters subject to collective bargaining and may be interpreted and reviewed by an arbitrator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

In each of the three prior cases in which this doctrine was utilized, the employee’s conduct was both illegal and <em>directly </em>related to the employee’s role in <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>carrying out the employing agency’s function. For example, in <em>Philadelphia Housing Authority, </em>a security officer was discharged after committing fraud against one of the elderly patients with whom he was entrusted to protect. Likewise, in <em>Musser, </em>two prison guards were terminated for their repeated assault on an inmate under their vigil. Finally, in <em>Independent State Stores Union, </em>a liquor store manager was fired for theft of store proceeds over which he had responsibility. Thus, in each of these cases, the illegal act on the part of the employee was inextricably linked to the on-the-job conduct of the employee and the function of the agency.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[245,949,1161,851]]]'>■ Conversely, the facts of this case are devoid of a similar nexus. The grievant was a laborer at the City’s water treatment plant. His charge was to aid in ensuring the quality of the City’s water supply. The gravamen of the charge against the employee was that he collected wages from either the City or another employer while actually working for the other. Discipline of the grievant for this type of objectionable, yet indirect, affront to the City is simply not akin to discipline for conduct which is directly related to the employee’s role- with respect to the function of the agency or which impacts upon the integrity of the agency. Furthermore, it is critical to note that the City failed to prove against which employer the theft of time occurred or that the City was in fact harmed. Thus, application of the principle regarding limitations on the freedom to bargain over discipline or dismissal under the facts in this case is simply misplaced.</p>

Contrary to the majority’s assertion, it is not that the government agency lacks the power to discipline or to discharge an employee. It is just not an unfettered power. It is simply that the discipline and discharge of employees is subject to bargaining between the parties and that a decision to discipline or discharge an employee may be subject to review by an arbitrator.</p>
