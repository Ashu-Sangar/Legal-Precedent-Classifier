About a week later, Christopher developed a fever, and Mrs. Harman took Christopher back to Dr. Borah’s office. Dr. Borah diagnosed Christopher with left otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear) and prescribed an antibiotic. Two days later, Mrs. Harman and her' husband, Appellee Robert Harman, rushed Christopher to the Lower Bucks County Hospital Emergency Room, where he was admitted and diagnosed with left otitis media and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). Mr. and Mrs. Harman transferred Christopher to CHOP, where he received treatment for encephalitis from Dr. Park and Dr. Bernbaum.

On October 14, 1988, the Harmans filed an amended complaint that named CHOP, Dr. Park, and Dr. Bernbaum as additional defendants. After that, the Harmans petitioned the trial court to dismiss the action without prejudice, which the trial court granted.

Dr. Strand took the stand and provided his opinion as an expert in the field of pediatric neuroradiology. Immediately after Dr. Strand completed his testimony concerning information from various CAT scans and related reports, the trial court judge, announced, in open court, that he wished to speak with Dr. Strand. The full text of the recorded conversation follows: THE COURT: Doctor, may I see you a minute? It has nothing to do with this case. <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>N.T., 04/18/00, at 70 (R.R. 2450).

N.T., 04/18/00, at 107-109 (R.R. 2487-89). The Harmans argued that the judge’s consultation with an expert for the defense on a personal matter gave the prejudicial appearance that the trial court found Dr. Strand more credible than it found any of their witnesses. The trial court overruled the objection and denied the Harmans’ motion for a mistrial. The following morning, the trial court asked counsel for the Harmans whether he desired a curative instruction to address the contested conversation. N.T., 04/19/00, at 5-6 (R.R. 1528-29). Despite the requests by the Harmans’ counsel not to issue an instruction,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> the trial court started the day’s proceeding with the following curative instruction:</p>

First, the trial court must decide whether one or more mistakes occurred at trial. These mistakes might involve factual, legal, or discretionary matters. Second, if the trial court concludes that a mistake (or mistakes) occurred, it must determine whether the mistake was a sufficient basis for granting a new trial. <em>See Spang, </em><a href="/pa/519/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="519 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="1813538" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0014-01">545 A.2d at 868</a>.

The defendant provided numerous examples in the record of behavior that demonstrated a possible bias against him. Furthermore, the defendant offered specific instances in the record when the trial court judge failed or refused to respond to defense counsel’s objections or overruled them in a cavalier manner. <em>Hammer </em>did not mark the end of the waiver doctrine in cases of judicial impropriety. To the contrary, the general rule remains that a party waives an issue concerning perceived trial court error, if the party fails both to preserve the issue with a timely and specific objection at trial and present it in post-trial motions. Thus, <em>Hammer </em>provides a limited exception to the waiver doctrine. Where it appears from all the circumstances that a timely objection to perceived judicial misconduct would be meaningless, a party may choose to raise the issue for the first time at post-trial motions to preserve it for appellate review.

While we can accept counsel’s concern about further alerting the jury, we find no justification for counsel’s inertia. The Harmans disclose no facts on the record to suggest that a timely objection would have been meaningless or caused greater harm to their case. There is simply no evidence that the trial court expressed any bias against the Harmans or their counsel during the trial. On the contrary, the record shows that the trial court heard the late motion for a mistrial, allowed counsel an opportunity <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>to support his claim, but ultimately denied the request and issued a curative instruction. The preferred course of action would have been for counsel to move for a prompt sidebar discussion with the judge to alert the trial court to what he perceived as on-going prejudicial behavior. In fact, counsel conceded to the trial court that he should have done that. N.T., 04/18/00, at 108-109 (R.R. 2488-89). Furthermore, after the jury had left the courtroom, the court entertained motions by the parties on other issues. These motions may have lasted for one-half hour. At no time during those arguments did counsel for the Harmans broach the subject of the private conversation with the trial court.

A trial court has wide discretion in phrasing jury instructions, and absent an abuse of discretion or an inaccurate statement of law, there is no reversible error. <em>Commonwealth v.

A careful review of the record reveals nothing improper about the instruction. The trial court phrased it with general language. It did not mention the specific dialogue. The trial court emphasized to the jury that he did not favor either party and clarified that the jury should not place any importance on whether the judge conversed with a particular witness or attorney. Ironically, the Harmans also complain that the instruction was untimely. Certainly, a prompt instruction has a greater likelihood of curing a trial error.

In my view, implicit in counsel’s explanation for the delay in objecting are two distinct rationales. First, counsel for the Harmans was obviously concerned that an immediate objection on his part in the presence of the jury would further draw attention to the improper conversation and might thereby bolster a perception on the part of individual jurors that the trial judge found Dr. Strand to be more reliable than the expert witnesses for the Harmans. In addition, it seems likely that counsel’s delay resulted, at least in part, from his reluctance to risk antagonizing the judge and alienating jurors, who naturally look to the trial judge for guidance. My belief in this regard is founded in no small part on the common-sense notion that it would take a very rare attorney indeed to expressly state such an explanation to the same trial judge whose conduct he was objecting to as improper, and before whom he was trying his case.</p>

I disagree with the majority’s conclusion in this regard, and would find that the facts of the instant case support the application of the <em>Hammer </em>exception to excuse counsel’s failure to lodge a contemporaneous objection to the trial judge’s admittedly improper conversation with a defense expert witness.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Therefore, I respectfully disagree with the majority’s determination that the Harmans’ failure to immediately object to the improper conversation constituted a proper basis for the trial court’s decision to deny their motion for a new trial.

The majority states that the Harmans have presented no evidence that the trial judge expressed any bias against them during the trial. But that is exactly what counsel for the Harmans objected to — an apparent bias in favor of a defense expert witness which the trial judge exhibited in the presence of the jury. In addition, the majority appears to place the burden on the Harmans to establish that their objection was not waived. The placement of such a burden of proof on the Harmans is in no way proper, as they come before this Court as appellees, and not appellants. Finally, I would disagree with any suggestion that the exception to the waiver doctrine set forth in <em>Hammer </em>is limited to only those situations where the record reveals that the trial judge exhibited a pronounced bias in favor of one of the parties appearing before him. In my view, objection to the inappropriate conduct of a judge can be equally meaningless regardless of whether the judge’s inappropriate conduct demonstrates a bias in favor of one of the parties or not.</p>
