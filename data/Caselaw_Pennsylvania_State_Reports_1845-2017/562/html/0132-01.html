LaCourt and his friend, Barbara Halley, encountered appellant and Tanesha Robinson, who were sitting in a stairway at the Cambridge Mall housing project. LaCourt tried to sell appellant a gold chain. After looking at the chain, appellant started an argument with LaCourt concerning whether the chain was genuine. Appellant refused to return the chain to LaCourt, pulled out a gun, and began to beat LaCourt with it. Appellant then knocked on the door of Larry Gregory, who joined in the beating, using <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>his own gun to pistolwhip LaCourt. As LaCourt pled for the beating to stop, Ms. Robinson ran up the stairway. Seconds after she left the scene of the beating, she heard approximately ten gunshots.

Two other witnesses testified concerning a plot to murder Robinson in order to prevent her from testifying at trial. Terrance Richardson testified that he was present when he heard Greggory and his brother give two other men a .357 revolver and $2,000 in cash and the directions to “be fast about it” and to “leave no witnesses.” The next day fifteen year old Robinson and two of Robinson’s friends were shot to death in Robinson’s apartment.

Hannibal raises a number of additional claims, all of which we have carefully examined, but none of which merit extended discussion. First, Hannibal claims that trial counsel was unprepared for trial and, therefore, that he was ineffective in several respects. He claims that counsel was ineffective in failing to call two alibi witnesses; that counsel met with him only once; that counsel failed to obtain psychiatric assistance at the penalty phase of the trial; that counsel was ineffective for failing to subpoena certain documents (records of where Hannibal was imprisoned); and that counsel failed to file an appellate brief until after it was due.</p>
      <p id="b204-7" data-blocks='[["BL_204.6",204,[259,900,1125,269]]]'>These claims are without merit for a number of reasons. First, Hannibal does not set out the ineffectiveness analysis required by Pennsylvania law. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Balodis, </em><a href="/pa/560/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="560 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="95737" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0567-01">560 Pa. 567</a>, <a href="/a2d/747/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="747 A.2d 341" data-case-ids="11469350,95737" data-case-paths="/a2d/747/0341-01,/pa/560/0567-01">747 A.2d 341</a>, 2000 Pa. LEXIS 419 (2000). Pursuant to this analysis, an appellant must prove (1) the issue which counsel did not address had arguable merit; (2) counsel’s course of action had no reasonable basis; (3) counsel’s action prejudicially affected the outcome of the case.</p>
      <p id="b204-8" data-blocks='[["BL_204.7",204,[256,1173,1126,465]]]'>Further, Hannibal testified that he did not remember where he was on the night of the murder, which moots the importance of his claimed alibi witnesses. Next, even if counsel met him only once, that in itself does not mean that counsel was unprepared. Next, Hannibal does not state what a psychiatric witness would have stated if one had been called. Next, the failure to subpoena prison records as to Hannibal’s location in prison — which would have been offered to show that Hannibal was not in a cell with Buigi and could not, therefore, have confessed to Buigi — fails because he fails to show that such records exist. Finally, the fact that counsel filed a brief after it was due, if true, does not tend to prove ineffectiveness because counsel explained that Hannibal stated to the court that he wanted a new attorney.</p>
      <p id="b204-9" data-blocks='[["BL_204.8",204,[256,1642,1123,184]]]'>Next, Hannibal claims that his trial was unfair because evidence of the murder of Tanesha Robinson, a witness, was admitted into evidence and that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the introduction of evidence that Hannibal was linked to the murder of Tanesha Robinson.</p>

First, the trial court did not err in admitting this evidence since it is part of the history of the case. Second, the claim of ineffectiveness fails because Hannibal again fails to set out the three pronged test for ineffectiveness of counsel. Third, there was no basis to object to the evidence because it was admissible to show Hannibal’s consciousness of guilt. <em>Commonwealth v.

Since he was not a party, he was not able to cross examine, and in any event, it was error to admit the May 4 testimony against Hannibal, for the evidence at preliminary hearing concerned Greggory.</p>
      <p id="b205-8" data-blocks='[["BL_205.6",205,[240,1201,1120,510]]]'>This argument fails because Hannibal himself admits that Robinson’s April 13, 1993 testimony was substantially the same as Robinson’s May 4 testimony, and both were admitted into evidence. Any error in admitting the May 4 transcript into evidence was, therefore, harmless error, for the content of both preliminary hearing statements was substantially the same as to Hannibal and both statements were before the jury. Similarly, Robinson’s police statements, which were given two days after LaCourt’s murder and were given at great risk to the witness, were virtually identical to the preliminary hearing statements. Thus, the police statements were made under circumstances which guaranteed their trustworthiness and, in any event, the police statements were merely cumulative. There was no error in admitting either the preliminary hearing transcripts or the statements to police.</p>
      <p id="b205-9" data-blocks='[["BL_205.7",205,[241,1715,1118,195]]]'>Finally, Hannibal claims that it was error for the trial court to enter an order prohibiting the disclosure of the identity of the witnesses Buigi and Richardson and prohibiting the disclosure of the contents of their expected testimony.

Richardson testified on the third day of trial and the court allowed Hannibal to question Richardson out of the presence of the jury as to an alleged disability which might have had a bearing on his ability to see, hear and report accurately what he had seen. Under questioning, Richardson indicated that he received social security for a tendency to express anger inappropriately, and the court ruled that this disability was unrelated to his ability to see, hear and to report what he had seen and heard. The court also gave defense counsel reasonable time to prepare for additional cross-examination. In fact, defense counsel vigorously questioned both witnesses about their motives for <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>testifying and questioned both at great length.

Even if the trial court improperly failed to grant adequate time to prepare for cross examination — which it did not— unless we are told what Hannibal would have discovered had he had more time to prepare for cross-examination of these witnesses, his claim fails.</p>

In his concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Castille retracts his decision to join the majority opinion in <em>Wayne. </em>Mr. Justice Castille now finds that the court in <em>Wayne </em>impermissibly intruded into the legislative domain by altering the traditional rule of co-conspirator liability as it relates to first degree murder. I must disagree. The court in <em>Wayne </em>did not intrude on the legislative power to define substantive criminal law; rather, it applied the principle that statutes are read in pari materia, thus giving effect to all of the respective elements of conspiracy and first degree murder. The decision in <em>Wayne </em>was not motivated by the severity of the punishment for first degree murder, but rather by the recognition that the legislature, in defining first degree murder, delin- ■ eated that crime from all other degrees of homicide by the element of a specific premeditated intent to kill. Nor do I find that a jury instruction, which explains that each person charged with first degree murder, whether an accomplice or co-conspirator, must possess the specific intent to kill, places an onerous burden on the prosecution.</p>
