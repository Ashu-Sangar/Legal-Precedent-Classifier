        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThe objection to the testimony covered by the first assignment of error was upon the ground that the attempt was to prove the declarations of an agent of the company made after the occurrence, and so remote from it as not to be a part of the res gestae. The fact of the agency and the right of the agent to speak for the company were not at the time questioned, and it afterward appeared from the testimony that he was acting within the scope of his authority. The plaintiff had gone to the office of the company to demand a retraction of the libelous publication. What was then said by any one connected with the newspaper could not be shown as an incident of the litigated act of publication, but it was admissible on other grounds, if the party as editor or manager of the paper or an officer of the company had authority to speak for it. If the answer contained anything as to the motive of publication which was thought to be objectionable, the court should have been asked at the time to strike it out. . The objection being based upon specific grounds, all other grounds of objection might be considered as waived.\nThe second assignment is not supported by an exception to the ruling of the court. The third, fourth and fifth assignments relate to the admission of testimony to show the injurious effect of the publication upon the reputation of the plaintiff among' her friends and acquaintances, and that it prevented her from obtaining employment. Testimony as to the effect upon her feelings was properly excluded. There was no attempt to prove the meaning of the words used, or to explain the publication. The purpose was to show in what maimer the publication had affected the plaintiff where she was known, and how it had prevented her from earning a living. This was in support of her averment of special damage.\nWe see no merit in the sixth assignment. The plaintiff had testified that her request for a retraction was refused except on terms that she would not bring suit. On the part of the defendant it was denied that any terms were insisted upon. The fact was not established in favor of either party, and the learned judge might well pass it without comment. He was not asked to say anything in relation to it, and the defendant cannot now be heard to complain that he did not: Humes v. Gephart, 175 Pa. 417.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

Held, that what was then said by anyone connected with the newspaper could not be shown as an incident of the litigated act of publication, but it was admissible on other grounds, if the party as editor or manager of the paper, or an officer of the company had authority to speak for it.\nLibel \u2014 Evidence\u2014Damages.\nIn an action for libel, it is proper in support of the averment of special damage to admit evidence to show the injurious effect of the publication upon the reputation of the plaintiff among her friends and acquaintances, -and that it prevented her from obtaining employment.\nPractice, G.

Term, 1896, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 8, Allegheny Co., Feb. Term, 1894, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for libel. Before Kennedy, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the libelous publications complained of appeared in the Pittsburg Post on October 10 and 11, .1893.\nThe first article, which was published, Oct. 10,1893, has these headlines in large letters: \u201c Gone to her- drummer. A missing-hotel maid being pursued by an irate parent.\u201d And the article reads thus: \u201c About three months ago Miss Mollie O\u2019Toole, a pretty young woman about twenty years of age, applied for work in a prominent hotel of this city. She was from McKeesport. Being of good appearance and having good manners, she was made parlor maid, which is a very desirable place for women in hotel work, but two days ago she disappeared, and is said to have gone to Philadelphia to meet a chewing gum agent whom she met at the hotel. The chewing gum gentleman made his appearance at the house about a month ago, and he and the girl got noticeably thick. He staid about one and a-half weeks, after which Miss O\u2019Toole, a girl friend noticed, got despondent. Her sudden leave to join her drummer friend explains this, but their life will not be one of a rosy path, if her father, who is said to have gone to Philadelphia with a gun to hunt for them, finds them. Miss O\u2019Toole is said to have been engaged to a young man in McKeesport when she left there.\u201d\nThis was followed the next day, October 11, with another article, which reads thus, without any head lines: \u201c The advantage which the chewing gum agent has over other traveling men in gaining the good will of the dear girls has again been demonstrated in this city. A chewing gum man from Philadelphia put up at one of our hotels and Mollie O\u2019Toole at once lost her heart. He wooed her with gum of the most succulent sort, and every time Mollie worked her jaws, she felt her love for the sweet man growing. When he voluntarily presented her with a whole box of gum, it was too much, and she hesitated no longer. Her father is now following her and her gum man into the wild, wicked east.\u201d\nThe plaintiff having testified that after her return from her trip East, some three weeks after the publication, she went to the office of the Post Printing & Publishing Company and there saw a Mr. Barr, she then continued as follows:\n\u201c Q. What did you say to him? A. Well, I asked him what authority had he to publish that lie in the paper.\u201d\nTo which defendant objected as follows:\nWe object to this. This is a suit against a corporation, and declarations after the fact are hardly competent. We object to any statements of agents or employees of the corporation sued, some weeks after the fact, and not as part of the res gestee.\nObjection overruled. Exception and bill sealed.\nThereupon the witness testified as follows:\n\u201c Q. What did Mr. Barr say to you, and what was done at that interview? A. Well, he said he supposed they just did it for a mere joke, and I asked him if he would contradict it in the paper, and he said, no he wouldn\u2019t do that if I intended to bring suit against him. I told Mm I was not guilty of that, and he would have to account for it. I says, \u2018 I\u2019ll show that it is not so.\u2019 He said, \u2018We won\u2019t retract if you intend to bring suit against us.\u2019 [1]\n\u201c Q. Did the publications which have been read to the jury in your hearing have any effect upon your reputation in Mc-Keesport or in other places where you have lived, and if so, what are they?\u201d\nObjected to. That is a question for the jury and not for the witness.\nBy the Court: \u201c Q. Did it have any effect at all? A. Yes, sir. Q. Then what was the effect? A. People had a bad opinion of me that read it m the papers. [2] Q. Did you have conversation with any of your friends in relation to these articles ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you talk to any people hr McKeesport or Pittsburg, or did any person talk to you about it ? \u201d\nObjected to as irrelevant and immaterial. If important the persons themselves are the best witnesses.\nObjection overruled. Exception and bill sealed.\n\u201c A. Do you mean the articles in the papers ? Q. Yes, the articles in the papers. A. Yes, sir. Q. Who? A. I talked to May McDermott, Mrs. McGinley and my sister, Annie O\u2019Toole and Mrs. Corsey. [3] Q. State in what way this article had a bad effect upon you ? \u201d\nTo which defendant objected as incompetent.\nObjection overruled. Exception and bill sealed.\n\u201c A. In several ways, not one alone. Q. State in what way? A. It injured my character and prevented me from getting employment from people that would have employed me if that hadn\u2019t been in the paper, and it injured me in the society I associate with, and school companions didn\u2019t think as much of me afterwards.\u201d [4]\nEliza Mulligan, a witness called on behalf of the plaintiff, being upon the stand testified as follows :\na.Q. Did you see these articles regarding Miss O\u2019Toole in the Post? A. Yes, sir. Q. When? A. Well, I couldn\u2019t tell exactly. Q. About the time of their publication? A. Yes, sir. Q. State if you read them. A. Yes, sir. Q. Do you know of others reading them? A. Yes, sir. Q. And commenting upon them? A. Yes, sir. Q. Favorably or unfavorably to Miss O\u2019Toole ? \u201d\nTo which defendant objected as incompetent.\nObjection overruled. Exception and bill sealed.\n\u201c A. Unfavorably. Q. Did persons talk to you in relation to it? A. Yes, sir. Q. Do you know the fact that persons declined to speak to Miss O\u2019Toole because of the publication of these articles? A. Yes, sir.\u201d [5]\nA. J. Barr and F. X. Barr who were connected with the newspaper testified that they had offered to publish a retraction which plaintiff declined to accept. This was denied by the plaintiff. No request was made by the defendant to the court for instruction as to this disputed fact.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,600. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1-5) rulings on evidence, quoting the, bill of exceptions; (6) in not charging the jury as to the effect of the offers of retraction tendered to plaintiff before suit brought, and by her declined, as testified to by defendant\u2019s witnesses, A. J. Barr and F. X. Barr.\nWillis F. McCook, with him John Marron, for appellant.\nThe declarations of an agent made at the time of the particular transaction which is the subject of inquiry, and while acting within the scope of his authority, may be given in evidence against his principal, as a part of the res gestee; but the declarations of an agent made after the transaction is fully completed and ended, are not admissible: Huntingdon R. R. v. Decker, 82 Pa. 119; Giberson v. Patterson Mills Co., 174 Pa. 369.\nThe effect of the publication is for the jury: P., A. & M. Pass. Ry. v. McCurdy, 114 Pa. 554; Rangler v. Hummel, 37 Pa. 130.\nA. B. Reid, with him A. V. B. Watterson, for appellee.\nThe evidence of a refusal to retract was properly offered and its weight and effect was for the jury: 1 Whart. Ev., sec. 261.\nHearsay evidence upon the subject of reputation is always admissible: 1 Whart. Ev., sec. 253.\nIt is competent to prove by bystanders, neighbors, acquaintances or any person hearing slanderous reports or reading a libelous article, the effect of such reports upon their minds, not for the purpose of proving the meaning of the words used\u2019 in the innuendo charged, but to substantiate proof of damages sustaiued: Warner v.
