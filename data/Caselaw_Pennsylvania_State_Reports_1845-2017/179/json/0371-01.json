        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Green,\nIn Stoughton\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 198, we said \u201c Oil, however, is a mineral, and being a mineral is part of the realty. Funk v. Haldeman, 53 Pa. 229. In this it is like coal or any other mineral product which in situ forms part of the land.\u201d In Gill v. Weston, 110 Pa. 312, we said of petroleum, \u201c It is a mineral substance obtained from the earth by a process of mining, and lands from which it is obtained may with propriety be called mining lands.\u201d In Westmoreland Nat. Gas Co. v. De Witt, 130 Pa. 235, we said, \u201c Gas it is true is a mineral, but it is a mineral with peculiar attributes.\u201d In Blakley v. Marshall, 174 Pa. 425, a lease for oil and gas purposes was made by lessors who were tenants for life and also as trustee for those in remainder. The leased premises proved to be productive. A question arose upon a case stated as to the interests respectively of the life tenants and those in remainder. The life tenants' claimed the whole of the oil, and for those in remainder the same claim was made. The court below appointed a trustee to receive all the oil due to the lessors, and to invest the pro-' c\u00e9eds, and pay the interest annually realized therefrom to the life tenants during their joint lives and the life of the survivor, and at the death of the latter to pay the principal to the-remainder-men. This court sustained the court below and said, \u201cas was said in Stoughton\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 198, and other cases in the same line, oil in place is a mineral, and being a mineral is part of the realty.' An- oil lease investing the lessee with the right to remove all the oil in place in the premises, in consideration of his giving the lessors a certain per centum thereof, is in legal effect a sale of a: portion of the land, and the proceeds represents the respective interests of the lessors in the premises. If there be life tenants and remainder-men the former are entitled to the enjoyment of the, fund (interest thereon) during life, and at the death of the survivor the corpus of the fund should go to the remainder-men.\u201d This distribution was made because all the interests concurred in making the lease, and it was to the manifest interest of all that the oil should be taken from the land, lest it should be drawn away by other wells on adjacent premises. In that respect of course there is a difference between oil and gas, and solid minerals, but in respect of the interests of life tenants as contrasted with those in remainder there was no departure from the common law rule that tenants for life, only, may not open new min\u00e9s or take minerals from the premises, except in case of mines opened .by .the former owner. This was recognized in Westmoreland Co.\u2019s Appeal, 85 Pa. 344, where we held that while the life tenant\u2019s right to work previously opened mines was undoubted, there was no right in a life tenant of several tracts, to open a new mine on one of the tracts upon which no previous opening had taken place. Merctjr, J., said, in the opinion, \u201c neither tract is appendant or appurtenant to the other. If she had a life estate in the distant tract only, the fallacy of claiming a right to remove the coal therefrom would be most manifest. The unanswerable reason would be that the mine on that tract had never been opened.\u201d\nWe see no difference between the present case and those cited, so far as this question is concerned. The plaintiff was but a tenant for life of the premises in question. There had never been any oil or gas operations commenced on the land before her estate for life accrued. She had no right therefore, to operate for oil or gas herself, and she could not give such a right to any lessee from her. Neither the original lessee nor the defendants, -his assignees, ever held any such right. They would have been trespassers if they had undertaken to exercise such a right. The lease was \u201c for the sole and only purpose of drilling and operating for petroleum, oil or gas,\u201d and \u201c to have and to hold the said premises for the said purpose only.\u201d All the terms and conditions of the lease relate to that purpose alone, and no right to the use of the surface for any other purpose is conferred. It is manifest, therefore, that as no interest whatever was acquired under the lease, the lessees are under no obligation to pay for a right or privilege which they never obtained, or in damages for not performing an illegal covenant therein. W e think the judgment entered by the court below was entirely right.\nIt seems to us, however, in view of \u25a0 the peculiar character of oil and gas as being fugacious in their nature, and liable to be diverted by operations upon other adjoining or nearby lands, in order to preserve the interests of both life tenants and remainder-men, it would be well for the legislature to make such enactments as would enable the owners of this class of lands to secure to themselves the benefits of such minerals as these. As it is now, the law is not efficacious to that end.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Held, that the lessor could not enforce the lease. '.)\u2022\u2022\u25a0\nArgued Oct. 29, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 69, Oct. T., 1896, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny' County, Dec. T., 1890, No. 231,-non obstante veredicto.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit for accrued - rent upon an oil and gas .lease. Before Stowe, P. J.\n\u25a0' At the trial it appeared that on the death of her husband the plaintiff became vested with a life estate in the land covered by the lease, and that it had never been operated for oil or gas. On February 17, 1885, plaintiff executed a lease of the land to W. A. Mellon for the sole purpose of mining for oil and \u2022 gas. The lease was for the full term of plaintiff\u2019s life, and was sub\u25a0sequently assigned to defendants. No actual possession of the -premises was taken by the lessee or his assignees, nor was-any attempt made to operate the land, nor was any. payment of rentals made. .\nVerdict for plaintiff subject to the question of law reserved as to whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover under all the evidence in the case. Judgment was entered for defendants non obstante veredicto.\nError assigned was entry of judgment as above.\nW. H. S. Thomson and A. P. Marshall, with them Frank Thomson, for appellant.\nThe lessee and his assignees knew the extent of their lessor\u2019s title, and whether they did or did not, there was no misrepresentation made to them by the lessor to induce them to enter into their agreement, and no lessee in possession is permitted to dispute the title of his lessor: Mays v. Dwight, 82 Pa. 464. A man may, if he sees fit, where there are conflicting titles, take a lease from each of the pretended owners, and if he is not deceived by assertions in regard to the matter, he would have to pay both: Hamilton v. Pittock, 158 Pa. 457; Wilson v. Cochran, 46 Pa. 229. It is contended that the same liability exists as to the assignee of the lease: Washington Nat. Gas Co. v. Johnson, 123 Pa. 576; Aderhold v. Oil Well Sup. Co., 158 Pa. 401. The nature of the interest granted by an oil or gas lease is widely different from the ordinary mining leases for coal, etc.: McNish v. Stone, 152 Pa. 457 n; Venture Oil Co. v. Fretts, 152 Pa. 451; Plummer v. Coal & Iron Co., 160 Pa. 483.\nAn actual entry upon the demised premises by an assignee of a lease is not requisite in order to charge him with the performance of covenants running with the land: 2 Taylor on Landlord and Tenant, sec. 450, p. 28.\nEdwin S. Craig, for appellees.\nA tenant for life can make no agreement affecting the estate which will bind the remainderman, nor will he, with whom the agreement is made, or his privy, b\u00f3 bound by it; for a contract binds both parties or neither: Hill v. Roderick, 4 W. & S. 221.\nThe estoppel of a tenant to deny his landlord\u2019s title is founded on possession and not on the instrument of demise: Taylor\u2019s Landlord & Tenant, 8th ed. sec. 89; Gleim v. Rise, 6 Watts, 44; Cooper v. Smith, 8 Watts, 536; Hall v. Benner, 1 P. & W. 402. As the defendants never entered or operated on the land described in the lease, the relationship of landlord and tenant never was established between the plaintiff and the defendants : Glasgow v. Chartiers Oil Co., 152 Pa. 52; Hooks v. Forst, 165 Pa. 247; Dallas\u2019 Bainbridge on Mines, 284.\nA tenant for life may work, even to exhaustion, mines opened upon the land before the commencement of the life estate; but unless exempt from liability for waste, she, or her grantee, cannot open new mines in the lands which she holds for life: Westmoreland Coal Co.\u2019s App., 85 Pa. 844; 1 Washburn\u2019s Real Property, 4th ed. 144; Clegg v. Rowland, L. R. 2 Eq. 160; Brown v. O\u2019Brien, 3 Clark, 96.\nOperations to produce oil and gas from land are mining operations, and such land is mining land: Gill v. Weston, 110 Pa. 313; Woodburn\u2019s Est., 138 Pa. 606; Stoughton\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 198; Williamson v. Jones, 39 W. Va. 231; Blakeley v. Marshall, 174 Pa. 425; Allison\u2019s App., 77 Pa. 221; Westmoreland Nat. Gas Co. v. DeWitt, 130 Pa. 235; Duffield v. Hue, 136 Pa. 602.\nWhere a tenant for life has committed waste by opening mines the produce of the mines belong to the remainderman, and the tenant for life is not even entitled to the interest of the produce: Rogers on Mines, 2d ed. 258.\nThe parties to the lease were the appellant (plaintiff) and one W. A. Mellon, who is not a party to this suit; and there being no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendants, the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover rests solely upon a supposed privity of estate between the plaintiff and defendants : Washington Nat. Gas Co. v. Johnson, 123 Pa. 576.\nThe privity of estate which induces personal liability is the actual or beneficial enjoyment of the thing demised or the right of possession and enjoyment. Where there is neither, no personal liability can arise: Wickersham v. Irwin, 14 Pa. 110.\nThe language \u201csubject to the conditions, reservations and restrictions contained therein \u201d in the assignment of the lease from W. A. Mellon to the defendants, imposes no personal liability on the defendants in favor of the plaintiff for covenants broken after the defendants have assigned over: Act of June 12, 1878, P. L. 205; Purdon, 1839, pl. 29, 30; Moore\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 450; Merriman v. Moore, 90 Pa. 78; Walker v. Physick, 5 Pa. 193; Fennell v. Guffey, 139 Pa. 341.\nJanuary 4, 1897:\nAn oil and gas lease is not a grant of property in the oil, but merely a grant of possession for the purpose of searching for and producing oil: Barnhart v. Lockwood, 152 Pa. 82; Meridian Nat. Bank v. McConica, 8 Ohio C. C. 442.\nAn oil and gas lease, under which no operations have ever been conducted, does not create a vested estate in either the land or the minerals. Such a lease may be surrendered and the surrender accepted by parol: Thompson\u2019s Appeal, 101 Pa. 232; Auer v. Penn. 92 Pa. 444; Cochran v. Shenango Nat.Gas Co., 40 P. L. J. 82; Brown v. Beecher, 120 Pa. 590; Haight v. Conners, 149 Pa. 297.\nAn assignee is liable in respect to his possession only, for he bears the burden only while he enjoys the benefit: Berry v. McMullen, 17 S. & R. 84; Weidner v. Foster, 2 P. & W. 23; Thomas v. Connell, 5 Pa. 13; Hannen v. Ewalt, 18 Pa. 11; Negley v. Morgan, 46 Pa. 281; Elkinton v. Newman, 20 Pa: 281."
