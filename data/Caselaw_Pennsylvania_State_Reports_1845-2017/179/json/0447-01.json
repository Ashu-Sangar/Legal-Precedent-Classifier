We have no doubt as to the correctness of his conclusion, that the alleged gift is invalid because it is within the prohibition of the act of April 26,1855, section 11, P. L. 332, which declares : \u201cNo \u00e9state, real or personal, shall hereafter be bequeathed, devised or conveyed to any body politic, or to any person in trust for religious or charitable uses, except the same be done by deed or will .... at least one calendar month before the decease of the testator or alienor; and all dispositions of property contrary thereto, shall be void.....: Provided, that any. disposition of property within said period, bona fide made for a fair valuable consideration, shall not be hereby avoided.\u201d\nIt is unnecessary to inquire to what extent \u2014 if at all \u2014 the ruling of the court below may be in conflict with McGlade\u2019s Appeal, 99 Pa. 838.

    "head_matter": "In re Estate of Caroline Luebbe, deceased. Appeal of German Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home.\nWill \u2014 Charitable bequest \u2014 Act of April 26, 1855, See. 11.\nA promissory note under seal made by testatrix to a charitable corporation within thirty days prior to her death, with a direction in her will contemporaneously made that the note shall first be paid out of her estate, is in violation of the act of April 26, 1855, sec. 11, P. L. 382, and void. McGlade\u2019s Appeal, 99 Pa. 338, has been practically overruled.\nArgued Not. 3, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 125, Oct. T., 1896, by the German Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., Not. T., 1895, No. 37, on exception\u2019s to distribution.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to distribution.\nOyer, J., filed the following opinion:\nThe German Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home Society of Allegheny county has presented a claim against this estate on a promissory note of which the following is a copy:\n\u201c $1,000. Pittsburg, October 10, 1893.\n\u201cThree months after date I promise to pay to the German Protestant Orphans\u2019 Plome society of West Liberty Borough, Allegheny Co., Pa., One Thousand dollars. For Yalue receiYed without defalcation.\n\u201cCaroline Luebbe, (Seal).\u201d\nIt appears from the testimony of J. W. Kinnear, Esq., who was called to prepare Mrs. Luebbe\u2019s will, that she desired to make a bequest of $1,000 to the Home; that, as he understood, her death was imminent, he informed her such a bequest would be Toid, but that he would prepare a note for that amount, which he did. She executed it under seal, and, by her directions, he deliYered it prior to her death, on the same day, to Dr. Ruoff, the president of the Home, (who was also appointed executor of the will.) She executed her will contemporaneously with the note, and in it made the following reference to the note:\n\u201c I hereby declare that my estate is first subject to the payment of a note for one thousand dollars given by me to the German Protestant Orphans\u2019 Home of West Liberty borough, Allegheny county, Penna.\u201d It is objected to the claim that the note is void, being within the prohibition of the 11th section of the Wills Act of April 26, 1855.\nHad the note been executed without a seal, it would have been merely a promise to make a gift in the future; and being without consideration, the payee could not have recovered from the maker, had she survived its maturity, nor from her estate after her death: Kern\u2019s Estate, 171 Pa. 55. But the seal imports a consideration, and the note, both in law and equity, constituted a valid gift of the money: (Hummel\u2019s Estate, 161 Pa. 215; Ross\u2019s Appeal, 127 Pa. 4), unless it is within the prohibition of the 11th section of the act of 1855. It provides that \u201c no estate, real or personal, shall hereafter be bequeathed devised, or conveyed to any body politic, or to any person in trust for religious or charitable uses, except the same be done by deed or will .... at least one calendar month before the decease of the testator or alienor.\u201d \u201c Provided, that any disposition of property within said period bona fide made for a fair valuable consideration, shall not be hereby avoided.\u201d If a strict construction be given to this act, it would appear to prohibit the gift of personalty for charitable uses by will only, and would not apply to gifts of personalty inter vivos. Such a construction seems to have been given it in McGlade\u2019s Appeal, 99 Pa. 338. There, for the avowed purpose of evading the act, the donor executed a power of attorney for the transfer of $2,400, of the Philadelphia city loan, delivered it and the certificates to M. with instructions to convert the certificates into money, and to give the proceeds to W. for distribution among the charities mentioned in her will. They were sold, and the money given to W. in the donor\u2019s lifetime, and it was held that the gift was not within the prohibition of the act. But in that case there remained nothing for the donor to do to consummate the gift. Here the gift was the donor\u2019s promise to pay, which would not be consummated until the money was paid; and, whilst the .promise was binding on the donor, it would be void as to her legal representatives, after her death, if within the prohibition of the statute.\nIn Reimensnyder\u2019s Administrator v. Gans, 110 Pa. 17, a more liberal construction was given the act. There the decedent made within one calendar month of his death a written subscription for the erection of a church, and it was held that it was within the prohibition of the act.. Whilst Mr. Justice Gordon, who delivered the opinion of the court, intimated that the subscription was an unexecuted gift revoked by the death of the donor, yet he says, \u201c This is, however, merely obiter, for the act of 1855 renders invalid any and every conveyance or devise of property, real or personal,, made to any charity or body politic within one calendar month of the decease of the alienor, or testator, unless the same be made for a fair valuable consideration.\u201d The word conveyance here is construed to apply to personal as well as real estate, and if it does, as there was no valuable consideration for this note, it is Avithin the prohibition of the statute. It is true, the gift of the sealed note was an executed gift, valid as between the donor and donee; but a deed executed and delivered Avithin thirty days of the donor\u2019s death, would be also, and it -is conceded it would be within the express prohibition of the act; so, also, is this note if the word \u201c conveyed\u201d refers to personal as well as real estate. The claim is, therefore, not allowed.\nError assigned was decree of the court.\nS. W. Cunningham, with him J. W.Kinnear, for appellant.\nThe decision of the court below is directly contrary to the ruling of this court hi McGlade\u2019s Appeal, 99 Pa. 338.\nThe only case referred to by the court below as in any way weakening the doctrine of McGlade\u2019s Appeal, is Reimensnyder v. Gans, 110 Pa. 17. Here there was a subscription to a church within a month of the subscriber\u2019s death, and the court found and held that there was absolutely no consideration of any sort to support the promise, and that death revoked it. And yet it is true that, instead of resting the case solely upon this very ample ground, the learned justice went further, and spoke of the subscription as within the scope of the act of 1855. In the case at bar the gift seems to have been the donor\u2019s oavii idea. And her instructions to deliver the paper evince an intent to make a present executed gift. In this respect, our case differs from the Appeal of Waynesburg College, 111 Pa. 130.\nJanuary 4, 1897:\nA gift inter vivos of the donor\u2019s promissory note under seal or bond is, both at law and in equity, a gift of the money : Sherk v. Endress, 3 W. & S. 255 ; Yard v. Patton, 13 Pa. 278; Candor\u2019s Appeal, 27 Pa. 119; 2 Williams on Executors, (6th Am. ed.) 1082, (1016); 8 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 1321; Thornton on Gifts, 242. Mack\u2019s App., 68 Pa. 231; Taylor v. Glaser, 2 S. & R. 502; Burkholder v. Plank, 69 Pa. 225; Ross\u2019s App., 127 Pa. 4. In Kern\u2019s Estate, 171 Pa. 55, an effort was made to obliterate the distinction, and to sustain a gift of a promissory note unsealed. But this court, while admitting the full force of the decisions as to sealed instruments, declined to apply the principle to an unsealed note.\nJ. S. and E. G. Ferguson, for appellee,\nwere not heard, but in their printed brief said; McGlade\u2019s Appeal, 99 Pa. 338, differs radically from the case at bar. In McGlade\u2019s Appeal, Mrs. Daly, during her lifetime, by her attorney in fact, converted her funds in the Philadelphia city loan into cash, to Archbishop Wood. If Caroline Luebbe had handed the appellant on the day of her death $1,000 in cash, or some specific article of personal property, even though she gave it for religious or charitable uses, McGlade\u2019s Appeal would be authority to sustain such a gift; but it goes no further."
