Defendant, a real estate agent, drew the contract, and it was agreed that he should receive the purchase money which was to be paid in instalments, and pay it over to Mrs. Modzynski, and that after all the purchase mone3r was paid he should see to the proper transfer of title to plaintiff. Plaintiff paid to defendant $1,020, when owing to delays he claimed to rescind the contract.</p>

There was a mortgage on the property to the . amount of five hundred thalers, and he was to pay one thousand eight hundred thalers and take the property subject to the mortgage of five hundred thalers. He paid, I think, some $200 at that time, and at different times paid money, until he had paid to the defendant, Schneider, $1,020.</p>

Mrs. Modzynski was the party selling the property, and yet she had not a title to the property.] [3] It turned out, finally, that the property had been conveyed to her and her husband, and he was dead; also, that there were minor children, and perhaps some children of age. Mr. Schneider sent on some papers to Germany — some powers of attorney that he speaks about — and he explains that the conveyance had to be made in court there; that the parties must appear in court, either personally or by attorney. There were also delays in consequence of not having a guardian for the minor children.</p>

We cannot enforce a parol contract for the purchase of real estate. Sometimes there may be an action for damages, under peculiar circumstances ; or if a party purchaser has gone into possession and made valuable improvements, he may, in a case of that kind, hold the vendor to the parol contract; but until something of that kind takes place, either party may refuse to carry out that parol contract, and, until it is consummated, either party may withdraw from it by giving notice to the other side.</p>

According to his testimony, the plaintiff was to pay only 1,800 thalers, and according to the value of thaler coins in this country, a thaler is worth about seventy cents, being three marks — worth more in Germany, a mark generally passing there for nearly a quarter of a dollar in our money; but the quotation in this country is that a Prussian <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>thaler is worth seventy cents. If on that basis Mr. Schneider received |1,020, it would be equal to a little more than 1,800 thalers, the whole amount of purchase money to be paid by the plaintiff.</p>

He entered into no contract with the plaintiff, and violated no duty which he owed him. An agent who receives money paid on account of <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>a contract for the purchase of real estate made with his principal cannot be held liable in an action by the purchaser to recover the money back on proof of facts which would entitle the purchaser to rescind the contract. The contract in this case was made between the plaintiff and Mrs. Modzynski for the purchase by him of her land in Germany. They agreed upon the terms of purchase, and went together to the defendant to have the contract reduced to writing. It was then arranged that the plaintiff should pay the purchase money in instalments to the defendant for the vendor, and that the defendant was to see to the proper transfer of the title when the whole of the price should have been paid. In procuring the transfer of the title he seems to have represented both parties, but in receiving the purchase money he was acting for the vendor only, and he offered to return it if she would agree. As ■ this view of the case is conclusive of the plaintiff’s right to recover, it is unnecessary to consider in detail the other assignments of error further than to say that a peremptory instruction for the plaintiff should not have been given, as the question whether there had been any breach of contract and whether the offer to rescind was made in time were fairly raised by the testimony.</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[262,1422,1167,249]]]'>As there is doubt whether the title has become vested in the plaintiff, and as to the means by which a reconveyance can be made should it become necessary, it is evident that another form of proceeding is better adapted to secure a satisfactory adjustment of the rights of the parties.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[290,1679,506,42]]]'>' The judgment is reversed.</p>
