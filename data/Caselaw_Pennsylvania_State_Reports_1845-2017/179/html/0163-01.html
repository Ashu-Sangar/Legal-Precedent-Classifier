The accountant does not seem to know much about these notes, but Dr. W. H. Meyers swears positively to their existence, and says that within a few days after the death of Peter Meyers, before an inventory of the personal estate was taken, when he and his brothers, including Cyrus and Dennis, examined their father’s papers, in the absence of their sisters, the two notes mentioned were found among them. He explains the kind of notes and the considerations for them, and says they were then and there destroyed at his suggestion. He says, “I burned these notes. I found there was nothing charged against me or any one else, and I said, ‘boys, lets make it all even,’ and I burned them.” This is the only reason assigned for the strange proceeding. He further says the two sisters were not present, and knew nothing of the matter until within a year or so since.</p>

The fact that the notes did not appear in the inventory comes to nothing if it is believed that they were destroyed before it was taken; and if the sisters learned of their existence and destruction only within a year or so, the fact that several audits have taken place at which they were not mentioned, cannot estop them, though it might so affect others.</p>
