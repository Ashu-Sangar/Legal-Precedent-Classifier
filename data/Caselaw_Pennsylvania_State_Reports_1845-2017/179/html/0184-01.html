She stopped at a point one hundred and seventy-five feet from the crossing.

The deceased was struck by the train as it reached the crossing the second time, running backward. It appeared that there was a down grade towards the railroad track, and that the view was obstructed more and more in descending to the track by a stone wall on the right and by buildings on the left, and particularly on this occasion by one of the car’s just switched off, which stopped before it got entirely across the road. There was another place where the deceased could have had a better view of the tracks, but it was so close as to be dangerous in case the horses should become frightened.

The accident occurred about nine or ten o’clock in the morning. Mrs. Cookson was driving two horses hitched to a common country sled, and was accompanied by her son, who was about eleven years of age. Mrs. Cookson was about thirty-three years of age, and was a strong and healthy woman. The scene and the circumstances of the accident are thus described by the court below in an opinion refusing a new trial:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b207-8" data-blocks='[["BL_207.13",207,[120,2029,1172,404]],["BL_208.1",208,[233,396,1172,2040]],["BL_209.1",209,[95,397,1182,2037]]]'>On the day of this sad catastrophe Mrs. Melinda Cookson, the wife of the plaintiff, and their eleven-year-old son, Walter, left their home in Cranberry township, at near ten o’clock in the forenoon, to go to the village of Evans City, in Butler county, about four miles away. It was snowing, and there was considerable snow on the ground. They went in a common country sled drawn by two horses, Mrs. Cookson doing the driving. Evans City is a little country town with a population <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>of six or seven hundred people, about four miles from the Cookson residence, in a thickly settled farming and oil-producing community. Breackneck Creek flows northward through its western side, and the main street — Pittsburg street — runs westward, crosses the stream over a bridge, and when about a hundred feet west of the stream forks, the right hand fork being known as the Harmony road, running northwest to Harmony, and the left hand as the Franklin road, running southwest towards Pittsburg. It was on this last named road Mrs. Cookson and her boy traveled. The defendant’s railroad passes northward down the western bank of the creek, western bound trains at this point going northward and eastern bound trains southward. Its station house is west of the railroad, and about forty feet north of the crossing, near the point where the Harmony and Franklin roads separate and leave Pittsburg street. There is a double track with a switch established about one hundred and sixty feet above and south of the crossing, from which cars are thrown upon a siding at the west of the railroad to bring them closer to the station house. In addition to this, Mr. Ifft, a business man there, has a private track or spur going to his warehouse immediately between the Harmony and Franklin roads running from this switch about twenty feet west of the siding of the railroad company, making in all four tracks to be crossed by travelers at this point. The ground on the Franklin road ascends as it leaves Pittsburg street at the railroad crossing, and runs southwest. On the south side is the property of Mr. Ifft, much higher than the road-bed, and surrounded by a high stone wall clear down to the railroad, which shuts off the view southward. On the other side buildings are erected, and the view westward is obstructed. ■ Mrs. Cookson reached a point on this road about one hundred and seventy-five or two hundred feet from the railroad, near the house of Miss Boggs, a little before noon. A freight train of the defendant, containing ten cars and caboose, going from Allegheny westward, passed down northward on the eastern track about 11: 30 A.M, pulled down past the station to a switch north of it and backed up southward on the western track — main track— south of the station, then headed in on the siding, attached one car ahead of the engine, backed out and swung the oars down the siding. One was a box car, and the other two were coal <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>cars, loaded with coal. These two cars were ahead of the box car, and ran nortli past the crossing and a little north of the station house. There is some dispute as to where the box car stood; however it did not clear the crossing, which is at grade. The engine, caboose and seven cars went down the main track —eastern track — over the crossing, the last car, a box car, being about three lengths — ninety or a hundred feet — below it, when the engine was signaled to back up, and the train was backed up. At this time Mrs. Cookson and her boy, team and sled 'were on the track, and were struck by the backing box car. She was instantly killed, and the boy died from his injuries a few hour’s afterwards. When she came to the house of Miss Boggs, about one hundred and seventy-five or two hundred feet from the track, she stopped for some ten or fifteen minutes, looked and listened. At this point she could see the crossing and bridge beyond distinctly, and could see the cars crossing the wagon road, and for a short distance she could see the-tops of the cars on the railroad, but not the track at either1 right or left of the crossing. After leaving her stopping place at Miss Boggs’s house she could not see the railroad to her right, on account of the high ground and stone wall at Mr. lift’s property, neither could she see to her left, on account of buildings at that side of the road. When she came near the track her view to the left — north—was obstructed by the box car, which was thrown in on the siding immediately before she reached the track, which was not far enough north to clear the crossing. Mr. Didier, the defendant’s engineer and witness, testifies that on account of the position of the box car there was no point from the road on which Mrs. Cookson stopped where she could see either up or down the railroad track until she came within thirteen feet of the south-bound track — the one on which she was killed — and there she could see ten feet north of the road or street; The ordinary distance from a driver’s seat on a common country sled to the point of the tongue is ten or twelve feet, so that when she was in a position to see ten feet down the track and north of the street her horses’ heads must necessarily have been up within two or three feet of the track on which the accident occurred, and the ordinary box car extends some eighteen or twenty inches beyond the track, leaving little or no room for a team of horses to stand in front of her.</p>

Under such circumstances the appellant’s negligence, though not formally conceded, did not admit of serious contention.</p>
    <p id="b215-7" data-blocks='[["BL_215.8",215,[116,980,1171,347]]]'>The public road had a down grade towards the track, and plaintiff’s decedent stopped at a point about one hundred and seventy-five feet from the crossing. Here she waited some minutes until the three cars were switched off, and the train had proceeded north over the crossing.

    <p id="b215-8" data-blocks='[["BL_215.9",215,[117,1337,1175,1072]],["BL_216.1",216,[238,344,1169,454]]]'>The first three assignments of error are to the admission of the opinions of witnesses that the place where the deceased stopped to look and listen, was the best or at least a proper place. The subject of the admissibility of a witness’s opinion was considered in Graham v. Penn. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=189%20Pa.%20149" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="189 Pa. 149">189 Pa. 149</a>, and the rule there settled that where mere descriptive language is inadequate to convey to the jury the precise facts, or their bearing on the issue, the description by the witness must of necessity be allowed to be supplemented by his opinion, in order to put the jury in position to make the final decision of the fact. But whenever the circumstances can be fully and adequately described to the jury, and are such that their bearing on the issue can be estimated by all men without special knowledge or training, opinions of witnesses, expert or other, are not admissible. This rule was followed in McNerney v. Reading, <a href="/pa/150/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="150 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="834404" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0611-01">150 Pa. 611</a>, and Dooner v. Canal Co., <a href="/pa/164/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="164 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="860301" data-case-paths="/pa/164/0017-01">164 Pa. 17</a>. As already said, the distance at which the deceased stopped was considerable, but evidence was given on the part of plaintiff that this point was on the rise of the hill, and that the view was obstructed more and more in descending to the track, by a stone wall on the right, and by buildings on the left, and particularly on this occasion <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>by one of the cars just switched off by this train, which stopped before it got entirely across the road. There was another place where perhaps a better view of the tracks could be had, but it was so close as to be dangerous in case the horses should become frightened. As the relative advantages and disadvantages of the two places could only be described in a general way, it was a fair case for the witnesses who were familiar with both to supplement their descriptions with their opinions in aid of the jury in reaching a decision.</p>
    <p id="b216-5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[241,805,1170,1580]],["BL_217.1",217,[137,368,1168,186]]]'>The main argument of appellant however is that the evidence shows incontrovertibly that the deceased was negligent in not stopping at the second point already referred to, a level space just before reaching the track, and therefore the verdict should have been directed for the defendant. The evidence is uniform that there were but two places where a stop could be profitably made, one at considerable distance and the other very close to the crossing. Each had its advantages and its disadvantages. The deceased chose the remoter point, and there was evidence that in so doing she followed the usual habit of people at that crossing. This evidence of itself prevented the court from deciding it to be negligence per se. The usual and customary place of stopping by people using a road cannot be said as matter of law to be an improper or negligent place. The standard of negligence is what persons of ordinary prudence and carefulness would do under the same circumstances, and a general habit of the public to stop in a certain place, is persuasive evidence that that place is the right one. The further the stopping place is from the track the greater will be the chance of an intervening peril before actual crossing. The duty of the traveler is therefore not only to keep a vigilant and continuous lookout, but to stop if a second place affords any increased facility to discover impending danger, but whether there is any such second place is a question of fact which is for the jury if at all in doubt. On this branch the present case is closely analogous and governed by Whitman v. Penn. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/156/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="156 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="844878" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0175-01">156 Pa. 175</a>, and the remarks there made are applicable to the facts here, “ If notwithstanding the drawbacks of the place where plaintiff stopped, it still had sufficient advantages over other places to make it the habitual choice of travelers on that road, only a jury can say whether or not it was the hest or a proper place to stop, and <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>even if it was, whether considering its disadvantages it was negligence in the plaintiff not to stop a second time on the level before reaching the track.” See also Ely v. Rwy. Co., <a href="/pa/158/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="158 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="848225" data-case-paths="/pa/158/0233-01">158 Pa. 233</a>.</p>
    <p id="b217-5" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[136,573,1171,599]]]'>Several of the assignments of error are to the language of the charge. Its tone lacked judicial calmness, and in parts at least came dangerously near being inflammatory as to damages, in an action of a class that peculiarly imposes on the judge the duty to repress natural sympathy with the injured and the suffering, and to hold the jury firmly down to the consideration of strict rights and responsibilities. Our books are not without cases of reversal for errors of this kind. But the nature of the issue and the evidence and law applicable to it were correctly set before the jury, and though the tone of the charge was objectionable, we do not think it was so erroneous that we should reverse for that cause alone.</p>
