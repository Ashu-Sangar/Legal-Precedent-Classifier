She executed her will contemporane<a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>ously with the note, and in it made the following reference to the note:</p>

It provides that “ no estate, real or personal, shall hereafter be bequeathed devised, or conveyed to any body politic, or to any person in trust for religious or charitable uses, except the same be done by deed or will .... at least one calendar month before the decease of the testator or alienor.” “ Provided, that any disposition of property within said period bona fide made for a fair valuable consideration, shall not be hereby avoided.” If a strict construction be given to this act, it would appear to prohibit the gift of personalty for charitable uses by will only, and would not apply to gifts of personalty inter vivos. Such a construction seems to have been given it in McGlade’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/99/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="99 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="446270" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0338-01">99 Pa. 338</a>. There, for the avowed purpose of evading the act, the donor executed a power of attorney for the transfer of $2,400, of the Philadelphia city loan, delivered it and the certificates to M. with instructions to convert the certificates into money, and to give the proceeds to W. for distribution among the charities mentioned in her will. They were sold, and the money given to W. in the donor’s lifetime, and it was held that the gift was not within the prohibition of the act. But in that case there remained nothing for the donor to do to consummate the gift. Here the gift was the donor’s promise to pay, which would not be consummated until the money was paid; and, whilst the .promise was binding on the donor, it would be void <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>as to her legal representatives, after her death, if within the prohibition of the statute.</p>

There the decedent made within one calendar month of his death a written subscription for the erection of a church, and it was held that it was within the prohibition of the act.. Whilst Mr. Justice Gordon, who delivered the opinion of the court, intimated that the subscription was an unexecuted gift revoked by the death of the donor, yet he says, “ This is, however, merely obiter, for the act of 1855 renders invalid any and every conveyance or devise of property, real or personal,, made to any charity or body politic within one calendar month of the decease of the alienor, or testator, unless the same be made for a fair valuable consideration.” The word conveyance here is construed to apply to personal as well as real estate, and if it does, as there was no valuable consideration for this note, it is Avithin the prohibition of the statute. It is true, the gift of the sealed note was an executed gift, valid as between the donor and donee; but a deed executed and delivered Avithin thirty days of the donor’s death, would be also, and it -is conceded it would be within the express prohibition of the act; so, also, is this note if the word “ conveyed” refers to personal as well as real estate. The claim is, therefore, not allowed.</p>

Here there was a subscription to a church within a month of the subscriber’s death, and the court found and held that there was absolutely no consideration of any sort to support the promise, and that death revoked it.
