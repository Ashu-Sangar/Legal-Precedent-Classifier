    <p class="summary" id="b633-7" data-blocks='[["BL_633.6",633,[112,951,1174,1369]]]'>While it may be conceded that the death of one of the intended beneficiaries under this will made Dr. Foster a party interested in the trust estate as next of kin, his interest is manifestly not such as can be made presently available in attachment by his creditors; for it cannot be taken without prejudice to his children’s rights : Drake on Attachment, 245. The trust estate is of such a character as to be incapable of present division. It consists of the household furniture which was in use during Mrs. Foster’s lifetime, and has been continued since in the same character. While there was no formal appointment by the donee, there was its equivalent in the permissive use which the trustee allowed his children. Dr. Foster testified that this continued use was in accordance with testatrix’s wish. It was at least a natural use, for it was part of the equipment, and necessary to the enjoyment of the children’s home. Its appointment to that use was made when all three children were living, and Dr. Foster’s good faith could not have been questioned. No change has since been made, and Dr. Foster can receive no increased benefit so long as this continues. The furniture, as a whole, is not less necessary to the surviving children. Their father is admittedly insolvent; and certainly as between him and them, he could not deprive them of what was necessary to their home comfort; for they were made the primary objects of bounty with his express consent; and what he could not, his creditors ought not to be permitted to do. The household furniture so far as appears is an entirety which cannot be broken without a breach of trust: Slemmons’ Est., <a href="/citations/?q=178%20Pa.%20156" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="178 Pa. 156">178 Pa. 156</a>.</p>

The apportionment of the principal will not become imperative until the majority of his youngest son, six years hence; and as it has not been made to appear that there is any contemplated action in the meantime to the prejudice of exceptant there is no present occasion for interference by this court. If occasion should in the meantime require, the question may arise whether or not the surviving beneficiaries have a right, assuming that Dr. Foster is incompetent, to the appointment of a trustee competent to act on the principle that a trust shall not fail for want of a trustee. The fact that, in the event of Dr. Foster’s death, the will expressly provides his “ successor in the line of the trust shall have all of the power and discretion ” which had been given him, necessarily implied that the exercise of these powers was intended to be made incidental to, and limited only by the duration of the trust. The trust having been created for the benefit of all the children, each was' interested in its continued existence; and it is not apparent why the death of one should prejudice the others, especially in view of the evident purpose to prefer them to Dr. Foster. As the father was, in contemplation of law, primarily liable for the training and maintenance of the children, the natural presumption is that the discretion given was subsidiary, and intended to be governed by the need of each of them.</p>
