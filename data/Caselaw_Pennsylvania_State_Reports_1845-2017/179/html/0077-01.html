    <p class="summary" id="b101-3" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[74,460,1172,556]]]'>From the statement of facts, agreed on by counsel, it appears that James Jackson, at the time of his death, was over seventy-eight years old. His daughter Catharine was about fifty-one, and Willie Webber Jackson about twelve. The testator outlived his wife some ten years. Catharine lived with her father until his decease. That she was a faithful and trusted daughter is evident from this fact, and the further fact that the testator deemed her worthy to take an important part in the mental and moral training of his grandson. At the time the will was signed, the ninety acre' tract of land was worth about $5,400, and the twenty-two acre tract about $800.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b101-4" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[72,1025,1172,235]]]'>A first glance at this will recalls Coke’s remark, which is as true today as when it was uttered: “ Wills and the construction of them do more perplex a man than any other learning, and to make a certain construction of them, this excedit jurisprudentium artem.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.6",101,[71,1281,1173,402]]]'>The interpretation contended for by Robert Jackson would, if adopted, result in depriving his sister, Catharine, of all benefit under the will. If she do not marry, the absolute interest in the personalty and the fee simple in the realty, given her by the first words of the devising clause, will be reduced to a life estate, and, if she do marry, she shall forfeit everything save the substitutionary bequest of $1,000, a sum insufficient to enable her to meet the charges imposed on her by the will.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b101-6" data-blocks='[["BL_101.7",101,[66,1690,1174,707]]]'>Obviously, some construction should be sought for which will not work such seeming injustice, and which will effectuate what, looking at all the surroundings we have every reason to believe was the testator’s main intent. It is impossible not to think that he had it in his mind to substantially benefit the faithful daughter who, it appears, had spent the best years of her life in his service. The will shows a desire and intention on the testator’s part to provide fairly for each of his children. It is hardly possible that, as to Catharine, his purpose was to give with one hand and take away with the other; nor can we reasonably suppose that he would expect her to actually pay out in money, not counting the labor and anxiety attending the care and education of her nephew, more than the value of the life estate, or the $1,000 legacy.</p>

Third, that where a devisee is subjected to a charge or burden which, it is unreasonable to think, would have been imposed unless the estate given was intended to be a fee simple, all doubts should be resolved in favor of the devisee.

The principle that the devise of a fee absolute in the first instance cannot be reduced to an estate for life unless the intention to do so is clear is recognized in the opinion, and the case is not in conflict with the rule of construction so often stated in our cases from Biddle’s Estate, <a href="/pa/28/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="28 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="981694" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0059-01">28 Pa. 59</a> <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>to Mitchell v.

The decision of the learned judge of the orphans’ court is in harmony with the general rules of construction, and with the act of April 8, 1833, which provides that “all devises of real estate shall pass the whole estate of the testator in the premises devised, although there are no words of inheritance or perpetuity, unless it appeal's by a devise over, or by words of limitation or otherwise in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate.” The construction, if it is necessary to resort to the established rules, should be in favor of the first rather than of- the second taker: of an absolute or vested estate rather than of a defeasible or contingent one; of a general or primary intent rather than of a particular or secondary one: Smith’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/23/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="23 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="974034" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0009-01">23 Pa. 9</a>; Etter’s Estate, <a href="/pa/23/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="23 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="973973" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0381-01">23 Pa. 381</a>; Letchworth’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/30/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="30 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="415635" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0175-01">30 Pa. 175</a>; Womrath v.

    <p id="b105-5" data-blocks='[["BL_105.4",105,[80,1299,1172,1015]]]'>This construction, we think, gives effect to the actual intent. The real estate devised by the testator to his daughter was worth about $6,200.- The stock on the farm was owned by the son. The testator’s daughter had always lived with him, and for ten years had had sole charge of his house. Her proportion of the charges imposed, the payment of the legacy to another son-and the maintenance and education of the testator’s grandson, amounted to more than the value of a life estate in one half of the farm, and unless this construction be given she takes nothing of value under the provisions of a will certainly intended to be of substantial benefit to her. The implication arising from the words “ what remains ” is that she had an unlimited power of disposal, which is inconsistent with the existence of a valid limitation over. In the first instance he gives her a vested estate unlimited in point of duration, and that the subsequent provisions were meant to become operative only in the event of her death in his lifetime is quite as probable as any other supposition. There is at least no clear evidence of a contrary intent, and the law regards with disfavor conditions subsequent divesting or reducing a vested estate.</p>
