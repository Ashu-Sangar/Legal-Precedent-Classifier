      <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>The other question is a far more important one. The claim of the city is for over $100,000. The main facts of the case are tírese: The Pittsburgh, Allegheny &amp; Manchester Passenger Railway Company, the defendant in this action, was organized in 1859, under a special act of the legislature. It was authorized to construct a passenger railway from Pittsburgh, through Allegheny, and to, what was then, the borough of Manchester. That act of assembly required the company to pay to the city of Allegheny five per cent on all dividends of profits. That was paid by the company until the arrangement was made with the traction company, sometime in 1889 or 1890. The old company was organized and chartered as a horse-car company, the motive power being horse-power. Under their charter, as decided in other cases by the Supreme Court, it had no authority to change to electric or cable power. The stock of the old company was seven thousand shares, of the par value of $50.00 a share, making the capital stock $350,000. Sometime, I presume after the organization of that company, a company, called The Pittsburgh Union Passenger Railway Company was organized. The defendant company purchased a controlling interest in that company, which was also a passenger railway in the city of . Allegheny. That company had a capital stock of $100,000, two .thousand shares at the par value of $50.00 a share. The Pittsburgh, Allegheny &amp; Manchester Passenger Railway Company purchased one thousand four hundred and ninety-nine shares of the union company’s stock, which gave them the controlling interest in it. In 1889, a movement was put on foot to change to an electric railway. The old company, having a capital only of $350,000, and limited to horse power, and also having a mortgage then on their property, were financially unable, under their charter, to raise the money necessary in changing it to an electric railway. An act of assembly was passed in 1887, authorizing the incorporation of companies to use electricity or cable power for more rapid transit over street railways. Several of the stockholders of the old passenger railway company applied for a charter of incorporation, under the act of 1887, and obtained it. The capital stock of that company was only $5,000 originally. Under the act of assembly that company was authorized to lease any passenger railway, and to apply electricity as a motive power. It was then arranged by the stockholders of the <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>passenger railway company, with the sanction, of the corporation,that the stockholders should transfer their stock to the electric company, and that the capital stock of that company should be increased to $3,000,000. The company was organized, and the old stockholders took stock in the electric or traction company. They subscribed and got eight shares in the new company for one share they had in the old. The old company made a lease for nine hundred and ninety-nine years, transferring all their property, rights and franchises to the electric company, all except some-real estate that was-held by the trustees, and after7 wards sold and divided among the shareholders, to which I have already referred.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b439-3" data-blocks='[["BL_439.4",439,[101,969,1172,1168]]]'>Now the claim of the plaintiff is, that by the stockholders of the old company getting eight shares of stock in the electric company for one in the old, it was in the naturé of a stock dividend, for which they ought to pay the five per cent to Allegheny city. The stock of the passenger railway company had increased very greatly in value. The par value was $50.00 a share, but the evidence of Mr. Hill is that shortly before this arrangement was made the stock of that company was selling in the market at $320 a share' — that would show that the stock had enhanced in value nearly seven times; and the evidence is that the stock in the new company7 shortly after it was organized sold at $40.00 a share; so that eight shares of stock in the new, or electric company, were exactly equal to one share in the old company at that time. Eight shares at $40.00 a share would be $320, and that was what one share of the old company’s stock was selling for at that time. No doubt the road was worth a great deal more than the $350,000 (the capital stock) at the time of this arrangement. No doubt it was because of its increased business which enabled it to pay handsome dividends* By the arrangement the traction company was bound to pay an annual rent to the old passenger railway company, of $75,000 a year, that would be at the rate of very nearly twenty-two per cent on $350,000.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b439-4" data-blocks='[["BL_439.5",439,[100,2150,1169,249]],["BL_440.1",440,[259,361,1169,914]]]'>Now the argument on the part of the counsel representing the city is, that the value of the corporate property had very greatly increased, and, as it was all transferred to the traction company, the increased value should be regarded in the character of a stock dividend, and be liable to pay a tax of five per <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>cent to the'city of .Allegheny. If I understand the argument it is this: that as the property of that old passenger railway company was worth seven times as much as its capital stock, the excess was in the nature of a dividend to the stockholders, and the increased value would be liable to the tax of five per cent. The traction company would be liable to pay the tax to Allegheny city on its dividends, whether it directly assumed to do so or not. Taking the franchises, property and rights of the old passenger railway company, it would take them subject to the burdens ripon them, and, as they were bound to pay five per cent tax upon the dividends, the new company would be bound toJpay it also. But they expressly assumed it. The ordinance of the city, substantially sanctioning this transfer, or at least, recognizing the rights of the electric company, also imposed this condition. The electric company has been paying the tax to the city ever since it was organized in 1890 and, according to the evidence, the tax paid to the city, has been greater than prior to this new arrangement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[258,1284,1168,803]]]'>I think there is a difference between a tax on the capital stock of a company and a tax simply on the dividends of the profits of the company. Where the tax is on-the capital the dividends often measure that capital. The dividends may show that the property is worth a great deal more than its capital stock. In this case the tax is to the city of Allegheny upon dividends of profits, or earnings of the railway company. Now, undoubtedly, the directors of the company might have suspended dividends for a year, or two or three years, if necessary, if it was advisable to pay debts. The paying of debts is a benefit to stockholders, because all expenses and interest on debts have to first be paid before there can be a dividend or profit. Wiping out the debts is an advantage to the stockholders. Although they might not get a dividend for two or three years, in the end they would get more in consequence of paying the indebtedness. ...</p>

By the twelfth section of the act the company was required, inter alia, to pay to the city of Allegheny a certain per centage “ of the dividends declared.” The city of Allegheny by ordinance gave its consent to the occupation of its <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>streets upon the same condition of the payment of the tax upon “dividends declared.” The question in the present case is whether the transaction by which the railway company was leased to the traction company, and the stockholders exchanged their holdings of stock in the former for stock in the latter, assuming all these matters to have been parts of the same transaction, was equivalent to the declaration of a dividend by the railway company on which a tax would be due under the charter and ordinance.</p>

A dividend, as defined by Webster’s dictionary (1893) is “the share of a sum divided that falls to each individual, a distributive sum, share or percentage, applied to the profits as apportioned among stockholders.” It differs from profits in being taken by competent authority out of the joint property of the partnership or company, and transferred to the separate property of the individual partners or stockholders. No safely conducted business, corporate or other, distributes all its earned profits. There must be a fund reserved for contingencies, for repair or renewal of deteriorated material, etc., and the amount, absolute or proportionate, to be held for such purpose must be determined by the authority which conducts the business. The power to control this matter is necessarily implied in all authority to make dividends, and in the present case it is expressly vested in the directors who are to declare such dividends as “shall appear advisable” to them, not exceeding net profits. The words “ dividends declared ” therefore, have a substantial and settled meaning, and it is upon such dividends only, and not as already said on par or market value of stock or on profits earned, that the tax is laid.</p>

The traction company acquired the stock of the railway company, which under its charter it had power to do. It might under such power have gone into the market and bought railway stock at 320, and sold enough of its own stock at 40 to pay for the other. Instead of the acquisition being made thus by separate purchase and sale of the two stocks, it was done by direct exchange between the owners. The nature of the transaction was not changed thereby. It was a transfer of property from one owner to another, and the personality of the purchaser or the seller did not change its substantial character. Then as to the railway company, its stock has changed holders, and that is all. The shares are all in existence just as they were before, but instead of being owned by numerous individuals they are held in one hand, in fact they are a valuable corporate asset of the traction company, and are pledged as collateral security for its bonds. As regards the railway company with reference to which the tax is to be considered, there was no distribution or change of what had been the joint corporate property, into the separate property of the individual stockholders. The whole transaction was a change <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>of ownership of the same property, and neither in form nor in substance the declaration of a dividend.</p>

In both of them the tax was upon the value of the capital stock, and not on the dividends, which were mere measures of such value, and in. both of them there had been in fact a severance of earnings or profits from the mass of the corporate property, and a distribution of them among the stockholders as individuals, which is the essential character of a dividend.</p>
    <p id="b445-4" data-blocks='[["BL_445.5",445,[121,917,1171,1485]],["BL_446.1",446,[252,348,1165,298]]]'>A distinction was raised in the argument here between the transaction as regards the exchange of stock by the holders in the railway company and the transfer to the traction company of the one thousand four hundred and ninety-nine shares of the Union Passenger company. The latter were held by trustees, but under what title or upon what terms does not precisely appear. The distinction was not made in the plaintiff’s statement, nor at the trial, and there is no assignment of error raising it specifically in this court; the plaintiff’s claim being made upon the entire transaction as single and involving a tax upon the whole. It appears inferentially in the argument and in some of the evidence that these shares of the Union company were part of the general assets of the appellee, and that in the arrangement they were transferred to the traction company in consideration of the issue of additional shares of its stock to the holders of the shares of appellee. If such was the fact it would seem to be a severance of these shares from the corporate property of the appellee and a distribution of their value or equivalent among the stockholders individually, and therefore a dividend, taxable unless the legislative intent was to restrict the tax to cash dividends only, an intent that could hardly be presumed, and the burden of proof of which would be upon appellee. But if this were the real state of the facts there would be no difference except the question of cash dividend between the distribution of the proceeds of this Union stock and the proceeds of the sale of the real estate, etc., as to which the learned judge below directed the jury to assess the tax. It would not be safe for us to assume that his including one and excluding the other was the result altogether of not having his attention called to the latter. <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>We must presume that the facts before him did not warrant him in putting both on the same footing. The facts if fully developed may however be so, and in affirming the judgment, therefore, we do so with leave to the court below to open and reconsider it upon this point should the facts and the law make it just and proper to do so. .</p>
