It is whether the plaintiff did the work claimed for in this case, under a verbal contract with the defendant. He claims here some $2,300, nearly double his contract — for what ? For trying to clean out that well. He says when he went there to work he found it plugged up, or, at least, caved in, about six hundred feet down. He went to the defendant, told him about it, and that he would need some tools to take out the tubing, and on two or three other occasions went to him and told about their troubles and difficulties. What agreement was there, now, between these parties ? That is the question, gentlemen — the main question —in this case. What was the agreement ?</p>

Now, what did that mean ? If the defendant did say that to him, what did he mean by that, and what was the understanding between the parties ? Was it that the plaintiff could go to any expense he pleased, and continue to work at that well for six months, and that the defendant would pay for all his expenses and all his men, and all his own labor? Was that what was meant by that ? Or was it that, when he said he would have to have some tools, to take out the tubing, the defendant agreed to pay for that? Under the statement of the plaintiff, he expected to have a well clear, down one thousand four hundred and fifty feet; but this obstruction there would have to be removed, and he would have to have special tools for it, because, he said, he had no tools there for it. Now what did the defendant mean by saying: “ I will do what is right; you shan’t lose ? ” Was it: “ Get what tools may be necessary to draw the tubing, and I will pay for that; ” or was it to give him unlimited time to go on and work six months there ? And did the defendant expect to be bound to pay for all his expenses and all his men <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>and time, and his own labor for that time ? What was really the understanding between the plaintiff and defendant in this conversation ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[274,502,1170,242]]]'>There is some evidence that, at different times, the plaintiff said they were getting along very well. According to his own testimony, they were never getting along well at all. Never from the start did they get along well; it got worse and worse all the time.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.6",476,[272,913,1171,813]]]'>Well now, gentlemen, bearing on that question as to what was the understanding between the parties, what occurred at Mr. Wallace’s office has a very material bearing on this case. There is contradiction between the plaintiff and the defendant and Wallace as to some things that occurred there at the office, but in some things there is no contradiction. The plaintiff then said that he would give up this contract, or abandon it, and I believe that that is not contradicted — that that expression was used, or testimony to that effect. The plaintiff admits that at that conversation the defendant claimed and wanted all the tools that were there at the well, and threatened him, if he did not give them, that he would send the sheriff on him. According to the defendant’s testimony, if you believe it, he had already paid some $600 or so to the plaintiff, in money and for tools that he had got, and had that claim, and contended for damages because he had not completed his contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.7",476,[270,1734,1170,504]]]'>Now, what is the position of the plaintiff there? And that is about the 1st of April, 1891, just the time that he quit working there. Does the plaintiff there, at that time, say to Mr. Sattler: “ Why, you owe me $2,000 or so for work at that well. I want my pay,” —anything of that kind said ? Does the plaintiff here say that, at that time, he demanded any money from the defendant ? If he did not, at that time, claim anything due to him, it has a very important bearing upon this case, as to whether there was such a contract as he says now there was, in September, 1890.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b476-8" data-blocks='[["BL_476.8",476,[270,2247,1166,146]],["BL_477.1",477,[154,350,1174,650]]]'>Another fact may bear on this controversy. It seems that a day or two after that interview at Wallace’s office, Sattler brought suit against him for these tools there at the well, claim<a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>ing — well, lie didn’t bring the suit for the tools, but brought a suit claiming that the plaintiff owed him, and attached all of these tools and things there, to secure his claim. It seems that after a couple of trials, perhaps, in the other courts, the plaintiff got a verdict against Sattler for taking those tools, or for something of that kind. That suit, as the counsel for the defendant say, has never yet been finally determined; but the verdict of the jury was in favor of Taylor, the plaintiff, in that controversy. Even then no suit is brought by Taylor against Sattler. This suit that we are trying was brought in January of 1894, some two years and nine months after he had quit working at the well, and after this suit or litigation in reference to the other matters.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.4",477,[152,1018,1171,546]]]'>I say these are facts, gentlemen, for you to consider in connection with the testimony now. Suppose the defendant did say: “ Go on and you shan’t lose; I will do what is right.” Suppose he did? What was the understanding between the parties about that? Was it to say to the plaintiff: “Go on under your contract, and if you are at any additional or extra expense in trying to get at this, why I will pay that.” Was it to go on any length of time he pleased, at any expense he pleased and “ I will pay you for all your expense and all your men, and this at the rate of $4.00 a day all the time you are there ? ”</p>

There was therefore no attempt to substitute a verbal contract for a written one. It was alleged that the verbal agreement was made in consequence of the written one, and the admission of the latter in evidence was merely as explanatory of the testimony relating to the verbal contract on which alone plaintiff relied. As thus restricted it was not improperly admitted.</p>

By necessary implication the fact that there was a verbal contract, as claimed by plaintiff, has been established by the verdict, and the amount due thereunder has been found. There appears to be no substantial error in the proceedings leading up to these conclusions of fact; nor is there anything in either of the specifications of error that requires further discussion.</p>
