The evidence for plaintiff tended to show that the defendant company suffered the uninsulated wire to remain on its poles for many years, and that on the day of the accident the wire broke and fell over a heavily charged wire. The deceased, in the discharge of his duty, and while attempting to remove the wire, was killed. The plaintiff’s theory was that the deceased while attempting to remove the wire with due care with his mace came in contact <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>with it with his body, and convulsively grasped the wire as he fell.

It knew, as its own witnesses testify, that any wire upon these poles was liable to break and carry the deadly current to the ground by falling across a live wire, especially if the wire was a naked one, as this wire admittedly was. This dead, useless and uninsulated wire did break, fell across a charged wire, carried down the current, and the death of the plaintiff’s husband was the result. We certainly cannot disturb the verdict because of the finding of the jury on the question of defendant’s negligence.</p>

It hung from a pole, the end <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>resting on the ground near the foot crossing, and at intervals emitting sparks. It was a rainy night, and any contact with the wire meant injury — even the touch of the frame of an umbrella of one passing, to the wire would, doubtless, have caused the instant death of him who carried it. Will the law say to the policeman on duty under such circumstances that his sole or primary duty is to look out for his own safety ? If it will not, then this question was one for the jury. It was told that if he voluntarily took the wire in his hand there could be no recovery. The testimony showed that he undertook to remove it with his mace, a method which, under ordinary circumstances, would have been perfectly safe. In some unexplained way he came into more dangerous contact with the wire.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[278,1022,1176,558]]]'>Test the case by changing the position of the parties. Suppose, in pushing aside this wire with his mace, Dillon had brought it in contact with and thus injured some one who was passing by, and had been sued, would any court have the hardihood to say, under the circumstances, as matter of law, that be was guilty of negligence ? Doubtless, by standing on the sewer drop, especially on this wet night, he increased his danger. But a negligent company cannot, for the purpose of escaping liability for its acts, set up a duty on the part of policemen to be expert electricians, and we must, in discussing this question, assume the negligence of defendant company.</p>

There appears to be no exception to his general charge, nor to any of his rulings on questions of evidence, etc. It is very evident from an examination of the testimony that it presented material questions of fact which the jury alone could legally determine. The case was accordingly submitted to them in a clear and accurate charge, quite as favorable to the defendant as it could reasonably ask.</p>

In view of the instructions under which the jury acted, their verdict necessarily implies a finding that defendant company was guilty of negligence in leaving the broken, uninsulated telephone wire in such a position as to endanger the lives of persons using the street; and that plaintiff’s husband, in the proper discharge of his duty as a police officer, while attempting to remove the dangerous ' nuisance, was brought in contact with the charged wire, and thus without any negligence on his part lost his life.
