On May 25,1896, a petition for "change of venue was presented by defendants to Judge Wallace, who directed it to be presented to Judge Miller. {1) It was presented to Judge Miller, who overruled it. (2) On the same day defendants filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the court, alleging that Judge Miller was disqualified by reason of a certain letter which he had written, which was quoted in the plea. The court, through Judge Miller, overruled the plea. (3) On the same day the defendants moved challenging the array of jurors, on the ground that Judge Wallace had participated in drawing the jurors. Judge Miller overruled the motion. (4) At 3:20 p. m. on the same day a writ of certiorari was issued from the Supreme Court, without any allocatur. At 3:40 p.

The decisions which hold that the record is to be treated as removed only from the time of actual filing of the writ in the court below, and not from the time of issue out of the office of this court, were intended to save the action of the court in the cause while the record is still actually there, and the court has no official knowledge of tbe order for its removal.

It is not the appropriate remedy, and it was issued prematurely without allowance. The suit was a common law action for libel. During its progress, before its actual call for trial by the jury, various dilatory motions were made, for change of venue, to quash the array of jurors, a plea in abatement to the jurisdiction of the court as then constituted, etc. These matters are not ordinary subjects of certiorari. It is true they are regulated ,by statute, and that certiorari is the proper writ to review proceedings out of the course of the common law, but these matters were not statutory proceedings in that sense, but mere interlocutory steps in the course of a common law action. It has never been held that a party can bring his case to this Court piecemeal in this <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>way, merely because some of the preliminaries to the trial have been regulated by statute somewhat at variance with' ancient common law forms. If a defendant could have the case reviewed in this way at every step, he could delay the plaintiff indefinitely, and load this Court with matters that belong to the tribunals of first instance. He must wait until he is aggrieved by a final judgment, and bring the whole case here at the same time.</p>
