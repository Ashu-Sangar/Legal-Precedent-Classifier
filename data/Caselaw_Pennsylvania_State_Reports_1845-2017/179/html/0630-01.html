The exceptions to the report of the viewers were in substance that the assessments were based upon the cost and not the value of the improvements, and that they Avere excessive and inequitable; and that they Avere improperly made because the viewers had not from personal inspection ascertained the character of the work, the situation of the property, the adaptability of the pavement to the grade of the street, and the particular -benefit or damage resulting to each property. The first time these exceptions appeared on the list their argument was postponed at the request of the appellant’s counsel. The second time they were ready for argument, counsel asked the court to appoint a commissioner to take the testimony anew, and this request being refused they declined to proceed Avith the argument or to point out their objections to the report. The report was then confirmed, but upon information that the exceptions filed by one of the parties had through mistake not been placed on the argument list and an opportunity for a hearing given him, the court set aside the confirmation of the report and. reopened the case as to al] the parties excepting, and the testimony taken before the viewers was filed. When the case again came on for hearing, counsel for the exceptants neither argued their exceptions nor stated to the court any reason for setting aside the report, but raised new questions not before us now.
