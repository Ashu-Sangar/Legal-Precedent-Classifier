The latter died pending the suit, without leaving any issue, and under thirty years of age; the significance of which, with other facts, will appear from the opinion of the Supreme Court. The defendant also denied liability in this suit because the insured had refused to submit the matters to arbitration under the terms of the policy which provided that in case the parties could not agree upon the loss, appraisers should be chosen ■ to adjust it. The court submitted the case to the jury on the question whether the value of the house at the time of the fire was equal to the amount of the policy, and what that value was.

The condition was nothing more than an agreement to refer to three appraisers to be appointed at a future time, to determine the amount of the loss by the award of any two of them. It was a revocable agreement and the insurance company is in no position to complain, here or elsewhere, of the revocation of it. It has not shown that it admitted the validity of its policy, or its liability under it, but on the contrary it has, in the language of the learned judge of the court below, “ always denied its liability on ground which, if sustained, cut up the contract by the roots.” The foregoing views are fully warranted and sustained by the decision of this Court in Mentz v. Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/79/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="79 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="438446" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0478-01">79 Pa. 478</a>. In Assurance Co. v.

The property destroyed was a dwelling house included in the devise by David McKee of his homestead to John D. McKee “to be his forever for his own proper use,” subject only to a restriction of alienation until he attained the age of thirty years, which in his case was for the period of thirteen years. In Jauretche v. Proctor, <a href="/pa/48/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="48 Pa. 466" data-case-ids="422209" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0466-01">48 Pa. 466</a>, Woodward, C. J., said: “A <em>partial </em>restriction, such as not to alien to a particular person or for a limited time, may be supported, but a general restraint of alienation when annexed to an absolute estate is void, upon the familiar principle that conditions repugnant to the estate to which they are annexed bind not.” This is in accord with the view expressed by Tilghman, C. J., in McWilliams v. Nisly, <em>2 </em>S. <em>&amp; R. </em>507, and by Coulter, J., in McCullough v. Gilmore, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Pa.%20870" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="11 Pa. 870">11 Pa. 870</a>. It is said in 6 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 877, note 4, that “ the weight of authority seems to be against such restraints however limited as to time.” The ground on which a partial <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>restraint of alienation is supported is that it is not inconsistent with a reasonable enjoyment of the fee: McWilliams v. Nisly, supra, and Libby v. Clark, <a href="/us/118/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="118 U.S. 250" data-case-ids="3519986" data-case-paths="/us/118/0250-01">118 U. S. 250</a>. While the cases on this point are conflicting, the Pennsylvania cases we have, cited seem to sustain a partial restraint of alienation. But we may assume that the restriction in question, is valid without conceding that it relieves the insurer from liability on its policy. The conditions of the policy are to be understood, not in their technical sense, but as requiring that the insured be the actual and substantial owner: Beach on Insurance, sec. 405. The risk was not affected by the restriction. It was not inconsistent with a reasonable enjoyment of the estate devised, and the insured was the actual, sole and substantial owner of the property destroyed. For the reasons above stated the restriction in question cannot be regarded as affording a defense to the action.</p>

The provision referred to is preceded by the devise of the homestead, by gifts of annuities to the brothers, sisters, and children of the testator, and by the appointment of executors. It is as follows: “ On the death of my heirs herein named all property and bank stock to be sold and divided among all the heirs should my grandson John D. McKee die before he is thirty without leaving any heirs his estate to be divided pro rata among the heirs.” We have quoted it entire and as it was written. It is quite clear that by “ my heirs herein named ” the testator meant the annuitants, and that “all the heirs” included John D. McKee. It is also obvious that “ all property and bank stocks ” did not include the homestead previously devised in fee. The part of the provision which relates to the division of John D. McKee’s estate may be fairly referred to his share of the proceeds of the property previously directed to be sold. , It may be possible to construe it as including the homestead, but it seems to us that this is not the reasonable interpretation of it. “ The clearly expressed purpose of a testator is not to be overborne by modifying directions that are ambiguous and equivocal, and may justify either of two opposite interpretations. Such directions are to be so construed as to support the testator’s distinctly announced main inten<a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>tion : ” Sheetz’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/82/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="82 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1047854" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0218-01">82 Pa. 218</a>. “ Where there is a clear gift in a will it cannot afterwards be cut down except by something which with reasonable certainty indicates the intention of the testator to cut it down: ” 2 Jarman on Wills, 443. Applying this well settled rule of construction to the will under consideration we hold that there is nothing in it which clearly indicates that it was the intention of the testator to defeat or modify his devise of the homestead. There is no other question raised by the specifications which requires discussion. All the specifications are overruled.</p>
