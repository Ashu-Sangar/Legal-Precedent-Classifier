Taylor, the decedent, was injured upon the road of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Railway Company on June 29, 1892. On August 25, 1892, she brought an action of trespass against said company to recover compensation for the injuries alleged to have been sustained by her on account of said accident. She died March 29, 1893, leaving surviving her three minor children, to wit: Mary Y. Taylor, George A. Taylor and Edith O. Taylor. By her last will and testament T. F. Birch, Esq., the accountant, and J. W. Rowland were appointed the executors of her estate, and these same gentlemen were also appointed by this court as the guardians of the above-named children. After her death the above-named executors had the same suggested upon the record, and themselves substituted as plaintiffs in the action brought by her; and on February 3, 1894, Birch and Rowland, as guardians of the above-named minor children, brought a second action of trespass against the said railway company to recover damages on account of the death of Mrs. Taylor. The action brought by Mrs. Taylor was to No. 58 of November term, 1892; and the action subsequently brought by the guardians of her minor children was to No. 196, February term, 1894. After the substitution of the executors as plaintiffs in the suit brought by Mrs. Taylor, an amended statement was filed by them which alleged that her death was caused by and the result of the injuries she received <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>on the said 29th day of June, 1892. To this statement a demurrer was filed by the defendant company upon the ground that the right of action did not survive the plaintiff. ■ The court of common pleas of Washington county sustained the demurrer so filed, and an appeal was taken by the plaintiffs to the Supreme Court of the state, which reversed the court below, and held that “ The right of action for death given by section 19, of the act of April 15,1851, as amended by section 1 of the act of April 26, 1855, is conditioned upon the concurring facts, that the injured party’s death was occasioned by said violence or negligence, and that no suit for damages was brought by him. The first section of the act of 1855 was not intended to dispense with either of said conditions. It merely designates the persons who, in connection with the widow, and in lieu of the personal representatives, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the statutory right of action, and recover damages for the death. In other respects, there does not appear to be any express or implied repeal or modification of the 18th and 19th sections of the act of 1851.”</p>

We there held that the eighteenth section of the act of April 15,1851, P. L. 674, was neither repealed nor modified by the act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 309; and that an action instituted to recover damages for personal injuries caused by negligence on the part of the defendant survived the injured party, and could be prosecuted to final judg<a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>ment and satisfaction by the personal representative of the deceased plaintiff. It was also held in the same case that the right of action for the death of a person injured by negligence •or violence of another, given by the nineteenth section of the same act was conditioned upon two concurring facts; first that the death of the injured person resulted from the violence or negligence complained of; and second, that no suit had been brought by the party injured to recover damages in his lifetime. That case disposes of this appeal so far as the main question is concerned. Mrs. Taylor was injured in a railroad accident in ■June, 1892. Some time after she brought an action against the railroad company to recover damages for the injury she had received. Pending this action she died in March, 1893. Her administrators were duly substituted as plaintiffs, and proceeded with the action, but before it was reached for trial the defendant made an offer to compromise, which was accepted hy the administrators with the assent of all parties interested in the prosecution of the claim. The sum of $7,500 was the amount agreed upon to be paid and received in full satisfaction of the plaintiff’s demand. Prior to the decision of Birch’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/165/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="165 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="862042" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0339-01">165 Pa. 339</a>, the guardians of Mrs. Taylor’s children had brought ■an action against the railroad company on behalf of their wards •claiming the right to recover, notwithstanding the action brought by Mrs. Taylor herself to which her administrators had succeeded. The decision in Birch’s Appeal was fatal to this contention, and determined that under the act of 1851, as also under that of 1855, the company was liable to but one action for the recovery of damages for the same injury to the same person. The action begun by the injured person having survived her, and the right to prosecute the same to “final judgment and satisfaction ” having been vested in her administrators, the damages suffered as the result of the injury were recoverable in that action and in that alone. The railroad company, however, insisted on the disposition of all pending actions against it on account of the-injury received by Mrs. Taylor, and the guardians accordingly joined the administrators in releasing the company from all further liability. As they had no claim to release, their joinder was a matter of form merely. It was superfluous. No right of action in them was extinguished by it, and it was perfectly clear that no interest, several or undi<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>vided, in tbe money paid to the administrators was acquired because of it. But it is suggested that their joining in the release at the request of the railroad company may be treated as the compromise of a doubtful claim, and that on this ground some part of the money paid should be awarded to them. There is however no evidence tending to show a settlement with the guardians, or the payment to them of a price in consideration of their release. They joined in the release to enable the administrators to conclude a settlement, and they well knew at the time that they had no valid demand against the company. It had been so held in Birch’s Appeal already referred to, and the testimony shows that no attempt was made to compromise with them.
