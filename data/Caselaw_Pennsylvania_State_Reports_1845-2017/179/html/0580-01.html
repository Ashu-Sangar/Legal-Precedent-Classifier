As was correctly said by the learned trial judge, there was no evidence whatever to go to the jury oh the question whether the paper was executed in the presence of two witnesses, as required by the law, as it was prior to the passage of the act of 1887, and hence the paper in question had to stand or fall under the provisions of that act.</p>

Stark, <a href="/pa/81/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="81 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1044157" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0235-01">81* Pa. 235</a>, the rule relating to the proper execution of a will is that it “ must be judged of by the law as it stood at the time of its execution, and not at the time of the death of the testator.” It was accordingly held in Taylor v. Mitchell, <a href="/pa/57/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="57 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1010414" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0209-01">57 Pa. 209</a>, that a charitable bequest in a will attested by a single witness, prior to the act of April 26, 1855, was good at the death of the testator after that date, although that act required two subscribing witnesses. Speaking for the court in that case, Mr. Justice Shabswood said: “ When a testator makes a will, formally executed according to the requirements of the law existing at the time of its execu<a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>tion, it would unjustly disappoint his lawful right of disposition to apply to it a rule subsequently enacted though before his death. While it is true that everyone is presumed to know the law, the maxim in fact is inapplicable to such case; for he would have an equal right to presume that no new law would affect his past act, and rest satisfied in security on that presumption. ... It is true that every will is ambulatory until the death of the testator, and the disposition made by it does not actually take effect until then. General words apply to the property of which the testator dies possessed, and he retains the power of revocation as long as he lives. The act of bequeathing or devising, however, takes place when the will is executed, though to go into effect at a future time.”</p>

In Kurtz v. Saylor, <a href="/pa/20/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="20 Pa. 205" data-case-ids="972348" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0205-01">20 Pa. 205</a>, it was decided that the will of a married woman, invalid for want of authority from her husband under the Wills Act of 1833, was not validated by the act of 1848, passed during her lifetime. That case is followed in Gable’s Executors v. Daub, <a href="/pa/40/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="40 Pa. 217" data-case-ids="478446" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0217-01">40 Pa. 217</a>. In Camp v.
