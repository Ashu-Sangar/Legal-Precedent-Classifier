Second, the agreement is not a conveyance of the land in dispute, and therefore no title passed to the defendant thereby. Third, that by the terms of the agreement John Geiger and his wife were only to execute a conveyance upon certain conditions depending entirely upon the volition of Geiger and his wife, and as their volition was not exercised in the lifetime of John Geiger the agreement is of no force or effect so far as concerns conveying title to the land in dispute. Fourth, the agreement is irrelevant and immaterial. Fifth, at most the agreement evinces a purpose or promise on the part of John Geiger and wife to make testar mentary disposition of the real estate referred to in favor of the defendant upon conditions satisfactory to the said Geiger and wife, and the purpose not having been carried into effect by Geiger in his lifetime, the paper is wholly inoperative as a conveyance of real estate, and therefore inadmissible in this case.</p>

The defendant alone excepted to this ruling; but, inasmuch as judgment non obstante veredicto was subsequently entered in his favor on the question reserved, he of course abandoned his exception; and no question, as to the form of the reservation, has been raised here by either party.</p>
    <p id="b151-5" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[92,656,1170,349]]]'>Waiving any question as to the regularity of the reservation, and considering the case, as the parties have done, on its merits, we are by no means convinced that the learned judge’s construction of the instrument, upon which defendant’s claim of title in himself depends, is not substantially correct.

    <p id="b151-6" data-blocks='[["BL_151.5",151,[92,1014,1169,453]]]'>There is no valid ground on which it can be successfully contended that the instrument in question is neither an executed nor an executory contract, but simply a lease. If that portion of it, designated as “ Part First ” stood alone, and contained no reference to “ Part Second ” and omitted the undertaking of the defendant, there might be some ground for construing it to be a lease. But in construing the paper both parts must be taken together; and when thus considered as a whole, it is very evident that it is not simply a lease.</p>

While the instruments to which they refer do contain words of present assurance of the land, they also provide for a future conveyance of the same. In the case at bar, there is a present grant of the land without any provision whatever for a future conveyance. The operative words are: “ (then) I (the said John Geiger and wife do) hereby grant to him (the said Thomas A. Menges) one day after my and my wife’s death the farm or tract of land described in Part First of this agreement, his heirs and assigns forever, and free of all incumbrances.” We thus have a present grant — containing words of inheritance —on conditions to. be performed by the grantee, followed by possession taken by him within less than three months after the <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>execution, of tlie instrument, and performance by him of tbe conditions and stipulations; and in addition thereto, valuable improvements made by him on the land, and continuous possession thereof during the joint lives of the grantor and his wife and the life of the survivor.</p>

We think it is, because (1) there is nothing unreasonable in its terms. It imposes on the defendant certain conditions, the performance of which on his part becomes absolutely necessary. (2) It contains words of <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>inheritance which, in equity are not even required in an executory contract. “ An executory contract will pass a fee simple in equity without words of inheritance: ” Ogden v.

(3) There was full compliance by defendant with its terms and conditions, and no complaint to the contrary was ever made by either the grantor or his wife. (4) The contract is perfectly fair. While it is informal, its terms are sufficiently clear and capable of ascertainment. There is no allegation of fraud or imposition in its procurement.</p>
