The character of the accused prior to the charge of crime is often important in determining the question of guilt, and it may of itself be sufficient to create the reasonable doubt which should work an acquittal. When damages are claimed for injury to character, the value of the character alleged to have been injured may properly be considered. In these cases it is character at the time of the alleged offense, or character at the time of the alleged injury, that may be taken into consideration and that may be proved.</p>

It does not appear that his connection with the controversy had become the subject of conversation or discussion in the neighborhood in which he lived, and that the reputation testified to was founded upon the expression of partisan opinions by those who had taken sides in the dispute. If this had appeared it might have been considered by the jury in determining the weight to be given to the testimony for and against him, but it would not have been ground for its exclusion. We have not been referred by counsel on either side to any authorities upon the subject, and we are not aware that the question has been decided in this state, but we find that the conclusion which we have reached is in harmony with the decisions in a number of other states : Mask v.
