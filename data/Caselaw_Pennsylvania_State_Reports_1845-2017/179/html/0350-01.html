    <p class="summary" id="b374-6" data-blocks='[["BL_374.6",374,[272,827,1163,1065]]]'>By the Court: The object as stated in this offer is to show that the plaintiffs were bound to ballast the road after the ti acks were laid. I think it will have to be a question for the court upon the written contract between the parties, and I don’t believe that any expert testimony is competent, but I cannot see that there is any ambiguity in the written contract. The plaintiffs covenanted to do certain things preparatory to their work. The defendant covenanted to do the excavation and prepare the bed of the road. I do not understand anything in the contract that requires the plaintiffs to do more than they expressly covenanted to do, nor do I understand it as limiting the defendant to simply excavating and preparing the roadbed. It would be something absolutely necessary, before the plaintiffs could proceed with their work, but what might be done and what might be necessary after the tracks were laid is not specified in the contract, and I think the fair presumption from the contract is that the plaintiffs could not be required to do anything more than they expressly covenanted to do. The clause in the agreement that they were to leave the track in good condition, ready for occupancy and ready for work, would be limited to what they expressly covenanted to do. [1]</p>

The main point of this offer, I apprehend, is to raise the question as to whether the plaintiffs were bound to elevate the outside track on these curves. If the object is for that purpose, I think the objection would have to be sustained. The defendant was bound to make the roadbed ready for the ties, and if it required an elevation on the outside of the curves, I think ‘the defendant was bound so to prepare the roadbed, but as I have intimated, if there were any little irregularities or defects, I have no doubt the plaintiffs would be required to correct them, and not take advantage of any little irregularity that would make the ties irregular. I cannot see that the expert testimony will throw any light on the written contract. That is for the court. Objection sustained. Exception and bill sealed. [2]</p>

It called for the construction of a railway in the manner and under the conditions “specified therein,” and authorized an inspection of the materials and work-by the engineers the defendant might employ or appoint for that purpose. The ties to be used in the construction of the railway were to be delivered by the defendant along the line of it. There was no express provision in the contract in regard to ballasting the road. The want of it led to this appeal. The defendant claimed that the plaintiffs were bound’by the contract to ballast it, while they claimed, and the court held, that they were not. The defendant offered to prove by the testimony of experts the meaning of the words “ excavated and prepared,” as applied to the roadbed, and used in the contract, but the offer was rejected on the ground that there was no ambiguity in them or arising from their use. These are the rulings of which the defendant complains. It is not denied that it is essential to the construction of a substantial railway that it should be well ballasted. But the court thought that inasmuch as this work was not expressly provided for in any of the plaintiffs’ covenants it was not chargeable to them. The court did not expressly say the defendant was bound to do the work, but it said there was nothing in the contract “ limiting the defendant to simply excavating and preparing the roadbed.” While it seemed to recognize the duty of ballasting the road as imposed by the contract, it expressly decided that it was nob laid by the contract upon the plaintiffs. It is clear that the defendant was not bound by the contract to ballast the road unless the ballast1 <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>ing of it was included in its covenant to prepare tbe roadbed! If the defendant was not bound to ballast it we have, under the ruling of the court below, a contract in which neither party is, required to do so, although the plaintiffs expressly agreed to furnish the materials and build the railway in a good, substantial and workmanlike manner and deliver it to the defendant “complete and ready for operation.” Manifestly, the parties contemplated the construction and completion of a good and substantial railway, and supposed they had contracted for one. All that the contract required the defendant to do was to prepare the roadbed and deliver the ties while the plaintiffs were required bjr it to furnish the materials and perform the work necessary to the construction and completion of the railway “ ready for operation.”</p>
