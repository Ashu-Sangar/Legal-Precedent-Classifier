She was from McKeesport. Being of good appearance and having good manners, she was made parlor maid, which is a very desirable place for women in hotel work, but two days ago she disappeared, and is said to have gone to Philadelphia to meet a chewing gum agent whom she met at the hotel. The chewing gum gentleman made his appearance at the house about a month ago, and he and the girl got noticeably thick. He staid about one and a-half weeks, after which Miss O’Toole, a girl friend noticed, got despondent. Her sudden leave to join her drummer friend explains this, but their life will not be one of a rosy path, if her father, who is said to have gone to Philadelphia with a gun to hunt for them, finds them. Miss O’Toole is said to have been engaged to a young man in McKeesport when she left there.”</p>

The third, fourth and fifth assignments relate to the admission of testimony to show the injurious effect of the publication upon the reputation of the plaintiff among' her friends and acquaintances, and that it prevented her from obtaining employment. Testimony as to the effect upon her feelings was properly excluded. There was no attempt to prove the meaning of the words used, or to explain the publication. The purpose was to show in what maimer the publication had affected the plaintiff where she was known, and how it had prevented her from earning a living. This was in support of her averment of special damage.</p>

The plaintiff had testified that her request for a retraction was refused except on terms that she would not bring suit. On the part of the defendant it was denied that any terms were insisted upon. The fact was not established in favor of either party, and the learned judge might well pass it without comment. He was not asked to say anything in relation to it, and the defendant cannot now be heard to complain that he did not: Humes v.
