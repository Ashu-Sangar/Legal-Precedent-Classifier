      <em>■ </em>On a bill in equity by a lessee under an oil and gas lease to restrain the lessor from interfering with the leasehold premises, it appeared that the lessor had forcibly taken possession of the premises, severed the pipes, and diverted the gas, alleging as a ground therefor that the lease was forfeited. By injunction the lessee was reinstated. A master was appointed who found that there had been no default by the lessee, and recommended that the injunction should be made perpetual. The master also recommended that the lessor should be ordered to pay to the lessee a specified sum, as compensation for the gas diverted during the time the lessor was in possession. The decree thus recommended was entered by the court •* without prejudice to the rights of the lessor to compel the lessee to account'to him for his share of the earnings of the gas well.” <em>Held, </em>that the decree was without error.</p>

The Poterie Gas Company is a corporation formed under the provisions of the act of May 29, 1885, and was duly chartered on December 5, 1890. By its charter the said company is empowered to mine for natural gas in Gilpin township, Armstrong county, to supply gas to consumers in the borough of Leeehburg, in Armstrong county, and to lay its lines from Gil pin township to the said borough of Leeehburg.</p>

George Poterie owned a tract of land in Gilpin township, Armstrong county, Pa., and, in order to develop the same for gas and to furnish gas for his tar works in said township he was instrumental in forming a company by the subscription of himself and some forty-two others to an agreement dated January 13, 1890, the company being entitled the Allegheny Valley Oil and Gas Company, the said agreement containing the following provisions: Said contemplated corporation to have a capital stock of $3,000, divided into sixty (60) shares ■ of the par value of $50.</p>

Subsequently, on December 5, 1890, in pursuance of said subscription paper, a charter was granted in name of the Poterie Gas Company, instead of the Allegheny Valley Oil and Gas Company, with a capital stock of $5,000, divided into 100 shares of $50.00. This increase from original capital being determined at a meeting of the company held November 6, 1890, and for the reason that in the judgment of expert drillers the sum of $3,000 would not likely be sufficient to thoroughly test the proposed well to be drilled on lease.</p>

On the first day of November, 1890, George Poterie did lease to the Poterie Gas Company, five acres of ground in Gil-pin township, Armstrong county, for five years from the first of January, 1890, for the purpose of drilling and operating for gas and oil and other products, using a printed form of a house lease peculiar to the Denny estate, said lease reciting that the term was from the first day of January, 1890, for and during the term of five years for the annual rent of $1.00 and other considerations, the phrase “ one dollar and other considerations ” being in the written portions of the lease, and said other consideration referring to subscription paper of October 13, 1890, wherein George Poterie was to receive one third of the profits realized from oil or gas found on the five acres of ground de scribed in the lease, and as much gas as he might need for his tar works at ten cents per barrel.</p>

After striking the well it was discovered that with but one well, and so small a tract of land in the control of the company, it would be difficult to find a suitable market for the <em>gas; </em>and with the view of securing more territory and increasing the capital stock of the company, a meeting of the stockholders was called for February 24, 1891. At this meeting a number of the stockholders expressed their dissent in strong terms that the capital stock of the company had been made $5,000, instead of $3,000 as provided in the subscription paper, without notice to them. A number of the stockholders also opposed the scheme of increasing the capital stock to $50,000 and securing more territory, asserting that the Denny estate people were instrumental in increasing the stock from $3,000 to $5,000 to secure a controlling interest in the company. This meeting was adjourned to Thursday, February 26,1891. At this adjourned meeting it was suggested that those interested in property sur<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>rounding the Poterie well, including George Poterie, should retire, and that they, the smaller subscribers who owned no property, should take their own action. This was accordingly done, and the property-holding members were in a short time called back and informed that a committee of four had been appointed, and the meeting again adjourned to March 2, 1891.</p>

The consideration for the lease, among other things, was one third of all profits realized from the gas and oil found on the premises. In pursuance of the lease plaintiff company took possession of the demised premises, drilled a gas well, and finding a good supply of gas in January, 1891, proceeded to market the same. Early in the following year, the defendant forcibly severed the pipes and diverted the gas from the pipe line because, as he alleged, the lease had been • forfeited by reason of the lessee’s failure to account for the proceeds of the well. In 1893, the company regained possession by the action of this court in reinstating the injunction which had theretofore been granted at its instance, but had been dissolved by the court below: Poterie Gas Co. v. Poterie, <a href="/pa/153/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="153 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="840364" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0010-01">153 Pa. 10</a>. The case having been referred to a master was prosecuted to a hearing and final decree. By deducting the expenses of drilling the well, laying a pipe line, etc., the master concluded, and so reported, that plaintiff company at the time it was dispossessed, did not owe defendant anything, and was therefore not in default, or subject to forfeiture ; and he accordingly recommended a decree, February 17, 1894, making the injunction perpetual, and ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff company the sum of $2201.62 as compensa<a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>tion for tbe gas diverted during tbe time defendant was in possession and control of tbe well, with interest and costs. The decree thus recommended was entered by the court “ without prejudice to the rights of the defendant, George Poterie, to compel plaintiff company to account to him for his share of the earnings of the gas well ” to the date of the termination of the lease. The learned master’s findings of fact, approved by the court, were fully warranted by the evidence, and the conclusions of law necessarily follow therefrom.</p>
