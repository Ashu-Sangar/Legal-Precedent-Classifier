Bailey, with the interest of the estate of William K. Nimick remaining therein; that owing to the depression in business since 1873, the property of the firm in 1887 was not of greater value than the obligations against it, and if forced to sale would not sell for enough to pay the debts ; that amongst the property of the firm was certain real estate which William Phillips et al., by deed dated September 12, 1873, recorded in deed book' 325, page 98, conveyed to William K. Nimick, the same being situated in the thirty-third ward of Pittsburg, and having thereon the Sligo Mills; that it was for the interest and advantage of those interested in said firm property that the interest of William K. Nimick, deceased, in the same should be sold in settlement of the said partnership, and that Alexander Nimick and James M. Bailey, the two surviving partners were willing to ■adjust and settle the affairs of said partnership by the purchase of said interest at the nominal sum of $1.00 and the assumption of the debts of said firm; that by the prayer of said petition the court had been asked “ to order and direct that the petitioner make a private sale of the interest of Wm.

Bailey, individually, it must be denied; if not, it must be granted; for the conveyance would then in form be prejudicial to petitioner’s interest. The solution of this question is jurisdictional. This court has power to divest title to land standing in the name of any decedent by (1) sale for the purpose of distribution under its direction amongst creditors, next of kin or legatees ; or (2) in the execution of trusts in the •modes prescribed by law. It is very plain that the proceedings here cannot be classified under the first head. It was not even in form a sale. No price was fixed; no purchase money was paid or secured, as required by the act of March 22,1859, sec. 1, P. L. 207, Purd. 1629. The agreed “ consideration ” cannot be regarded as furnishing a substantial basis, for its payment was but an existing obligation, official and personal, cognizable in another court. It was no more than the expression of duty which was implied in the character of liquidating partners. The assumption of an intended sale would have raised a necessary implication of distribution under the direction of this court; but there was no creditor seeking and no contemplated distribution here ; and this court cannot be supposed to have intended an illegal delegation of its judicial functions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b618-4" data-blocks='[["BL_618.4",618,[255,1491,1166,958]]]'>But in addition to and underlying these formal defects, there are meritorious reasons which conclusively show that there was neither power nor intention to authorize a sale. The declared purpose of the proceeding was “to adjust and settle” firm affairs, which necessarily implied settlement in the mode prescribed by law. The conveyance was a mere incident. W. K. Nimick admittedly had no land to sell. He was a mere trustee, and might have been compelled to transfer the legal title which he held to the surviving partners. What he might have been compelled, he would have been authorized, to do. The ground of jurisdiction in either court could be no other than the administration of a trust, and the result of its exercise the same. “ All roads lead to Home.” The land being admittedly firm assets necessary for the payment of firm debts, it became the trustee’s duty to convey, and the surviving partners to receive it for the purpose of liquidation; and it would have been a fraud on the equities of the partners to pervert it to any other use. Its character was so fixed as to be beyond the power of parties or court to change it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b619-3" data-blocks='[["BL_619.3",619,[136,364,1173,914]]]'>
      <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>It seems plain, therefore, that the jurisdiction of this court to make the order of conveyance can be sustained only upon the theory of - the execution of a trust; and that, consequently, the title thereunder vested in Alexander Nimick and James M. Bailey, not 'individually, but as surviving partners of the firm of Phillips, Nimick &amp; Co., for the purpose of liquidation. The decree, expressly declaring a purpose “to adjust and settle” the firm affairs, followed by direction that conveyance be made to “Alexander Nimick and James M. Bailey, the surviving partners,” plainly shows the character in which they were intended to take. The inducement was the execution of the trust, and the expression of other “ considerations ” could not change its nature, but was simply collateral. Logically, the conveyance'to them should have conformed to this purpose, but “ it must be construed with and its mistakes corrected by the record upon which it depends for its validity,” in accordance with the well' settled rule: McGhee v. Hoyt, <a href="/pa/106/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="106 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="455636" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0516-01">106 Pa. 516</a>; Johnson’s App., <a href="/pa/114/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="114 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="550039" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0132-01">114 Pa. 132</a>.</p>

Standing in the channel of title, the record of this court was notice to them that the property conveyed by the trustee under the will of W. K. Nimick^ deceased, was assets belonging to the firm of Phillips, Nimick &amp; Co. necessary to the settlement of firm affairs, primarily liable for its debts and the adjustment of the equities of the parties, and consequently held in trust. Their interest was therefore secondary; and while the correction of the mistake inadvertently made by the trustee could do them no harm, refusal might prejudice the right of petitioner. The controversy which has arisen here is of itself sufficient evidence of injury to petitioners. ' The assignment passed to the assignees only such property as the assignor had right to convey. No claim was made here that this particular property was even specified; and <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>there is nothing to show that the individual creditors of Alexander Nimick granted an extension of time for the payment of his debts upon its credit as part consideration. “ Every man is bound,” said Chief Justice Tilghman, in Messinger v. Kintner, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Binn.%20104" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Binn. 104">4 Binn. 104</a>, “ to take notice of the record, which is the foundation of his title. If they looked into the title at all, the decree of the orphans’ court stared them in the face at the first step, and seeing the decree they must take notice at their peril of the proceedings on which it was founded.” The land proposed to be conveyed here having been stampéd of record with the character of trust assets must remain trust assets until the purpose of the trust shall have been accomplished; ■ and those who claim through it must regard its sanctity. The cases of Gunnison v. Loan Co., <a href="/pa/157/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="157 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="846597" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0303-01">157 Pa. 303</a>, and others of that class, invoked by respondents, in which it was held that land whose title stands in the name of individual members of a firm must be treated as individual assets, although bought with firm assets for firm purposes, are clearly distinguishable from the present by the fact that the record gave no notice of a trust. These respondents claiming through the record of this court, and therefore, with record notice of the trust under which the land was held, are limited in interest to the residue which shall remain after that trust has been satisfied.</p>

The questions involved appear to have been fully considered and correctly decided by the learned court below. We have no doubt as to that court’s power to make the decree complained of, or as to the propriety of making it. It is unnecessary to show statutory authority for the correction of such a manifest error as appears in this case, patent upon the face of its own records, and thus notice to everybody who has had occasion .to examine them. Every court of justice has inherent power to correct such errors; and it would be strange, indeed, if having had its attention called to such a glaring mistake or blunder of one of its own officers, it would either hesitate or decline to make the necessary correction. But these and all other questions presented by the record have been so thoroughly discussed in the clear, concise and convincing opinion of the learned president of the court below, that nothing need he added to what may be found therein. On that opinion the decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at appellant’s costs.</p>
