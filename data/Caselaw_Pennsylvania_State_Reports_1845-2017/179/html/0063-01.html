If this allegation is correct the writ must be quashed. The constitution of tlxe United States, art. IY, sec. I, provides that, “ Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other state, and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which the acts, records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof.” Congress has by a general law, act of May 26,1790, prescribed the effect of such judicial proceedings by enacting that “ they shall have such faith and credit given to them, in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage ixr the courts of the state from whence the said records shall be taken.” The same act provides, “ the records and judicial proceedings of the courts of any state or territory shall be proved or admitted in any other court within the United States by the attestation of the clerk and the seal of the court annexed, if there be a seal, together with a certificate of a judge, justice or presiding magistrate that the said attestation is in due form.” In the case before us we have the record of a judgment recovered in the county court of Douglas county, Nebraska, against the defendant, and that the said judgment was by transcript entered and docketed in the office of the clerk of the district court of said Douglas county, axxd that the exemplification which is the basis of the proceedings now instituted here, purports to be “ a true, perfect and complete copy of transcript of judgment ” as filed in said district court, and is certified to be by the clerk of said district court, and under its seal. There is also a certificate of the pre<a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>siding judge of said district court that the clerk so certifying was at the time of the execution of certificate the clerk of said court duly elected, commissioned and qualified; that said court is a court of record, and that said clerk had by law the custody of the records and the seal of the court; that said attestation is in due form and according to the laws of Nebraska.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b87-5" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[81,666,1179,1537]]]'>In Edmiston v. Schwartz, 13 S. &amp; R. 135, Justice Gibson says : “ Shorn what is the court to judge whether an exemplification contains the whole record ? Certainly from the certificate of the officer whose business was to authenticate it and to whose acts in this particular full faith and credit are due. Every court is the best judge of its own record, and its officer acting by its direction is presumed to certify nothing but the truth, and to justify the decision of another tribunal against the truth of the certificate, would require something beside the absence of certain things which are usually constituent parts of a complete record.” There is not anything before us that would indicate to us or lead us to conclude but that the exemplification before us is a true, perfect and complete record of the proceedings and judgment had against the defendant as the same stands in the circuit court of Douglas county, Nebraska. There is another phase of this matter which we might mention, and that is, the proceeding in the court of common pleas of Armstrong county against defendant is a foreign attachment, and as such is in the nature of a writ of execution to collect a debt. Now who would doubt but that upon the judgment against defendant as the same stands in the circuit court of Douglas county, Nebraska, the plaintiff would be entitled to a writ of execution to collect his claim. And as by the act of congress above cited the records and judicial proceedings authenticated shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the state from whence the said records are taken, we cannot but conclude that the copy of record filed in this case supports the writ of foreign attachment and the same cannot be quashed.</p>

M. Crosby (the defendant) is a nonresident of the state of Pennsylvania.” This we think is such a substantial compliance with the act as will support the writ of attachment issued in this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b88-4" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[256,615,1170,1111]]]'>The third reason is dismissed, as the sheriff, at time of argument of motion to dissolve, amended his return (which amendment was allowed by the court) curing the defect alleged. And as to the fourth reason, we cannot agree with counsel for the defendant that the writ of summons to garnishee must be made returnable to the next term of court. We have in this court monthly return days for writs of summons, etc., viz, the first Monday of each month, and this writ served upon garnishee is a writ of summons, and certainly can be made returnable to a monthly return day. Section 45 of the act of June IS, 1836, P. L. 580, provides, “in every writ of attachment as aforesaid shall be contained a clause commanding the officer to summon all persons in whose hands or possession the said goods and chattels or any of them may be attached so that they and every of them be and appear before the said court at the day and place mentioned in said writ to answer,” etc. The writ in this case follows explicitly the requirements of the section of the act, and as we have already said that this writ so far as the garnishee is concerned is but a writ summoning him to appear. The plaintiff had the right to make the same returnable to the first Monday of April, 1894, a monthly return for writs of this nature issued from the court.</p>

The defense interposed in the court below is purely technical, and clearly insufficient to carry the case to a jury. It is not pretended that the debt is not due, or that judgment was not recovered therefor in the foreign jurisdiction. Nor is it even alleged that the defendant is not a nonresident of this state, or that he was within the jurisdiction at the time of the impetration of the writ. While these considerations would not prevail against a fatal technical defect, we cannot be expected in such cases to go out of the way in search of errors. The record of the foreign judgment on which suit was brought is certified in strict accordance with the act of congress. This is sufficient to make it the basis of this action. The foreign judgment, and not the note referred <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>to, is the foundation of the suit, and hence it was unnecessary that the note should be incorporated in plaintiff’s statement of claim.</p>
