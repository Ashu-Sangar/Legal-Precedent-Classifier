The act of assembly in this regard can bear no such construction. It is true this is an important element ha the case, but not the ’‘controlling one.

This question having been decided by the court below and affirmed by the Supreme Court, the defendant company came in on March 9, 1896, representing that the water supply at that time was reasonably pure and sufficient in quantity to supply its patrons, and that the said company had remedied the defects complained of in the plaintiffs’ bill, and asked that evidence be heard, and that the court fix the rates to be charged and collected by the defendant company, whereupon the court fixed March 26 as the time for further hearing upon the question of the present supply and condition of the water, and of rates and charges, at which time some additional testimony was taken, and the parties fully heard upon all the questions open for decision. The defendant company in its testimony shows that in the fall of 1895 it went up the Connoquenessing creek from thirty-three to thirty-five thousand feet to Boydstown, and built <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>an impounding dam, and laid a terra cotta water line from that point to its receiving well at Butler, at a cost of about $37,647; that their impounding dam covers in the neighborhood of forty-nine acres of land, and will contain over one hundred million gallons of water; that the watershed from which the water is received is generally from wood and grass land, and is likely to be pure and wholesome; that from every indication, and from an estimate of the rainfall, and extent of the watershed, and quality and character of the ground, the water obtained and impounded in this dam will be adequate to supply the citizens of Butler, and be reasonably pure and wholesome. The defendant company also called a number of witnesses, amongst whom were three physicians, who'testified as to the present condition of the water. Dr. Graham says he has been using it about a month: “ It is fairly good for domestic use ¿ it is a little hard for washing purposes, but there is nothing in it to be injurious to persons drinking it; there may be a little salt water in it.” The doctor says on cross-examination that his family also used rain water for domestic use during the last month. Dr. Hoover says he has been using the water for part of a montn, two, three or four weeks, and that it is is reasonably pure and wholesome, and fit for domestic use; that it is hard, and that he has seen it discolored in the last month. Dr. Pil-Igw says, “ I think it is reasonably pure and fit for domestic use; I think it is good; I have been drinking it right along.” He has not noticed any particular hardness lately. Porter W. Lowry says his family has been using the water for about a month, exclusively since the first of March, and that it is all right for domestic purposes, except that the folks at home complain that it is too hard to wash clothes with it, but are using it for laundry purposes. “ I suppose the way it is this morning it would not do for washing clothes, would not be sufficiently clear to wash clothes.” C. N. Boyd, a druggist, says he has been using it for about six weeks for domestic purposes at his home, and at his store for various purposes, except chemical purposes, for which he uses distilled water; he uses it in his soda fountain, and says it is fairly satisfactory, but does not use it for laundry purposes; has found no injurious effects, and has heard no complaints about its hardness. J. L. Purvis has been using it for domestic purposes, and supposes his family is using <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>it for laundry purposes; he considers it good; draws it from the spigot; uses it to wash with. “ I noticed last night for a minute or two that there was a little discoloration.” He is familiar with the improvements, and has no doubt as to the ample supply 'at all seasons of the year, and has no doubt of the capacity, permanency and success of the improvements lately made. •</p>

Neither have I found or been referred to a decision of the Supreme Court or any other court in the commonwealth furnishing a precedent to follow; therefore the duty of the court is a hard one. In localities where water is convenient, abundant and reasonably pure, as at Chicago, Cleveland and other cities upon lakes, and where very large amounts are daily used, it can be furnished at rates very much lower than where it is scarce, and where impounding dams must be built, and the water stored and conveyed through long lines of pipe, as must necessarily be done in many country districts; so that it would not be fair and just to have a uniform rate throughout the United States or throughout the state. Neither can the rates be established and fixed from the cost of the water plant, and the expense of running the same, as that would indirectly make the consumers insurers to stockholders in water companies that their investments are profitable.</p>

Russell, said: “ The interests of the water company, and those of the public, though not identical, are clearly related. The furnishing of water to the public is like the furnishing of light and heat for domestic purposes, a ‘ public use.’ ” It receives its charter and power from the commonwealth, with its right of eminent domain, and with its exclusive right to furnish water to the consumers, upon the principle that the people have rights which must be respected. If it was the duty of the court to look after and protect the interest of the water company only, its labors in this matter would be but one of calculation; obtain the cost of the plant, the yearly expenses of running it, an estimate of the numbers of consumers and amount of water used annually, fix a rate of charges which would be sufficient- to pay the expense, and a fair, reasonable, profitable dividend to the stockholders. In this way the people would pay for the repairs and betterments of their works, interest on their money, and a profit on their investment, also pay for their mistakes, blunders and losses. This would indeed make the water business a sure, safe and profitable one, and one in which almost every person would be willing to invest money. It would be as safe as government bonds, and pay better than banking, and the company which would be first to get into a town would be pretty sure to remain there; but in justice and equity to the people tins rule cannot be established, and we must look for another.</p>

That the annual expense of operating, taking the average of the last four years, is $5,466.04, which added to interest on $170,000, money for sinking fund to pay debts and expense, runs their estimated annual current expenses up to $21,180.04.

Mr. Findley says : “ Counting the time from November, 1883, two years before there were any dividends paid, and estimating the actual capital paid in by the stockholders, the amount of cash dividends paid would be at the rate of seven per cent on the capital invested for the whole time. If to the cash dividends we add the stock dividends, it will make the rate peícent on the investment about twelve and four fifths per cent. From November, 1889, to November, 1894, the last five years that cash dividends were paid, the rate on the actual investment is eight and one fourth per cent. If to cash dividends we add the stock dividends paid during the same period, it makes the rate 19 per cent on the investment.” The dividends were paid semi-annually, and half the dividend at each payment. Of this $99,600 stock, $37,410.61 was stock dividends, making the actual investment by the stockholders $62,189.39, and the actual receipts, after deducting $40,993.40 of expenses, are $78,632.56, so that on an investment of $62,189.39 by stockholders they have from November, 1883, to November, 1894, about eleven years, over $41,000 in cash, and new stock amounting to $34,800, making in the eleven years over one hundred and twenty-two per cent profit on the original investment or eleven per cent per annum. Much the largest profits were made in the last five years, during which time I have no doubt they would reach the estimate fixed by Mr. Findley.</p>

The rate for water charged by other water companies, or water tax levied by municipalities, do not furnish a precedent to govern this court as to proper charges to be made by the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>defendant company.

It being found as a fact that the water furnished by the defendant company is adequate and reasonably pure, the power of the court ends with fixing the rates for water as it is furnished. The water company may for itself select the source of supply, and determine the system of collection and distribution, the mode of storage, and control generally the business details, and the rates must be determined with reference to the justice and equity of the case.</p>

We have no authority for such a ruling, and it would be unjust to the consumer who would have to pay full cost of the water, provide a sinking fund, secure a reasonable profit upon the investment, and have no voice in the management of the business of the company. The act of assembly in this regard can bear no such construction. It is true this is an important element in the case, but not the controlling one. Other interests and surroundings must be carefully considered. The court in its judgment and discretion must have reference both to the expense necessary to furnish water, and to what is a fair andi reasonable compensation therefor, so as to render it possible to. furnish water without loss, or so low as to amount to a practical confiscation of the property invested in the business. It seems fairest to fix a rate for the water by quantity, and ascertain this quantity by meter, so that the consumer may use as. much as he desires and pay for the amount so used.</p>

The questions then raised related to the power of the court to suspend the collection of water rents by the company so long as the water delivered by it to its customers was so impure as to be clearly unfit for domestic use. We held, affirming thereby the ruling of the court below, that the act of April 29,1874, invested the courts of common pleas with the visitorial powers of the commonwealth as to water and gas companies, so far as related to the quality and quantity of the supply furnished and the prices charged therefor. This supervisory power was brought into exercise upon the petition of one or more consumers making complaint against the company on account of deficiency in the quantity or quality of the water furnished, or of the excessive and unreasonable charges made therefor. Upon a hearing of the testimony the statute empowered the court to dismiss the petition, or to make such order for the relief of the petitioners as the facts disclosed by the evidence might require. This we held included the power to enjoin the company against the collection of water rents when the water furnished was clearly unfit for-domestic use. But we also held that this statute gave the court no power to operate the plant of the water company,, or to interfere with or direct the official discretion of its officers otherwise than as therein prescribed. Where it should go for its source of supply, by what route the supply should be brought to its distributing reservoir, and by what system of distribution it should be taken to its customers, together with all similar questions of construction and operation, were within the exclusive control of the company. It might determine to suspend its operations or to continue them, to increase its capital or to withdraw it altogether, but so long as it continued in the exercise of its franchises it was subject to the supervisory control of the court for the protection of the public supplied by it. The court was charged to inquire first, whether the corporation was discharging the duty it had assumed, and was supplying water to its customers suitable in quality, and sufficient in quantity. It was also to inquire upon complaint made whether the company was extorting from its customers an unreasonable price for the water furnished. While the liti<a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>gation in which this decision was reached was in progress the water company had been earnestly at work, endeavoring to relieve itself from its embarrassment. It had gone up the Conoquenessing creek several miles to a point above the oil and gas wells which had poured salt water into the stream, constructed a large impounding reservoir, extended their supply pipes up to it, and thus obtained a supply of water reasonably pure, and ample in quantity, to supply the town of Butler. When this had been accomplished the water company presented in the court below its petition setting forth the facts and asking that their truth be inquired into, and if satisfied, that the court would so determine by an appropriate decree, and permit the company to collect water rents from its customers in accordance with a schedule which it had prepared and presented to the court. The learned judge directed an investigation. From the evidence produced on the hearing he found the facts to be as alleged by the water company, and that the company was now entitled to charge and collect water rents, but he declined to approve the schedule of water rents presented. On the other hand he prepared another schedule made up in part from evidence received upon the hearing, and in part from information gathered through other channels, regarding the prices charged in other cities and towns. This schedule he incorporated into the decree, and the company was authorized thereby to charge water rents in accordance with the rates so fixed and not otherwise. This appeal is from so much of the decree as imposes the schedule of charges prepared by the learned judge upon the water company, and forbids the charging and collection of any other rates than those so prescribed. The water company alleges that the court has no power to adopt a tariff of prices for it; but that if this proposition should be denied, still the tariff of prices adopted by the court is erroneous because constructed upon a mistaken basis. It will thus be seen that the real question at issue is whether the boundary line that separates the discretionary control of the owner from the supervising control of the courts, which was pointed out in <a href="/pa/172/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="172 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="874082" data-case-paths="/pa/172/0489-01">172 Pa. 489</a>, terminates when the plant is completed and a suitable water supply procured, or continues on through the business operations of the corporation? The answer to this question must depend on the nature and extent of the powers that result <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>from tbe mere fact of ownership, and on the character of the restrictions, if any, which the commonwealth may have put upon those powers in the interest of the public. The ownership of a corporation is as absolute and comprehensive as that of a private citizen. It includes the right to put a value upon its property, and to determine on what terms it will part with it, or supply its customers with the commodity in which it deals, in the same manner that an individual or a partnership cduld do. But as the corporation derives its existence and its powers and franchises from the state, it is more directly accountable to the state than a natural person now is, under existing laws, for the exercise of good faith in the conduct of its business and for the reasonableness of its charges. The state intervenes for the protection of the citizen. When therefore a customer of a water company finds the company neglecting or refusing to furnish him with an adequate supply of water, or finds the water furnished to be unfit for domestic use, he is authorized by the act of 1874 to make his complaint to the court of common pleas of the proper county by petition. The court is thereupon required to investigate the subject and “to dismiss the complaint, or compel the corporation to correct the evil complained of ” as the evidence may require. As one of the proper methods for the enforcement of a decree against the company, we held in Brymer v. Butler Water Co., <a href="/pa/172/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="172 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="874082" data-case-paths="/pa/172/0489-01">172 Pa. 489</a>, that the company might be restrained from the collection of water rents until the decree was complied with. But the same statute provides that any customer of the company may complain by petition of the charges made for water furnished,' and requires the court to hear and determine as to the charges complained of, and “ to decree that the said bill be dismissed, or that the charges shall be decreased, as to the. said court shall seem just and equitable.”</p>
    <p id="b271-3" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[97,1994,1169,400]],["BL_272.1",272,[281,357,1167,1167]]]'>A provision in the third, section of the act of June 2, 1887, relating to the jurisdiction of the courts over gas and water companies is supplemental to the act of 1874, and defines somewhat more distinctly the duty of such companies to furnish the public with pure gas and water, but it contains no allusion to the subject of. price. The power of the court to interfere between the seller and the buyer of water is conferred only by the provisions already quoted from the act of 1874; and that act authorizes <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>the court to entertain the complaint of the buyer, to investigate the reasonableness of the price charged, and to “ dismiss the complaint,” or to order that the charges complained of, if found to be unreasonable and unjust, “ shall be decreased.” The water company prepares its schedule of prices in the first instance, and makes its own terms with its customersbut if these are oppressive, so that in the exercise of the visitorial power of the state the just protection of the citizen requires that they be reduced, then the court is authorized to say “ this charge is oppressive. You must decrease it. You are entitled to charge a price that will yield a fair compensation to you, but you must no't be extortionate.” This is not an authority to manage the affairs of the company, but to restain illegal and oppressive conduct on its part in its dealings with the public. It may be that the power to order that any particular item of charge shall “ be decreased ” includes the power to fix the extent of the reduction that must be made, or to name the maximum charge for the particular service in controversy, which the court will approve, but the decree is that the item shall “ be decreased ” either generally or to a sum named. The schedule of charges must be revised accordingly by the company defendant, and such revision may be compelled in the same manner that the decree of the same court may be enforced in other cases.</p>
    <p id="b272-4" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[280,1533,1167,858]],["BL_273.1",273,[155,373,1175,1733]]]'>We do not think this supervisory power would justify the court in preparing a tariff of water rents and commanding a corporation to furnish water to the public at the rates so fixed. This would involve a transfer of the management of the property, and the business of a solvent corporation, from its owners to a court of equity, for no other reason than that the court regarded some one or more of the charges made by the company as too high. The act of 1874 contemplates no such radical departure from established rules as this, but provides simply for the protection of the citizen from extortionate charges specifically pointed out and complained of by petition. This leads us to the second question raised, viz: by what rule is the court to determine what is reasonable, and what is oppressive ? Ordinarily that is a reasonable charge or system of charges which yields a fair return upon the investment. Fixed charges and the costs of maintenance and operation must first be provided for, then the interests of the owners of the property are to be <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>considered. They are entitled to a rate of return, if their property will earn it, not less than the legal rate of interest; and a system of charges that yields no more income than is fairly required to maintain the plant, pay fixed charges and operating expenses, provide a suitable sinking fund for the payment of debts, and pay a fair profit to the owners of the property, cannot be said to be unreasonable. In determining the amount of the investment by the stockholders it can make no difference that money earned by the corporation, and in a position to be distributed by a dividend among its stockholders, was used to pay for improvements and stock issued in lieu of cash to the stockholders. It is not necessary that the money should first be paid to the stockholder and then returned by him in payment for new stock issued to him. The net earnings, in equity, belonged to him, and stock issued to him in lieu of the money so used that belonged to him was issued for value, and represents an actual investment by the holder. If the company makes an increase of stock that is fictitious, and represents no value added to the property of the corporation, such stock is rather in the nature of additional income than of additional investment. This whole subject was brought to the attention of the learned judge by a request that he should find as matter of law that the reasonableness of the charges must be determined with reference to the expenditure in obtaining the supply, and providing for a fund to maintain the plant in good order, and pay a fair profit upon the money invested by the owners, and that a rate which did no more than this was neither excessive nor unjust. This the learned judge refused to find, saying in reply to the request, “ we have no authority for such a ruling, and it would be unjust to the consumer who would have to pay full cost of the water, provide a sinking fund, secure a reasonable profit upon the investment, and have no voice in the management of the business of the company. The act of assembly in this regard can bear no such construction.”</p>
    <p id="b273-3" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[160,2123,1170,299]],["BL_274.1",274,[233,369,1173,2035]],["BL_275.1",275,[133,350,1168,659]]]'>This ruling cannot be sustained. The cost of the water to the company includes a fair return to the persons who furnished the capital for the construction of the plant, in addition to an allowance annually of a sum sufficient to keep the plant in good repair and to pay any fixed charges and operating expenses. A rate of water rents that enables the company to real<a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>ize no more than this is reasonable and just. Some towns are so situated as to make the procurement of an ample supply of water comparatively inexpensive. Some are so situated as to make the work both difficult and expensive. What would be an extortionate charge in the first case might be the very least at which the water could be afforded in the other. The law was correctly stated in the defendant’s request, and the court was in error in refusing it. But we think the court had no power to adopt for, and enjoin upon, the company a comprehensive schedule like that incorporated into the decree in this case. The decree found that the water supply furnished by the defendant company was abundant and “reasonably pure and fit for public use,” but, without any adjudication that any particular charge or charges complained of were excessive and must be decreased, he made a decree that “ the water rates of the defendant company from March 1,1896, to be charged and collected from the plaintiffs for water by the defendant company to the plaintiffs shall be as follows: ” Then follows a table filling two and a half pages of the appellant’s paper-book, and pro-providing specifically for domestic rates, for livery, hotel and trading stables, for hotels and boarding houses, for fountains, steam engines, schools, motors, public buildings, special rates, and meter rates, subject to provision that “ when the water ” which the same decree had just pronounced to be reasonably, pure and suitable for domestic use “is properly filtered the charges may be increased twenty per cent.” The school district of Butler was not a party complainant in this case, nor was the county of Butler, but both were taken under the protection of the court and specifically provided for by the decree. Fountains are luxuries. The question whether the police power of the state can be successfully invoked to cheapen the price of water furnished for purposes of display or the mere gratification of one’s taste, is at least open to discussion, but, without discussion, it is disposed of by this decree, and the price reduced. In short, upon a general complaint that the rates charged by the defendant were too high, without specification of the particular charges that were alleged to be excessive, the court has undertaken to revise the entire schedule of prices, and instead of directing the company to decrease the objectionable charges, has formulated an entirely new schedule of prices, covering all of the business <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>of the company. Tins new schedule it has framed upon the mistaken basis adopted and stated in the third conclusion of law already considered. This action is not authorized by the act of 1874. It is not the hearing of a complaint against the charges made by the company and a decision of the controversy so arising, but it is the assumption of a power to frame a schedule of prices covering the entire business of the company, with all its customers, many of whom are not even complaining of the rates paid by them. The framing of such a general schedule is ordinarily the right of the company. The correction of this schedule when framed, whenever it may work injustice and hardship is tiie prerogative of the court, and one which should be fearlessly exercised.</p>
