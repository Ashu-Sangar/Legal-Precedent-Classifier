        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nOn February 24, 1931, plaintiff filed its mechanic\u2019s lien against defendants, husband and wife, as reputed owners, alleging that the sum of $17,254.95 was due him for improvements on defendants\u2019 building under a written contract and subsequent written authorizations for certain additional work. The amount claimed represented the balance on the full contract price after deducting certain cash payments. The scire facias issued March 2, 1931, and defendant Mary Redlich, the wife, filed her affidavit of defense on June 22, 1931., In this she alleged that her husband, defendant Max Redlich, had a complete legal defense to the whole of plaintiff\u2019s claim and that she had a legal defense to part of plaintiff\u2019s claim. The husband\u2019s defense was that he was not the owner of the premises nor did he contract with the plaintiff or any other person for the making of the improvements. Defendant Mary Redlich, on the other hand, admitted ownership of the premises and all the material terms of the contract together with the subsequent agreements to pay for extras. She alleged that in addition to the cash payments on the full amount due, mentioned above, two notes had been given for a total of $6,500, which notes were \u201cheld by the Ambridge Savings & Trust Company.\u201d She also alleged that certain subcontractors and materialmen who had dealt with the claimant had filed mechanics\u2019 liens.\nDefendant\u2019s affidavit of defense continues as follows:\n\u201c5. Defendant therefore says that, inasmuch as the above named subcontractors and materialmen who have filed the liens are entitled to judgment and execution thereon, she admits liability for the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim herein, subject to the rights of the said subcontractors\u2019 and materialmen\u2019s liens as above set forth and any others, if there be any others, who have a right to such liens. Likewise she admits the liability of the plaintiff to judgment herein for the amount claimed, subject, however, to credit thereon for any amount hereafter paid on account of the notes heretofore given.\n\u201c6. With these conditions, defendant admits the amount claimed to be due and authorizes the prothonotary to enter judgment against her for the sum claimed, to wit: Seventeen thousand two hundred fifty-four and \u25a0'%)0 ($17,254.95) dollars, with interest from February 1, 1931.\u201d\nBelying on this admission, plaintiff filed a praecipe with the prothonotary of the court of common pleas directing him to enter judgment for $17,254.95, to be liquidated with interest due from February 1,1931. Plaintiff subsequently gave to subcontractors various partial assignments of this judgment. One of these was to the Ambridge Savings & Trust Company, in the amount of $6,500. On February 23,1932, the defendant Mary Iledlich filed a petition to strike off the judgment entered by the prothonotary, setting up as grounds therefor: (1) that her affidavit of defense contained a defense to the whole or part of plaintiff\u2019s claim, sufficient to prevent entry of judgment, and (2) that the prothonotary possessed no authority under the mechanic\u2019s lien statutes to enter the judgment. This petition was denied by the court below and the judgment remained.\nWe will discuss defendant\u2019s second proposition first. In any action pending in the courts of this Commonwealth, where an affidavit of defense clearly admits the whole or any part of the amount claimed by a plaintiff to be due, the protlionotary may enter judgment for the amount so admitted. The Act of May 31, 1893, P. L. 185, section 1, reads as follows: \u201cThat in all cases now pending, or hereafter to be commenced, in the several courts of this Commonwealth in which affidavits of defense have been or may be filed to part of the claim of the plaintiff or plaintiffs, the plaintiff or plaintiffs may take judgment for the amount admitted to be due and have execution for the collection of the same, and the cases shall be proceeded in for the recovery of the balance of the demand of the plaintiff or plaintiffs, if anything more should be justly due to such plaintiff or plaintiffs.\u201d\nIt will be observed that this act uses tbe phrase \u201cplaintiff may take judgment,\u201d without specifying whether it shall be taken in court or in the prothonotary\u2019s office, but this court, in Roberts v. Sharp, 161 Pa. 185, 28 A. 1023, in a Per Curiam opinion, affirmed the judgment of the court below and quoted at length from the opinion of Judge Arnold of that court, in which opinion is the following statement: \u201c \u2018There appears to be no good reason why a judgment for the amount admitted should not be taken in the prothonotary\u2019s office, the same as a judgment for default.\u2019 \u201d\nThe language of the Act of 1893, supra, is broad enough to cover a case where either part or all of the whole claim is \u201cadmitted to be due.\u201d It provides that \u201ccases shall be proceeded in for the recovery of the balance of the demand, if anything more should he justly due \u201d The implication of that last clause is that after an \u201camount is admitted to be due\u201d there may be something or nothing more due. If we held that the Act of 1893 applied only to those cases where less than the full amount claimed was admitted to be due, we would give the act an unreasonable interpretation because under such an interpretation a plaintiff suing for $1,000 could take judgment for $999 if the affidavit of defense admitted that-sum to be due, but could not take judgment for $1,000 if that entire sum was admitted to be due.\nWe have an analogy to this Act of 1893 as we interpret it in the language of the Practice Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 483, section 17, reading as follows: \u201cIn actions of assumpsit the prothonotary may enter judgment for want of an affidavit of defense, or for any amount admitted or not denied to be due.\u201d\nThis court has held in Duggan v. Duggan, 291 Pa. 556, 140 A. 342, speaking through Mr. Justice Simpson : \u201cThe Act of 1893 does not refer to actions of assumpsit at all, but to all existing and future cases in which affidavits of defense have been or may be filed.\u201d\nThe case of Gedrich v. Yaroscz, 102 Pa. Superior Ct. 127, 156 A. 575, cited by appellant, is inapplicable here. In that case the error charged is that certain judgments entered on scire facias sur mechanic\u2019s lien were void \u201cbecause they were entered \u2018contrary to law by an attorney on a mere praecipe for judgment and not by the court, as provided by section 32 of the Mechanic\u2019s Lien Act of June 4,1901, P. L. 431, as amended by the Act of May 23,1913, P. L. 307.\u2019 \u201d The Superior Court held that by the terms of the section referred to the court alone has the authority to direct the entry of a judgment on a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense to a scire facias sur mechanic\u2019s lien.\nSection 32 as amended by the Act of 1913, P. L. 307, differs from the Act of 1893, supra, in this: it authorizes the court to enter judgments against duly served defendants for want of either (1) an affidavit of defense, or (2) a sufficient affidavit of defense, to a scire facias sur mechanic\u2019s lien. Section 34 of the Mechanic\u2019s Lien Law provides: \u201cif no affidavit of defense be filed within the time designated, judgment may be entered and damages assessed by the prothonotary by default, for want thereof.\u201d Clearly the affidavit filed by defendant in this case cannot be judicially regarded as the equivalent of \u201cno affidavit.\u201d The Act of 1893 as interpreted in Roberts v. Sharp, supra, authorizes the prothonotary to enter judgment for an amount ewplioitly \u201cadmitted to he due.\u201d Where a definite amount is in plain language admitted to be due, the exercise of no judicial function is called for and the prothonotary can enter judgment.\nThe distinction between a defendant\u2019s admission in his affidavit of an amount due and the filing of no affidavit or an insufficient affidavit of defense is so obvious as to require no discussion. The Act of 1893 is inapplicable in those cases where the affidavit of defense does not admit anything to be due: City of New Castle v. New Castle Electric Co., 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 228; Reilly v. Daly, 159 Pa. 605, 28 A. 493; Muir v. Shinn, 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 24, and it applies only where there is a distinct admission of a sum certain being due: Hoegerle\u2019s App., 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 522. Except where the mechanic\u2019s lien law specifically provides for the procedure to be followed, the practice in mechanic\u2019s lien law cases tends to assimilate with the practice in assumpsit cases. The general rules of practice like the general rules of evidence apply to mechanic\u2019s lien cases when not inconsistent with any provisions in the mechanic\u2019s lien law.\nWe sustain defendant\u2019s second contention that the prothonotary possessed no authority under the mechanic\u2019s lien law to enter a judgment in this case. We will go further and hold that the affidavit of defense did not so plainly and unconditionally admit the amount claimed to be due as to justify the prothonotary in proceeding under the Act of 1893 to enter judgment.\nThe defendant\u2019s first proposition is that the affidavit of defense did contain a defense to the whole or part of plaintiff\u2019s claim, sufficient to prevent entry of judgment. The insufficiency of the affidavit is not raised on this record. Since that question may be raised by appropriate proceedings and since it appears that the defendant is willing that judgment should be entered against her for the amount demanded, provided the claims of subcontractors and materialmen and other lawful cognate claims are taken care of, it is suggested that the court below, if judgment should later be entered against the defendant for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, should so control the execution on that judgment as to do justice to the defendant and to all other parties in interest.\nThe order of the court below in refusing to strike off judgment entered sur mechanic\u2019s lien is reversed, and the judgment is stricken off, with a procedendo.",
