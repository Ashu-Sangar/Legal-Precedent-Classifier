It gave the usual thirty days notice of its intention to withdraw, and delivered, at the same time, a transfer of its certificate of stock; but before the thirty days had expired, the old association had merged with six other like associations, into a new building and loan association, also called the Mortgage Building and Loan Association, hereinafter designated as the “new association,” and to it a charter was duly issued. By the merger, the old association ceased to exist, and all of its assets became vested in the new association. This rendered nugatory plaintiff’s and all other pending notices of withdrawal given to the old association. The proceedings leading up to the merger were regular; but plaintiff, though notified of the meeting of the members of the old association for the purpose of voting on the <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>question as to whether or not it should be merged into the new association, did not appear at the meeting, nor did it vote for or against the merger, nor did it take any steps to prevent the merger. A few months later plaintiff sued at law to recover the value of his stock at the time of the merger, and claimed the right to measure that value by the appraisement of its value, specified by the department of banking as a condition of its assent to the merger, and accepted as correct by all the constituent associations. Judgment was entered for want of a sufficient affidavit, of defense, the damages were assessed in the way claimed by plaintiff (that is, at |94 per share), and defendant appealed.</p>

Of course he could not be a withdrawing stockholder of defendant association, since he had never been a stockholder in it. Nor could he enforce a claim as a withdrawing stockholder of the old association, since it was no longer in existence. Moreover, without considering whether or not that objection might avail under other circumstances, it suffices to say here that defendant’s filing of its affidavit of defense to the merits, was an abandonment of its right to attack the regularity or sufficiency of the statement: Boyle v.

      <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>The principal controversy, however, was waged around the question of the amount plaintiff was entitled to recover. Defendant first avers that at the time of and prior to the merger, the old association “was in a state of insolvency in that after, deducting the sums due to its general creditors, it had not sufficient assets to pay back to its stockholders dollar for dollar the amount of their capital contributions, as established by a report thereof made by the Banking Department of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” It asserts that its conclusion, as above stated, is “based upon an official examination of the books of the association, and an appraisal of all assets in December, 1930, by competent appraisers” appointed by the department. An examination of the appraisal shows, however, that at that time the old association had on hand net assets worth $1,143,-833, and the capital contributions of all its stockholders aggregated $1,401,679. Assuming those figures to be correct, as appellant asserts they are, then plaintiff will get, at most, but little over its share of the assets on hand, for it had paid in $114 per share, and has recovered at the rate of $94 per share, and <em>sfín </em>of $1,401,679 amounts to $1,155,770, which is only a little over one per cent beyond that which a strict arithmetical calculation would have justified it in receiving. It is not averred that the Banking Department had not a good reason for making this trivial allowance, and, in the absence of some clear-cut assertion to that effect, of which there is none, defendant, whose only right to exist was based on the acceptance of those figures of the department, cannot be heard to complain of them in this suit: Ferrando v. U. S. National B. &amp; L. Assn., supra.</p>
    <p id="b593-3" data-blocks='[["BL_593.4",593,[197,2077,1152,318]],["BL_594.1",594,[274,347,1159,587]]]'>In a highly argumentative affidavit of defense, appellant makes the general statement that, in its opinion, “after payment of the amounts due to creditors, there would not remain funds and/or assets sufficient to pay shareholders of the 28th series [in which, before the merger, plaintiff was a member], on account of their <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>respective contributions to the capital of said association, a sum in excess of $10 per share.” The courts are not interested, however, in appellant’s opinion, especially where it is thus argumentatively expressed; in an affidavit of defense adequate facts to back up the opinion are required, and these have not been given. If this allegation were true, then instead of the actual value of the assets having been $1,099,110, as elsewhere in its affidavit defendant avers they were, they would only have been $112,954, or only about <em>% </em>of the actual assets, since <em>10/m </em>of $1,401,679 is that smaller sum.</p>

National B. &amp; L. Assn., could be more wisely applied. Moreover, on the question of value, the case here is stronger for appellee than it was there. The agreement of merger here expressly provides that “the amount to be allowed and paid to withdrawing stockholders of the merged or consolidated corporation shall be ascertained, calculated and determined in accordance” therewith. That sum is stated to be $94 per share for this series, with 1% per cent simple interest. True, plaintiff is not suing as a withdrawing stockholder, but this does not affect the value of the stock as thus ascertained, especially as “all debts, dues and liabilities of [the old association] not of record, shall thenceforth be assumed by and attach to” the new association. For this reason, and because also the reorganization by the State was for the express purpose of fixing figures regarding the stock in the seven merging associations, at which they could justly join together and operate as a new and solvent association, and as upon that basis defendant and all its shareholders, who entered into the merger, acted, plaintiff properly averred in its statement of claim that the value of its stock was, as shown by that agreement, $94 per share, but without interest. Defendant’s opinions to the contrary, backed only by general and argumentative statements, would be insufficient to overcome plaintiff’s mere averment of <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>value, even if it was not sustained by the facts above stated.</p>

This indebtedness was paramount to anything due to former stockholders, whose indebtedness arose either by maturity of their stock or by a notice of withdrawal, the thirty days time limit of which had expired. It also was indebted to the latter class of withdrawing stockholders, and, perhaps, also to matured stockholders. These may be termed creditors, but their claims were subject to a possible readjustment of amount, under the circumstances and in the way specified in Sperling v. Euclid B. &amp; L. Assn., <a href="/pa/308/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="308 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1140281" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0143-01">308 Pa. 143</a>. It also had stockholders who had given notices of withdrawal, but the thirty-day time limit had not expired. As already stated, these notices became ineffective when the old association ceased to exist. It also had shareholders, some of whom agreed to and some of whom did not agree to the merger. The latter, like plaintiff here, had the right to have the value of their stock determined, and a judgment entered therefor against the new association. These, and the withdrawing stockholders, whose thirty-day time limit had expired, were in the same class, neither having preference over the other.</p>

As to the second, the new association is bound to pay those liabilities in accordance with the terms of the particular obligations. As to the last, as we have already shown, the indebtedness to them is payable as soon as the amount is deter<a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>mined; but, in view of the relation, akin to a partnership, which once existed between all the shareholders, the court below, in the exercise of a sound discretion, may and should, upon the entry of appropriate security by the solvent new association, give to it, acting diligently, a reasonable time to make such payments. In determining what is a reasonable time, due consideration should be given to liabilities to the public authorities, accruing and to accrue; to the necessity for keeping the real estate belonging to the new association in such a condition as to preserve its value and to render it income-producing; and to the wisdom of strengthening the new association as an effective organization.
