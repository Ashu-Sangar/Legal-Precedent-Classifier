Defendant avers it gave such notice of cancellation in a letter addressed to the “city treasurer and or collector of city taxes of the City of Harrisburg” under date of September 30, 1931, and also that notice of such action was received by the secretary of the board of school directors on the same date, as indicated in a letter from the board’s secretary to John C. Orr, agent for defendant bonding company. Plaintiff contends the notice in question did not refer to the bond in suit, and, as a further defense, avers Orr, as agent for <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>defendant, orally, on or about October 8,1931, reaffirmed and continued the bonding contract. Defendant contests both these statements, further alleging that up to and including October 5,1931, no default in payment had been made by the trust company.</p>
