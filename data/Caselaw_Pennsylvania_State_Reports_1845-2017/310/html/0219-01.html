Assuming the answer might be considered as proof, appellant’s case is not aided. The supplemental answers to the bill were vague, uncertain, and contained no substance to prevent the entry of a decree. For illustration, the 16th paragraph avers the deeds were without fair consideration. The answer says there was a fair consideration as the wife had invested money in the property and paid the carrying charges: when, how, or in what sum is not stated. Similarly defective is the statement that personal services were rendered. The character of such services is not stated nor their time, place, or value. The further claim that the consideration arose through a desire to adjust or prevent a threatened breach in family relations has no weight in considering the relations between debtor and creditors, when the conveyances of the former’s lands were for a nominal consideration.

It states that conveyances made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors are fraudulent as to present and future creditors. The intent to hinder, delay or defraud must be actual as distinguished from presumptive. In Schline v. Kine, <a href="/pa/301/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="301 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="1126490" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0586-01">301 Pa. 586</a>, 591, A was liable to B under an agreement. A, to defeat B’s claim, collusively mortgaged his property to C. In an action by B against C, under the Act of 1921, we held that the act contemplated a showing of “actual fraudulent intent.” Under the statute of 13 Eliz. it has been stated that as between husband and wife fraud is presumptively present when the conveyance is for a nominal consideration and is challenged by creditors (American Trust Co. v. Kaufman, <a href="/pa/276/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="276 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1077700" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0035-01">276 Pa. 35</a>; Butterworth v.

The statement of the effect of such transfers which appears in Chisholm v. Moore, <a href="/pa-super/49/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="49 Pa. Super. 132" data-case-ids="425751" data-case-paths="/pa-super/49/0132-01">49 Pa. Superior Ct. 132</a>,135, cited in the foregoing cases, would apply to the act under consideration. There a deed from mother to son for nominal consideration was under discussion. The court stated: “It is a well-established principle that a person in debt cannot convey to his child or children all of his property without an adequate consideration nor so dis<a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>pose of it as to hinder and delay creditors...... If a conveyance is made without any consideration the transaction is fraudulent on its face and no [other] evidence is necessary to show a fraudulent intent or to avoid the deed as to existing creditors.” Viewing this case from that standpoint, actual intent appears as to one creditor when the deed is from husband to wife or parent to child for a nominal consideration. The burden is then cast on the wife or son to show by clear and satisfactory proof that the conveyance was fair and that the husband’s or father’s liabilities were not out of proportion to his then remaining assets: Peoples Saving &amp; Dime Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Scott, <a href="/pa/303/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="303 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="1130048" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0294-01">303 Pa. 294</a>, 297; Shaver v.

To permit him to hold such land makes him a party to the fraudulent intention of the grantor, though he did not know of the fraud at the time of the conveyance to him.

We have then a finding of fraud supported by evidence (the pleading) without countervailing proof.
