Urian, who died September 11, 1930, under the following circumstances: He entered the garage at the rear of his home, about nine a. m., and three hours later his eleven-year-old son went into the garage and found his father dead, seated in his automobile behind the steering wheel. The deceased had a pair of pliers in his hand, which was dirty and greasy, and tools were <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>lying along the running board. The hood of the automobile was up on the left side, and a plate to which wires were attached had been taken off. The garage was filled with smoke, and the engine was still warm, although not running; the ignition was on, and the gasoline tank was empty. A front door of the garage eight feet high was open about 18 inches, and the back of the car, with its exhaust pipe, was toward that door. The physician who examined the body a short time later testified that death was caused by the inhalation of carbon monoxide gas discharged by the engine; that the gas was odorless, and that inhalation for a period of ten seconds would cause death.</p>

It has been interpreted in nearly every state in the union. The case which is most often quoted is probably U. S. Mut. Acc. Assn. v. Barry, <a href="/us/131/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="131 U.S. 100" data-case-ids="5698490" data-case-paths="/us/131/0100-01">131 U.

    <p id="b371-3" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[189,604,1154,1124]]]'>Another frequently quoted definition is that given by Sanborn, J., in Western Comm. Travelers’ Assn. v.

On the other hand, an effect which is not the natural or probable consequence of the means which produced it, an effect which does not ordinarily follow and cannot be reasonably anticipated from the use of those means, an effect which the actor did not intend to produce and which he cannot be charged with the design of producing, ......is produced by accidental means. It is produced by means which were neither designed nor calculated to cause it. Such an effect is not the result of design, cannot be reasonably anticipated, is unexpected, and is produced by an unusual combination of fortuitous circumstances; in other words, it is produced by accidental means.”</p>

In that case the terms of the policy were exactly like the terms of these policies. The plaintiff brought suit to recover for a rupture which he received while he was tightening the strap of a trunk. The court discussed the element of intention, and held he could not recover because, although the rupture was an accident, it was not brought about by accidental means, since he intended the tensing or strain which caused the rupture, even though he did not intend to produce the result. We think the learned judge took particular care to exclude <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>from the scope of the decision such cases as that now before us, when he said: “In the review of the authorities following we shall not include deaths by accidental drowning, by poison accidentally taken, by accidental inhalation of gas, or by snake bite, for all of them come squarely within the combination of external, violent and accidental means.”</p>

The policy was similar to those in the instant case, and it was held that no recovery could be had, for the reason that the death was not caused by “accidental means.” The insured had voluntarily inhaled the poisonous gas administered to him. He intended to take it, and the only unintentional and unforeseen element was the unexpected result; the means or cause of death, far from being accidental, was wholly voluntary. The opinion of the court states: “There were no accidental means, all those employed were intentional.”</p>

      <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>Considering the facts of this case in the light of what has been said, it is apparent that insured came to his death as the result of purely accidental means. The breathing of a lethal amount of poisonous gas must either be intentional or unintentional, and the verdict has concluded any thought of self-destruction. It follows that the death of insured was due to an accident, that it resulted from the unconscious inhalation of carbon monoxide gas — probably for a very few seconds— while he was intent on repairing his machine. Although he entered the garbage and started the motor of the automobile, it cannot reasonably be argued that the only natural and probable result — which he should have foreseen — of his intentional acts was the generating of poisonous gas in sufficient quantity to cause his death. There is nothing in the record to indicate that he knew of the danger he was in. He had frequently repaired his car and started the motor under practically the same conditions, without any ill effects. It is a matter of common knowledge that thousands of automobile engines are started in closed garages, particularly in the winter months, and that comparatively few deaths result thereby from carbon monoxide poisoning. If he knew of the likelihood that the motor might generate carbon monoxide, there is nothing in the record to show that he did not rely on the open door, and the proximity of the exhaust pipe to it, to carry off the fumes.</p>
