The Act of May 11,1874, is <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>entitled “An act fixing the liability of stockholders of banks, banking companies and other banking institutions in this Commonwealth.” It provides “That from and after the passage of this act, all stockholders in banks, banking companies, saving fund institutions, trust companies, and all other incorporated companies doing the business of banks or loaning and discounting moneys as such in this Commonwealth, shall be personally liable for all debts and deposits in their individual capacity to double the amount of the capital stock held and owned by each: Provided, that before such liability shall accrue, in case of banks already chartered, the stockholders shall, at a regular or adjourned meeting, declare by resolution or otherwise their intention to accept the provisions of this act, and notice of their action shall, within thirty days thereafter, be filed in the office of the auditor general and secretary of the Commonwealth, setting forth at length their proceeding, declaring their intention to be bound by its provisions in the same manner and as fully as if the same had been a part of the original act by which they were incorporated.” We shall designate this as the May Act to distinguish it from the general Corporation Act of April 29th of the same year.</p>

Enlarged liability is the exception; it possesses elements of a penalty. Section 24 shows that the legislature was not content to rest the stockholder’s obligation on the implications of the general rule and, therefore, specifically expressed the immunity. It is a valuable privilege. A legislative intention to withdraw it should clearly appear before the courts may declare it withdrawn. In O’Reilly v. Bard, <a href="/pa/105/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="105 Pa. 569" data-case-ids="454234" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0569-01">105 Pa. 569</a>, 573, we said: “Corporation stockholders, who have already contributed their proportions to the capital stock, are not at the common law, or in equity, liable for corporate debts; statutes which impose this liability must therefore be strictly construed; this rule of law is well settled: Mean’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=85%20Pa.%2078" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="85 Pa. 78">85 Pa. 78</a>.” Appellant would concede all that, and also that, standing alone, the May Act did not affect the immunity. He contends that the privilege was relinquished at the moment the title company discounted paper, as permitted by the Act of May 9, 1923, supra. His argument is that by discounting notes, etc., the company became a bank, destroyed the immunity granted by section 24, subjected itself to the May Act, and imposed on its shareholders the enlarged liability there specified. The contention is not well founded, as will appear by considering the May Act and the general Banking Act of 1876 in the light of the conditions confronting the legislature immediately after the adoption of the Constitution which became effective January 1, 1874.</p>

Special charters were prohibited in article m, section 7. General statutes providing for incorporation were therefore among the matters requiring attention, subject to the provisions of article xvi. Among the bills introduced to provide for general incorporation, was that passed and approved April 29th, since known as the Corporation Act of 1874. Another, which failed to <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>pass at that session, was a general act to provide incorporation for the transaction of the banking business. Such a law was passed in 1876, supra. In view of the subsequent development of the title insurance company into what may be called the modern trust company (to distinguish it from trust companies created by special laws prior to 1874) it may be noted, at this point, that no provision was made for the formation of trust companies, as such, in the Corporation Act of 1874, or in the general Banking Act of 1876, or by any other general law. Such trust companies developed from section 2, clause 19, and section 29 of the general corporation act, as supplemented from time to time.</p>

It is unnecessary to discuss the extent of the enlarged liability imposed on shareholders by the May Act (though, compare Dreisbach v. Price, <a href="/pa/133/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="133 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="812901" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0560-01">133 Pa. 560</a>). That obligation, whatever it was — as to shareholders in “companies doing the business of banks or loaning and discounting moneys as such,” was superseded by the general banking act. The substitution appeared in section 5, as follows: “The shareholders of any corporation formed under this act shall be individually responsible, equally and ratably, but not one for the other, for all contracts, debts and engagements of such corporation to the amount of their stock therein at par value thereof in addition to the par value of such shares.” This provision was retained when section 5 was amended May 3, 1909, P. L. 412. The provisions of the May Act, enabling corporations of the class referred to, chartered <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>prior to the adoption of the Constitution, to accept the provisions of that act, were carried into the later act in section 32. Not only were those provisions of the May Act so superseded by provisions in the later act, but it was the first general act passed after the adoption of the new Constitution for the incorporation of banks. It was substantially a reenactment of prior general legislation on the subject. Its title was: “An act for the incorporation and regulation of banks of discount and deposit.” This general act is so obviously intended to be a complete expression of the legislative will concerning the incorporation of banking institutions that, according to familiar rules of construction, we must hold that the legislature intended to repeal the provisions of the May Act concerning the “doing the business of banks or loaning and discounting moneys as such.” As to such business, the two acts could not stand together, and section 33 provided that all general acts or parts of acts inconsistent with it should be repealed. This conclusion is fortified, if the May Act be considered as imposing treble liability (Dreisbach v. Price, <a href="/pa/133/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="133 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="812901" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0560-01">supra)</a> for, we cannot impute to the legislature an intention to continue to impose treble liability on shareholders in corporations “doing the business of banks or [that is] loaning and discounting moneys as such,” and at the same time, to provide, as in the general banking act, that shareholders in “banks of deposit and discount,” formed under that act — the only general act under which they could be formed — should be liable only for double their stock subscriptions. Such a distinction or difference in penalties imposed, would involve a classification of banking corporations with no substantial basis in fact and would therefore be unreasonable and ineffective. See Laplacca v. P. R. T. Co., <a href="/pa/265/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="265 Pa. 304" data-case-ids="1051930" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0304-01">265 Pa. 304</a>, 308; Mason-Heflin Coal Co. v.

We must hold that the legislature intended what would be legally effective and that section 5 thereafter prescribed the shareholder’s liability. The appli<a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>cable rule of construction is familiar. In Murdoch v.

Superior Ct. 29</a>, 31, President Judge Bice says, ‘The question of the repeal of statutes by implication is one of legislative intention, and all rules of construction have in view the ascertainment of that intention. One of the rules upon the subject is that a subsequent statute revising the whole subject-matter of a former statute and evidently intended as a substitute for it, although it contains no express words to that effect, operates to repeal the former.’ To like import is Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes, section 241. ‘A statute is impliedly repealed by a subsequent one, revising the whole subject-matter of the first:’ Sedgwick on Construction of Statutory and Constitutional Law (2d edition), page 105. Buling Case Law, volume 25, page 925, states that, ‘where a statute is revised, or a series of acts on the same subject is revised and consolidated into one, all parts and provisions of the former act or acts, that are omitted from the revised act, are repealed,’ and the same principle is found in Sutherland on Statutory Construction (2d edition), volume 1, sections 270, 271.”</p>

Article xvi, section 11, of the Constitution, required that banking corporations be kept in a separate class. It provided: “No corporate body to possess bank and discounting privileges shall be created or organized in pursuance of any law without three months previous public notice, at the place of the intended location, of the intention to apply for such privileges, in such manner as shall be prescribed by law, nor shall a charter for such privilege be granted for a longer period than twenty years.” That section 11 was amended in 1920, is immaterial in this case.</p>

The words ‘trust companies’ used in the Act of 1874 [the May Act] can only have reference to those trust companies created by special acts passed prior to the adoption of the new Constitution, of which there are a few, and which were given the right to engage in a banking business. This is clearly indicated in the title to the act. It is an act fixing the liability of stockholders of banks and banking companies and other banking institutions. At that time there were in existence some so-called trust companies possessing the power to do a banking business, and this was the class of institutions intended to be included in this section of the act. The modern trust company did not then exist, nor was there any authority by which it could be created at that time. After that time no trust company, incorporated under the general Corporation Act of 1874 or its supplements, could be authorized to do a general banking business, and hence we must conclude, as did the court below, that the trust companies mentioned in the double liability Act of 1874 were such as had been previously created with power to engage in the business of banking. The trust company in the case at bar had no such power, and the act does not apply to it.”</p>

In rejecting the argument we said: “He avers, however, by various later statutes, each of the two classes of corporations is vested with powers which it did not have when that case [DeHaven v.

Hence, he says, plaintiif must nOAv be considered as if it were a banking institution, and governed by the Act of 1917. It would be just as valid an argument to claim that, because of these recent statutes, banks are to be treated as if they Avere trust companies, and that the Act of 1917 is no longer applicable even to them. But, aside from this, the statutes relied on are enabling, and not disabling acts, and nothing in them even suggests an intention to make trust companies liable to the Act of 1917, or to place them, on the question of branches, in the class to which banking institutions belong.” In every ease, then, in Avhich it was contended that such trust companies had transferred themselves into another class of corporations by availing themselves of unconditional enabling legislation, we have held that they remained in the class in which they were incorporated.</p>
