The present appeal is from an order of the court below, overruling appellants’ exceptions to the account of the secretary of banking, who had disallowed appellants’ claim to be preferred over the depositors in the distribution of the assets of the trust company to the extent of $7,828, less a credit of $350.14.</p>

Briefly stated, they are as follows: On November 19, 1929, appellants borrowed $1,200 from the trust company on their joint note, pledging as collateral security for the loan a cex1tificate for 100 shares of Pennsylvania Eailroad Company stock. By various payments the amount of this debt was reduced, and on January 21, 1930, the balance due was $350.14. On that day, without the consent or knowledge of appellants, the stock xvhich they had pledged was sold, for the account of the trust company, by brokei'S in Pittsburgh. On the same day the treasurer <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>of the trust company, who had ordered the sale of this stock, stole from the trust company $7,828, a sum equal to the proceeds of this sale, and debited the account of the Mellon National Bank, its Pittsburgh correspondent, with a like sum. The following day the proceeds of the sale were credited, as a collection item, to the trust company’s account in the Mellon National Bank. On September 13, 1930, the note signed by appellants was marked paid on the books of the trust company. Until the above facts became known, after the closing of the trust company on November 13, 1930, appellants supposed that the note remained unpaid, and that the certificate representing the pledged stock was still in the possession of the trust company, as they had made no further payments on account of principal, and had paid interest on the. debt for a period extending beyond that date.</p>

In that case it appeared that the bank, which had been taken over by the secretary of banking had received in cash, while insolvent, only a week before it closed, the sum which the claimant contended it held as trustee ex maleficio. The bank, from the time it wrongfully received the money to the moment it suspended business, always had cash assets in excess of the sum thus received. The claimant, therefore, was rightfully entitled to a preference in the distribution of the bank’s assets to the full amount of its claim, as the fund into which the proceeds of the wrong were traceable had always thereafter exceeded that sum.</p>

The treasurer accomplished his theft from the trust company before the proceeds of the sale of appellants’ stock reached its account in the Mellon National Bank, and it was not until they were paid into that account that they were received by the trust company. The period of time separáting the theft by the treasurer from <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>the receipt of the funds by the bank is most material, and cannot be disregarded. It is argued that the treasurer knew the exact amount of the proceeds of the sale of appellants’ stock before he took the funds of the bank. This may be true, but it cannot alter the fact that the benefits of the sale were not deposited in the trust company’s account until the day after the treasurer had embezzled its funds.

Appellants are entitled, by an application of the principles stated above, to receive from that account, in preference to other creditors, an amount equal to their claim, or, if the balance of that account ever went below the amount of their claim, to the lowest balance thereof at any time after the proceeds of the conversion had been deposited therein.
