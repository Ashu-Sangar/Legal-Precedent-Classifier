The defense was that the interference with the flow of the springs resulted from drought and not from mining. The issue so made was tried in January, 1931, with a verdict for plaintiffs; January 20, 1931, a motion for a new trial was made; April 24, 1931, supplemental reasons for a new trial were filed. This motion was not disposed of by the court below until January 4, 1932, when judgment for plaintiffs followed. An appeal to this court was taken to March Term, 1932, and was argued March 21, 1932. The judgment was affirmed April 11, 1932 (see <a href="/pa/307/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="307 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1138121" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0264-01">307 Pa. 264</a>).

It will be noticed that in its petition, defendant does not state specifically when it learned the alleged fact on which it grounds its application; it merely avers that the evidence was discovered “since the trial;” as time is one of the decisive elements in the consideration of the question, such an indefinite statement of the time of discovery is without value. Then, too, petition does not aver why the data collected from day to day by the representatives of the weather bureau in the vicinity were not available from time to time, as gathered, as is generally the case. It is to be observed, too, that no reason is given for not moving on or about March 1, 1932, as soon as the information is said to have been acquired. At that date, by appropriate petition, defendant could have brought the matter to the attention of this court before the appeal was disposed of on the merits as appellant then presented them. Instead of applying to the court below, as defendant apparently might have done, during the long period between the date of the verdict, January 17, 1931, and the time of taking the appeal to this court, January 29, 1932, or of thereafter applying to this court prior to argument March 21, 1932, as was done, for example, in Ralston v.

The other mining expert stated that if these springs became dry for the first time in 1930, it might be due to the drouth. We submit that the remarkable coincidence in this case was the failure of the springs, which corresponded exactly with the severe drouths. That it was the most probable cause of the failure to plaintiffs’ springs is evidence by plaintiffs’ own testimony.” Later on in the petition, the following is stated: “In <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>our case the testimony points to the drouth as the proximate cause of the loss of plaintiffs’ springs. It was at least equally probable that it was the cause of the failure of plaintiffs’ springs, and not the mining of the coal underneath. It is also at least equally probable that the severe blasts the old building received from the winds and storms loosened the shingles on the roof, which is emphasized by the fact that the roof required repairs due to the loosening of the shingles long before the mining and blasting complained of, and it is probable that the shaking of the building by storms caused the cracks complained of in the cellar floor and walls.”</p>

Since the trial, heavy rains have set in, the springs have come back and are now flowing, and this is the item of proof now sought to be introduced by the petition. There can be little doubt but that the absence of water on the farm played a large part in the verdict though there were other elements of damage.

An abuse of discretion appears where there is a clear and manifest disregard of the facts or law. The judges who hear applications of this sort must assume the absolute and full responsibility for the conclusion reached.

Moreover, the reappearance of the flow of water is subject to another consideration: when the effect of normal rains disappears, it may again cease, a condition that never arose before defendant’s mining operations. Such a course of procedure leads to confusion and difficulty and condemns many prior decisions based on these principles. Fixed legal rules should not be set aside in hard cases.</p>

While every person is entitled of right to one trial in which he has his day in court, a second trial is not a matter of right but of grace and will be granted during term time only when the first trial is shown to have been improper through fraud or any circumstance connected with the trial which appeals to the trial court: Gazzam v. Beading, <a href="/pa/202/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="202 Pa. 231" data-case-ids="992364" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0231-01">202 Pa. 231</a>, 237. When a new trial is granted in term time the discretion thus exercised will not be questioned.</p>
    <p id="b258-6" data-blocks='[["BL_258.6",258,[267,2245,1154,154]],["BL_259.1",259,[205,348,1154,416]]]'>Here the term was passed and the judgment affirmed by this court. To secure another trial after the term has ended, the path of the moving party is beset with <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>grave and serious difficulties. The petitioner must allege fraud in connection with the first trial which prevented a fair submission of the controversy to the jury. No such allegation is made here, but it is suggested that in addition to fraud as ground for a new trial after term time, mistake in trial would be sufficient to justify a reversal, and that the present existence of the springs shows that the verdict was based on a mistake of fact.</p>
    <p id="b259-3" data-blocks='[["BL_259.4",259,[202,782,1154,795]]]'>As the reappearance of the springs was plainly a fact that came into being since the trial, it was after-discovered evidence, but the substantive facts underlying the evidence were before the court. This item supplemented defendant’s proof in that physical facts would now show what inference alone then showed. Courts will go some distance to correct manifest wrong in trials, but, as the majority opinion sets out and as Judge McCann notes, the facts of the springs’ existence and the reason they did not flow were all matters contested before the court in the first trial. While the demurrer to the petition may admit facts as well pleaded, such demurrer does not remove or change the facts in the record of the trial. They are the primary and fundamental basis of the action.</p>
    <p id="b259-4" data-blocks='[["BL_259.5",259,[194,1598,1156,812]],["BL_260.1",260,[278,342,1158,308]]]'>The ruling contended for is novel: that after a trial is ended, and term passed, the losing party may years after come in and say a mistake, without regard to its importance, was made in the trial and obtain a new trial. Pew trials are had without mistakes, many are more grave and serious than this so-called mistake. The supposed mistake is no more grievous than in many cases where in the interest of the public trials must end and a new trial cannot be had. The unfortunate consequences of an adoption of appellant’s position are well stated by Fitzgerald, J., in Fogel v. I. R. T. Co., <a href="/nys/103/0977-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="103 N.Y.S. 977" data-case-ids="7691491" data-case-paths="/nys/103/0977-01">103 N. Y. S. 977</a>, when he says: “The granting of the motion under the exceptional circumstances may tend to imperil the security of judgments, may lead to interminable delay in arriving at definite determinations in actions, may be pro<a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>ductive of multitudinous and exasperating applications for new trials in cases, particularly where verdicts rest in any degree upon expert evidence as to future resultant conditions reasonably to be apprehended, — thus swelling the volume of litigation and largely increasing the labors of the courts.”</p>
    <p id="b260-4" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[277,670,1158,697]]]'>The situation is somewhat analogous to personal injury cases, where it is testified that a person has been permanently injured and after the trial and verdict and money paid, the permanent condition is reduced to partial disability. While some courts have allowed a new trial, it has usually been where the recovery of the plaintiff is so rapid as to suggest fraud (45 L. E. A., N. S. 87), and no judgment in this State to my knowledge has ever been opened for another trial under such circumstances after term time. However, the rule first stated applies, namely, the court below, through Judge Mc-Cann, having passed on this question, its decision is controlling under the circumstances appearing here.</p>

Whether the connection between the mining operations and the drying up of the springs was causal or coincidental was entirely a matter of inference at that time. The evidence was purely circumstantial.</p>

    <p id="b261-3" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[192,1174,1151,98]]]'>To this petition the plaintiffs demurred, thereby admitting all of the facts pleaded.</p>
    <p id="b261-4" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[188,1283,1156,317]]]'>These facts being thus admitted, it appears to me that the defendant is paying plaintiffs $10,000 for alleged damages never sustained and it is therefore entitled to the redress it is asking for at the hands of the court below, which redress is that judgment should be opened, the verdict set aside and a new trial granted.</p>
    <p id="b261-5" data-blocks='[["BL_261.6",261,[184,1609,1157,806]],["BL_262.1",262,[293,368,1156,424]]]'>This is not a case where a litigant seeks a new trial upon after-discovered evidence which by diligence might have been discovered earlier. Defendant could not have discovered that the plaintiffs’ springs had resumed their normal flow until there had been a season of normal rainfall and until there was available data covering at least several months. It appears to me that defendant acted with all of the diligence required under the circumstances. The verdict of the court below was obtained on January 12, 1931. This judgment was not affirmed by the Supreme Court until fifteen months later, i. e., on April 11, 1932. Defendant’s petition for reargument was refused by this court on May 9, 1932. Petition for rule to open judgment was filed on May 17, 1932, eight days thereafter. This to me indicates i*ather unusual <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>diligence by the defendant. The majority opinion says: “It is to be observed, too, that no reason is given for not moving on or about March 1, 1932, as soon as the information is said to have been acquired. At that date, by appropriate petition, defendant could have brought the matter to the attention of this court before the appeal was disposed of on the merits as appellant then presented them.”</p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[291,802,1158,644]]]'>I think the defendant can not be justly criticized for waiting until the Supreme Court had passed on the question then under its consideration before moving in the court below for the opening of the judgment. The defendant had an undoubted right to go before the court below when the record was remitted to it and ask that the judgment be opened. Surely the delay from March 1, 1932, when defendant was convinced that the springs had resumed their normal flow, to May 17, 1932, when they moved for the opening of judgment, a period of only two and a half months, is not unusual measured by the speed with which legal matters are customarily handled.</p>
    <p id="b262-5" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[290,1454,1156,480]]]'>Furthermore, if there was any delay in this case the plaintiffs were not in the slightest degree harmed by it. If defendant is amerced of $10,000 for alleged damages which are proved by subsequent natural events to have been mythical, this court should brook no delay in undoing that injustice. The damages claimed and secured by the plaintiffs were supposedly based on facts; it is now admitted (for that is the effect of the demurrer) that they were based merely on erroneous conjecture.</p>
    <p id="b262-6" data-blocks='[["BL_262.6",262,[289,1943,1158,425]],["BL_263.1",263,[214,356,1148,99]]]'>In our opinion filed April 11,1932, we said: “The testimony as to the drying up of the springs is as follows: ‘A’ spring began to fail In June or July, 1927, after that there was water in it only during extremely wet seasons. This spring was never as strong as before 1927. <em>‘W </em>spring began to dry up in the summer of 1928 and the water in it was never afterwards sufficient for domestic use. ‘C’ and ‘D’ springs began to dry up about July, <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>1930, and in November of that year they became entirely dry.”</p>
    <p id="b263-3" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[213,465,1154,854]]]'>When this summary of plaintiffs’ testimony, which resulted in a verdict for them, is contrasted with the facts alleged in defendant’s petition and admitted by the demurrer “that at all times since, the summer and fall of 1931 having been a season of normal though not excessive rainfall, said springs flowed freely and normally, supplying plaintiffs’ farm and farm buildings with all plaintiffs’ requirements of water and overflowing in the normal manner and to the normal extent; [and] that such condition now continues......,” the conclusion is to me inescapable that the legal damages alleged by plaintiffs and on which the judgment of $10,000 was predicated were absolutely nonexistent, and that the dryness of plaintiffs’ springs between 1927 and 1932 was due to an act of God (i. e., a season of drought) and not to the acts of defendant.</p>

It alleges an act of nature not discernible until after final judgment, which under the pleadings is not denied. It is not inherent or included in the case at the time of the trial, but lay outside it, incapable of exact proof and only brought to light after the judgment was rendered. In point of fact it was nonexistent, and only came to life when normal conditions once again obtained. It meets the test of equity because (under the pleadings) the party could not have availed himself of the evidence at the trial, and is also now found to be clearly unjust. ...... As the pleadings now stand the springs are admittedly back in full force and vigor, and if this be true, a wrong was inadvertently done defendant which it is the privilege if not the duty of the court, in the exercise of its equitable powers, to correct to the extent at least <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>of overruling the demurrer and having plaintiff answer over. If, after testimony shall have been taken on the rule, a different set of facts is shown, and it is found that the evidence submitted is intrinsic and not extrinsic, and collateral to the questions formerly brought before the court, then the rule to open the judgment should be denied, otherwise a new trial will be a mater of simple justice.”</p>
