S. 121</a>, 127, the Supreme Court of the United States said: “......The means to be employed to promote the public safety are primarily in the judgment of the legislative branch of the government, to whose authority such matters are committed, and so long as the means have a substantial relation to the purpose to be accomplished, and there is no arbitrary interference with private rights, the courts cannot interfere with the exercise of the power by enjoining regulations made in the interest of public safety which the legislature has duly enacted...... It is only in those clear and unmistakable cases of abuse of legislative authority that the court is authorized_______ to enjoin the exercise of legislative power.”</p>

The Court of Common Pleas of Berks County recognized and officially declared its reasonableness and validity. We find nothing in the record that leads us to reverse the conclusion of that learned court. The purpose to be accomplished by the ordinance is commendable, the means adopted have a rational relation to the accomplishment of that purpose, and the <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>interference with the exercise of plaintiff’s right of property is not arbitrary but clearly demanded by the public welfare.</p>
