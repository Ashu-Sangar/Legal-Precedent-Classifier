The amount claimed represented the balance on the full contract price after deducting certain cash payments. The scire facias issued March 2, 1931, and defendant Mary Redlich, the wife, filed her affidavit of defense on June 22, 1931., In this she alleged that her husband, defendant Max Redlich, had a complete legal defense to the whole of plaintiff’s claim and that she had a legal defense to part of plaintiff’s claim. The husband’s defense was that he was not the owner of the premises nor did he contract with the plaintiff or any other person for the making of the improvements. Defendant Mary Redlich, on the other hand, admitted ownership of the premises and all the material terms of the contract together with the subsequent agreements to pay for extras. She alleged that in addition to the cash payments on the full amount due, mentioned above, two notes had been given for a total of $6,500, which notes were “held by the Ambridge Savings &amp; Trust Company.” She also alleged that certain subcontractors and materialmen who had dealt with the claimant had filed mechanics’ liens.</p>

    <p id="b97-5" data-blocks='[["BL_97.4",97,[228,553,1151,861]]]'>Belying on this admission, plaintiff filed a praecipe with the prothonotary of the court of common pleas directing him to enter judgment for $17,254.95, to be liquidated with interest due from February 1,1931. Plaintiff subsequently gave to subcontractors various partial assignments of this judgment. One of these was to the Ambridge Savings &amp; Trust Company, in the amount of $6,500. On February 23,1932, the defendant Mary Iledlich filed a petition to strike off the judgment entered by the prothonotary, setting up as grounds therefor: (1) that her affidavit of defense contained a defense to the whole or part of plaintiff’s claim, sufficient to prevent entry of judgment, and (2) that the prothonotary possessed no authority under the mechanic’s lien statutes to enter the judgment. This petition was denied by the court below and the judgment remained.</p>

In any action pending in the courts of this Commonwealth, where an affidavit of defense clearly admits the whole or any part of the amount claimed by a plaintiff to be due, the protlionotary may enter judgment for the amount so admitted. The Act of May 31, 1893, P. L. 185, section 1, reads as follows: “That in all cases now pending, or hereafter to be commenced, in the several courts of this Commonwealth in which affidavits of defense have been or may be filed to part of the claim of the plaintiff or plaintiffs, the plaintiff or plaintiffs may take judgment for the amount admitted to be due and have execution for the collection of the same, and the cases shall be proceeded in for the recovery of the balance of the demand of the plaintiff or plaintiffs, if anything more should be justly due to such plaintiff or plaintiffs.”</p>

      <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>It will be observed that this act uses tbe phrase “plaintiff may take judgment,” without specifying whether it shall be taken in court or in the prothonotary’s office, but this court, in Roberts v.

    <p id="b98-5" data-blocks='[["BL_98.4",98,[270,926,1164,802]]]'>The language of the Act of 1893, supra, is broad enough to cover a case where either part or all of the whole claim is “admitted to be due.” It provides that “cases shall be proceeded in for the recovery of the balance of the demand, <em>if anything more should he justly due ” </em>The implication of that last clause is that after an “amount is admitted to be due” there may be something or nothing more due. If we held that the Act of 1893 applied only to those cases where less than the full amount claimed was admitted to be due, we would give the act an unreasonable interpretation because under such an interpretation a plaintiff suing for $1,000 could take judgment for $999 if the affidavit of defense admitted that-sum to be due, but could not take judgment for $1,000 if that entire sum was admitted to be due.</p>

In that case the error charged is that certain judgments entered on scire facias sur mechanic’s lien were void “because they were entered ‘contrary to law by an attorney on a mere praecipe for judgment and not by the court, as provided by section 32 of the Mechanic’s Lien Act of June 4,1901, P. L. 431, as amended by the Act of May 23,1913, P. L. 307.’ ” The Superior Court held that by the terms of the section referred to <em>the court alone </em>has the authority to direct the entry of a judgment on a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense to a scire facias sur mechanic’s lien.</p>
    <p id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[198,1060,1154,913]]]'>Section 32 as amended by the Act of 1913, P.

Section 34 of the Mechanic’s Lien Law provides: “if no affidavit of defense be filed within the time designated, judgment may be entered and damages assessed by the prothonotary by default, for want thereof.” Clearly the affidavit filed by defendant in this case cannot be judicially regarded as the equivalent of “no affidavit.” The Act of 1893 as interpreted in Roberts v. Sharp, supra, authorizes <em>the prothonotary </em>to enter judgment <em>for an amount ewplioitly “admitted to he due.” </em>Where a definite amount is in plain language admitted to be due, the exercise of no judicial function is called for and the prothonotary can enter judgment.</p>
