Hile, deceased, appealed from the decision <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>of the register of wills admitting bis will to probate. The Orphans’ Court of Franklin County on the report of an examiner refused an issue devisavit vel non. Thereafter contestant endeavored to open the adjudication on the basis of after discovered evidence; the court below refused the prayer of petitioner and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.4",569,[208,678,1152,1397]]]'>The evidence discloses that two men bearing the same name, John Hile, were born about the same time and lived in the same vicinity. One of these individuals, the father of contestant, had been an inmate of the County Home, placed there by his family because of his weakened mental condition, The contestant, Julia, was placed in an orphanage, and the record of her admission to that institution shows that her father, John Hile, was then at the home. The records show no discharge of her father therefrom although apparently he left it at sometime. It appears that he lived an unsettled life, wandering about the countryside with a wife, Nancy Knight, and three children. He died about 1891 or 1892, having been buried from the home, to which, apparently, he had returned prior to his death. The other John Hile, the testator, though bearing the same name and about the same age, was an educated and respected citizen of Franklin County, a business man of ability and intelligence who had lived in that community for fifty years or more. His history appears chronologically in the testimony, almost without a break, from birth to death, showing his domestic, business and religious connections. He had been twice married and it was as a daughter of his first wife that Julia filed her appeal. The testimony is abundant that this John Hile had no children by either wife.</p>
    <p id="b569-5" data-blocks='[["BL_569.5",569,[209,2094,1150,262]]]'>The court held that there were two John Hiles, one of unsound and the other of sound mind, and that the contestant was the daughter of the one of unsound mind. Appellant contends that the issue was one for the decision of a jury.</p>

      <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>The principles of law which govern the granting of an issue devisavit vel non are not unsettled, vague or difficult of comprehension, and have been stated by this court on numerous occasions. The application of these principles is not as simple as their statement. It is this latter problem which has led appellant to bring the case to this court. Contestant bases her claim for an issue on section 21 (b), Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 363: “Whenever a dispute upon a matter of fact arises......the court shall, at the request of either party, direct a precept for an issue to the court of common pleas of the county for the trial thereof.”</p>

It is the evidence of the fact on the one hand and the evidence in denial on the other, which raises such a substantial and material dispute as this court must alone consider in determining the right demanded: Sharpless’s Est., <a href="/pa/134/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="134 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="814925" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0250-01">134 Pa. 250</a>. As the rule is usually stated, an issue should be denied in a case where, after a careful consideration and review of all the evidence, the trial judge would feel compelled to set aside a verdict, if found for the petitioner, as impossible and improper on the strength of the evidence.

To sustain the grant of an issue, the evidence must be such as would permit a verdict for either party to stand. Otherwise, there is no substantial dispute upon a material question of fact. The evidence of the contestant, standing alone, may present a prima facie case, but it is not of itself sufficient to entitle her to an issue as a matter of right, for the reason that it may be so overwhelmingly swept aside by <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>opposing proof as to leave no substantial dispute to pass on: Fleming’s Est., supra; Sharpless’s Est., <a href="/pa/284/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="284 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1091994" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0169-01">supra.</a></p>
