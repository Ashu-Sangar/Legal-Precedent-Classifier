Claiming that it was seriously injured during the construction of the apartment house, and that defendant was responsible therefor, plaintiff brought the present suit.

It will be noticed this agreement does not provide for defendant to do any of the actual work of construction, either by itself or through subcontractors; that the real relation between the owner and defendant was not that of owner and contractor, but was that of owner and superintendent, defendant acting, in the matter of the construction, in that capacity only.</p>

With “the approval of the owner, and for its account,” defendant made various subcontracts for specific portions of the work of construction, the aggregate of said contracts embracing all the work needed in the erection of the apartment house. This imposes no liability on defendant : Bachler v. Widmyer, <a href="/pa/242/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="242 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="998819" data-case-paths="/pa/242/0108-01">242 Pa. 108</a>. Each of these subcontracts was executed by defendant as “Agent for 1437 Spruce Street Corporation [Owner] by W. W. Loeb.” All the work performed in the course of the con<a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>struction was done by these subcontractors, and none of it by defendant. The only employee defendant had on the work was a superintendent, who did not interfere with the method of performance by the subcontractors, save to see that the work was completed in accordance with the “plans, specifications and details” prepared by the “owner’s architects,” and, as expressly authorized by the contract, to require the discharge of any employee “deemed by the contractor to be incompetent, careless or a hindrance to the work” generally. Whether any employee was discharged, because of this provision, does not appear, but, in any event, out of these matters defendant would incur no personal liability: Miller v. Merritt, <a href="/pa/211/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="211 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="940114" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0127-01">211 Pa. 127</a>.</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[299,1109,1159,860]]]'>It follows that if defendant is to be held liable, it must be solely because of its personal wrongful acts: Berry v. Vantries, 12 S. &amp; R. 89, 93; Beeson v. Lang, <a href="/pa/85/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="85 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="440484" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0197-01">85 Pa. 197</a>, 201. There was no employee of defendant working on the building, and hence the doctrine of respondeat superior could not be applied. Even if it should be alleged that defendant did not select efficient subcontractors, or properly superintend the work of construction, its responsibility therefor would be only to the owner; for, quoad the matter of superintendence, it owed no duty to plaintiff. “Where an agent has authority to employ subagents, he will not be liable for their acts or omissions, unless in their appointment he is guilty of fraud or gross negligence, or improperly cooperates in [their wrongful] acts or omissions:” Harrison v.

As said by us in Simonton v. Morton, <a href="/pa/275/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="275 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1075675" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0562-01">275 Pa. 562</a>, 569: “There necessarily must be a certain control by contractee of all undertakings such as the one we are considering, otherwise he could not safeguard himself as to the satisfactory ac<a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>complishment of the work. ‘As a practical proposition, every contract for work to be done reserves to the employer a certain degree of control — at least to enable him to see that the contract is performed according to the specifications. The employer may exercise a limited control over the work without rendering the employee a mere servant, for the relation of master and servant is not inferable from the reservation of powers which do not deprive the contractor of his right to do the work according to his own initiative so long as he does it in accordance with the contract.’ ...... A reservation of the light to supervise and inspect the work during performance does not make the contractor a mere servant, where the mode and means of performance are within his control: 14 Ruling Case Law 69...... ‘The control of the workmen doing the actual manual labor in the performance of the work is an extremely important element in determining whether the employee is an independent contractor. The fact that the contractor employs, pays, and has full power to control the workmen [as was the case with every subcontractor on this operation] is practically decisive of his independence:’ 14 Ruling Case Law 71.” If, however, these subcontractors should not be held to be independent contractors, this would not render defendant liable to plaintiff, in the absence of express wrongdoing on its part, for their contracts were with the owner, defendant appearing in the transaction only as its agent.</p>

Speaking generally, there are three classes of injuries to plaintiff’s property, of which he complains: (1) An injury to the roof by articles falling or being thrown on it in the course of construction of the apartment house; (2) An injury to his property generally because of interference with the means therein provided for carrying off surplus water; and (3) A failure to protect the brick building on plain<a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>tiff’s property, so that it and the adjoining earth settled, causing injury, especially to the rear building itself. For none of these things, however, was defendant responsible to plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b342-4" data-blocks='[["BL_342.4",342,[275,569,1162,1077]]]'>As to the first two, since defendant was not to do, and did not in fact do any of the actual work of construction, and all these matters arose out of and in the course of construction, those who did that work must necessarily be responsible for whatever injury occurred. Moreover, this is especially provided for, the contracts between defendant, as agent for the owner, and the subcontractors, specifically providing that “The subcontractor is to be fully responsible and repair and place in first-class condition, at his expense, all damage done to property...... in the performance of this contract.” If it be said that the damage complained of would not have occurred if defendant had properly superintended the work, it need only be said again that, for this neglect, if there was one, defendant is responsible only to the owner. Indeed, the evidence in this case is barren of proof as to who caused those injuries. We are asked to infer that it was done by one or more of the subcontractors, solely by reason of the fact that it occurred while they were woi’king on the apartment house.</p>

He must watch the progress of the work without notice from any one...... He must be responsible and make good to the architects’ satisfaction all defacements and injuries to neighboring properties done by him or men in his employ, or through his or their negligence, or to any work upon the building not in this contract, if done by him or men in his employ, or through his or their negligence. He must use, provide and make all proper, necessary and sufficient precautions, safeguards and pro<a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>teetions against the occui'rence or happening of any accidents, injuries, damages or hurt, to any person or property, during the progress of the construction of work contracted for, and he must be responsible for and indemnify and save harmless the owner from the payment of all sums of money by reason of any such accidents, injuries or hurts that may happen or occur through him or men in his employ, or through his or their negligence.” Aside from all other considerations, it is so plainly evident that these provisions apply only to the relation between defendant and the owner, that nothing further need be said in regard to them.</p>
    <p id="b343-3" data-blocks='[["BL_343.4",343,[187,1009,1152,1131]]]'>The third contention, which is the important one on this appeal, must also be decided against plaintiff. The apartment house was to be built on the entire front of the owner’s property, running up to plaintiff’s property. His residence also occupied the entire front of his lot, the west wall thereof, extending back for sixty feet, being a party wall — that is, partly built on each property. North of that, plaintiff’s building receded four feet, and then continued of that reduced width back to Manning Street. The four feet not built upon constituted plaintiff’s side yard. Ip constructing the apartment house, its west wall for the sixty feet in depth was the existing party wall above referred to, and in relation to it no substantial complaint is made. North of the party wall, however, and east of the party line of the owner was the above mentioned side yard of plaintiff. The plan of the apartment house provided for a curtain wall along that side yard, that is, a wall which came up to the common line of the two properties, but not encroaching on plaintiff’s property, as would have been necessary had this part of the wall been a party wall.</p>

He said it was necessary to support that side yard, to put in that sheathing, so that they could support it and keep it from falling in.” It will be noticed that this refers only to the support of the yard, not the building. Following the permission thus obtained, defendant, as agent for the owner, gave the lines at which the sheathing should be placed, and then plaintiff says “there was sheathing driven in and considerable of the ground taken out for the sheathing to be put in.” Plaintiff alleges “that the cause of the settlement of the building [following the construction of the sheathing] was water getting behind the sheet piling and percolating through for a series of weeks and wasting out the earth.” Defendant had nothing to do with the actual performance of that work; it was all done by the subcontractor who had the contract above quoted.</p>

The incorrectness of this contention is evident as regards anyone, and, as respects plaintiff, is readily made clear. The facts are these: Plaintiff complained of the injury, and the architect for the owner had an interview with him. Following this, the owner directed defendant to give to the subcontractor an order to remedy the cause of the complaint, the cost of so doing to be paid by the owner. This course was pursued, the subcontractor did the work at an expense of some $5,000 and the owner paid the bill. Of course this cannot affect defendant in the slightest degree.</p>
