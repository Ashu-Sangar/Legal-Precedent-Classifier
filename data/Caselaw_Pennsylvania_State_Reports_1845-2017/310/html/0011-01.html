Reading thus far in the will, we are still without doubt as to her intentions, because, with the death of the last child, the only provisions of the will not carried out are the $1,000 annuities to the grandchildren, and the principal sums of $25,000 to be appointed by them to their children and grandchildren.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b40-7" data-blocks='[["BL_40.6",40,[240,1384,1158,477]]]'>“This conclusion is based on a consideration of the will as a whole and the intention of the testatrix to dispose of her sole estate, whereas if the trusts for the payment of the $1,000 annuities continue, an intestacy, it is argued, will result with respect to the $25,000 sums in cases where a grandchild fails to exercise his power of appointment or is not survived by children or grandchildren; and furthermore, no disposition is made of the income in excess of the $1,000 annuities.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b40-8" data-blocks='[["BL_40.7",40,[238,1871,1156,361]]]'>“This intestacy would result, it is contended, because the only provision to be found in the will covering a final distribution of the principal of the estate is that which must be made upon the death of the surviving child, which event has now occurred, and in order to avoid intestacy, there should be a construction that the whole estate is now distributable.</blockquote>

The word ‘distributed7 in the latter part of this clause, referring to the rule against perpetuities, certainly looks to the future, as there could be no violation of the rule in a distribution upon the death of one of testatrix’s children.</blockquote>

This purpose has not been disturbed by any provision of the will, and I am unwilling to find that it has been affected by any omission of the testatrix. The great-grandchildren were as much objects of the bounty of the testatrix as were the grandchildren, and should not be cut off from their benefits.</blockquote>
