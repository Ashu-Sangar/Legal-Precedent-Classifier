Wallace died January 5,1927, bequeathing his 745 shares to his wife, who prior thereto owned 5 shares; three days later, she died, leaving next of kin, who, it is averred, then became entitled to the 750 Wallace shares. Hanna, one of plaintiffs, sues as administrator c. t. a. of both Wallace estates. Mrs. Wallace’s next of kin are also named as parties plaintiff. The bill avers that no distribution of said shares has been made to the beneficiaries who may be entitled. On November 15, 1929, Hanna, as administrator c. t. a. of both estates, the next of kin of Mrs. Wallace ahd their respective husbands or wives, executed a voting trust agreement assigning the Wallace shares and providing for the voting of those shares by Hanna and Howell as trustees. These trustees, and Howell, individually, are also parties plaintiff.</p>

As no other right to sue individually, appears, Howell is improperly joined in that capacity: Coatesville, etc., Ry. Co. v. West Chester Ry.
