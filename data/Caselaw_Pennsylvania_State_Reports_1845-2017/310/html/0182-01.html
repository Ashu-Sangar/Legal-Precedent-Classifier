As administratrix she filed the final account of her deceased mother as guardian of her husband’s estate. He died in 1931 and Mary was named as his executrix, and filed her first and final account.

They were that Bridgett, wife and guardian of Michael, did not treat the note as part of her husband’s estate when he became feeble minded; it was not inventoried nor accounted for by her in any of her accounts. Mary, her daughter, as administratrix of her mother did not account for the note though she knew her mother had it, nor did she later account for the note as executrix of her father’s estate.

There are, however, two other children of Michael who have taken appeals in this estate; they cannot be deprived of their interest through any misconduct by Mary. The testimony shows that the note was in the possession of Bridgett, wife of Michael, shortly after Michael became feeble minded. As stated above, the presumption would be that the note was legally in Michael’s possession; that complete delivery had been made when Michael was of sound mind; and that the note passed into the guardian’s custody. Unless appellee offers countervailing proof the requirement of delivery is satisfied, not only by the presumption arising from execution, but also from this evidence of possession by representatives of the estate.

The mere concealment of the note from the account or failure to collect from Patrick’s estate could be easily accounted for in a manner not to impugn the validity of the note. If the note had been in the possession of P. A. Killeen, and in some surreptitious manner came into the mother’s possession, or the daughter’s, and its use at the present time was to defeat the minor child of his estate, this use would be fraud of the worst type, but there is not a scintilla of such evidence in the case. The bare fact of concealment of the note does not of itself show fraud on the maker or his estate, but it would on the contrary have a decided effect as showing fraud on the estate or heirs of the payee.</p>

The record as now presented compels us to reverse the decree, but, as the court below mistakenly required the proponents of the note to prove consideration, which they failed to do, and then refused to consider the note for that reason without hearing evidence from the minor child’s representative showing its invalidity, an opportunity will be afforded for the presentation of evidence, if it exist, to show either no delivery in fact, failure of consideration, or any testimony affecting its integrity.</p>
