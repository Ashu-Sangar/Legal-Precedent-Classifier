    <p id="b148-5" data-blocks='[["BL_148.7",148,[288,624,1163,1351]]]'>By the Act of July 15, 1919, P. L. 963, amending section 3 of the Act of May 2, 1899, P. L. 184, it is provided that “the auditor general shall publish the mercantile appraisers’ list of names and classification of each person subject to license in not less than two nor more than three newspapers of general circulation published in the respective county, <em>one of which newspapers shall represent the minority party of the two principal parties of the county ” </em>Interpreting this to mean that the list could not legally be advertised in more than two “newspapers [which] shall represent the [majority] party” in a county; and that the italicized words above continued in force, although section 1204 of the Fiscal Code of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, hereinafter quoted, vested the duty of advertising the lists in the department of revenue, and did not contain those or any similar words, plaintiffs, as taxpayers, filed the bill in equity in this case, praying an injunction against payment for the advertisement of the lists in more than two newspapers representing the majority party in four specified counties, each of which had “a population of less than one million.” The court below disagreed with plaintiffs’ contention and dismissed their bill; whereupon they appealed. This disagreement raises the substantial question in the case.</p>

L. 440) expressly repeals certain named statutes (not including, however, the Act of July 15, 1919, supra) and further specifies that “All acts and parts of acts supplied by this act are hereby repealed. ......” It follows that if the section of the Act of July 15,1919, above quoted, is “supplied” by the Fiscal Code, that section is repealed thereby.</p>

This statement, however, has no relation to the present situation. What plaintiffs seek to do is to preserve a single clause of the Act of 1919, viz., the one requiring the auditor general, in making the advertisements, to publish them in one newspaper representing the minority party in the county. By the Fiscal Code, however, the auditor general has nothing to do with this advertising; that matter is dealt Avith entirely by the department of revenue, and no such restriction is placed upon it. All the other provisions of the Act of 1919 are retained, but this one is eliminated, the presumption being, therefore, that it was not intended to be continued.</p>
