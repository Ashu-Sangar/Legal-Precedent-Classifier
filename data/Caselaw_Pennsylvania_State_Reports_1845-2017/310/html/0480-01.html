The referee refused to allow compensation, for the reason that the accident resulted from a violation of Eule 29, article XII, of the Anthracite Mine Law, 1891, P. L. 176, inasmuch as claimant returned to the face of the mine in less than twelve hours after he had reason to believe a misfire had occurred in one of the holes in which high explosives were being discharged. The referee’s findings of fact and conclusions of law were sustained by the Workmen’s Compensation Board but reversed by the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County on tfye ground that claimant did not know he was returning to a misfire, and that his act was merely a negligent per<a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>formance of a duty in the course of his employment for which he was entitled to compensation. J Upon appeal to the Superior Court, the judgment of the court of qomm(on pleas was reversed and the order of the Workmen’s Compensation Board, affirming disallowance of compensation by the referee, reinstated and affirmed. The opinion of the Superior Court considered the validity of Buie 29 of article XII of the Act of June 2, 1891, supra, and determined it was not in violation of article II, section 1, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, as contended by plaintiff. The appeal before us. involves only the decision on that phase of the case.

It is a measure designed and enacted, primarily, to provide for the health and safety of persons employed in and about the anthracite coal mines. In conjunction with the Bituminous Mine Law it seeks to throw around the miners of coal in this State every safeguard and protection that is possible. It has been on our statute books for over forty years, and has been of incalculable benefit to those engaged in the hazardous occupation of mining coal. To destroy the safeguard and protection of this law in order to deal liberally in the allowance of compensation to a few men who were injured by failing to comply with its salutary provisions, would be a most short sighted policy, which should not be adopted unless required by the plain mandate of the Constitution. Fortunately, we do not feel compelled so to construe the law. <em>1</em>

To assert that a law is less than a law because it is made to depend on a future event or act, is to rob the legislature of the power to act wisely for the public welfare, whenever a law is passed relating to a state of affairs not yet developed, or to things future, and impossible to be fully known. What is more common than to appoint commissioners under a law to determine things upon the decision of which the act is to operate in one way or another? The courts exercise powers dependent on their own disci*etion. Take the case of granting a license to keep an <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>inn and sell liquor. The judge determines whether the license is necessary, and if not necessary, the law says to the applicant, “no license.” The law takes effect just as the judge determines, yet who says it is the court that legislates? Though contingent in form, the law is mandatory throughout in all it requires, and all it determines. That is not less an act of sovereign power, which says to the subject, do this, and that shall follow; do that, and another thing shall follow. To the subject a discretion of acting is given, and as he decides, the law pronounces the consequences. It is the sovereign which gives the law, not the subject. Then, the true distinction, I conceive, is this: The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law; but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend. To deny this would be to stop the' wheels of government. There are many things upon which wise and useful legislation must depend, which cannot be known to ¿he law-making power, and must, therefore, be a subject of inquiry and determination outside of the halls of legislation. Hence the necessity of the municipal divisions of the State into counties, townships, cities, wards, boroughs and districts, to which is committed the power of determining many matters necessary, or merely useful, to the local welfare. If a determining power cannot be delegated, then there can be no power delegated to city councils, commissioners, and the like, to pass ordinances, bydaws and resolutions in the nature of laws, binding and affecting both the persons and property of the citizens. If a determining power cannot be conferred by law, there can be no law that is not absolute, unconditional and peremptory; and nothing which is unknown, uncertain and contingent can be the subject of law.’ See also McGonnell’s License, <a href="/pa/209/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="209 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="936206" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0327-01">209 Pa. 327</a>; Wilkes-Barre v.
