Appellant urges that any default on the day fixed for payment was within the meaning of the bond though the rent was paid the following day or later, while appellee contends that “default” does not contemplate a mere failure to pay on the due day but means a default in the payment of any month’s rent which the surety is called on to pay.</p>

    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[285,926,1160,752]]]'>If a contract is ambiguous as to what shall constitute a default, strict enforcement of forfeiture for failure to give notice of any default should not be permitted. The bond provides that on default <em>immediate </em>notice in writing shall be given and if notice is not given thirty days after discovery then the bond shall be null and void. Here is an ambiguity as to when the notice shall be given: was it immediate or thirty days after failure to pay on the due date or thirty days after the landlord learned that the tenant did not intend to pay? When the interpretation of a contract is doubtful it is strictly construed against the party who used the ambiguous language: Coates v. Cotteral, <a href="/pa/290/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="290 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="1104475" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0237-01">290 Pa. 237</a>; Sunseri v.

J. 171. Bearing in mind that the law abhors forfeiture, this interpretation becomes more certain from the lease which the bond secured. The bond and the lease must be construed together as relating to the same matter. It is fair to presume the parties had in contemplation the liability incurred by- the primary instrument, the lease, and a .construction should be adopted <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>which effects that intention unless it does violence to the instruments involved. A principal should not be held liable beyond the precise terms of his contract. Under a strict literal interpretation of the bond, such as the surety urges, it would fail of its purpose, and this certainly was not the intention of the parties; unless immediate notice was given of a breach of one of the many covenants by lessee, no matter how trivial, the bond would be void. As stated above the lease and bond should have a reasonable interpretation consistent with all matters involved therein and the word “default” must be related to the lease in its entirety.</p>
    <p id="b243-3" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[230,996,1153,1015]]]'>The lease provides: “If any part of the rent shall be <em>in arrears' and </em>unpaid......then in any such case the rent for the entire unexpired part of the term...... shall at once become due and payable...... In case of a breach by lessee of any of the covenants......lessor may terminate this lease...... Upon the expiration or other determination of this lease, any attorney may appear for lessee in an amicable action of ejectment...... and......confess judgment...... If the rent...... shall not be paid promptly......any attorney...... may confess judgment......for the amount so owing or any parts thereof...... In case any one or more of the foregoing judgments shall be confessed...... In every suit or action......lessor shall have the right to recover an attorney’s commission of $50......

But if the surety was to be held liable for such default it must be notified thirty days after the particular default occurred, and if the landlord elected to consider <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>the rent for the balance of the term due, and so notified the surety, no further notice would be necessary, even though the rent was later received. “Acceptance of rent shall not be deemed a waiver.” The lease provided for judgments for any one or several defaults or failures to pay, with the implied right to cure the failure by payment of rent (Equitable Surety Co. v. Board of Comrs., <a href="/f/256/0773-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="256 F. 773" data-case-ids="6735074,6735106" data-case-paths="/f/256/0773-01,/f/256/0773-02">256 Fed. 773</a>); and default in the bond must be considered as related to the several defaults in the lease. A failure to pay on a particular date would then become an active default or breach within the meaning of the lease only when the lessor undertook to exercise his right thereunder and notified the surety of such default. The failure to pay on the due date does not necessarily visit extreme punishment on the lessee and he may thereafter pay if the landlord choses to receive it. It is manifest the parties did not intend that a default should consist merely in a failure to pay, but in a refusal to pay; each default stood alone, requiring notice to be given the surety of such default in thirty days if it was to be held.
