At the time of his arrest, appellant was on parole, having served <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>seven months of a sentence of three months to five years for a prior conviction in 1971 on charges of aggravated robbery. Counsel was appointed to represent Zuber in his murder trial and, following the denial of a pre-trial motion to suppress a confession, counsel entered into plea bargain negotiations with the assistant district attorney assigned to the case. The result of said negotiations was a promise by the Commonwealth to recommend a sentence of seven to fifteen years, and further, that the Commonwealth would join with defense counsel in a request to the State Board of Parole that the new sentence run <em>concurrently </em>with appellant’s “backtime” of four and one-half years. The assistant district attorney stated the terms of this agreement in open court, whereupon appellant entered a plea of guilty to murder generally. The court reiterated the terms of the agreement for the record and, accepting the Commonwealth’s recommendation, imposed a sentence of seven to fifteen years’ imprisonment.</p>

Furthermore, the fact that it was made known to the appellant on the record that such a request to the Parole Board in no way guaranteed the Board’s final decision vis-a-vis the “back time” owed is of no moment. <em>Commonwealth v.

It did not <em>guarantee </em>appellant a reduction in the length of time he would have to serve. The majority’s modification of the sentence, however, grants appellant such a reduction and, as a consequence, gives him more than the benefit of the bargain the majority purports to restore. In our view, the circumstances of this case entitle the appellant to no more than an opportunity to withdraw his plea. See <em>Santobello v.

(a) reduction in the length of time he [appellant] would have to serve,” is incorrect. Appellant pleaded guilty with the understanding that he would be <em>eligible </em>for parole after serving seven years of his prison sentence. Since back time owed must be served first and cannot be served concurrently with time under the new sentence, appellant in fact received a sentence under which he would not be eligible for parole until he had served eleven and one half years. Consequently, this remedy, remanding for the lower court to enter a new sentence of two and one half to fifteen years, will allow appellant to be eligible for parole after serving seven years. This remedy does not give appellant any more or less than that for which he bargained.</p>

Appellant’s post-conviction petition also raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim founded upon the mistaken advice given appellant by trial counsel concerning the authority of the Parole Board to run his “back time” concurrently with any new sentence imposed on the murder charge. In view of the disposition of this case, however, we find it unnecessary to reach the merits of that issue.</p>
