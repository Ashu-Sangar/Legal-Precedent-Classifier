After a review of the record it is clear that the court below was correct in concluding that the facts were insufficient to warrant a finding that Harold Mowris’ easement was lost by adverse possession. The only action by the appellants in Appeal No. 140 which supports their claim of adverse possession is that appellants planted some trees near the right of way. However, Mrs. Reed admitted that the trees were not planted for the purpose of obstructing the right of way and in fact did not do so. As the Chancellor and the court en banc found that was insufficient evidence to warrant a finding of adverse possession.</p>
