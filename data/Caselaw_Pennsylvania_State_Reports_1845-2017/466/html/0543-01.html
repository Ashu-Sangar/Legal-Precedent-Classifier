At that time, appellant’s counsel, who was also trial counsel, filed a brief with this Court. Appellant, Buford Dilbeck, pro se, also, submitted a brief challenging the effectiveness of his counsel’s assistance both at trial and in the then pending appeal. We agreed with appellant that his counsel’s appellate brief did not meet the requirements of <em>Anders v. California, </em><a href="/us/386/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="386 U.S. 738" data-case-ids="6182629" data-case-paths="/us/386/0738-01">386 U.S. 738</a>, <a href="/us/386/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="386 U.S. 738" data-case-ids="6182629" data-case-paths="/us/386/0738-01">87 S.Ct. 1396</a>, <a href="/us/386/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="386 U.S. 738" data-case-ids="6182629" data-case-paths="/us/386/0738-01">18 L.Ed.2d 493</a> (1967) and <em>Commonwealth v.

Since appellant had also raised the issue of the same counsel’s effective assistance at trial, we remanded the matter for the appointment of new counsel, unless waived by appellant on remand, and ordered new counsel, if appointed, to file a new brief and argue this appeal. <em>See Commonwealth v. Dilbeck, </em><a href="/pa/455/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="455 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="582310" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0113-01">455 Pa. 113</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20505" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="314 A.2d 505">314 A.2d 505</a> (1974).

Appellant contends that the trial court’s pre-plea examination was deficient since it failed to elicit the information required by the Rule which was in effect at the time of the plea.
