The court provided the defense with extra peremptory challenges and advised counsel that wide latitude would be permitted during the remainder of the voir dire to allow them to fully explore the issue.

The deceased also indicated to her relatives that she had been frequently beaten by appellant. Further evidence of the disharmony was shown in a note left by the deceased for appellant.

(2) The trial court may promptly correct the asserted error. With the issue properly presented, the trial court is more likely to reach a satisfactory result thus obviating the need for appellate review on this issue. Or if a new trial is necessary, it may be granted by the trial court without subjecting both the litigants and the courts to the expense and delay inherent in appellate review. (3) Appellate courts will be free to more expeditiously dispose of the issues properly preserved for appeal. Finally, the exception requirement will remove the advantage formerly enjoyed by the unprepared trial lawyer who looked to the appellate court to compensate for his trial omissions.’ ”</blockquote>

Thus, a “trial ruling has been made.” By objecting immediately following the close of the argument, the trial court could have “promptly correct [ed] the asserted error” by making specific cautionary instructions to the jury or by ordering a mistrial. There is no allegation that appellant’s counsel was “unprepared.” Thus, none of the rationales of <em>Clair </em>are applicable.</p>

Moreover, the majority’s new <em>Clair </em>rule makes it necessary for defense counsel to object as the district attorney’s prejudicial remarks are being uttered in order to preserve an objection. Such a procedure could seriously disrupt the trial with no gain in either the quality or the effectiveness of the proceeding. Further, the full prejudicial nature of the closing remarks may not be immediately recognizable through no fault of counsel because they may be cumulative in nature.</p>

Objections raised immediately following a district attorney’s closing argument afford sufficient timely notice for the trial court to rule on and to correct the claimed error. Such objections preclude an imposition of a waiver.</p>

I cannot agree, however, that the means utilized was proper without the consent of the parties or that the defendant may not have been prejudiced. The Court’s opinion recognizes that “the inherent dangers [of the device here employed] outweigh the possible benefits to be derived therefrom.” Opinion of the Court, <em>ante </em>at 414. That being so, I see no alternative to awarding a new trial, and I therefore dissent from the order of affirmance.</p>
