The City filed preliminary objections alleging that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was an indispensable party to the lawsuit, and its failure to be joined divested the Court of Common Pleas of jurisdiction. The preliminary objections were dismissed and an appeal was taken by the board to the Commonwealth Court. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the Court of Common Pleas, holding that the Commonwealth was not an indispensable party and, therefore, need not be joined. See <em>Ross v. Keitt, </em>10 Pa. Cmwlth. 375, <a href="/citations/?q=308%20A.2d%20906" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="308 A.2d 906">308 A.2d 906</a> (1973).

The Commonwealth Court, in an opinion and order by President Judge Bowman, held that since the Commonwealth was not an indispensable party under the Commonwealth Court’s previous decision in the case, the Commonwealth was not a true “party” defendant within the meaning of § 401(a) (1); that the case should be heard in the Court of Common Pleas; and that the case should be transferred back to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. The Commonwealth then filed papers in this court entitled “Appeal from an Order of the Commonwealth Court”.</p>
