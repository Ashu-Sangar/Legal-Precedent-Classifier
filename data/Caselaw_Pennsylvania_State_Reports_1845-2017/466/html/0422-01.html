    <p class="author" id="b453-8" data-blocks='[["BL_453.8",453,[260,965,313,34]]]'>PER CURIAM:</p>
    <p id="b453-9" data-blocks='[["BL_453.9",453,[212,1029,1152,149]]]'>Appellant was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life in prison. This appeal followed denial of post-verdict motions.</p>
    <p id="b453-10" data-blocks='[["BL_453.10",453,[209,1220,1154,528]]]'> Appellant contends (1) that certain pre-trial statements made by him were improperly elicited from a defense witness during cross-examination by the prosecution; (2) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a verdict of murder in the first degree; and (3) that the prosecution acted unfairly in seeking a verdict of murder in the first degree, because some of appellant’s co-defendants were prosecuted for murder in the second degree. We have examined the issues raised and conclude that they are without merit.</p>
    <p id="b453-11" data-blocks='[["BL_453.11",453,[255,1773,621,38]]]'>Judgment of sentence affirmed.</p>
