As a result of this beating, Miss Payne was hospitalized for four days. At the time of her admission, she complained of sleepiness, headache and general lethargy. The admitting physician testified that he observed that she had bruises below and behind her right eye, tenderness behind her ear on the right side and bleeding into the white of her left eye. After it was determined that Miss Payne had not suffered a concussion, she was discharged from the <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>hospital. She was readmitted to the hospital on or about May 23, 1973, in a semi-comatose state. On May 27,1973 she was examined by a neuro-surgeon, Dr. Steven Malina, who, following various tests, determined that she was afflicted with a subdural hematoma, or thick blood clot, on the right frontal portion of the brain. An operation was performed on that date to remove the clot. Despite the operation, Peggy Payne died on June 26, 1973 from complications resulting from the hematoma.</p>

    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[231,1124,1156,1066]]]'>There is no dispute that the evidence was sufficient to establish that on May 5, 1973, the appellant did strike Peggy Payne in the head. The only testimony specifically directed to the issue of causation came from Dr. Malina. He testified that “I would classify that hematoma with reasonable medical certainty to be old two to three weeks without doubt.” This conclusion was based upon his examination of Miss Payne on May 27, 1973. On cross-examination, Dr. Malina amended the time span within which he believed the hematoma could have developed by saying it might be “[a] day or 2 earlier, day or two later.” Using this testimony as a guide, the hematoma he observed on May 27 could be said to date from between May 4 and May 15, 1973. The date of the beating by appellant, May 5, 1973 thus falls within that time frame. Given this evidence and the fact that those blows were severe enough to cause Miss Payne’s immediate hospitalization, the jury could justifiably conclude that the blows administered by appellant were the cause of the subdural hematoma.</p>

For that proposition, appellant relies upon two cases decided by this Court: <em>Commonwealth v. Radford, </em><a href="/pa/428/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="428 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1912429" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0279-01">428 Pa. 279</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=236%20A.2d%20802" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="236 A.2d 802">236 A.2d 802</a> (1968) and <em>Commonwealth v. Embry, </em><a href="/pa/441/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="441 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1933861" data-case-paths="/pa/441/0183-01">441 Pa. 183</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=272%20A.2d%20178" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="272 A.2d 178">272 A.2d 178</a> (1971). Our holding in both those cases was that where in a homicide trial the only evidence of causation is the testimony of a medical expert, that testimony must establish the link between the act of the defendant and the death of the victim beyond a reasonable doubt. In <em>Radford, </em>we affirmed the granting of a motion in arrest of judgment where the physician who performed the autopsy on the victim was able to testify only that “the defendant’s assault on the deceased <em>probably </em>caused the death.” <a href="/pa/428/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="428 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1912429" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0279-01">428 Pa. at 281</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=236%20A.2d%20802" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="236 A.2d 802">236 A.2d at 803</a>. Similarly, we reversed the judgment of sentence in <em>Embry </em>because the forensic pathologist “was only able to reconstruct the chain of causation with a ‘reasonable degree of medical certainty.’ ” 441 Pa. at 185, 272 A.2d at 179. The thrust of appellant’s argument is that because only Dr. Malina’s testimony was specifically directed towards the issue of causation and because he was unwilling or unable to say even with a “reasonable degree of medical certainty” that the blows struck by Ilgenfritz were the cause of Peggy Payne’s death, <em>a fortiori, </em>his testimony was insufficient to prove causation.</p>
    <p id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[260,1668,1154,522]]]'>Appellant reads the cited cases too broadly. While it is true, of course, that the Commonwealth must prove causation, like every element of a crime, beyond a reasonable doubt, it does not follow that only medical testimony can prove causation, or that any medical testimony which is relied upon by the Commonwealth must be framed specifically in terms of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.

There was testimony by Peggy’s parents that in the early evening hours of May 5, 1973, she went to her mother’s home complaining that she had been struck on the head by the appellant. She was admitted to the hospital on that date <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>experiencing symptoms — drowsiness and headache— which, according to the testimony of Dr. Malina, were consistent with a diagnosis that she had suffered a subdural hematoma. Following Peggy Payne’s readmission to the hospital on May 23, 1973, it was determined by the doctor that she, in fact, had suffered such a hematoma. The pathologist who later performed an autopsy upon the victim’s body testified that in his opinion her death was directly attributable to the effects of the hematoma. Dr. Malina testified that the hematoma was of traumatic origin. His further testimony as to the time span within which the hematoma developed encompassed the date of Ilgenfritz’ attack on Peggy Payne. The doctor also gave it as his opinion that if Miss Payne had suffered another blow from another source sufficient in magnitude to cause the hematoma, she would have sought medical attention. Because she did not seek such assistance, the jury could justifiably conclude that no such other blow took place and that the blows struck by Ilgenfritz were the cause.</p>

As noted above, Dr. Malina had testified that had Miss Payne suffered blows other than those struck by appellant severe enough to have caused the subdural hematoma she would have sought medical assistance. Mrs. Whetzel according to the offer of proof, would have testified that Peggy Payne did express to her an intention to see a physician and also explained why she did not do so. This evidence was certainly relevant, and we cannot say that the error in excluding it was harmless. Accordingly, appellant is entitled to a new trial.</p>
