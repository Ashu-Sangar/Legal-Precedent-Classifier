Shortly after breakfast on the fatal day, Scoggins sought Edinger out in his cell and there stabbed him six times. Edinger, screaming, broke away from Scoggins and fled from the cell. Scoggins closely pursued him with a sharpened butter knife poised above his head. The victim found sanctuary in a control room where Scoggins was finally subdued by a prison guard and several inmates. Edinger died six days later as a result of these wounds.</p>

Rather, his position at trial was that he did so in self-defense. He testified that he went to Edinger’s cell at Edinger’s request; that once he was in the cell Edinger subjected him to verbal abuse, pulled a knife from under a blanket and initiated an attack resulting in several cuts on Scoggins’ arm; that Scoggins repelled this attack by a kick <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>which caused Edinger to drop the knife and fall to his knees; that Scoggins then seized the knife and when Edinger renewed his assault, this time by attempted strangulation, appellant stabbed Edinger six times in self-defense. This account was corroborated by the testimony of a fellow inmate, one James A. Murray, who was characterized by Scoggins as a “former partner”.</p>

In the instant case the jury could have reasonably decided to discount the testimony of the defense witnesses and could have concluded that when Scoggins wielded the knife against Edinger, he did so with a specific intent to kill. Both Scoggins’ knife-wielding pursuit of Edinger, and the discrepancies in his story developed by the Commonwealth would amply support this conclusion. Accordingly, we find no merit in appellant’s sufficiency of the evidence challenge.</p>

The statute which sets forth this offense, requires, as a necessary element, a showing by the Commonwealth that the accused “has been sentenced to imprisonment for life.” The necessary consequence of meeting this element is an exposure of the jury to the fact that the defendant had previously been convicted of a criminal act sufficiently heinous to warrant the imposition of a life sentence. Appellant does not challenge this exposure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Instead, he argues that while evidence of his life sentence was properly admitted, the additional fact that the sentence was being served for a conviction of murder in the <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>first degree was not necessary to establish the statutory element and, therefore, should have been excluded by the trial judge.</p>

We do not deal here with a situation where the challenged evidence alerts the jury to a prior criminal act of the accused. Rather, the evidence in question was presented to a jury <em>already </em>exposed to the fact that the defendant had been convicted of a crime of the most egregious sort.

Appellant’s argument, however, misperceives the rule that governs the admissibility of an alleged murder weapon in this Commonwealth. Positive testimony that the weapon in question is the actual murder weapon is not required prior to its introduction into evidence; rather, the Commonwealth need only lay a sufficient foundation to justify an inference of the weapon’s use in the course of the crime. <em>Commonwealth v.

Here such a foundation was laid; the knife in question was identified as the murder weapon by at least two eyewitnesses; it was discovered in the yard outside a nearby cell shortly after the knifing; and, when discovered the knife was covered with fresh blood of the same type as that of the victim. Taking this evidence as a whole, we conclude that an adequate foundation was laid for the introduction of the knife.</p>
