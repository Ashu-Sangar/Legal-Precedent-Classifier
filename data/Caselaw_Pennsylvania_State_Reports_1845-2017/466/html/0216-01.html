Paul Fisher suffered a gunshot wound of the knee in the same incident and following the injury made his way to Graduate Hospital. About 4:30 p. m. Fisher was questioned by a Philadelphia police detective, while he was lying on a stretcher in the hallway of the hospital, as to how he <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>was shot. Fisher said nothing inculpatory but his explanation of how he was shot included inconsistencies. The detective then phoned police headquarters and was told of the Clanton homicide. Shortly thereafter, Fisher was taken to a ward in the hospital and when “several gang boys” attempted to enter the ward, a police guard was placed at the door. About 7 p. m. Fisher was again questioned by the same detective for <em>“a </em>few minutes” about how he suffered the gunshot wound.</p>

When the detective told Fisher one Warren Sexton had been named as “the shooter of Robert Clanton,” Fisher said, “Warren Sexton wasn’t there at all.” The detective then said, “Well, if you know Warren Sexton wasn’t there, then you must know more about what happened — You must know who was there.” Fisher replied, “Well, Warren Sexton wasn’t there. He didn’t shoot him. I did.” For the first time Fisher was then given the warnings required by <em>Miranda v.

The questions and answers were recorded in handwriting by the detective.

An evidentiary hearing ensued wherein the only witness was the police detective who questioned Fisher on three occasions in the hospital. The detective’s testimony is the source of the circumstances of Fisher’s questioning set out as facts above. At the conclusion of the testimony, the hearing judge entered an order suppressing all evidence of Fisher’s inculpatory statements concerning the Clanton killing.

A police guard was at Fisher’s hospital door continuously for forty-eight hours before he incriminated himself. He had been questioned on three separate occasions by the police detective. The third period of questioning was directed to the Clanton homicide. The initial self-incrimination came after the interrogating officer suggested, “[I]f you know Warren Sexton wasn’t there, then you must know more about what happened . . . .” When these circumstances are considered in totality, it can hardly be said that the detective’s conduct and questioning was of a neutral nature and not expected to evoke admissions against Fisher’s interest.</p>

In my view, Fisher was neither under arrest, subject to custodial interrogation, nor the focus of the investigation at the time he confessed to the slaying. Rather as I read the facts, the confession in the hospital on July 24 was uttered in response to a question posed by the police to Fisher as a possible witness as part of an investigatory fact-finding process, Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Bordner, <a href="/pa/432/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="432 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1919662" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0405-01">432 Pa. 405</a>, 411, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20612" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="247 A.2d 612">247 A.2d 612</a>, 615 (1968). Indeed, the record of the hearing below indicates that the police questioned Fisher on July 24 in an effort to corroborate information they had that one <em>Warren Sexton </em>had committed the slaying. Under these facts, I can only conclude that Fisher was being interrogated to determine whether he had any information relevant to the homicide, not whether he committed it.</p>

The record below indicates that the guard was placed by Fisher’s door to <em>protect </em>Fisher from “gang boys” who were trying to find him. While under some circumstances the presence of such a police guard might be misunderstood and translated into a reasonable belief that freedom of movement is being restricted, such is not the case here. There is absolutely no indication in the record that Fisher thought that he was under a restrictive rather than protective guard, or, even more significantly, that he was under a guard at all. Under these facts, I do not see how it can be said that Fisher entertained a reasonable belief that his movement was <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>being restricted.
