On April 24, 1972, Frumento advised his employer that he would miss work the next day, which was primary election day.

In citing an example of a situation that could properly be considered as “truly involuntary”, the employer suggests one where an employee’s absence is as a result of compliance with a legal subpoená.

Thus, not only must we look to the employee’s reason for non-compliance we must also evaluate the reasonableness of the request in light of all of the circumstances.

The rationale upon which this concept of good cause was developed was that where the action of the employee is justifiable or reasonable under the circumstances it can not be considered wilful misconduct since it can not properly be charged as a wilful disregard of the employer’s intents or rules or the standard of conduct the employer has a right to expect. <em>Crib Diaper Service v.

If the nature of the employee’s undertaking (judge of election) was inimical to the employer’s interest, he was provided ample opportunity to request that Frumento relinquish this responsibility. Having waited until the day before the primary election, when the question was again raised by the employee, to issue the directive in question appears to have been an unreasonable approach. Further, the employer first conditioned his approval of the absence upon whether the work load would allow the loss of the employee’s services for the day. The refusal, however, was predicated upon the absence of other employees <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>and not an increase in the volume of the normal work load.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

However, he was not here discharged for the acceptance of the office without prior approval of the employer. Most significantly, when apprised of the fact of Frumento’s election to this office, the employer did not either order or suggest that he consider resigning. Having once undertaken the responsibilities of an election official he was subject to the same obligation as all others in his category by virtue of § 3548 regardless of the circumstances under which he assumed office. The degree of compulsion mandated by § 3548 upon one subject to its provisions is in no way alleviated because of a voluntary assumption of this responsibility.</p>
