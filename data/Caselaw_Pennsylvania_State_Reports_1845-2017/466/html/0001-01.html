Felmlee and Felmlee Enterprises, Inc., filed a complaint in equity to enjoin the appellants, Larry L. Lockett and Lockett Industries from using certain formula, processes and molds pertaining to the manufacture of soft fishing lures, alleging that they were trade secrets. After holding lengthy hearings, the chancellor concluded that appellees’ lures were manufactured by use of a secret process, formula and mold giving the lures unique form, color, structure and soft texture which appellants used in contravention of their duty of nondisclosure arising from their confidential relationship with the appellees.</p>

In 1954, he set up a family operated business which eventually became Felmlee Enterprises, Inc. Felmlee Enterprises, Inc., operates out of Lewistown, Pennsylvania and is engaged in the manufacture of fishing lures. Through John Felmlee’s efforts, Felmlee Enterprises, Inc., began to produce soft fishing lures which were of a different chemical composition and design from those on the market. In recognition of these <em>design differences </em>the United States Patent Office issued a patent to John Felmlee in 1957, covering four <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>different patentable ideas which go into the design of any Felmlee lure.</p>

Through a process of experimentation with plastics and other additives, John Felmlee was able to produce a secret chemical formula for soft plastic which gives his lures unique qualities such that the Felmlee lure has a soft texture and natural fish coloring that will not scale off. Although the separate ingredients for the formula can be purchased on the open market, it is the proper proportion of such ingredients in relation to each other which give Mr. Felmlee’s soft plastic lures their unique characteristics. John Felmlee never sought any patent protection for his chemical formula for soft plastic.</p>

According to appellee, John Felmlee, he told Mr. Lockett the secret chemical formula for soft plastic lures sometime after Mr. Lockett began to work for Walter. Apparently, this was done in the normal course of the business to enable Mr. Lockett to better function as plant manager.
