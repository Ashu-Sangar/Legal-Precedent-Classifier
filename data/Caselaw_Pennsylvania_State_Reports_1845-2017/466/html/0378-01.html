Consequently, it was clear that the “payment of debts and charges” was to take place before any distributive shares were determined. Section 2508(b) of the Wills Act of 1947, however, contains no reference to the Intestate Act of 1917.

It is true that this Court has recognized that taking against the will under Section 2508 was not the same as taking by intestacy. <em>Id. </em>at 30, n. 10, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20730" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="318 A.2d 730">318 A. 2d at 734, n. 10</a>. Because we recognize a difference between Section 2508 and the Intestacy Act, however, does not mean that the spouse’s elective share should not bear the burden of administrative expenses. In <em>Neamand Estate, </em>we held that the surviving spouse who took against the will could have the benefit of some of the will’s provisions. Thus, we allowed her the benefit of a provision stating that her share of the estate, whether passing under the will or not, was to be free of the burden of paying taxes because it was an administrative provision and not a bequest which she had renounced by taking against <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>the will. In doing so the Court stated: “The statute does not mandate that the fractional share be arrived at after taxes are deducted, or that the elective share can never be taken tax free.” <em>Id. </em>at 26, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20730" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="318 A.2d 730">318 A.2d at 733</a>. Appellant contends that this statement means that her fractional share does not have to be computed after administrative expenses are deducted. This is true, but unlike <em>Neamand Estate, </em>the testator here left no administrative direction that she was to take her share, either under the will or against it, free of administrative expenses.</p>
