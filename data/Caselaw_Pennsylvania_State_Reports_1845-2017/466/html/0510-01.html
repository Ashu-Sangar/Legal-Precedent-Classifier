Although he stated that the fire could have been started accidentally, he testified that, based on his investigation of over 1,000 fires, the fire was probably incendiary because the usual causes of accidental fires were not present.</p>

In <em>Leslie, </em>the fire marshall found “a mass rubble of charred remains at the building.” He could give no testimony concerning the cause of the fire other than his feeling that “it was other than an accidental fire.” The Commonwealth offered no other evidence to establish the corpus delicti. Here, an expert on the causes of fires positively eliminated the most frequent causes of accidental fires.</p>

Appellant also alleges that the credibility of the police officer who took his confession was so damaged that it was unbelievable. However, he bases this contention on testimony at the preliminary hearing, which was not presented at trial. The record shows that the officer’s credibility was not seriously challenged at trial; in any case, the credibility of witnesses is within the province of the trier of fact. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rose, </em><a href="/pa/463/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="463 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1708024" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0264-01">463 Pa. 264</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="463 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1708024" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0264-01">344 A.2d 824</a> (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em><a href="/pa/448/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="448 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="1944731" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0258-01">448 Pa. 258</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=293%20A.2d%2033" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="293 A.2d 33">293 A.2d 33</a> (1972).</p>
