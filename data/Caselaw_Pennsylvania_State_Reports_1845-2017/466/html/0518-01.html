On August 31, 1930, appellee, Edward Henry, was born to appellee, Mary Mathis and one “Francis Henry,” whom the appellees claim is the deceased. On April 18, 1931, Traverse Henry married Mary Mathis. There is no evidence to indicate an intervening divorce between the deceased and his first wife. The record is clear, however, that Ella Mae Vontress did not die until September 23, 1968. On March 20, 1933 a son, Robert Henry, was born to the deceased and Mary Mathis. Robert Henry died on June 11, 1973, survived by two daughters, Stella Henry and Rishell Henry, also appellees in this action. The appellants, Florence Henry Brown, Virginia H. Greenwood and Charles Henry, are the sisters and brother of the deceased.</p>
