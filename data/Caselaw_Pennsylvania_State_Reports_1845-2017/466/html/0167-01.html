Wigmore defines relevancy as, “None but facts having rational probative value are admissible.” 1 Wigmore, Evidence § 9-10 at 289-95 (3rd ed. 1940). McCormick suggests the following for determining relevancy, “. . . [d] oes the evidence offered render the <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>desired inference more probable than it would be without the evidence? . . . Relevant evidence, then, is evidence that in some degree advances the inquiry, and thus has probative value, and is prima facie admissible.” McCormick, Evidence § 185 at 437-438 (2nd ed. 1972). <em>We have </em>accepted these basic definitions. <em>Commonwealth v. Lippert, </em><a href="/pa/454/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="454 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="579873" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0381-01">454 Pa. 381</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20586" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="311 A.2d 586">311 A.2d 586</a> (1973).</p>

Stafford, supra; Commonwealth v. Haideman, supra. </em>Therefore, it is clear that evidence that appellant sought to confer with counsel is not relevant on the issue of appellant’s guilt or innocence.

This situation is clearly distinct from those instances where such an objection is sustained. In the latter cases, counsel must move for a mistrial and thereby inform the court of the client’s position that even though the court has sustained his objection, sufficient error remains to warrant a mistrial. In situations like the instant case, however, it would be futile to move for a mistrial after the trial judge has just overruled one’s objection and admitted the complained of evidence. By overruling the objection the court has, in effect, ruled that the evidence is admissible and appropriate. Given this ruling it would be a vain act to make a perfunctory motion for a mistrial. In <em>Commonwealth v. Stafford, supra, </em>there is no indication that appellant made a motion for a mistrial after objecting to the prosecutor’s closing remarks and <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>yet we considered his claim. Therefore, I see no reason in precedent or logic to demand in the instant case that a futile perfunctory motion for a mistrial be made. Such a demand can only result in one more needless disruption of an orderly and efficient trial.</p>
