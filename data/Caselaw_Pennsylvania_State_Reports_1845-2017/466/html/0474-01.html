The argument continued in the apartment. When decedent went into the kitchen to place a telephone call, appellant followed her and frustrated the attempt by striking her. They returned to the livingroom. Appellant shouted that decedent and her children were taking advantage of him and went to a closet to obtain a pocket knife. Decedent’s sons attempted to keep appellant and decedent apart but failed. Appellant swung the knife at decedent, she grabbed his arm, and they fell to the floor where appellant repeatedly swung the knife at decedent in an at<a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>tempt to stab her. There was no evidence that any of these blows struck decedent. Decedent’s sons again attempted to separate them. One of the sons obtained a second knife and wounded appellant in the back. Appellant regained his feet and stabbed the son who had wounded him. This son fled into the hallway of the house, decedent followed him, and appellant pursued them both. In the hallway, the son saw appellant stab his mother in the chest. Two stab wounds of the thorax were the cause of death.</p>
