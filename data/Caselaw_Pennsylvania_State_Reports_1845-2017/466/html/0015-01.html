Specifically, he contends this deficiency resulted from the fact that his plea was accepted in the face of an affirmative defense, that the elements of the offense were never explained to him and that certain rights attendant upon a jury trial were inadequately explained. Since we agree with appellant’s first contentions, we need not reach the merits of his final claim.</p>

During the course of this dialogue, no attempt was made to elicit specifically from appellant those acts surrounding the shooting which he intended to admit by the entry of the plea other than the single unchallenged fact that he fired the shot which caused the death of Mr. Andrews. The record contains the following questions and answers which represent the entire information ascertained as to those acts to which appellant admitted responsibility prior to the acceptance of the plea.</p>

    <p id="b52-9" data-blocks='[["BL_52.9",52,[269,828,1150,585]]]'>I agree that the guilty plea colloquy which preceded the trial court’s acceptance of appellant’s plea of guilty was inadequate under the standards prevailing at the time the plea was entered. I am also of opinion that the Court properly reaches the merits of appellant’s challenge to his guilty plea, despite the fact that no petition to withdraw the plea was filed in the trial court. See my concurring opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Rodgers, </em><a href="/pa/465/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="465 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1712697" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0379-01">465 Pa. 379</a>, 386, <a href="/pa/465/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="465 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1712697" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0379-01">350 A.2d 815</a> (1974). Accordingly, I concur in the reversal of the judgment of sentence and in the remanding of the case for a new trial.</p>
