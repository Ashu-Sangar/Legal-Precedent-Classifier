Firing, plaintiff-appellant in this action, was reelected District Justice of the Peace for Magisterial District 38-2-01, and in January, 1970, he began to serve his new term. His seventieth birthday occurring on September 29, 1973, however, he was mandatorily retired, as required by Article V, Section 16(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. He subsequently filed a complaint in mandamus in the Commonwealth Court against the State Court Administrator and the Treasurer of the Commonwealth alleging that he had been elected to a six-year term of office which did not expire until January 1, 1976, and that Article V, Section 16(a) of the Constitution provides that the compensation of justices, judges, and justices of the peace shall not be diminished during their terms of office unless by law applying to all salaried officers of the Commonwealth; he asked that defendants [appellees] be ordered to pay the salary allegedly due him for the period subsequent to his retirement, which they had refused to pay. Appellees filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and the Commonwealth Court, with one judge dissenting, sustained the preliminary objections. See <em>Firing v. Kephart, </em>18 Pa.Cmwlth. 578, <a href="/citations/?q=336%20A.2d%20470" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="336 A.2d 470">336 A.2d 470</a> (1975).

By demurring to appellant’s complaint in the instant case, appellees admitted as true the facts that appellant had been elected to the office of District Justice and that he served in that capacity until his mandatory retirement upon attaining the age of seventy, but they did not admit that his term was one of six years, since the extent of that term was a conclusion of law dependent upon the legal interpretation of the Constitutional requirement that justices of the peace be retired upon attaining the age of seventy.</p>

The role of the court in ruling on preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer is to determine whether or not the facts pleaded are legally sufficient to permit the action to continue. This is so whether the legal determination to be made is relatively simple or relatively difficult. Cf. <em>Schott v.

There was no factual dispute in this case, only a dispute over the interpretation of the Constitution, and the ruling on appellees’ preliminary objections was clearly the appropriate juncture for the Commonwealth Court to interpret the pertinent provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution and determine the merits of appellant’s claim. Our task on appeal is to determine whether the court’s interpretation was correct.</p>

The applicable statute there specifically limited the terms of such judges and stated that they would expire on “the last day of December next after he shall be seventy years of age”; an elected judge was required to file “a certificate, stating his age, and the time when his official term will expire, <em>either by completion of a full term, or by reason of the disability of age.” </em>[Emphasis supplied.] The Pennsylvania Constitution, however, is <em>not </em>so specific.

Article V, Section 13(b) provides that “a vacancy in the office of justice, judge or justice of the peace shall be filled by appointment by the Governor.” It further provides that “The person so appointed shall serve for an initial term ending on the first Monday of January following the next municipal election more than ten months after the vacancy occurs.” It has been held that under this section a vacancy occurs when the incumbent of a judicial office dies, resigns, <em>retires, </em>or is removed, <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>or when his term of office ends. <em>Creamer v.

It plainly would be anomalous to construe the Constitution in a case like the present one as permitting two persons filling two separate terms to occupy the same office at the same time.

We are not so persuaded. Rather, it seems clear to us from the language of Section 16(b) that the framers intended to authorize — not require — the legislature to compensate those members of the judiciary who have retired, and to forbid it to compensate those who have been suspended or removed for misconduct pursuant to Article V, Section 18 or Article VI.

Nor is it significant that the only retirement compensation actually provided a retired justice of the peace by law derives from his retirement benefits earned for prior service. The language of Section 16(a) — “Justices, judges and justices of the peace <em>shall be compensated by the Commonwealth as provided by law” </em>[Emphasis supplied] — is clearly different from the language of Sec<a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>tion 16(b) — “Former and retired justices, judges and justices of the peace <em>shall receive such compensation as shall be provided by law.” </em>[Emphasis supplied.] The former appears to mandate compensation for active members of the judiciary, while the latter appears to make it discretionary with regard to retired members. Section 16(b) cannot therefore be construed as requiring that mandatorily retired justices of the peace be compensated for the unserved balance of a regular term pursuant to Section 16(a).</p>

Section 16(c) not only does not apply to retired justices of the peace, but it plainly indicates that the power of a retired justice or judge on temporary judicial service does <em>not </em>depend upon an unexpired regular term, but only upon his status as a former or retired justice or judge and the applicable rule of the Supreme Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

The majority opinion in the Commonwealth Court held that this occurred on appellant’s seventieth birthday and that his term expired on that date, September 29, 1973.
