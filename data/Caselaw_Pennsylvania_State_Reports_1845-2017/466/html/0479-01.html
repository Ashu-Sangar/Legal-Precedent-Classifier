There we held that once appellant showed he was institutionalized as incompetent at the time he admitted involvement in the crime, the burden shifted to the Commonwealth to prove competency. The Court held that the Commonwealth had not met its burden of proving appellant competent when he made the admissions sought to be used in evidence.</p>

It did not involve the test for determining the competency of a witness; nor did it alter the longstanding rule in the Commonwealth that the burden of proving a witness incompetent rests upon the party opposing admission of the testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ware, </em><a href="/pa/459/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="459 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="480994" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0334-01">supra,</a> <a href="/pa/459/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="459 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="480994" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0334-01">459 Pa. at 352</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="459 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="480994" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0334-01">329 A.2d at 267</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.

Moreover, even if appellant’s evidence had been sufficient to shift the burden to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth’s evidence satisfactorily supported the trial court’s determination that the witness was competent to testify.</p>
