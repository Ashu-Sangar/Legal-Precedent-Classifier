The action was instituted against James D. Barger, the Commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police Department, and the individual members of the Court-Martial Board. The court-martial proceeding had been instituted by the Commissioner for the purpose of <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>considering certain improprieties allegedly committed by Dussia in the performance of his duties.

Appellant first asserts that his constitutional right to a fair hearing will be denied if the court-martial proceedings are permitted to continue because of the Commissioner’s bias against him. The testimony pertaining to this point focused upon the content of a telephone conversation between the Commissioner and appellant. Although appellant’s version of the conversation would tend to indicate that the Commissioner was biased against him, the Commonwealth Court found the Commissioner’s representations to the contrary more credible. The court below concluded that Barger’s statements were “only an effort to apprise the appellant that there was evidence against him and to suggest that resignation should be considered.” They found that the record failed to establish that Barger had, in fact, formed an opinion as to appellant’s guilt or innocence and, therefore, could objectively perform his function. While the record presents a close question as to whose version is correct we believe the findings of fact made by the Commonwealth Court are supported by adequate evidence and, thus, will not be disturbed on appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
