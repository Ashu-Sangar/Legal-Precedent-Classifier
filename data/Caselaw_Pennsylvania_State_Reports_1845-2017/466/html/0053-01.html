Emmett Barrett was quickly apprehended by police following the church robbery. A .32 caliber handgun was recovered by police at that time. The other participant in the church robbery escaped capture. As a result of statements made by Barrett to police concerning the church robbery, a warrant for Coley’s arrest was issued for his participation in the church robbery.

Pursuant to this information, a federal warrant for Coley’s arrest was issued for flight to avoid prosecution. On November 30, 1973, Coley surrendered to federal authorities in Philadelphia. An arraignment was held in a federal magistrate’s court at which time the federal officials withdrew the federal charges against Coley. At that arraignment Coley had counsel, apparently supplied by federal officials.</p>

Coley was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings at this time and affirmatively indicated he understood his rights. He <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>expressed a willingness to answer questions but denied any involvement in the hotel robbery.

The first interview lasted for one hour and thirty minutes; the second interview, during which Coley incriminated himself, lasted one hour and ten minutes.

The trial court was apparently influenced by the fact that the instant case involved a delay of three hours and thirty-five minutes or a period approximating the four hour delay period in <em>Johnson, </em>supra. But the mere comparison of time periods is not a sufficient inquiry. The <em>Futch </em>rule has as its purpose the elimination of circumstances which are coercive in nature, including constant and prolonged interrogation. See <em>Commonwealth v. Young, </em><a href="/pa/460/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="460 Pa. 598" data-case-ids="482747" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0598-01">460 Pa. 598</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="334 A.2d 252" data-case-ids="482747,482847" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0598-01,/pa/460/0597-01">334 A.2d 252</a> (1975).

Thus, the <em>Futch </em>issue necessitates an examination of all the facts to determine what degree of coerciveness exists in any given case. This is not to say that the three-pronged inquiry outlined in <em>Commonwealth v.

But it is a mere formula designed to effectuate a purpose and only when the purpose of <em>Futch, </em>namely, to prevent an accused from being subjected to coercive influences and circumstances, is advanced will <em>Futch </em>be applied to suppress a confession.</p>

Such coercive circumstances which were the operative facts in the application of <em>Futch </em>in <em>Johnson </em>are not present here.

Our emphasis on the delay is merely a recognition of the fact that a delay in and of itself, if sufficiently long, when viewed in relationship to the accused, including such factors as age and intelligence, may cause a sufficient amount of psychological coercion to result in an involuntary confession.

Police and prosecutors, with us, are supposed to seek justice, of course, but we channel their zeal to the pursuit of evidence of guilt, and train them to rely on the defense to find and present to an impartial third party evidence of innocence. We rely on the collision between prosecution and defense to produce the just result. This adversary system may not be the best, the most efficient, or ultimately the most just. But the worst and most unjust system is assuredly a mixed one, an adversary system which weighs the scales, contrary to its fundamental premises, in favor of the prosecution.”</blockquote>
