On April 27, 1970, at 11:40 p. m., two Philadelphia police officers arrived at appellant’s home and arrested him in connection with a murder investigation of the slaying of David Fineman at Thirteenth and Diamond Streets. At 12:10 a. m. on April 28, 1970, appellant arrived at the Police Administration Building and shortly thereafter was informed that he was arrested for the murder of David Fineman and was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. At 12:30 a. m., appellant admitted participation in the shooting, and between 12:30 and 1:30 a. m., he was further interrogated as to the details of the murder. At approximately 2:30 a. m., appellant’s aunt, Lorraine King, was admitted to the interrogation room and spoke with appellant. Shortly thereafter the detective returned, again warned appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and proceeded to take his formal statement, which was substantially the same as his informal oral statement.</p>

It was the detectives’ failure to abide by Mrs. Roane’s assertion of her son’s constitutional rights prior to his formal statement which led this Court into a discussion of the validity of the waiver. The fact that the juvenile had made a prior oral statement implicating himself did not serve to remedy the later refusal to waive by Mrs. Roane, in light of the coercive circumstances under which the previous statement had been elicited. His later formal statement was a mere product of his earlier oral statement. The Court’s analysis considered the totality of circumstances relevant to the issue of admissibility of a confession.</p>

The consideration of whether a juvenile had an opportunity for friendly adult consultation prior to a waiver is one circumstance which increases in importance as the juvenile’s age decreases and the period of police questioning increases.</p>

    <p id="b180-4" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[265,911,1157,1296]]]'>The circumstances of the present case indicate that the admissibility of appellant’s confession turns on the validity of his waiver. There are no indicia of unreliability present in the instant case. Louis Stanton was almost seventeen years old. He was arrested in his mother’s presence on the charge of murder and she did not request to accompany her son to the homicide unit. Stanton appeared alert and responsive at all times prior to his waiver and confession. Stanton stated the police did not coerce or intimidate him in any way, factors which were clearly present and relevant in <em>McCutchen, Starkes, </em>and <em>Roane. </em>He had a tenth grade education. The <em>Miranda </em>warnings were read upon arrival at the homicide unit. Stanton stated he understood his rights and that he wanted to speak. Immediately following his answers to preliminary identification questions Stanton confessed to the crime, within fifteen minutes of his arrival at the homicide unit. Although Stanton did not have interested-adult guidance after his arrest and prior to his waiver, it appears from all of the facts that he did in fact validly waive his rights. His confession therefore should be admissible. The case law does not warrant or even support a different result. I therefore dissent.</p>

    <p id="b181-4" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[180,397,1151,1246]]]'>Like Mr. Chief Justice Jones, I believe that the voluntariness of a confession given by a juvenile suspected of a crime should be judged by the normal standard of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the waiver of constitutional rights which precedes the confession. Those circumstances will include the age of the suspect and whether opportunity for parental or friendly adult guidance was afforded; the latter factor, while significant, should not by itself be determinative of the voluntariness question. As I read the recent opinions of our Court, however, I cannot escape the conclusion that the majority of the Court has in fact adopted a <em>per se </em>rule that a minor cannot validly waive his constitutional rights without having had an opportunity to consult with a parent or other interested adult, who himself has been advised of the minor’s constitutional rights.
