    <p class="author" id="AHpB" data-blocks='[["BL_502.8",502,[328,1196,321,34]]]'>PER CURIAM:</p>
    <p id="b502-8" data-blocks='[["BL_502.9",502,[279,1259,1154,422]]]'>David Ash plead guilty to murder generally in Luzerne County. A degree of guilt hearing ensued and subsequently, a finding of guilt of murder in the first degree was entered by the court. One week later, no post trial motions having been filed, the court sentenced Ash to life imprisonment. A direct appeal from the judgment of sentence was then filed in this Court asserting certain errors in the prosecution process.</p>

The record fails to support the finding that Ash’s decision was knowing and intelligent.</p>
    <p id="b503-4" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[189,626,1154,692]]]'>The record does establish that before sentence was imposed, the court informed Ash of his right to file post trial motions and called his attention to the fact that no such motions had been filed. However, the court did not advise Ash that failure to file these motions would have a consequential effect on his right to appeal. Additionally, it is undisputed in the record that Ash’s trial counsel were of the opinion that since the conviction resulted from a guilty plea, no post trial motions were required to preserve errors for appellate review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It was after receiving this advice from his counsel that Ash decided not to file any post trial motions.

In order to preserve a claim of error for appellate review, it must initially be presented to the trial court for decision via post <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>trial motions, and this is so whether the conviction results from a trial or guilty plea. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em><a href="/pa/459/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="459 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="481057" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0589-01">459 Pa. 589</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="459 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="481057" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0589-01">330 A.2d 854</a> (1975). If the issue is not raised in the trial court in the manner described it is deemed waived. However, to constitute an effective waiver, the decision not to file post trial motions must be knowing and intelligent. <em>Commonwealth v.
