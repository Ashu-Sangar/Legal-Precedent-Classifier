The Public Defender was appointed to represent him in these proceedings. This is clearly in violation of our present rules of criminal procedure.

Although Webster alleged ten grounds in support of the prayer of the petition in addition to the alleged denial of his right to appeal in the proceedings below, he subsequently appealed the denial of relief to this Court raising only the issue of <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In an opinion decided May 22, 1974, this Court affirmed the ruling of the lower court as to this issue. <em>Commonwealth v.

II, § 202(1), 17 P.S. § 211.202(1) (Supp.1974-75). This procedure, however, omits a critical stage in the appeal process. As a result of the court’s order, there was no opportunity for filing, arguing and disposing of motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial by the trial court. The preferable procedure would have been to allow appellant the opportunity to file with the court below post-trial motions. However, in the interest of judicial economy, we will entertain this appeal at this time and treat the lower court’s denial of these specific grounds in its order in the post-conviction hearing proceeding as if it was in effect a denial of post-trial motions.</p>

Darryl was then age 16 and in the tenth grade in high school. Walton testified that he advised Darryl and his mother that they wished to question him about the incident as an informational witness and not as a suspect. After indicating to his mother his willingness to go with the officers, Darryl left the house alone in the company of the police officers, with his mother’s consent.</p>

Walton also cautioned Darryl that if there was any chance of implicating himself, it would be to his best interest to refuse to answer any questions. Approximately after ten minutes, before appellant had made any incriminatory statements, another team of officers arrived and advised Walton that they had learned Darryl <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>was, in fact, implicated in the firebombing. The interview was immediately stopped and Walton telephoned Darryl’s mother to advise her of their intention to formally charge her son as an accomplice to the arson-murder. Mrs. Webster was permitted to speak with Darryl and after she had finished, advised Officer Walton she did not object to the police questioning him because “the truth is going to come out one way or the other anyhow.” She indicated to the officer that it was up to Darryl to decide if he wished to be interviewed.</p>
    <p id="b351-4" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[212,847,1151,958]]]'>After the conversation with Mrs. Webster, Darryl was fully advised of his constitutional rights, informed of the nature of the charges that were going to be preferred against him and the probable consequences if he were to be found guilty. According to Walton’s testimony, Darryl remarked that “If the other boys are going to talk, I better get my side in also. Because they are not going to put everything on me.” Darryl then made a preliminary oral statement, followed by a formal statement which was transcribed by typewriter. The statement contained a detailed account of how Darryl and several other youths had obtained the raw materials for several primitive firebombs; how they had constructed the bombs; and how two of the youths had thrown the bombs at Mrs. Amplo’s house. At the conclusion of the statement, Darryl corrected one minor factual detail, read the typewritten transcript aloud, initialed each page, and signed it at the end.</p>

Although he admitted that he had not been physically abused by the officers, he charged that he was in fact in fear because he had been given a “dirty look” by Officer Walton while they were enroute to police headquarters and that Officer Walton told him “When we get you to the station, you will speak <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>up.” He stated that although Walton told him he (Walton) had spoken to his mother over the phone, Walton did not give him an opportunity to speak to her. While he claimed he was not given his warnings prior to his oral admissions, he did concede that he was so advised before the written statement was commenced.</p>
    <p id="b352-4" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[288,607,1148,640]]]'>Interestingly, Mrs. Webster was not called during the suppression hearing although she did testify at the trial where the issue of voluntariness was again raised. During the trial, Mrs. Webster equivocated as to whether she had given permission to the officers to take Darryl to police headquarters. Further, although admitting receiving a call from Officer Walton from police headquarters, she denied that he advised her that her son was to be charged as an accomplice in this crime or that her permission was sought to interview him. She stated that the officer called her for the sole purpose of telling her that they were giving her son lunch.</p>

Heretofore, although recognizing the need to scrutinize with special care any incriminating statement obtained from a youth during police custodial interrogation, we have refrained from announcing, as a blanket rule, that a 16-year-old youth is legally incapable of waiving his constitutional rights and confessing to a crime. <em>Commonwealth v.

In that case, the mother followed her son and the police to police headquarters. Upon her arrival, she was given no information concerning the whereabouts of her son and was required to wait over an hour, when by chance, she noticed her son being accompanied by a detective to a water fountain in the hallway where she had been sitting. When Mrs. Roane attempted to seize this opportunity to speak with her son, she was denied access to him by the detective who took the youth to another interrogating room. After another period of approximately one hour, during which her inquiries pertaining to her son’s whereabouts were left unanswered, Mrs. Roane noticed the door ajar to an interrogation room and entered uninvited. Upon finding her son in the room she had entered, she again asked for permission to confer with him and was granted the right, but urged to speak up so that their conversation could be heard by the officers present. At the commencement of the written statement when the right to counsel was read to the youth in his mother’s presence, Mrs. Roane informed the officers that she wished to obtain a lawyer for her son. This request was ignored and the taking of the formal statement began. When Mrs. Roane protested, one of the officers urged her “Let him talk, maybe it will make him feel better.”</p>

Assuming that the Court is merely following the precedent established in <em>Commonwealth v.

Following his conviction in September 1969, Webster took no appeal. On January 15, 1973, he filed a petition under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, § 1 <em>et seq., </em>19 P.S. § 1180-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. 1975-76), claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had been denied his rights relative to appeal. The PCHA hearing court determined that in fact this was the case, and he was therefore enabled to take an appeal as if timely filed. This appeal followed. In <em>Commonwealth v. Faison, </em><a href="/pa/437/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="437 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1927806" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0432-01">437 Pa. 432</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=264%20A.%20394" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="264 A. 394">264 A. 394</a> (1970), this Court laid down what I believe to be the proper test for determining whether an appellant on a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal may raise an issue which is premised on a constitutional right announced subsequent to his judgment of sentence. We held that such an issue may be raised “provided that this right has been given such retroactive effect that it would have been available to appellant had an appeal been timely filed.” <a href="/pa/437/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="437 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1927806" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0432-01">437 Pa. at 441</a>, 264 A.2d at 399. Any other result would, as here, give such appellants an unfair windfall. The unfairness of granting appellant relief based on <em>Starkes </em>is made clear when it is considered that in <em>Commonwealth v. Moses, </em><a href="/pa/446/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="446 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="1941737" data-case-paths="/pa/446/0350-01">446 Pa. 350</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=287%20A.2d%20131" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="287 A.2d 131">287 A.2d 131</a> (1971), we denied relief to a co-defendant of Webster’s <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>who took a timely appeal.
