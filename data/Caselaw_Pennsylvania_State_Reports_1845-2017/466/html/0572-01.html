The purpose of this provision was to encourage the retirement of judges who had reached age seventy by allowing them to retire and to receive the same salary. On April 23, 1968, a new judiciary article of the Pennsylvania Constitution was adopted. Article V<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> mandates that all judges elected after January 1, <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>1969, shall retire upon attaining the age of seventy.

Kephart, </em><a href="/pa/466/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="466 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="1714961" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0560-01">466 Pa. 560</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="466 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="1714961" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0560-01">353 A.2d 833</a> (1976) (J. 24 of 1976), we held that the term of a mandatorily retired member of the judiciary expires upon his retirement. Thus, the new judiciary article had a significant impact on section 401(4) not only by rendering retirement at age seventy mandatory but also by creating an alternate end, based on age, to the term for which a judge is elected. Because the attainment of age seventy before his term as a member of the judiciary would otherwise end ends the term, there is no “unexpired portion of his term” as defined in section 401(4). By reason of this alternate termination of a judge’s term of office, the option provided in section 401(4) was available only to judges who voluntarily retired after twenty-five years of judicial service prior to attaining age seventy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Accordingly, at the time appellant was reelected in 1973, section 401 (4) offered him no benefits.</p>
