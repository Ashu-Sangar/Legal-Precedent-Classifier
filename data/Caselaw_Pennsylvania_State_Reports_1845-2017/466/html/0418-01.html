We do not agree. We have reviewed the record, accepting as we must the evidence and the reasonable inferences arising therefrom, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to prove the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v.

During the argument, appellant pulled out a knife and waved it in the victim’s face. The victim left the scene and returned a short time later armed with a baseball bat. Seeing the victim coming toward him with the baseball bat, appellant charged with knife in hand toward the approaching victim. Appellant was restrained by a friend who held appellant’s arms until just before the victim swung the baseball bat. At that time the friend released appellant’s arms and appellant partially blocked the approaching bat with a radio he had been carrying. The bat, nonetheless, struck appellant in the head.</p>
