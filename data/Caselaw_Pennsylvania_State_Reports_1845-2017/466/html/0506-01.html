    <p id="b537-13" data-blocks='[["BL_537.13",537,[172,1732,1150,580]]]'>Appellant was the defendant in a trial which commenced on April 8, 1974. After the jury had been selected and sworn, court was adjourned until 9:30 a.m., the following day. When appellant failed to appear at 9:30 a.m., the trial court sent a county detective to appellant’s home, where appellant was found sleeping. Appellant arrived in court at 11:00 a.m. Appellant apologized to the court, and explained that he had gone to a party the night before and thought he had set his alarm. Based on this incident, appellant was held in contempt, and the fine imposed.</p>

      <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>The prosecution contends that appellant’s conviction was proper because he either disobeyed or neglected the lawful process of the court. See Act of June 16, 1836, P.L. 784, Sec. 23, 17 P.S. 2041. Appellant contends that the conviction should be reversed because the evidence failed to establish intent which, according to the appellant, is a necessary element of the crime of contempt.
