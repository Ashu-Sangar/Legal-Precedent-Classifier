The court stated that it was applying the Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act, Act of September 26, 1961, P.L. 1664, as amended, formerly codified as 35 P.S. § 780-20(d). The permissible range of sentence for the sale of heroin under that act was a fine not to exceed $5,000 and imprisonment of not less than five nor more than twenty years. In fact, the proper statutory provision, to the extent it does not set a greater penalty, was Act of April 14, 1972, P.L. 233, § 13(f)(1), 35 P.S. § 780-113(f)(l) (Supp.1975).

The latter provision sets as a maximum sentence of $250,000 fine and fifteen years of imprisonment.

This contention is without merit. It appears that the fines were based solely on whether the particular defendant had any assets. Thus they reflect neither the backgrounds of the appellants nor the circumstances of the crime. Furthermore, the terms of imprisonment are the real and effective sentences, and, in these cases the prison terms are identical.</p>

These cases do not alter our conclusion. Two unappealed cases, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortego, </em>according to appellee’s appendix to its brief, were sentenced in accordance with the court’s predetermined “standard sentence.” They therefore fully support appellants’ allegations.

Thus, only <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaro </em>might challenge this conclusion, and the record does not establish on what basis the “non-standard” sentence was imposed.</p>
      <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.3",157,[221,925,1110,1100]]]'>Even assuming these cases do not confirm the existence of a sentencing plan, they do not alter the fact that these six appellants were sentenced according to such a plan. There is no basis for the dissenting opinion’s conclusion that “the record conclusively establishes sales of heroin for profit absent any significant mitigating or extenuating circumstances” or for its assertion that the crimes were inspired by “greed.” First, there was evidence before the sentencing courts that these defendants committed the crimes in strikingly different circumstances. For example, appellant Cañóles, according to the uncontradicted testimony of both the Commonwealth’s undercover agent and appellant’s counsel was heavily addicted and did not sell for profit, yet he received a stiffer sentence than appellant Burgos, who was alleged to be unaddicted and a pusher. These differences were treated as irrelevant and were ignored. (See supra at 653-654.) Second, the sentencing hearings were too cursory to establish that no mitigating or extenuating circumstances existed (see, e. g., <a href="/pa/462/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="462 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="485207" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0216-01">supra at 653-654, note 8</a>; supra at 654, note 10). No pre-sentence reports were requested by the sentencing courts to correct this deficiency. The dissenting opinion’s reliance on the colloquy in appellant Martin’s sentencing hearing is misplaced. That colloquy occurred prior to imposition of any of these sentences and prior to the time that, appellants contend, the sentence procedure was determined (see supra at 651-652). As the remaining sentencing colloquies demonstrate, these sentences were imposed without reference to any mitigating or extenuating circumstances. Third, to deny the existence of a “standard sentence” without regard to individualized circumstances in these six cases ignores the very words used by at least one of the sentencing judges (see supra at 652-653).</p>
      <p id="b157-6" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[220,2033,1108,300]]]'>Finally, the dissenting opinion’s characterization of these sentences as “uniform” is inaccurate. The arbitrary decision to make the sentences consecutive, without regard to the circumstances of the individual defendant, resulted in widely differing sentences. Such arbitrary determinations, made prior to the sentencing hearings which are intended to provide information for making the determinations, have no place in an individualized sentencing scheme (see infra at 657, n. 23).</p>

Where, as here, there was ample evidence to determine that these crimes were inspired by greed and the defense had been given full opportunity to articulate any extenuating or mitigating circumstances, I do not believe that a decision that a pre-sentence report was unnecessary was an abuse of that discretion.</p>

LUCARELLI: Your Honor, if I might speak to that point, Trooper Gills and Trooper Rogers, who were out on the streets at this time and say from the Defendant and from the people around him tell me that the Defendant isn’t an addict but he was in the business of selling heroin for profit.</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b171-12" data-blocks='[["BL_171.9",171,[251,1971,1073,267]]]'>He had a 1972 car, a 1972 Thunderbird and he had a job. There was attempts on the sale in the street for this Defendant and two other men to form a syndicate to control the heroin traffic in Lancaster and force the Puerto Ricans out of the business. This is not a case that we have some poor addict selling to support his habit, he’s trying to corrupt all of the rest of the people in the county.”</blockquote>

Legal text writers have repeatedly approved of the multi-judge sentencing panels in the Eastern District of New York, the East<a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>ern District of Michigan, the New York Supreme Court, Bronx County, and the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. See, for example, <em>Collective Sentencing Decision in Judicial and Administrative Contests, supra </em>at n. 5 and <em>Lawlessness in Sentencing, supra </em>at n. 5. The formation of such panels for the discussion among judges of the appropriate sentence to be imposed for a particular crime when the defendant’s individual characteristics place him within a limited category, does not violate any ideal of individualized sentencing.</p>
