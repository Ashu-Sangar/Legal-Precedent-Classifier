Larry Williford testified that appellant said that he was ready to do something because he wasn’t feeling good and wanted to get some money. When they drove past the White Tower Restaurant near the corner of Germantown and Allegheny Avenues, appellant said, ‘This is a nice place to take off.’ Williford said that there were too many police around, but appellant insisted. Appellant told Williford to go around the corner and he would get out of the car. Williford stopped the car on 12th Street and everyone got out. Williford saw appellant take something like a piece of steel or a gun from his pocket. At trial, Williford identified the shotgun recovered by the police as the object appellant took from his pocket. Williford also observed appellant, take a green shell out of a cigarette pack. Williford gave the car keys to his cousin Herbert Johnson, and observed appellant, Herbert Johnson and Carl <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>Johnson walk up Allegheny Avenue through a school yard toward the White Tower Restaurant.</blockquote>

Julius Wise testified that between 2:30 a. m. and 3:00 a. m. on July 2, 1972, he observed three Negro males, who were walking north on Germantown Avenue, enter the White Tower and about ten seconds later heard something like a firecracker. Wise then observed the three men run out of the restaurant and proceed south on Germantown Avenue. On 12th Street Wise saw the three men enter a white 1960 Oldsmobile.</blockquote>

The witnesses saw three men enter the restaurant, heard a gunshot, and saw three men running out. These men were followed until they entered a white 1960 Oldsmobile on 12th Street. Prior to the crime, appellant was riding in a white 1960 Oldsmobile, which was parked on 12th Street. Appellant had expressed his intention to rob the restaurant, had exhibited a shotgun, and was seen walking in the direction of the restaurant with two companions. The shotgun found in the vicinity was identified as the appellant’s shotgun. It had a green shell inside similar to a green shell which the appellant had in his possession prior to the crime. Under these circumstances the evidence was sufficient to establish that the appellant participated in the robbery during which the fatal shooting occurred.</p>
