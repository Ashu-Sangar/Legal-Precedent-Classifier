In essence, appellees argue that the arbitration provision in the trust agreement, which admittedly gives jurisdiction to the American Arbitration Association to decide substantive issues concerning forfeiture of benefits, should not be read to give jurisdiction to decide procedural disputes even though the subject matter remains the forfeiture of benefits. We cannot accept such a distinction.</p>
