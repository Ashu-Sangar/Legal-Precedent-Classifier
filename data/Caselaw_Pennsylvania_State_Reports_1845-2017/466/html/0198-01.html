On May 18, 1970, Reverend Smith was shot and killed in his Philadelphia home in the presence of his daughter, Mrs. Beulah Hopewell. In a motion to suppress prior to trial, appellant sought to prevent the introduction of identification evidence. That motion was denied, and at trial the witness Hopewell identified appellant as one of two men involved in the crime. The second man has never been identified. The failure to suppress the identification evidence was assigned as error in post-verdict motions and again in this appeal. We agree that the identification evidence should have been suppressed because its use denied appellant due process of law. <em>Neil v.

She was reading the paper and having coffee and paid little attention to the voices she heard in the living room. Sensing the presence of someone near her, she “turned around” and saw a man in the doorway. He said “Don’t look at me, cover your eyes.” She “laughed” thinking it was a “joke.” She “thought it was some of the boys coming from church” and said “okay, and turned around and covered [her] eyes.” The man then said “Get up and come into the other room.” As she got up, he said “Don’t look at me,” and “put his hand up over his face.” As he did, she saw a gun in his other hand and “quickly closed [her] eyes again.” Before doing so, she got a “momentary look” or “glimpse” of the man near her. She also saw another man standing in the living room with his back to her, and her father looking at a piece of paper. The man with her instructed her to lie on the floor. While lying facedown on the dining room floor she heard her father say, “you must be kidding, I have a sick wife upstairs.” The man with her then said “Don’t argue with the man, just shoot him.” She :heard shots and saw her father fall to the floor. She remained on the floor until after the men had fled. Later, she picked up the paper she had seen her father reading.

It is not clear from the record how many times she was shown appellant’s picture. The prosecutor admitted at trial that “there are not records in existence to the best of my knowledge as to the photographs shown to her on any occasion when there was no identification, and that includes those occasions on which Fowler’s photograph was shown to her and she failed to identify it.” Despite the lack of complete records, the defense was able to establish through prosecution witnesses at least three of the occasions when she was <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>shown appellant’s picture prior to August 13, 1970. She was first shown appellant’s picture on May 19, 1970, one day after the killing. At that time, she was shown eight photographs. Six of these were police mug shots showing both front and side views from the chest up. The other two photographs differed significantly from the six. One of these was a photograph of appellant. His photograph was not a mug shot and no markings of any kind appeared on it. There was nothing to distinguish it from an ordinary picture. Appellant, unlike the persons in any of the other photographs, appeared in a full-length front view wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie. The second display of photographs in which appellant’s picture appeared took place three days later on May 22, 1970. At that time, thirteen photographs were displayed. Again eleven of the thirteen photographs differed significantly from the two others, one of which was a photograph of the appellant. Eleven of the photographs were mug shots. Appellant’s photograph depicted him in the same pose as did the photograph shown on May 19, 1970. The third display of photographs took place sometime after May 22, 1970, but the exact date could not be tied down by the officer who displayed the photographs. He said, however, that he did not enter the case for several months. Thus, this display probably took place in late July or early August of 1970. On that occasion, the daughter was shown eleven photographs, at least nine, and maybe all but one of which as before, differed from two of the other photographs, one of which was the appellant.

Appellant and two <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>other men entered the restaurant together and sat on the opposite side of the counter close enough to the daughter to enable her to hear him speaking to his companions. She said that his voice sounded immature and at one point she heard him say to one of his companions “that is the wife and daughter, and she doesn’t recognize me.” Appellant and his companions left the restaurant first. They were about to get into their car, when the daughter saw them again and wrote down the license number of the car. The daughter’s husband and mother were not aware of her observations and did not hear appellant’s alleged remark. The daughter said nothing to her husband and mother until they arrived in New York, later explaining that she did not wish to alarm her mother. Upon their arrival in New York, she told her husband about the incident and he called the police giving them the license plate number. The number was subsequently traced to a Hertz Rent-A-Car for which appellant was found to be signatory on the rental agreement.</p>

At the line-up, the daughter “said [appellant] looked like the same person I had seen but I would like to hear him speak.” All six men in the line-up were then asked to speak after which she identified appellant for the first time as the man who had been in her father’s home at the time of the crime, three and one-half months earlier.

She had little opportunity to view the criminal at the time of the crime. Her degree of attention during her first momentary look was not affected by knowledge that anything unusual was happening. During her second momentary look, her view of the criminal’s face was obscured by his arm. In addition, the criminal wore a hat and sunglasses further obscuring her view of his face. These circumstances alone cast serious doubt on the witness’s ability to make an identification reliably based on what she saw at the time of the crime.</p>
