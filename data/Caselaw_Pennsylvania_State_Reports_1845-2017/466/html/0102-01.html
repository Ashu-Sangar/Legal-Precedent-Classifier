      <p id="b138-6" data-blocks='[["BL_138.6",138,[271,1381,1145,789]]]'>. Appellant claims that the Legislature “impliedly repealed” the Act of March 31, 1860, P.L. 427, § 3, as amended (formerly codified as 19 P.S. § 3) (hereinafter “section 3”) when it enacted the Act of August 6, 1963, P.L. 511 § 1 (see 19 Pa.C.S. § 11 (Supp. 1975)) (hereinafter “section 11”). Such a result would be compelled either if the two statutes were “irreconcilable” or if section 11 were a revision of all statutes upon the particular matter. See 1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1936, 1971 (Supp.1975). Neither of these possibilities exist here. Although section 11 covers pursuit and arrest of felons with or without a warrant, it does not exclude alternative authorizations for arrest. Thus it does not purport to be a complete revision of the subject matter. Further, contrary to appellant’s assertion, section 11 does not limit an árresting officer’s jurisdiction to “hot” pursuit of felons. Consequently, section 11 does not necessarily conflict with section 3 and should be interpreted to specifically include the authorization for arrest with a warrant found in section 3. See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1932 (Supp.1975). It should be noted that section 3 was suspended by this Court because it conflicted with Pa.R.Crim.P. 323 (adopted since the arrest here) and not because of any conflict between section 3 and section 11.</p>

Appellant relies on the following prosecutorial conduct: alleged leading questions at the suppression hearing and at trial; comments made at side bar; ánd comments made during defense cross-examination of a prosecution witness concerning whether the witness had previously answered the defense’s question. The court sustained many of appellant’s objections. Assuming that the court may have erred in refusing to sustain some of appellant’s objections, no prejudice occurred.</p>
      <p id="b144-9" data-blocks='[["BL_144.8",144,[295,1382,1114,529]]]'>Appellant alleges that the Commonwealth’s cross-examination of two defense witnesses was improper. Appellant’s brother testified on appellant’s behalf. The district attorney asked him why he had not come to the police sooner with his story. He also attempted to explore matters beyond the scope of direct examination. Objections to these questions were sustained. Appellant also alleges that certain other questions of this witness created an inference in the minds of the jury that defendant was incarcerated prior to trial. The witness testified that appellant had a moustache prior to the date the crimes were committed and until the date of trial. The district attorney, in an effort to impeach this testimony, attempted to show a picture of appellant without a moustache taken while appellant was in jail. The court sustained an objection made at sidebar.</p>
      <p id="b144-10" data-blocks='[["BL_144.9",144,[293,1912,1110,455]]]'>Another of appellant’s brothers also testified on appellant’s behalf. The district attorney inquired when he was first asked to testify. Appellant objected because he had chosen to present no evidence at the first trial. The court cautioned the Commonwealth to limit its questioning. The district attorney also questioned this witness about appellant’s activities at the time of arrest. The witness stated that appellant came into the witness’ bar quite often and had been there on December 19, 1968. The Commonwealth then asked when the next visit occurred. Appellant’s objection was sustained because of the danger that the witness might testify that appellant had been arrested the following day. The jury was instructed to ignore the question.</p>

Appellant relies on the following: (1) A box containing Commonwealth exhibits marked “Curtis Davis, homicide” was brought into the courtroom. When appellant objected, the lettering was covered. (2) A Commonwealth witness was allowed to testify that the physical characteristics of the assailant five years before were similar to appellant’s at the time of trial. The court asked the same witness whether she took into account the passing of time. No prejudice occurred since the court’s question alerted the jury to the uncertainty of the identification testimony. (3) A doctor who had conducted over 5,000 autopsies was allowed to testify on the cause of death. Appellant, on cross-examination, challenged the witness’ conclusions. Appellant’s objection to the doctor’s qualifications as an expert was properly overruled. The qualification of expert witnesses is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavalier, </em><a href="/pa/284/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="284 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1092017" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0311-01">284 Pa. 311</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.%20229" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="131 A. 229">131 A. 229</a> (1925); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ametrane, </em><a href="/pa-super/205/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="205 Pa.

Nothing in this record supports an abuse of discretion. The credibility of the witness was for the jury to determine. (4) Appellant argues that the court improperly admitted into evidence certain exhibits. The record shows that the exhibits were properly identified and admitted. (5) Certain inflammatory pictures were held inadmissible by the court. Appellant claims that these pictures were visible to the jury when the district attorney placed them on the court stenographer’s desk. The court, to ensure that no prejudice occurred, had the pictures turned over by the stenographer. The record does not support any inference that the pictures were seen by the jury. (6) Appellant argues that comments made by the court at sidebar prejudiced his case. This claim is frivolous. (7) A detective, on cross-examination, was questioned concerning the chain of custody of the fatal bullet. Appellant claims that the court prejudiced his case by referring to earlier testimony involving this issue. This reference did not create any prejudice. (8) Finally, appellant asserts that the court erred in its charge to the jury by the “constant repetition” of first degree murder by comparison to its references to other degrees of murder. This claim is meritless, and, in any event, was waived because no objection was interposed and no clarifying instruction was requested. Pa. R.Crim.P. 1119(b); <em>Commonwealth v.
