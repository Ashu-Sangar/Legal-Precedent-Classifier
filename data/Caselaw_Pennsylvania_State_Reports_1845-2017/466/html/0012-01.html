On appeal to the Superior Court, he challenged the validity of his guilty plea, alleging that the guilty plea colloquy was insufficient to demonstrate that it was intelligently, knowingly and voluntarily tendered. He petitioned this Court for leave to appeal from the Superior Court’s affirmance<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> of his judgment of sentence. We granted that petition, and now reverse the order of the Superior Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
