The officer approached the car and a young woman, therein, sat up. The officer turned on his flashlight and checked the front and back seats and the floor, but found nothing suspicious. He exchanged a few words with the young woman and left. However, he kept the car under surveillance by observing it from a distance with binoculars. During a period of ten minutes in which he observed the car, he saw people walking to the vehicle. He radioed for assistance and pulled up behind the car. At that time, appellant was sitting behind the wheel of the observed car and its motor was running. In addition to appellant, there were five passengers in the car and a man standing outside the car facing the open window of the right door. The police requested everyone to exit the car. When the front-right passenger’s seat was pushed forward to permit exit by those in the back, the police officer who had been observing the car, saw a corn cob pipe with aluminum foil in the bottom of the bowl lying in the space beneath the back of the right-front passenger’s seat. The pipe was made visible only after the front-right passenger’s seat was pulled forward. The residue in the bowl was identified by the officer as mari<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>juana. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of marijuana in the pipe found by the officer. No marijuana was found on appellant.</p>
    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[313,470,1150,475]]]'>Appellant's conviction rests solely on his alleged possession of the corn cob pipe. The trial court reasoned, “the pipe containing marijuana residue was not accessible to or available to anyone in the car so long as the front seat was occupied. It was effectively concealed in a hiding place controlled and possessed by the [appellant]. Therefore, the inference must follow that it was in the [appellant’s] possession.” In so concluding, the court emphasized that appellant owned the car.</p>

The fact of ownership does not support the inference that appellant knew the pipe was under the seat. The facts presented here are like those in <em>Commonwealth v. Fortune, </em><a href="/pa/456/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="456 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="584476" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0365-01">456 Pa. 365</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20327" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="318 A.2d 327">318 A.2d 327</a> (1974). There, the Supreme Court found the evidence insufficient to convict the resident of a house of possession of drugs found on her kitchen floor, ‘not in a place normally accessible only to a resident of a home.’ <em><a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20327" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="318 A.2d 327">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20327" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="318 A.2d 327">at 369</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20327" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="318 A.2d 327">318 A.2d at 329</a>. When the police entered the house the resident was upstairs. Three men and a woman were in the living room. Upon seeing the police approach they fled through the kitchen and out the back door. Reversing, the court . said: ‘There is no evidence that the appellant had any knowledge of the presence of the drugs in her home prior to the arrival of the police. The appellant’s residency in the home does not establish any such knowledge. We cannot assume that a resident of <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>a home, where guests are present, knows of the full contents of the premises.’ <em><a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20327" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="318 A.2d 327">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20327" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="318 A.2d 327">at 369</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20327" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="318 A.2d 327">318 A.2d at 329</a>. So here we cannot assume that appellant as owner and driver of the car knew its full contents, when it appears as in <em>Fortune </em>that some of the contents might have been hidden by his guests.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[164,764,1152,1180]]]'>In the present case, we can find no evidence that appellant who was seated in the <em>driver’s </em>seat of his automobile had possession of the corn cob pipe which was located in the space beneath the back of the front-right <em>passenger’s </em>seat. Appellant’s ownership of or presence in the car does not establish possession on the part of appellant. <em>Commonwealth v. Fortune, </em><a href="/pa/456/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="456 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="584476" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0365-01">456 Pa. 365</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20327" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="318 A.2d 327">318 A.2d 327</a> (1974). The facts disclose that the other occupants of appellant’s car had ample opportunities to place the pipe in the crevice behind the front-right passenger’s seat. Because of the presence of these other persons in the car, appellant did not have exclusive control of the area where the pipe was found. We cannot, therefore, infer that appellant was in possession of the pipe. “[T]he fact of possession loses all persuasiveness if persons other than the accused had equal access with him to the place in which the property was discovered.” <em>Commonwealth v. Davis, </em><a href="/pa/444/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="444 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1938552" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0011-01">444 Pa. 11</a>, 16, <a href="/citations/?q=280%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="280 A.2d 119">280 A.2d 119</a>, 121 (1971). There is no evidence that appellant placed the pipe under the seat. It is possible that the pipe was placed there by one of the other persons before appellant entered the car or as the police were approaching.</p>
