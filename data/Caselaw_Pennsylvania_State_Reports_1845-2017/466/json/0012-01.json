        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Daniel Nathaniel Mack, Jr., entered a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery with accomplice by violence and received a sentence of five to ten years in prison. On appeal to the Superior Court, he challenged the validity of his guilty plea, alleging that the guilty plea colloquy was insufficient to demonstrate that it was intelligently, knowingly and voluntarily tendered. He petitioned this Court for leave to appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s affirmance of his judgment of sentence. We granted that petition, and now reverse the order of the Superior Court.\nAs we stated in Commonwealth v. Rodgers, 465 Pa. 379, 350 A.2d 815 (1976) :\n\u201cThe constitutional requirement for a valid guilty plea is that the record of the guilty plea hearing contain an affirmative showing that the defendant understands \u2018what the plea connotes and ... its consequences.\u2019 In particular cases, this understanding has been held to include: (1) an understanding what specific acts the defendant is admitting and whether they make out the crime charged; (2) an understanding of the rights given up by choosing not to put the state to its proof; and (3) an understanding of the nature and extent of punishment which may be imposed for the crime which the defendant admits committing. Obviously, this is not an all inclusive list, because the indicia of a voluntary, knowing and intelligent plea will vary with the circumstances of the individual case.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)\nThe guilty plea colloquy in this case is inadequate in many respects. For example, appellant was questioned concerning the waiver of all of the rights associated with a jury trial, as follows:\n\u201cTHE COURT: Now, you know that by entering a guilty plea you give up the right to a Jury trial ?\n\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n\u201cTHE COURT: You know that, do you ?\n\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\u201d\nThis is the complete colloquy concerning the defendant\u2019s waiver of rights afforded and protected by a jury trial. The trial court also explained to the defendant the range of sentences which could be imposed, and asked him whether he was acting of his own free will and whether he had discussed his plea with his lawyer. Affirmative responses to each of these questions apparently satisfied the trial court that the plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.\nThis guilty plea colloquy fails to satisfy not only the most recent decisions of this Court, but fails to satisfy every statement of what the colloquy must show from Commonwealth ex rel. West v. Rundle, 428 Pa. 102, 237 A.2d 196 (1968), to the recent statement in Commonwealth v. Ingram, 455 Pa. 198, 316 A.2d 77 (1974).\nOrder reversed, case remanded for a new trial.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which\nMANDERINO, J., joins.\n. Commonwealth v. Mack, 230 Pa.Super. 596, 326 A.2d 881 (1974).\n. We hear this appeal under authority of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. 211.204(a) (Supp.1975).",

I am also of opinion that the Court properly reached the merits of appellant\u2019s challenge to his guilty plea, despite the fact that no petition to withdraw the plea was filed in the trial court. See my concurring opinion in Commonwealth v. Rodgers, 465 Pa. 379, 386, 350 A.2d 815 (1974). Accordingly, I concur in the reversal of the order of the Superior Court affirming the judgment of sentence and in the remanding of the case for a new trial.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this concurring opinion.",
