        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nIn this appeal, we are presented with three issues arising from the grant of a nolle prosequi: (1) is Pa.R.Crim.P. 314(a), which provides that a trial court may, upon request of the Commonwealth, grant a nolle prosequi \u201cnotwithstanding the objection of any person,\u201d valid under the Federal Constitution; (2) was appellant denied due process of law under the Federal Constitution by the trial court\u2019s grant of a nolle prosequi; and (3) was the trial court\u2019s grant of a nolle prosequi an abuse of discretion.\nOn February 1, 1972, after several hours of drinking with undercover agents of the Pennsylvania State Police, Joseph Francis Bowers confided that he and two other men had been involved in the burglary-murder of John L. Miller in June of 1969. A week later the agents again sought out Bowers, who once again admitted his participation in the crime. A criminal complaint was filed against Bowers on March 8, 1972, and he was indicted on July 13,1972.\nWhile in prison, Bowers gave police a formal statement implicating himself, one Kemmerling, one Schneck and appellant in Miller\u2019s murder. Criminal complaints against the three were filed on June 27, 1972, and they were indicted October 4,1972.\nCounsel was appointed to defend appellant in July 1972. This counsel, however, withdrew from the case on October 2, 1972, two days before appellant was indicted, and was replaced by the public defender. The case was called for trial on November 15, 1972, at which time the defender, over appellant\u2019s objection in open court, moved for a continuance because he was not ready to go to trial. The continuance was granted, with trial scheduled for January 1973.\nSchneck\u2019s case proceeded more quickly than did appellant\u2019s. A jury was sworn in Schneck\u2019s case on January 8, 1973. Bowers, the only witness able to link both Schneck and appellant to the crimes charged was called but refused to testify, asserting his right to remain silent. The Commonwealth, caught by surprise, was unable to prove its case and was unable to obtain either a continuance or a nolle prosequi. Schneck was acquitted.\nAt this time a jury was being selected to hear appellant\u2019s case but had not yet been sworn. When Bowers refused to testify in Schneck\u2019s trial on January 8th, the Commonwealth asked for and was granted a short continuance in appellant\u2019s trial to determine whether Bowers would again refuse to testify if called as a witness in appellant\u2019s case. During the continuance Bowers, his attorney and attorneys for the Commonwealth conferred. Bowers indicated that he would refuse to testify in appellant\u2019s trial.\nWhen appellant\u2019s trial resumed the following day, January 9th, the Commonwealth requested a continuance, alleging that it could not, without Bowers\u2019 testimony, prove a prima facie case. This motion was denied. The Commonwealth then requested a nolle prosequi. After hearing argument from both appellant and the Commonwealth, the nolle prosequi was granted. In its written opinion, the trial court, relying on Pa.R.Crim.P. 314(a) and Commonwealth v. DiPasquale, 431 Pa. 536, 246 A.2d 430 (1968), stated that the grant of the nolle prosequi was a proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Appellant appeals from the order granting the nolle prosequi.\nAppellant challenges the constitutionality of Pa. R.Crim.P. 314(a). His attack seems to focus on the \u201cnotwithstanding the objection of any person\u201d portion of the rule. After quoting rule 314 (a), appellant states:\n\u201cBy its\u2019 [sic] language, the rule closes the door on all defendants and gives to the attorney for the Commonwealth the exclusive and sole right to prosecute or not to prosecute. Defendant\u2019s rights are completely ignored. There are no provisions for any processes on a defendant\u2019s behalf. Clearly a denial of due process.\u201d\nIn this case, however, the record shows that appellant was permitted to present objections to the trial court before the nolle prosequi was granted. It is clear, therefore, that the trial court did not interpret the \u201cnotwithstanding the objection of any person\u201d language to bar such argument. Nor does appellant allege that the trial court ignored his arguments, thus making the opportunity to present them meaningless. The record shows that the trial court indicated it would consider the merits of appellant\u2019s argument and there is no basis for this Court to conclude that it did otherwise.\nThe trial court\u2019s action in this case was perfectly consistent with the rule. The challenged language merely means that a criminal defendant does not have an absolute right to be tried on demand. A motion for a nolle prosequi is treated like any other motion: one side presents the motion to the court; both sides argue the merits of the requested motion; the court considers the merits of their arguments; and the trial court issues a ruling. The rule in no way bars the presentation of objections by the defendant nor does it direct the trial court to ignore those objections. It merely states that the defendant\u2019s objection is not dispositive of the issue.\nWe now turn to appellant\u2019s claim that the grant of a nolle prosequi, apart from the validity of the rule, denied him due process of law. Appellant relies primarily on Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213, 87 S.Ct. 988, 18 L.Ed.2d 1 (1967), which held that the sixth amendment guarantee of a speedy trial is applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment.\nA speedy trial claim is analyzed in two steps: (1) is the delay itself sufficiently long to trigger the \u201cnecessity for inquiry into other factors that go into the balance,\u201d and (2) a balancing of the length of delay, reason for delay, defendant\u2019s assertion of the right and prejudice to the defendant.\nAppellant was indicted October 4, 1972, and the trial was scheduled to begin November 13, 1972. When appellant\u2019s case was called on November 15, 1972, appellant\u2019s counsel, the public defender, requested and was granted, over appellant\u2019s objection, a continuance until the January court term. The case was called for trial on January 5, 1973, and the nolle prosequi was granted January 8, 1973.\nThe issue we must decide is whether the grant of a nolle prosequi on January 8 denied appellant due process of law by denying him his right to a speedy trial. We must consider this issue in light of the facts and circumstances extant on January 8th.\nThe total delay from indictment to nolle prosequi was 93 days. We do not believe that a 93 day delay is sufficient to trigger the full speedy trial inquiry when the charge involved is a major felony. We therefore hold that the grant of a nolle prosequi on January 8, 1973, did not deny appellant his right to a speedy trial because the delay involved was not sufficiently long to be presumptively prejudicial.\nFinally, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by granting the nolle prosequi. Appellant relies on the Commonwealth\u2019s readiness to go to trial on November 15, 1972, when the public defender requested a continuance, and its reaffirmance of that readiness on January 5, 1973, when the case was called. Appellant concludes that the trial court abused its discretion by believing the Commonwealth\u2019s statement, on January 8. 1973, that it could not prove a prima facie case and by granting a nolle prosequi on that basis. We disagree.\nA trial court\u2019s grant of a nolle prosequi will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears to be an abuse of discretion. Pennsylvania law indicates that there are two factors to be considered when a request for a nolle prosequi is made: (1) is the reason given by the Commonwealth for requesting the nolle prosequi valid and reasonable, and (2) does the defendant, at the time the nolle prosequi is requested, have a valid speedy trial claim?\nWe have already determined that appellant did not have a speedy trial claim on January 8. Therefore, if the Commonwealth had a valid reason for requesting the nolle prosequi, the trial court\u2019s action will be upheld.\nThe Commonwealth was clearly surprised by Bowers\u2019 refusal to testify; otherwise they would never have risked empaneling a jury in the Schneck case. Because it was surprised by the sudden unavailability of Bowers\u2019 testimony, the earlier representations of preparedness cannot be regarded as deliberate, or even negligent attempts to detective either appellant or the court or to subject appellant to unnecessary delay or other burden.\nAlthough the refusal of a witness to testify is not completely analogous to the unavailability of a witness, it is nonetheless a valid basis for some trial delay. As the United States Supreme Court stated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 534, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2194, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972):\n\u201c[S]ome delay would have been permissible under ordinary circumstances, so that Manning could be utilized as a witness in Barker\u2019s trial . . . .\u201d\nManning, of course, was the Bowers of Barker\u2019s case: a co-defendant who refused to testify because to do so would implicate himself. The delay the Court was approving was the time ordinarily necessary to try and convict the reluctant witness, thus invalidating his claim of privilege.\nBecause appellant did not have a valid speedy trial claim when the nolle prosequi was granted and because the Commonwealth had a proper reason for requesting it, the grant of a nolle prosequi in appellant\u2019s case was proper.\nOrder affirmed.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this opinion and files a concurring opinion.\nEAGEN and POMEROY, JJ., concur in the result.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. We hear this case under authority of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 205, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.205 (Supp.1975); id., art. V, \u00a7 503(a), 17 P,S. \u00a7 211.-503(a). See Commonwealth v. Learning, 442 Pa. 223, 225-26, 275 A.2d 43, 44 (1971):\n\u201cWe must address ourselves initially to the question of the appealability of the order granting the nolle prosequi. The Commonwealth asserts that the order is interlocutory, noting that appellant could raise his speedy trial claim if and when the Commonwealth petitions the trial court to remove the nolle prosequi and that the necessity for our review of the speedy trial issue would disappear altogether if appellant were to win an acquittal upon retrial.\n\u201cTo the extent that the constitutional guarantee of speedy trial reflects a desire to minimize the degree to which pretrial delay hampers an accused\u2019s ability to defend himself, appellant would indeed have an adequate opportunity to secure relief by appealing any subsequent conviction on the ground of prejudicial delay. However, the speedy trial guarantee is also much concerned with limiting the period of \u2018anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation.\u2019 United States v. Ewell, 383 U. S. 116, 120, 86 S.Ct. 773, 776, 15 L.Ed.2d 627 (1966), and, in this regard, quashing the instant appeal makes little sense. The logic of the Commonwealth\u2019s position allows for the possibility that appellant will be forced to live under the shadow of a pending indictment for years, and: appellate review after trial at the expiration of such a potentially long period can provide no effective remedy for the intervening anxiety and concern. Accordingly, even if the nolle prosequi order be interlocutory, the particular nature of the speedy trial issue presents \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 dictating appealability.\u201d\nCf. Commonwealth v. Bunter, 445 Pa. 413, 417, 282 A.2d 705, 707 (1971) (motion to quash indictment appealable interlocutory order). But cf. Commonwealth v. Barber, 461 Pa. 738, 337 A.2d 855 (1975) (motion to quash indictment not appealable order).\nWe note, with disapproval, that neither appellant nor the Commonwealth has provided the required jurisdictional statement in the briefs filed in this Court. See Pa.Sup.Ct.R. 47.\n. Pa.R.Crim.P. 314(a):\n\u201c(a) Upon application of the attorney for the Commonwealth, the court may, in open court, order a nolle prosequi notwithstanding the objection of any person.\u201d\n. Brief for Appellant at 7.\n. Appellant asserts no claim under either Pa.Const., art. I, \u00a7 9, nor under Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100. We, therefore, do not address these issues.\n. Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972).\n. Id. at 530-33, 92 S.Ct. at 2192-93.\n. A decision which reflected facts and events after January 8, 1973, would require us either to speculate what occurred after that date or to take evidence ourselves. Neither is an appropriate activity for an appellate court.\nIf the situation has changed between January 8, 1973, and the present, appellant is free under Pa.R.Crim.P. 304 to make a pretrial application to quash the indictment or for other relief. This factor distinguishes this case from Klopfer in which there was no way by which Klopfer could have the outstanding charges either tried or dismissed.\n. Appellant, in his brief with this Court, details the lapse of time between the Commonwealth\u2019s knowledge of his alleged participation in Miller\u2019s murder and his indictment. We do not consider this time in determining whether the delay was sufficient to trigger the full Barker analysis because the speedy trial protection afforded by the Federal Constitution applies only to delay between indictment and trial.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court recently held that the constitutional right to a speedy trial, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and held applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment only protects defendants from prosecutorial delay between indictment and trial. United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1972). The Court\u2019s decision in Marion rested in large part on the presence of statutes of limitations designed to protect defendants against pre-indictment delay . . . \u201d\nCommonwealth v. Cardonick, 448 Pa. 322, 333, 292 A.2d 402, 408 (1972).\n. For purposes of determining whether the full Barker analysis should be applied we take the total delay between indictment and the grant of the nolle prosequi. This initial determination looks only to the amount of delay. If the delay is sufficient to trigger the full analysis, we may then look to the causes of the delay to determine whether appellant\u2019s speedy trial rights have been infringed. Cf. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(d); Townsend, v. Superior Court, 15 Cal.3d 774, 126 Cal.Rptr. 251, 543 P.2d 607 (1975) [18 Crim.L. Rptr. 2368 (1975)].\n. See Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 531, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972).\n. Commonwealth DiPasquale, 431 Pa. 536, 541, 246 A.2d 431, 432 (1968):\n\u201cThe grant or refusal of a petition for a nolle pros and for a continuance lies within the sound discretion of the lower court, and its action will not be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d\n. See Commonwealth v. Leaming, 442 Pa. 223, 275 A.2d 43 (1971). In Learning we vacated the nolle prosequi because we found its grant to be an abuse of discretion. We remanded the case for a \u201cprompt trial or, failing that, for final dismissal of the charges.\u201d Appellant here is not entitled to the Learning relief because the record presents substantially different facts justifying the grant of the nolle prosequi.\n. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. DiPasquale, 431 Pa. 536, 246 A.2d 430 (1968).",

        "text": "NIX, Justice\n(dissenting).\nIn my judgment, the majority has failed to perceive the full thrust of appellant\u2019s due process claim. I believe appellant\u2019s position to be meritorious and therefore dissent.\nThe members of the majority focused upon the question of a speedy trial and concluded that the rights of the accused in that regard were adequately protected. While I do not find that result troublesome, I am concerned that no attention was given to the question of an accused\u2019s right to insist upon trial before his peers for the purpose of seeking public vindication once he has been formally charged with crime.\nThe protection of due process is not limited to possible threats against one\u2019s penal interest. The reputation of an individual is as precious as any interest and is ofttimes gained only after years of industry and restraint. Where a system permits that reputation to be sullied and stained through the government\u2019s virtually unfettered right to initiate prosecution, that system must also provide the person charged with an adequate opportunity for exoneration where the charges proved to be unwarranted or incapable of substantiation.\nTo allow the imposition of a nolle pros, over the objection of the accused, forecloses the right to effectively demonstrate the fallaciousness of the imputation occasioned by the institution of the original prosecution. Even where the possibility of further prosecution is foreclosed, the accused is not relieved of the stigma caused by the arrest and indictment. Where the action is terminated by a nolle pros, it is the decision of the prosecutor and not necessarily the innocence of the person that brings about the result. Where one has a trial before his peers, he is afforded the opportunity to affirmatively demonstrate his innocence.\nI am fully cognizant of the presumption of innocence. However, realistically we all must concede that this presumption alone is incapable of fully removing the stain. Due process must also provide a reciprocal right to the person charged to compel the Commonwealth to expose to public scrutiny the basis upon which the charges were brought, and also supply a forum in which testimony may be offered to refute the accusations and eradicate the suggestion of impropriety. The presumption of innocence requires the Commonwealth to prove guilt but it should not be construed as a basis for denying the defendant the right to affirmatively establish his innocence.\n. \u201cThe purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation.\u201d Shakespeare, King Richard II, Act I, Sc. 1.\n\u201cHe whose honour depends on the opinion of the mob must day by day strive with the greatest anxiety, act and scheme in order to retain his reputation. For the mob is varied and inconstant, and therefore if a reputation is not carefully preserved it dies quickly.\u201d Spinoza, Ethics, Prop. LVIII, Note.\n. Nor can it be argued that an adequate redress is provided by tort liability. In many instances one may be mistakenly charged with crime and yet not have available to him civil redress.",
