Anstine and Vivian D. Anstine (appellants) a variance from the terms of the York Township Zoning Ordinance of 1960.</p>
    <p id="b57-4" data-blocks='[["BL_57.8",57,[192,841,1148,584]]]'>The appellants purchased approximately two acres of land in York Township on December 19, 1959. At the time of purchase, the land was improved with a two-story block building, formerly used as a chicken house and hog pen. On February 2, 1960, York Township (Township) adopted a zoning ordinance, effective February 15, 1960, designating the zone in which appellants’ land was located as an “R-Residential” district. This ordinance prohibited the location of trailers<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> within an “R-Residential” district except in an authorized trailer camp.</p>

They applied to the Board on October 24, 1961 for a variance to continue to use and occupy the trailer or mobile-home as a residence and to improve it by placing it on a concrete foundation and adding to its exterior a patio, awning and other decorative features. A hearing was held and testimony was taken. The variance was refused because, according to the Board, appellants had failed to show that the ordinance would work an unnecessary hardship upon them. Appellants then appealed the Board’s decision to the Court of Common Pleas of York County and that court, without taking testimony, sustained the refusal of the variance <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>and the validity of the ordinance.

Section 704.1 of the York Township zoning ordinance of 1960 states: “Insofar as the provisions of this ordinance are concerned, <em>within an R-Residential District a trailer shall he considered as a particular type of dwelling use, </em>and shall be located only within a permitted trailer camp. <em>In all other districts, a trailer shall he considered as a single family detached dwelling, </em>and it shall conform to all regulations applicable to a single family dwelling for the district in which it is located.” (Emphasis supplied) Section 301.1 of the ordinance sets forth the use regulations within an R-Residential district as: “A Building may be erected or,used, and a lot or land may be used or occupied for any of the following purposes, and no other: 1. Single Family Detached or Semi-Detached Dwelling.” The effect of such ordinance provisions is to permit the location of a trailer or mobile home on single lots anywhere within the Township, except in an “R-Residential” district where they may be located only in trailer camps. Trailer camps may be located any where, in the township, provided certain conditions are met.</p>

Likewise, the interior plywood covering on the walls and floor of appellants’ dwelling and the insulation between the exterior covering and the interior covering are basically similar to the building materials which would be used in a conventional dwelling house. The living space within the mobile home consists of a living room-dining room, a kitchen -with a double sink, hot and cold running water, a four-burner gas stove, a bathroom with a regular size bath tub, lavatory, commode and hot and cold running water. Appellants’ two children sleep in the 8' x 8' bedroom and appellants sleep on a roll-out bed in the adequately furnished living room. The mobile home- is equipped with city water facilities, electricity, telephone service, a septic tank located beneath <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>the mobile home and a fuel oil heating unit and it presently rests on concrete blocks and is surrounded by two acres of land. Appellants have specifically requested the Township for permission to remove the wheels presently attached to the undercarriage of the mobile home and to place the structure on a concrete block foundation. Thus, the mobile home will be rendered immobile and will be permanently affixed to the block structure. A 12' x 15' cement patio with a 2' wall constructed on either side and an awning to cover the patio is planned. The record shows that this structure could be moved after these improvements are effected only with the same degree of difficulty and harm to the structure as would accompany the moving of a conventional dwelling house.</p>

The question of what best serves the public interest is primarily a question for the decision of the appropriate legislative body in a given situation, but whether a zoning ordinance operates in an arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or confiscatory manner as to the property in question calls for judicial determination: <em>Bilbar Construction Co. v. Easttown Twp. Board of Adjustment, </em>supra. In our opinion, a review of the record shows that the refusal to grant appellants permission to improve their mobile home is arbitrary and discriminatory. Only single family dwellings are allowed within the R-Residential District and, if appellants are permitted to go forward with their improvements, the resulting structure clearly would be a single family dwelling, albeit a small dwelling, within the definition of the ordinance. Their plans involve the removal of the mobile home’s undercarriage to which the wheels are attached and the bolting of the structure to a concrete block foundation and the proposed addition of a concrete patio covered by an aluminum awning clearly creates a <em>fixed </em>rather than a <em>mobile </em>structure. The <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>record shows that the structural construction of this home differs from that of a conventional home only to the extent that it is of a smaller scale; The. degree of difficulty in physically moving the structure is the same.- Setting aside for the moment all' niceties of definition, appellants’ request envisions the maintenance of a permanent and immobile house within this residential area.</p>
    <p id="b62-4" data-blocks='[["BL_62.4",62,[242,786,1148,1398]]]'>In <em>every other zoned district </em>in York Township, a trailer or a mobile-home is to be considered a single family dwelling house merely by fiat of the ordinance's definition. It is arbitrary, therefore, to deny this status to a mobile home in an R-Residential area which in fact is no longer able to be drawn by a vehicle and to a mobile-home rendered structurally immobile. There is in this ordinance no restraint on the use of trailers or mobile-homes other than by way of definition and there is established no minimum square footage for all single family dwelling houses as has been held to be a valid zoning standard in this Commonwealth: <em>Lower Merion Township v.

The facilities in this home and its physical structure are clearly adequate and any dangers inherent in this dwelling would most likely be found in a conventional home of the same dimensions. If this is so, the zoning ordinance should apply to all dwellings of the same or similar size, irrespective of any differences in basic construction. The record before us does not show that the improvement of appellants’ dwelling will cause greater traffic congestion in York Township nor is there any showing that it will create a greater risk of fire danger than conventional dwellings.

Thus, the Township would have us <em>presume </em>that the style or design of a mobile home per se detracts from the aesthetic characteristics of the community and, accordingly reduces neighboring property values and that a conventional dwelling house, no matter its unattractiveness, will not have the same effect. This is clear error. We are bound to look no further than the record before us. This record does not reveal whether appellants’ requested improvement will or will not enhance the aesthetic characteristics of the neighborhood and the only evidence relating to the concept of aesthetics is the testimony of a realtor to the effect that the improvement of appellants’ dwelling would hide an existing concrete block structure used as a hobby shop and <em>to that extent </em>aesthetically <em>enhance </em>the area. An expert testifying for appellants stated that the improved structure would increase the value of appellants’ property and that it “will tend to make it [the immediate area] more óf a residential area”. In effect, this testimony amounted to an expert’s <em>opinion </em>of the favorable impact of <em>this </em>property use on this immediate neighborhood. A party protesting the permit testified that he had <em>heard </em>that the value of adjoining properties had depreciated $2,000 since the placing of the mobile home on appellants’ property.

Buckingham Township Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em>supra). A reading of the York Township ordinance of 1960 shows that the Township legislative body envisions that in the future the designated "R-Residential" district will remain agricultural with single family detached or semi-detached dwellings. In <em>Schmalz v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em>supra, at p. 302, it was stated: "We must determine the reasonableness of the regulation as it applies to conditions <em>now existent." </em>The record shows that the area presently surrounding appellants' property is a conglomeration of commercial, agricultural and residential properties. To the east and south of appellants' land is farm land upon which corn and wheat are grown. To the west are three properties: (1) land improved with a single family dwelling and truck garage upon which a baking business is conducted; (2) land upon which a dwelling is located together with a parking lot for <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>trucks and farm equipment upon which ponies are raised and a landscaping business conducted; (3) land upon which a dwelling is located, two-story chicken coops housing 6,000 chickens, a stable for horses and ponies together with areas for pasturing ponies and sheep. The conclusion is inescapable that the township ordinance as it affects appellants' property and environs is attempting to develop an agricultural and residential area out of what is presently a <em>commercial, </em>agricultural and residential area. To argue that the improvement of appellants' mobile home will lower the character of the neighborhood by its nonconformance with adjoining properties is to argue against the physical facts revealed by this record.</p>

I am fearful that this holding may be misconstrued to mean that under no circumstances can a community regulate the placement and existence of trailer homes. The majority opinion points out that no competent evidence was produced to show that the placement of this trailer had any deleterious effect up<a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>on the aesthetics of the community, or that it had any unfavorable impact upon property values.
