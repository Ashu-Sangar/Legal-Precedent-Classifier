This appeal followed. This is the second such action instituted by the appellant. His previous request for a writ of habeas corpus, filed on April 6, 1959, was also denied by the lower court and its action affirmed by this Court on appeal: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Ryan v.

This is reasserted in the present action. The record of the proceedings belie appellant’s factual allegations in this regard. The correct facts are recited and were carefully considered in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Ryan v. Banmiller, </em>supra, and no further discussion of this issue is required here. It is devoid of merit.</p>

In each instance, they allege error in the conduct of the trial.

Jur. § 571, p. 264, and cases therein cited. Its essential elements are `notice and opportunity to be heard and to defend in an orderly proceeding adapted to the nature of the case before a tribunal having jurisdiction of the cause': 12 Am. Jur. § 573, pp. 267, 268." Assessment of the presence of due process is to be tested by an appraisal of the totality of the facts in a given case. See, <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em><a href="/us/372/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="372 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="1765333" data-case-paths="/us/372/0335-01">372 U.S. 335</a> (1963). Stated another way, the test is whether or not the thing complained of is so flagrantly unjust that the Constitution of the United States steps in to forbid it. See, <em>Snyder v. Mass., </em><a href="/us/291/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="291 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="1498121" data-case-paths="/us/291/0097-01">291 U.S. 97</a> (1924).

The juror in question at first indicated that she had a "definite opinion" in the case. How<a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>ever, subsequent questions and answers clearly indicated that she did not know anything about the occurrence involved. She stated unequivocally that she could and would render a verdict based solely upon the evidence presented at trial. Defendant's own counsel was so satisfied with her answers that he accepted her without objection and stated, "The defense has no challenge." Hence, the court was not asked to rule upon a challenge for cause since none was entered and the juror was accepted without objection by both sides. Further, at the time of this juror's acceptance for service, the defense had only exercised two of the twenty peremptory challenges allowed by legislative enactment in a case of this nature. In fact, the defendant exercised only a total of fifteen peremptory challenges before twelve members of the panel and two alternate jurors were accepted. There is not a semblance of merit to appellant's present contention. See, <em>Commonwealth v.
