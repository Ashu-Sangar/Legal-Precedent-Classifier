In the first situation, the element of finality inherent in the order of suppression is apparent and sufficient to render the order appealable. In the second situation, although the element of finality in the order is not so apparent, it is nevertheless present. Without a right of appeal in the Commonwealth in the second situation, the Commonwealth is completely deprived of <em>any opportunity </em>to secure an appellate court evaluation of the validity of the order of suppression which forces the Commonwealth to trial without <em>all </em>of its evidence. The evidence suppressed may well mark the difference between success and failure in the prosecution; to deny the Commonwealth its only opportunity of securing an appellate review to determine whether the evidence was properly suppressed is highly unfair to the Commonwealth and the interests of society which it represents. In our zeal to protect and preserve for the accused every constitutional right to which he is entitled we <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>too often forget and neglect to preserve the rights of society which, too, are entitled to consideration. An appellate review of the validity of the order of. suppression cannot harm the defendant whereas the denial of the right to such review does harm the Commonwealth. In <em>both </em>factual situations the practical, effects of an order granting the suppression of evidence give to the order such an attribute of finality as to justify the grant of the right of appeal to the Commonwealth, in both situations.</p>
    <p id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.5",86,[240,887,1147,907]]]'>The right of appeal by a defendant stands upon an entirely different footing. The denial of a defendant’s motion for the suppression of evidence does not deprive; a, defendant of an appellate review, of the validity of that order. At trial, the defendant still has full opportunity to object to the introduction into evidence of the allegedly improper evidence and, in the event of his conviction, he will then have an opportunity to secure an appellate evaluation of the propriety and admissibility of such evidence. Therefore, unlike the Commonwealth, an adverse pretrial disposition of a motion to suppress, evidence does not deprive the defendant of his only opportunity for appellate review. Under such circumstances, the element of finality, which is the basis of appealability, is lacking in an order denying suppression and the defendant should have no right of appeal from such order.</p>

        <em>Mapp </em>singles out for recognition the action of California in 1955 in its adoption of the exclusionary rule <em>(People v. Cahan, </em><a href="/cal-2d/44/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="44 Cal. 2d 434" data-case-ids="4373278" data-case-paths="/cal-2d/44/0434-01">44 Cal. 2d 434</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20P.2d%20905" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="282 P.2d 905">282 P. 2d 905</a>), yet California, in its application, of -the exclusion rule, follows its own conception of what constitutes a reasonable search' and seizure rather than the substantially different federal standards <em>(People v.
