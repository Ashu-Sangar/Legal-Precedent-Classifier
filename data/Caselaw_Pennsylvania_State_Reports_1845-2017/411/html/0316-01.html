Under this so-called Service Agreement, the County, in order to make the project for the municipalities economically feasible,, sets forth its willingness to aid the municipalities in providing sewers and sewer treatment services until such time as the number of connections in the municipalities’ collections systems has increased sufficiently to make such county aid unnecessary and to this end will provide county funds intended to be sufficient to maintain the rates of the Authority to the municipalities at not more than a certain number of dollars per equivalent residential unit. In line with that purpose, the County, under the Service Agreement, for each fiscal year will determine in advance the amount which the Authority will require during each fiscal year to meet all of its obligations under the Neshaminy Sewer Project and the amount of the Authority’s revenues and other.monies which might be available to meet the obligations of the Authority for the project “assuming the Authority’s equivalent residential unit rate at the above amount”; the County will then include in its annual budget an amount equal to the difference between the latter and <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>former amounts and <em>from current revenues </em>will appropriate such amount to the municipalities to be allocated in the proportion that the number of residential equivalent unit connections to the collection systems in each municipality bears to the total of all connections of all the municipalities. The Service Agreement provides for an agreement by the municipalities that any and all County appropriations shall be paid <em>directly </em>to the Authority and for the purpose of such payments the municipalities will designate the Authority as their agent. By resolution, the County hás expressed its intent to approve such appropriations which do not exceed, on the average, $120,000 per year over a ten year period.</p>

MacCalman and Barbara MacCalman, his wife, as property owners, residents and taxpayers of the County, instituted an action in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County against the County, its commissioners and the Authority seeking to enjoin the County and its commissioners (a) from entering into the Service Agreement or making any appropriations thereunder and (b) from approving payments to be made from county funds under said agreement and to enjoin the Authority from expending any monies paid by the County under said agreement.</p>

Mac-Caimans’ contentions are three-fold: (1) that a third class county cannot lawfully make appropriations “to” a municipality within the county, but <em>payable </em>to a municipality Authority formed by the county, and to be applied by such Authority toward the amortization of the costs of the sewage facilities owned by the Authority and the sewage treatment costs, thus reducing the Authority’s charges to the municipality for the use of the Authority’s facilities; (2) if the County can make such appropriations, the present county commissioners cannot bind their successors in office to make such appropriations in future_ years; (3) if they can, the action of the present commissioners <em>constitutes </em>an unlawful incurring of indebtedness by the County to the extent of the total maximum appropriations which The County is committed to make.</p>
