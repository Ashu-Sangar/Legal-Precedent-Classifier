Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/388/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="388 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1272551" data-case-paths="/pa/388/0539-01">388 Pa. 539</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.2d%20695" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="130 A.2d 695">130 A. 2d 695</a> (1957). The merits of the controversy and the interpretation given to the facts or the law by the court below may not be reviewed: <em>Raby v.

Appeal, </em>supra, this Court ruled that the statute does not give the court of quarter sessions the power to <em>abolish </em>a ward (containing three hundred and fifty electors or more) even though the abolishment be accomplished by a consolidation, and that such action would be contrary to Section 401 of the act. It is asserted herein that <em>Scott </em>is controlling because the <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>court, in the instant case, abolished two wards by consolidating” them into a new proposed ward. We:do. not so interpret the court’s action. <em>Scott </em>is materially distinguishable.</p>
    <p id="AJb" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[245,566,1077,42]],["BL_251.5",251,[173,620,1150,531]]]'>Harrison Township before the present proceeding consisted of five wards. Under the court's order, it will still consist of five wards. There is no reduction in number. More significantly, no wards were abolished, eliminated, or in fact consolidated. They were merely rearranged or redivided. The geographical boundaries were realigned. This the court below clearly had power to do. There is a difference between "consolidation" and "redivision" or "rearrangement." See, <em>Independent District of Fairview v. Durland, </em><a href="/iowa/45/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="45 Iowa 53" data-case-ids="2312643" data-case-paths="/iowa/45/0053-01">45 Iowa 53</a> (1876).</p>
    <p id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.6",251,[173,1163,1152,583]]]'>The second question presented by this appeal is more difficult. As noted, supra, the township previously consisted of and will now comprise five wards. By virtue of §504 of the Act of 1931, supra, as, amended, 53. P.S. §55504, one commissioner is elected from each ward and is required to reside in the ward he represents. Section 504 specifically directs that the commissioners from the odd-numbered wards shall be elected in a different year than that in which the commissioners from the even-numbered wards are elected. The term is fixed at four years.</p>
    <p id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.7",251,[173,1759,1148,587]],["BL_252.1",252,[239,348,1146,371]]]'>The status of the commissioners for wards one, three and five expire in January 1964, and remain unaffected by this proceeding. Likewise, the status of the commissioner for ward two is not disturbed since he continues to live in the same ward under , the new arrangement. However, the commissioner now serving in the fourth ward will reside in the first ward under the new geographical set-up. His tenure of office expires on the first Monday of January 1965, and cannot be ended or reduced by any directive in this proceeding. In order to give the newly proposed fourth ward repre<a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>sentation by an individual actually residing therein, and to retain the harmonious schedule of commissioner elections provided for by the statute, the court below directed that a commissioner be elected this year from the fourth ward for a two-year term. Appellant contends that this exceeded the statutory authority. We must agree.</p>
    <p id="b252-4" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[238,728,1149,695]]]'>A careful reading of the statute discloses that it vests no authority in the court to order an election of a commissioner for a two-year term, except in the instances wherein: (1) a township is first divided into wards (Act of June 24; 1931, supra, §407, 53 P.S. §55407); (2) a new ward is created and the township previously had less than five wards. (See, §408, as amended, 53 P.S. §55408). The provisions are not pertinent to the situation with which we are herein concerned. If a vacancy exists the power of appointment first vests in the Board of Commissioners. See, Act of June 24, 1931, supra, §530, as amended, 53 P.S. §55530.</p>
    <p id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[311,1435,842,43]]]'>As modified, the order below is affirmed.</p>
