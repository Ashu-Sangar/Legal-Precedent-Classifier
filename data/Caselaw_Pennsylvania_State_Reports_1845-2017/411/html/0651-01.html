    <p id="b674-8" data-blocks='[["BL_674.10",674,[245,1050,1146,313]]]'>The appellant, Murray Dickerson, was tried and convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree. The punishment was fixed at life imprisonment. On appeal to this Court, the judgment of sentence was affirmed: <em>Commonwealth v. Dickerson, </em><a href="/pa/406/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="406 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1304933" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0102-01">406 Pa. 102</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.2d%20421" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="176 A.2d 421">176 A. 2d 421</a> (1962).</p>

At that time, the same questions now raised were considered with great care, adequately discussed and rejected for lack of merit. Additional consideration at this time merely fortifies our previous conclusions. Further discussion now would tend to be repetitious and serve no useful purpose. Since no issue of fact needs to be resolved and the allegations of the petition are insufficient to warrant the granting of a writ of habeas corpus, the petition was properly dismissed without hearing: <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
