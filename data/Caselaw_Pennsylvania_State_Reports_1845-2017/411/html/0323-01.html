Skoda, Jr., at the time of his death was 35 years old, he was employed by the National Mines Corporation as a mechanic for about ten years. His place of employment was in and about the garage building, repair shop and other buildings of National Mines in Luzerne Township, Fayette County. On June 24, 1957, the day of the accident, he was engaged with another employee in repairing a fuel tank on -a 22 ton Euclid dump truck, which was used exclusively on the premises of National <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>Mines for the purpose of hauling mine refuse from the mine opening to the slate dump. It was necessary to remove the fuel tank from the body of the truck and in order to do so the truck body was elevated hydraulically and then a timber was wedged under the body to prevent it from falling while the tank was removed. The truck was placed over an underground fuel tank, near the entrance to the mine garage, to drain the fuel from the truck before removing it for the repairs. It became necessary to move the truck in order for other trucks to have access to the underground fuel tank.</p>

Robert Pierno, a fellow employee, slowly drove the truck in reverse while watching Skoda’s feet. The truck was moving backwards with the body in the upright position, Pierno watching Skoda’s feet, when the topmost part of the body, known as the truck cab protector, came in. contact with a high tension wire. Pierno heard a hissing sound and stopped the truck and, alighting, saw decedent on the ground enveloped in fire. The fire was extinguished with the help of other employees and Skoda was taken to the hospital where he died as a result of the burns on August 17, 1957.</p>

The electrical lines of the appellant supplied the electricity to National Mines, which lines were carried by means of poles to a transformer station, which was a brick structure with an enclosed area in which were poles and transformers. The wires were between 20 and 21 feet from the ground, copper and uninsulated. The top of the dump truck, with the bed extended at the- time of the accident, was 20 to 21 feet from the <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>ground. The truck bed extended approximately 3 to 5 inches aboye the wire at the point of contact. The truck stopped with the bed between the first and second wire, contact having been made with the first wire. The vehicle was equipped with large rubber tires. The truck was backed approximately 93 feet from where it was at the garage to the point of contact with the electrical wire. The poles supporting the wires to the transformer yard had a span of approximately 154 feet. There would be a normal sag in the line which would vary somewhat with the temperature.</p>

The lubrication of the trucks generally took place in the garage and outside the doors on an apron which extended about 55 feet from the garage door towards the transformer station. The trucks were washed at a place nearer the transformer station and closer to the overhead electric wires and the trucks were sometimes parked in the vicinity of the transformer yard and had sometimes been parked under the wires with the bodies in a flat position. The area in which the trucks were lubricated, which operation required the extension of the bodies, was approximately 60 feet from the high tension wires, and the area in which the trucks were washed, also with the bodies extended, was nearer to the wires.</p>
