    <p id="b379-6" data-blocks='[["BL_379.9",379,[172,1271,1150,370]]]'>Amp for some time has been engaged in the operation of manufacturing plants at various locations, one being located at Selinsgrove, Snyder County. In September, 1958, Swank was hired by Amp at its Selinsgrove plant and she remained an employee of Amp until September 16, 1960 at which time she was laid off due to changes by Amp in its production methods.</p>
    <p id="b379-7" data-blocks='[["BL_379.10",379,[170,1660,1148,422]],["BL_380.1",380,[248,343,1146,477]]]'>In this equity action, Swank alleged that, when she was employed, Amp, through fully authorized representatives, agreed that, after a 90 day probationary period, she would become a permanent employee and that, under an oral contract with Amp, when she had successfully completed the probationary period, she would be . . entitled to seniority as of the date of hire, to promotion based on seniority, and ... to <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>have seniority govern when the working forces of [Amp] were reduced and, if laid off, ... to be given an opportunity to return to service in the order of said seniority . . .”; that this oral contract as it related to seniority was breached. In answer thereto, Amp alleged that no such oral contract was entered into and that the only commitment made by Amp to Swank was that she could become entitled to so-called “service credit” in her employment.</p>
    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[243,829,1150,750]]]'>In short, Swank takes the position that, when she was employed, she had an oral contract with Amp that she would be given seniority rights on a “plant wide” basis under which her seniority rights would depend upon only one factor, i.e., <em>length of service in the plant, </em>while Amp takes the position that its only commitment to Swank was that, in the event of layoffs or rehiring, she would be entitled to the so-called “service credit” policy of Amp under which various factors, such as length of service in the plant, skill, versatility, experience and physical capacity, would be considered in determining the order in which Swank would be laid off or rehired and that the length of service in the plant was not the <em>only </em>factor to be considered.</p>
    <p id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.6",380,[243,1590,1148,684]]]'>The matter was tried in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County before the Honorable Carl B. Shelley as chancellor. The chancellor, after the taking of testimony, found that Amp had made no oral contract with Swank, at the time she was hired, that she would be entitled to so-called “plant wide” seniority but that Amp’s only, agreement was that Swank would be laid off and rehired on the basis of its so-called “service credit” policy, and the chancellor, upon such findings, dismissed the complaint. The court en banc entered a decree affirming the findings, conclusions and action of the chancellor and from that decree this appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b380-7" data-blocks='[["BL_380.7",380,[245,2294,1144,97]],["BL_381.1",381,[160,338,1150,804]]]'>The nub' of this controversy is whether, at the time Swank was hired, Amp orally contracted with her that, <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>in the event she was laid off or in the event of rehiring, she would be entitled to seniority on a “plant wide” basis. The chancellor found: [Finding of Fact] “12. [Amp] did not, through any of its employees who interviewed [Swank] at the time of [her] employment or through any of its employees who later discussed the terms of [her] employment with [her], ever represent to [Swank] in any way that ‘plant-wide seniority’ or length of employment would at any time be the sole factor determining the order in which production employees would be laid off if that step should prove necessary or the order in which former production employees would be rehired.” That finding was arrived at after the chancellor had seen and heard the witnesses for the several parties.</p>
