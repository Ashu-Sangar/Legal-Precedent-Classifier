    <p id="b671-6" data-blocks='[["BL_671.9",671,[186,922,1148,478]]]'>Appellant in May 1949, was tried and convicted by a jury on eight bills of indictment charging armed robbery and was sentenced to a term of 80-160 Years. On July 1, 1949, he was tried and convicted by a jury of first degree murder occurring during a robbery on March 12, 1949, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. A motion for a new trial was filed, but was subsequently withdrawn. No appeal was prosecuted from the judgment of sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

    <p id="b671-7" data-blocks='[["BL_671.10",671,[186,1410,1148,315]]]'>On July 1, 1958, the appellant applied for a writ of habeas corpus in the courts of Philadelphia County, which was dismissed. On appeal, this Court affirmed the action of the court below: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Norman v.

Nothing new is added. In that proceeding, they were carefully considered by this Court and rejected for lack of merit. See, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Norman v. Banmiller, </em>supra.

This Court over the years has ruled that habeas corpus is not a substitute for an appeal, or a writ of error, or for a motion for a new trial: <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

However, we have also judiciously held that if the record shows a trial or sentence which was so fundamentally unfair as to amount to a denial of due process, or where the record shows that some basic fundamental error was committed which deprived a person of his constitutional rights, relief may be sought by habeas corpus: <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
