Smith two residents of the City of Reading, disappeared from their respective homes. Police officers who were investigating these disappearances ultimately learned that appellant had had some business relations with Mrs. Klein. Appellant was a general contractor and painter. He had discussed with her some alterations she wished to have made in her house. On July 15th, September 13th, and October 20th, 1960, the officers spoke to appellant about Mrs. Klein’s disappearance. On the first two of these occasions appellant had stated that he knew nothing about the whereabouts of Mrs. Klein. However,- during his interview with the police on October 20th, he said: “I don’t know why you are bothering me all the time. Why don’t you check with Clement Smith?”</p>

When asked what had become of Smith, Mrs. Messner stated that late in February or early in March of 1960, Smith “just went off” and she had never seen him again. When asked what happened to Smith’s effects, Mrs.- Messner testified that in March of 1960 the appellant had appeared at her rooming house having in his possession keys both to her front door and to Smith’s room. She had never given these <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>keys to appellant. He told her that he was “supposed to take Mr. Smith’s belongings out and also his mail.” Mrs. Messner requested appellant to obtain proper authorization from Smith.</p>

A few days later, on March 26, 1960, appellant returned to Mrs. Messner’s premises, paid her $4.50 for a week’s rent on Smith’s behalf, plus $18.50 for other items, for all of which she gave him a receipt. Mrs. Messner thereupon permitted appellant to remove Smith’s mail and furniture, for which he gave her a receipt.</p>

Captain Feltman, Chief of the Reading Police, then informed appellant that he (Feltman) would have to obtain a search warrant to examine appellant’s premises, known as the Englewood Tennis Club, which was both his home and place of business. Appellant replied that a search Avarrant Avould not be necessary and that Captain Feltman might search the premises as much as he wished, so long as he put everything back where he had found it. Appellant then delivered to Captain Feltman the keys to his premises.</p>

Being convinced that appellant was not telling them the truth, the officers immediately (viz., on November 19th) obtained additional warrants for appellant’s arrest and took him to State Police Barracks for further interrogation. In the course of such interrogation, which was taken down stenograpkically, appellant admitted knowledge of the deaths of both Mrs. Klein and Smith. At this interrogation he stated that on an unspecified date in March of 1960 Smith had appeared at appellant’s premises in an automobile which contained the dead body of Mrs. Klein. According to appellant, Smith stated that he had stolen the automobile in Baltimore. Appellant said he had had an argument with Smith arising out of appellant’s objections to Smith’s bringing Mrs. Klein’s body to appellant’s home. In the course of this argument Smith menaced appellant with the latter’s single barreled 12-gauge shotgun and while the two men were struggling for possession of this weapon, it was accidentally discharged, wounding but not killing Smith. Defendant then said that he had killed Smith with another shell “to put him out of his misery.” Appellant further admitted that he had subsequently <em>buried both bodies on his premises. </em>He also admitted that he had written the above-mentioned card which was sent to Mrs. Messner, and added that he also had sent letters to friends and acquaintances of Mrs. Klein which were intended to allay their concern about her disappearance.</p>

The bodies of Smith and Mrs. Klein were found in a common grave in an advanced state of decomposition and putrefaction. That one body was that of a woman was established by hair which was still connected to the skull; that the other body was that of Smith was established by his dentist and by clothing which was recognized by a member of Smith’s family. When Smith’s body was examined by a pathologist, he found in the body wadding from a shotgun charge. The presence of shotgun pellets in Smith’s body was shown and proved by X-rays.</p>

On December 9, 1960, the police therefore again interrogated appellant concerning the circumstances of the deaths of Mrs. Klein and Smith. Appellant then gave a different account of the death of Mrs. Klein. In this second statement he abandoned-his original story that Smith had brought Mrs. Klein’s dead body to the Tennis Club. Instead, the story he now told was that he himself had taken her to the Tennis Club in his automobile on a particular Sunday in order that they might more conveniently discuss the carpentry work he was planning to do for her. Later that evening Smith unexpectedly dropped in to pay a visit. According to appellant, Smith and Mrs. Klein commenced a romantic affair which continued until late the following Thursday or Friday. He found them occupying the same bed Sunday night and Monday morning. Between Sunday night and late Thursday or <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>Friday, appellant was away from Ms home during worMng hours. However, while he was at home, in the mornings and evenings, he found them still in his house some of the time they were drinMng together, and some of the time they were sleeping together. Far more important, he stated that on his return to his home late on Thursday or Friday, Smith took him to a bedroom and showed him Mrs. Klein’s dead body. Appellant said Smith told him Mrs. Klein had died of natural causes. Appellant in this, <em>Ms second statement, </em>gave the same account as before concerning his subsequent argument with Smith, in the course of which Smith had threatened appellant with the latter’s single barreled .12-gauge shotgun and while he and Smith were struggling for possession of the gun, it was accidentally discharged, killing Smith. However, in this second statement appellant denied that he deliberately fired a second shot and thus Mlled Smith. He again admitted burying the two bodies. At the trial appellant’s testimony was' the same as his above-mentioned second statement.</p>

Following appellant’s consent to a search of his premises and his delivery to Captain Feltman of the keys to such premises, appellant turned over to Captain Felt-man a 12-gauge single barrel shotgun, while the police and the appellant were at the Tennis Club. The police also found a box of “pumpkin ball” shells and another <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>box of Winchester shells. Moreover, the shotgun and the shells were admitted in evidence <em>without objection </em>on the part of appellant’s competent counsel.

Realizing that some of the jurors might feel an obligation to attend Church on Sunday, the Court interrogated the jurors and found that the Roman Catholic members desired to attend Church. After giving the matter careful thought Judge Hess then announced that the Roman Catholic jurors, accompanied by a bailiff, could attend the 9 o’clock mass at St. Paul’s Roman Catholic Church. Judge Hess stated that he would call Father Huesman, the pastor of that Church, in order that the Catholic jurors would sit by themselves, speak to no one, including the pastor himself, and that he (Father Huesman) should refrain from any reference to the trial. From the record it would appear that the appellant personally agreed to this arrangement. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to show that the Catholic jurors availed themselves of the opportunity for Church attendance which the Court had sanctioned. Nevertheless appellant asked for the withdrawal of a juror and contends that (a) regardless of consent and (b) regardless of the record, there should be a new trial because the Court permitted a separation of the jury in a murder trial.</p>

      <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>We agree with the trial Judge that the evidence as to the temporary separations of the jury in the instant case showed that there had been no prejudice to the appellant, and we are convinced that the trial Judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to grant a new trial because of the separation of the jury either in Church or in the barber shop. However, we deem it proper to add that in a case where an accused is charged with murder the general rule should be strictly followed whenever reasonably possible, and that a jury should be kept together and free from even a suspicion of improper influence.</p>
    <p id="b481-3" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[160,1002,1150,262]]]'>Appellant had a fair trial and is fortunate that the jury brought in a verdict of murder in the second degree. The Commonwealth’s evidence, if believed, was amply sufficient to prove that appellant was guilty of murder in the first degree.</p>

They asked for and received from him two documents, (apparently) relating to his dealings with Mrs. Klein. When appellant was cross-examined concerning these papers at the trial, the papers themselves and evidence concerning them were excluded by the Court on defendant’s complaint that interrogation on the subject might incriminate him on the separate crime of forgery.</p>
