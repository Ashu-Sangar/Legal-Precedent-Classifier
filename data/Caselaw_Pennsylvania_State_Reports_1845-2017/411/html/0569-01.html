On July 1, 1943, January 3, 1944 and January 2, 1945, appellant purchased five, two and two additional shares, respectively, of appellee’s stock. On each of these stock certificates, the same notice of subjectivity to the April 11, 1942 agreement was noted. Some time between January of 1946 and 1950, the testimony on the point being extremely vague, appellant surrendered his stock certificates to appellee. The certificates were returned to him with the word “Void” written across the notice of subjectivity to the April 11, 1942 agreement and with the following notation on them: “This certificate is held subject to the right of Bechtel, Lutz &amp; Jost, Inc. to purchase the shares represented by this certificate upon the death of the registered owner hereof, or upon the registered owner hereof ceasing to be in the employ of Bechtel, Lutz &amp; Jost, Inc. The price shall be the book value of said shares. Agreed to. J.

At the time the plaintiff agreed to the second notation quoted above, changing the contractual obligation of defendant to purchase the stock to an option or right to purchase said stock, the defendant had a clear right to discharge the plaintiff from its employ had it chosen to exercise this right.

Some time elapsed, they were handed back to me. Q. By whom? A. Mr. Lanshe. With the top paragraph marked ‘void’, and the new paragraph underneath. I did not examine that second paragraph as closely as I should have, I did not notice that there was a deviation in the meaning, but having full trust and faith in Mr. Bechtel, and Bechtel, Lutz &amp; Jost, I signed them, and the certificates were given back to me.

What is the use of having a clear written agreement if one of the parties thereto can legally repudiate and escape it by saying that he did not read it as closely as he should have, or did not notice what it said or clearly understand what was so clearly set forth therein? What was this Chinese word which was so difficult for appellant to understand? The word “Void”, a word which a fourteen year old boy could understand, was written in enormous letters on plaintiff’s stock certificate, and his new certificates gave defendants an option to purchase plaintiff’s stock. How naive or how stupid can we permit an intelligent man to be, especially when his alleged naiveté or gross negligence permits him to circumvent and make a mockery of the parol evidence rule which for nearly forty years the Courts have so strongly endeavored to uphold against many attempted breaches or erosions.</p>
