Detective Raifer examined the automobile and its glove compartment and kept the automobile under surveillance until about 8:15 a.m. on that date, at which time the car trunk was examined and, in addition to tools, a fruit basket and construction paraphernalia, there was found a “two gallon Gulf, blue and orange . . . gasoline can that was lying on its side” and under it “. . . a wet spot-on top of the fruit basket. . . which smelled like gasoline” together with “a roll of sort of pale, green toilet paper, and,' on the edge of the roll, itself, there, were charred marks, charred as if. from fire.” The trunk was then closed and its contents left undisturbed.</p>

Such holding is directly contrary to the federal cases on this point. The federal law is summarized as follows: “All the cases in which a ‘tip’ has been heavily relied upon to establish probable cause have stressed the need for ‘a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay,’ (citing a case), or a record of ‘accurate and reliable information,’ (citing a case) ; in short, ‘a previously reliable informant,’ (citing a case).

The meaning and rationale behind the search incident, to arrest doctrine— the only occasion under federal law where, a search can be conducted without a warrant—is not to be sought in the Oxford English Dictionary, as the. majority-does, but rather in the considerable body of federal law dealing with that concept. The two. purposes of the rule are to protect the arresting officer from bodily harm, and. to prevent the defendant from destroying evidence which is “within his control.” See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rabinowitz, </em><a href="/us/339/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="339 U.S. 56" data-case-ids="362582" data-case-paths="/us/339/0056-01">339 U.S. 56</a> (1950). Where, as here, the defendant has been in custody for <em>24 </em>hours the rule is obviously inapplicable. <em>Agnello v</em>. <em>United States, </em><a href="/us/269/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="269 U.S. 20" data-case-ids="186310" data-case-paths="/us/269/0020-01">269 U.S. 20</a> (1925).</p>

Although <em>Rabinowitz </em>-holds that it is not necessary for the prosecution to justify in each case the failure to obtain a search warrant, the failure to secure a warrant where, as in the instant case, one could easily, be obtained without danger of a disappearance of the evidence, is a factor in determining <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>the validity of the search and seizure.
