What is an accident? Everyone knows what an accident is until the word comes up in court. Then it becomes a mysterious phenomenon, and, in order to resolve the <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>enigma, witnesses are summoned, experts testify, lawyers argue, treatises are consulted and even when a conclave of twelve world-knowledgeable individuals agree as to whether a certain set of facts made out an accident, the question may not yet be settled and it must be reheard in an appellate court. An accident simply stated, is merely an unanticipated event; it is something which occurs not as the result of natural routine but as the culmination of forces working without design, coordination or plan. And the more disorganized the forces, the more confusedly they operate, the more indiscriminately haphazard the clash and intermingling, the more perfect is the resulting accident.</p>
    <p id="b435-3" data-blocks='[["BL_435.4",435,[155,1047,1151,1294]],["BL_436.1",436,[258,351,1147,252]]]'>In the case of <em>Western Commercial Travelers’ Assn. v. Smith, </em><a href="/f/85/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="85 F. 401" data-case-ids="7852473" data-case-paths="/f/85/0401-01">85 Fed. 401</a>, the insured sustained an abrasion on his foot as the result of wearing new shoes. Although he gave the abrasion reasonable attention, it nevertheless caused blood poisoning from which he died. The question arose as to whether the production of the abrasion resulted from accidental means. Circuit Judge Sanborn of the Eight United States Circuit, discussed accidents as follows: “An effect which is the natural and probable consequence of an act or course of action is not an accident, nor is it produced by accidental means. It is either the result of acutal design, or it falls under the maxim that every man must be held to intend the natural and probable consequence of his deeds. “On the other hand, an effect which is not the natural or probable consequence of the means which produced it, an effect which does not ordinarily follow and <em>cannot be reasonably anticipated from the use of those means, </em>an effect which the actor did not intend to produce and which he cannot be charged with the design of producing ... is produced by accidental means. It is produced by means which were neither designed nor calculated to cause it. Such an effect is not the result of design, cannot be reasonably anticipated, is un<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>expected, and is produced by an unusual combination of fortuitous circumstances; in other words, it is produced by accidental means.” The finding of the trial court that the abrasion was produced by accidental means was affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.4",436,[258,622,1147,522]]]'>Whether the bodily disablement or death, which is the subject of inquiry, was caused by the accident or disease is a matter of weighing the facts which preceded the injury or death. The insurance company maintains that the automobile mishap here under discussion came about as the result of a dizzy spell occasioned by arteriosclerosis and hypertension with which, it is claimed, Mrs. Brenneman was afflicted. Thus, it- argues, a pre-existing infirmity contributed to the cause of death.</p>
    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[257,1164,1149,1128]],["BL_437.1",437,[174,343,1148,259]]]'>The trial court, in granting judgment h.o.v. said that Mrs. Brenneman’s death could be explained “in no other way than that” Mrs. Brenneman was overcome by dizziness or a blackout which caused her to lose control of her car and carry her to her death. As against the jury’s verdict which certainly found, under the instructions of the trial judge, that there was an accident and an accidental injury, the court imposed an arbitrary conclusion. There could, of course, be the surmise that the lost control was due to dizziness or a blackout overcoming the driver, but such a surmisal does not lock the .door of inquiry and ratiocination. The only basis upon which the court can found its categorical conclusion that a blackout took the Brenneman car off its normal course is the statement of Dr. Evans that Mrs. Brenneman told him she had had several dizzy spells in the past. But the dizziness of yesterday cannot didactically dictate the decision of today. Moreover, Dr. Evans’ statement was flatly contradicted by Mrs. Brenneman’s husband who certainly was in an even more intimate relationship to testify on <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>this subject. He testified that Mrs. Brenneman was in excellent health, that both of them had just returned from a trip to Florida, and that “I never saw her better in her life, cheerful and seemed as though there was never anything wrong with her.”</p>
    <p id="b437-4" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[172,618,1150,752]]]'>But even if dizziness were accepted as á hypothesis in the case, that of itself would not, without further evidence, prove the defendant’s position. With a slight temporary aberration at the wheel, the car could still have come to a harmless stop on the highway, it could have ground to an innocuous halt in the grassy plot. The fatality occurred not because of the erratic course of the automobile, but because it fell into a ditch. The court below in granting n.o.v. said: “The burden was on plaintiff to prove that the car collision which caused the head injury resulted from some event constituting an Accident,’ and to exclude the inference that it resulted from dizziness or blackout caused by arteriosclerosis and high blood pressure.”</p>
    <p id="b437-5" data-blocks='[["BL_437.5",437,[170,1386,1150,745]]]'>The plaintiff did indeed have the burden of proof to establish an accident, but he was not required, in doing so, to disprove possible inferences of dizziness or blackouts caused by arteriosclerosis and high blood pressure. After he proved a bona fide accident, with testimony that the violence resulting therefrom caused death, the burden shifted to the defendant insurance company to sIioav that without a pre-existing illness, death would not have occurred.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The defendant did not specifically produce such evidence, but whatever evidence it did produce was placed before the jury in the alembic of factual decision and, in the laboratory of their deliberation, the jury decided that no malady caused or contributed to Mrs. Brenneman’s death.</p>

The cause of the accident <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>was important only to the extent that the cause contributed to the physiological processes of death. If Mrs. Brenneman’s body had been found at the bottom of a 300-foot cliff and there was no evidence as to what caused her to fall from the cliff, liability under the policy would unquestionably have attached. There was no evidence in the case that the alleged illnesses of arteriosclerosis and dizziness of Mrs. Brenneman drove her off the cliff of life into the canyon of death.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[244,832,1147,639]]]'>The insurance company seems to be of the impression that Mrs. Brenneman somehow was at fault in driving a car after what her doctor assumedly told her, but fault on the part of an insured (in the absence of any nullifying provision in the policy for that reason) does not cancel out a contract of accident insurance. If in this case it had been proved that Mrs. Brenneman had attempted to light a cigarette while driving and, because of that thoughtless act, she had lost control of the car and it dashed against the concrete culvert, causing her death, the accident policy would unquestionably have remained unaffected.</p>

There would be no point in enumerating the many possibilities of explanation for the mishap and there is as little point in concluding, in the state of the record, that dizziness, and dizziness alone, smashed the car against the cul<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>vert, especially when the history of dizziness was categorically denied, and the jury resolved that conflict in testimony in favor of the plaintiff.</p>

There was evidence that the decedent had, five years prior to the fatal fall, been hit. over the head with a pipe and that the blow left him with an occasional unsteady walk and that he sometimes suffered “some dizziness.” It was not established at the. trial that dizziness assailed the insured just before he fell. The Court held that the question as to whether the death was accidental or not was an issue for the jury to decide, saying: “This testimony was sufficient to go to the jury. Were it otherwise, it would require the proof to <em>esoclude </em>fainting or dizziness as the antecedent cause of any fall and proof of the precise means by which the fall was brought about, and where there are no eye witnesses such would be impossible, unless it were done exactly as was done, here, i.e., ‘by evidence of circumstances which viewed as .a whole, reasonably exclude, by their preponderating probative weight, any other explanation found in the evidence.’ ”</p>
