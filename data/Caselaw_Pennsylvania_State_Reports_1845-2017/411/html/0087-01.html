The Parkers entered into a contract with the Thomases in November, 1957, for the purchase of all of the stock of the Kaufman Hotel and Restaurant Company, a Pennsylvania Corporation. The other agreement between the Parkers (the purchasers of all of the stock of Kaufman Hotel and Restaurant Company, Inc.) and the Thomases provided that, upon the clearance of the liquor license for transfer to the new purchasers, the land and building wherein the hotel and restaurant carried on. its business would be conveyed to the corporation by William J. Thomas and Mary Thomas, his wife, the owners, by the entireties, of the real estate.</p>

The complaint alleges no breach by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas of their.agreement nor default on- their part in any manner whatsoever. It seems hardly necessary to labor the point that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover the monies they have paid under the terms of the contract unless there has been a breach upon the part of the Thomases to fulfill their part of the agreement or perform their contract according to its terms. The complaint is absolutely silent concerning any breach by the Thomases which gives the Parkers any right of action. . .</blockquote>

No mention is made of the default by the plaintiffs and the proceeding in ejectment referred to in the sixth preliminary objection filed by the defendants. <em>However, at the oral argument of the ease and in their brief the plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to recover the payments they have made on the contract in spite of their default by reason of the defendants’ action in repossessing the property without first having entered judgment against the plaintiffs for the balance due under the contract and having, the property sold at Sheriff s sale. </em>[Emphasis supplied.] This is an ingenious argument but it is not the law in Pennsylvania or for that matter in the great majority of American states.

This is for the reason that, since the contract is entire, performance of all of the undertaking must be regarded as a condition precedent to plaintiff’s right to recover at all. Furthermore, the law will not create in favor of one who is a wilful and deliberate defaulter against the person injured by the nonperformance of the entire contract, any implied contractual obligation to recover for part performed, either on the theory of a quantum meruit or on the equitable theory of restitution for unjust enrichment. 12 Am.
