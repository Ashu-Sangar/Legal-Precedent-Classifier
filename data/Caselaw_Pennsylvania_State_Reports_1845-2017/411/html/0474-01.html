A charge was filed with the Board in December, 1960, by the Waiters and Waitresses Union, Local 301, Hotel and Restaurant Workers and Bartenders International Union, AFL-CIO (Union), alleging that- appellee Three Chefs, Inc. (Employer), a restaurant, had engaged in unfair labor practices, as defined in-Section 6(1) (a) and (c) of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act (Act),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> by interfering with the rights of self-organiza<a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>tion of its employees and discriminatorily discharging employees for union activity. The Employer denied the charges and countercharged that the Union itself had committed an unfair labor practice by intimidating employees into signing union membership cards in violation of §6(2) (a),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and urged that the complaint of the Union be dismissed pursuant to §10.1.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

However, no finding was made with respect to the employer’s defense of unfair labor practices by the Union. The Employer’s exceptions to the <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>nisi decision were dismissed and the order made final on August 7, 1961. (Exceptions filed by the Union were also dismissed.) From this disposition, the Employer appealed to the court of common pleas. Argument "was heard on November 27, 1961, and on March 30, 1962, the appeal was sustained and the complaint dismissed. Hence, this appeal by the Board.</p>
    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[264,726,1150,633]]]'>Prior to the institution of this unfair labor practice charge before the Board, the Employer had filed a complaint in equity (November, 1960) to enjoin the Union picketing. A preliminary injunction was granted on April 19, 1961, and a permanent injunction on November 28, 1961. <em>Three Chefs, </em>Inc. <em>v. Waiters’ and Waitresses’ Union, Local </em>301, <em>A. F. of L., </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/28/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="28 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 257" data-case-ids="1668561" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/28/0257-01">28 Pa. D. &amp; C. 2d 257</a> (C.P. Phila. Co. 1962). The chancellor there held that the picketing had as its purpose the unlawful coercion of the employer to compel the employeés to join thie Union. No appeal was taken from that decision. ,. . .</p>

[in the equity proceeding], there is no dispute or controversy between Three Chefs, Inc. and. its employees. Accordingly, the parties hereto ... stipulate and agree that the within entitled action be terminated as follows: 1. The Appeal by Three Chefs, Inc., to .the Court of Common Pleas in the within case shall be marked withdrawn. 2. The Court shall recall its opinion and order filed in the within case. 3. The Appeal from the order of the Court in the within entitled matter to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania shall be withdrawn. The foregoing Stipulation shall have no effect until and unless the same has been approved by the Court.” The court below determined that it lacked the power to recall its opinion and order and, therefore, refused to approve the stipulation.</p>

      <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>The Employer has filed a motion to dismiss under Supreme Court Rule 41 on the ground that the appeal is moot, in that the labor dispute has been settled. The motion was argued at the time of oral argument on the merits and will be disposed of here.</p>
    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[170,618,1150,1067]]]'>The dispute here is whether or not the Employer could properly be found guilty of an unfair labor practice. The fact that picketing has ended and employer-employee relations apparently have calmed is not necessarily determinative of this issue. If the Employer did commit an unfair practice, as found by the Board, it would be required to post a notice to its employees as ordered by the Board. As matters now stand, the court of common pleas has determined that although the Employer’s conduct might have been an unfair practice, the complaint should have been dismissed under Section 10.1 of the Act. The Board' contends otherwise and insists that its order be enforced. Apparently, this controversy would have become moot if the Employer had complied with the order. The actions required in the stipulation of settlement would also have achieved that result by making the Board’s order operative. However, these events did not occur. Therefore, the question of unfair labor practice remains alive, and the motion to dismiss must be denied.</p>

Section 9(b) of the Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> provides for appellate review of a final order of the Board by the court of common pleas. In <em>Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v.

Such evidence has been defined as that which to a reasonable mind is adequate to sup<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>port a conclusion.

To the contrary, the court below accepted the findings of the Board that the Employer had engaged in conduct which constituted an unfair labor practice. However, the court concluded that the Board had acted unreasonably in failing to sustain the Employer’s defense that the Union had also committed an unfair labor practice. This issue is nowhere discussed in the Board’s nisi decision (although raised as new matter in the Employer’s answer to the complaint) and is treated in the final order with the statement that the Board “. . . is of the opinion that all the exceptions [apparently of both Employer and Union] are without merit and should be dismissed.” The court found, upon testimony uncontradicted and undenied in the record, that the two original union employees had intimidated other employees into signing union membership cards and that this conduct was an absolute defense to the complaint under Sections 6(2) (a) and 10.1 of the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> While the court below made reference to the equity proceeding and to its finding there of unlawful coercion by the Union, the result it reached here does not depend upon the equity determination. There is ample undisputed testimony in the present record of the pro<a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>ceeding before the Board to support the court’s conclusion, and which the Board should not reasonably have ignored.</p>
    <p id="b503-3" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[167,509,1147,746]]]'>The Board further argues that even assuming an unfair labor practice by the Union, such practice was not “in connection with or as part of the actions forming the basis of the complaint” as required by Section 10.1. This contention is without merit. The complaint was based upon charges of discriminatory discharge of union employees and interference with the employees’ right to self-organization. Necessarily involved were the Union membership cards and the manner in which the signatures were procured. The Employer was charged with improperly obtaining repudiation of the very same cards improperly obtained by the Union initially, all of which occurred within a period of a few days.</p>
