In Catherwood, (pp. 77, 78), we expressly stated: “While we have never held that ordinary small stock dividends should be considered as income payable to the life tenant, we have not held to the <em>contrary; </em>our prior decisions dealt with stock dividends, extraordinary in nature. If a total stock distribution for the current year is payable at the rate of 6% or less of the corporation’s outstanding shares before such distributions were made such distribution in stock of the distributing corporation should be treated as income.” The majority opinion, correctly states that, under the Rule, ordinary small stock dividends, not exceeding <em>6% </em>in any one year, were not apportionable and were deemed income payable to the life tenant, and, therefore, I agree with its first- premise. From such premise, however, it. cannot be argued that <em>this </em>stock dividend shall be deemed income because <em>prior </em>to the payment of such dividend this Court in <em>Catherwood </em>abolished <em>prospectively </em>the Rule and declared that <em>thereafter </em>the distribution of stock dividends should be governed by the provisions of the act. While the majority opinion correctly states the manner of distribution of such stock dividends <em>under the </em>Rule, such statement in nowise controls the manner of distribution thereof <em>after the Rule has teen </em>

      <em>abolished. </em>In my view, the first premise of the majority opinion, while historically correct, is of no moment in determining the distribution of this stock dividend paid after the Rule had been abolished. ‘</p>

Such a posh tion is untenable. <em>Catherwood </em>abolished the Rule as to <em>dll </em>stock dividends, large or small, ordinary or extraordinary, and made applicable thereafter the provisions of the Act to <em>all </em>distributions of <em>all </em>stock dividends and <em>Catherwood </em>drew no distinction between, the classes and types of stock dividends to the distribution of which <em>thereafter </em>the provisions of the Act would be applicable. In abolishing what had become an unworkable rule of apportionment, <em>Catherwood </em>subjected <em>thereafter </em>the distribution of <em>all </em>stock dividends to the mandate of the Act rather than to' a court-made rule of apportionment. In its second premise, the majority opinion misconceives the intent of this Court expressed in <em>Gathenoood </em>and Avould differentiate between classes of stock dividends when no such differentiation was either made or intended to be made. If the majority of this Court want to overrule <em>Catherwood, </em>such is its privilege.

However, I cannot agree with, the statement in the majority opinion that the Sun Oil Company has paid “since 1913 <em>small </em>(6% or less) stock dividends in many years in-varying percentages”, because the record indicates otherwise. The record shows<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">4</a> that from 1913 up to and including 1932—the year of creation of this trust—Sun Oil Company paid the following stock dividends: .1913-20%, 1915-60%, 1922-300%, 1925-3%, 1926-6%, 1927-3%, 1928-6%, 1929-9%, 1930-9%, 1932-3%. Thus, in the period <em>preceding </em>the creation of this trust, 10 stock dividends were declared of which 5— including the two <em>immediately </em>prior to the creation of this trust—were <em>in excess of 6%. </em>Assuming -therefore, that every Sun Oil Company stockholder <em>knew </em>the established policy of the Company as to stock dividends, every stockholder must have known that at least one-half, of such stock dividends had been <em>in excess of 6%. </em>Under such a factual situation upon what basis can it be found that the settlor of this trust <em>intended </em>stock dividends <em>not in excess of 6% to </em>be considered “income” or “net income” payable to the life tenants? Would.it not be more logical for the settlor, aware of the stock dividend policy of this Company, to intend that <em>all </em>stock dividends, those not in excess and those in excess of 6%, be considered “income” or “net income” payable to the life tenants? We fail to see that <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>the past dividend policy of the Company could reflect an intent on the part of the settlor to include only stock dividends not in excess of 6% to “income” or “net income” payable to the life tenants, a limitation which the majority opinion clearly imposes.</p>
    <p id="b141-4" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[180,613,1151,853]]]'>It is further interesting to note that, in the years from 1932 up to and including 1961, the Sun Oil Company paid 14 yearly stock dividends in excess of 6% and only 9 stock dividends of 6% or less. Would the majority hold that the settlor intended <em>all </em>of these stock dividends to be considered “net income” payable to the life tenants or <em>only </em>such stock dividends of 6% or less. There is not a scintilla of evidence on this record upon which to sustain the finding of an intent on the part of the settlor to have stock dividends of <em>6% </em>or less included within “net income”; on the contrary, the record would more likely, <em>if at all, </em>sustain a finding of <em>intent, </em>based on the past stock dividend history of the Company, that the settlor intended to include in “net income” <em>all </em>stock dividends of the Company regardless of the amount.</p>
