Words and phrases on one side of the word "or" <em>may, </em>and often do, modify and apply to words and phrases on the other side of the word "or" in the same sentence. For example, in the very paragraph now under construction, the words "damage by" are on one side of "or" and yet clearly such words include not only "damage by" <em>accidental fire </em>on the same side of "or" but also "damage by" <em>other casualty </em>on the other side of "or". In construing "or", the court below relied in part on <em>Garratt v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/387/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="387 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="1270995" data-case-paths="/pa/387/0442-01">387 Pa. 442</a>, 444, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.2d%20738" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="127 A.2d 738">127 A. 2d 738</a>. In <em>Garratt, </em>the Court construed the language of a municipal ordinance which read: "Section 1.

(emphasis supplied). Can there be the slightest doubt under the language of this ordinance that, even though "or" separates "policeman" and "park policeman", that the phrase "who is killed in the course of responding to an alarm, etc." modifies not only "policeman" on the one side of "or", but also "park policeman" on the other side of "or"?</p>

The court below found that the words "accidental fire" encompassed fires of negligent as well as non-negligent origin and for such finding there exists authority under our law. Our Court in <em>North American Life &amp; Accident Insurance Co. v. Burroughs, </em><a href="/pa/69/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="69 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="1026390" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0043-01">69 Pa. 43</a>, 51, 52, defined the terms "accident" and "accidental": "An accident is `an event that takes place without one's foresight or expectation; an event which proceeds from an unknown cause, or is an unusual effect of a known cause, and therefore not expected; chance; casualty; contingency.' And accidental signifies, `Happening by chance or unexpectedly; taking place not according to the usual cause of things; casual; fortuitous. We speak of a thing as accidental when it falls to us as by chance and not in the regular course of things; . . .' Webster's Dictionary <em>ad verba." </em>Over 100 years ago and prior to <em>Burroughs, </em>supra, this Court in <em>McCarty v. New York and Erie Railroad Company, </em><a href="/pa/30/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="30 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="415579" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0247-01">30 Pa. 247</a>, 250, 251, considered whether "accidental fire" included fires of negligent as well as of non-negligent origin. In that case, the Court considered the propriety of instructions to a jury wherein the trial court said: "`If the fire' . . . `was the result of accident, a circumstance over which they could have no control, they are not liable. If it was <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>the result of carelessness or negligence on their part, they are liable.'" Counsel argued that the trial court's use of the word "accident" led the jury to believe that a loss occasioned by an accident is something different from a loss occasioned by negligence, that the two are identical and the opposite of accident is not negligence but design. The Court said: "If accident and negligence be not opposites, we cannot regard them as identical, without confounding cause and effect. <em>Accident, </em>and its synonyms casualty and misfortune, <em>may proceed or result from negligence, or other cause known, or </em>unknown."

The court below was correct in holding that an "accidental fire" included fires of negligent as well as non-negligent origin. However, reasoning from such premise, the court below then proceeded to find that the phrase "damage by accidental fire" <em>standing alone </em>was sufficient to exhibit Dilks' intent to release Chevrolet from liability for damages caused by a fire even though such fire was caused by Chevrolet or its employees. With that position we disagree.</p>
