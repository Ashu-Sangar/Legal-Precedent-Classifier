    <p id="b554-8" data-blocks='[["BL_554.10",554,[228,1004,1149,851]]]'>These appeals involve two actions in equity, instituted by the respective appellants against the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh [Authority] and the City of Pittsburgh [City]. Appellant Schwartz, as trustee for a corporation to be formed, and appellant Shapero, in his own behalf as a taxpayer and in behalf of other taxpayers of the City, filed complaints in equity seeking: 1. to enjoin the Authority and the City “from taking any action to sell, grant, convey, lease, mortgage, encumber, pledge or in any manner dispose of or attempt to dispose of” a certain parcel of land in a redevelopment area to Bell Telephone Company or others; 2. to require the Authority to show cause why the parcel of land should not be conveyed to Schwartz; and 3. to compel the authority to accept Schwartz’s proposal.</p>
    <p id="b554-9" data-blocks='[["BL_554.11",554,[226,1868,1148,367]]]'>The two suits involved identical questions of fact and law and were consolidated for trial. At the conclusion of appellants’ case, the chancellor granted appellees’ motions for a compulsory nonsuit. The court en bane refused appellants’ motions to take off the judgments of nonsuit, thereby giving rise to these appeals.</p>

(Emphasis supplied). We are therefore guided by the principles that a nonsuit should be entered only in a clear case, and, on appeal from the refusal to take off a compulsory nonsuit, the plaintiff must be given the benefit of all favorable testimony and every reasonable inference of fact arising therefrom and all conflicts therein must be resolved in favor of plaintiff. <em>Miller v.

L. 991, 35 P.S. §1701 et seq., as amended. The City, of Pittsburgh is a municipal corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is an indispensable party to the proceedings by virtue of the provisions of the Urban Redevelopment Law, since it is required to approve the proposed sale, lease or transfer of any real property in a redevelopment area.</p>

After the construction of new streets and grades, sewers and utility lines, the Authority, in January, 1959, compiled and circulated to interested persons a booklet known as the “Land Disposition Documents” and invited proposals from the public for bids to purchase the tracts of land in the redevelopment project. Appellant Schwartz submitted a proposal to purchase Lot “E” in the redevelopment project area for $200,000 which was in excess of <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>the total asking price of the Authority, the asking price being ¡¡¡&gt;196,100. The proposal for the construction of a drive-in hotel was a commercial use and qualified as a proper use for commercial land in the redevelopment project area. Lot “E” is zoned commercial C-4 under the zoning ordinance of the City of Pittsburgh and one of the permitted uses for lots so zoned is a hotel. The “Land Disposition Documents” circulated by the Authority state that one of the permitted land uses and buildings for an area zoned' C-4 included hotels.</p>

The City Planning Commission prepared a redevelopment area plan dated June 7, 1955 and' in conformity with this redevelopment area plan, the Authority prepared a proposal for the redevelopment of Redevelopment Area No. 3. After a public hearing, duly advertised in accordance with the Urban Redevelopment Law, the proposal and redevelopment area plan were approved by the City Planning Commission and by the Council of the City of Pittsburgh. In all of the ac<a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>tions by the planning commission, the Authority and city council, Lot “E” was zoned C-4 and among its permitted land uses and buildings was that of a hotel.</p>
    <p id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[153,508,1152,1064]]]'>The Schwartz proposal to purchase parcel “E” was rejected by the Authority. In its letter to Schwartz rejecting his proposal, the Authority stated: “While a motel, being a commercial use, qualifies as a proper use for commercial land in the Lower Hill project, the Board’s decision hinged on their desire to see commercial development on Parcel ‘F’ [the parties agree that the parcel is “E”] which would relate more directly to the needs and desires of the 935 families eventually to occupy the apartments to be constructed by Webb &amp; Knapp on Parcel ‘G’ directly across the street from the parcel in which you were interested.”- The report of the Authority staff, relative to the Schwartz proposal contains the following language: “We feel that the development of this site for motel purposes, while in keeping technically with the Redevelopment Area Plan controls on land use, would not be ideally compatible with either the existing commercial uses along Fifth Avenue or with the residential development north of Colwell Street.”</p>
    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[154,1601,1148,314]]]'>Subsequent to the rejection of the Schwartz proposal, the Authority entertained a proposal from the Bell Telephone Company, to erect, on parcel “E”, a building to house electronic computers employed in the preparation of bills for Bell’s customers, the proposed purchase price being $196,100.</p>
