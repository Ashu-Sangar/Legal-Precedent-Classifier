On April 15, 1963, the District Attorney did not take an appeal, but filed this petition in this Court for a writ of mandamus. This petition was not served upon the lower Court and hence that Court filed no answer and <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>was not represented at the hearing or argument before this Court.</p>
    <p id="b588-4" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[235,451,1154,1559]]]'>A criminal trial is as different from a civil' trial as day is from night. In civil trials there is pre-trial discovery and a <em>mutual </em>exchange of evidence. In a criminal trial there is no mutual exchange of evidence. The defendant does not have to inform the Commonwealth before or until the end or near the end of his trial his defense or any of his evidence; he does not have to take the witness stand and no unfavorable inference can be drawn therefrom;' he can be convicted only if the Commonwealth proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, which is defined to be a doubt which would restrain a reasonable man from acting in a matter of importance to himself; his confessions are. not admissible in evidence unless and until the corpus delicti has been proved; he is presumed to be innocent no matter how many terrible crimes he may have committed; if he has never been convicted of crime he can place in evidence his good reputation and that alone can be sufficient to justify his acquittal; and finally, he cannot be convicted unless all twelve of the jurors unanimously find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, after a conviction, a defendant can always appeal (a) for a new trial, alleging errors of law or a violation of his Constitutional rights, or (b) for judgment on the record,* while after a jury’s verdict of acquittal, the Commonwealth has no right of appeal for a new trial or for judgment on the record, no matter how many and flagrant were the errors which were committed against it.</p>

At the very least, a defendant should be required to present exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons such as were present in <em>DiJoseph's </em>Petition, <a href="/pa/394/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="394 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="1280973" data-case-paths="/pa/394/0019-01">394 Pa. 19</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.2d%20187" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="145 A.2d 187">145 A. 2d 187</a>, to justify an exception to the general rule. How otherwise can law abiding communities be adequately and justly protected against the appalling crime wave which is sweeping and alarming our Country. Defendants, District Attorneys and Courts should remember that Justice is not a one way street — Justice means fairness and protection for, and Justice to Society, as well as Justice for and the protection of the basic rights of an accused.</p>
    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[159,1527,1150,642]]]'>The record in the instant case is barren of exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons to justify the grant of defendant’s petition. The mere allegation that the numerous indictments did not set forth facts with sufficient particularity is not a sound basis on which to grant unlimited discovery. The lower Court before granting any discovery should at the very least have conducted a preliminary hearing in order to determine the <em>necessity </em>for discovery <em>and the extent </em>of the discovery, if any, which should be granted. This the Court completely failed to do, even though Caplan’s petition was opposed by the District Attorney.</p>
