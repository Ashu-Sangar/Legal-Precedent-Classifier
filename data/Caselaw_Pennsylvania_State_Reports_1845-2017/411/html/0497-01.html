One juror stated, on his voir dire, that he would not impose the penalty of death (if the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had committed the crime of murder in the first degree), because he did not believe in capital punishment; and this juror was not challenged by the Commonwealth. The Judge reasoned that consequently the District Attorney knew at the commencement of Johnson’s trial that he would not ask the death penalty and the jury would never (unanimously) impose the death penalty. Although such a juror would likely be highly advantageous in<a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>stead of prejudicial to Johnson, the introduction of Johnson’s previous criminal record (burglaries and “obstructing a railroad” in Delaware, which is a felony in that State) was not for the limited and proper purpose for which it was introduced—namely, to aid the jury in fixing the penalty,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">*</a> but to influence the jury to find a verdict of guilty. The hearing Judge correctly states that under <em>Commonwealth v.

However, Judge Quinlan concluded that the realities—viz., the juror’s conscientious scruples and the failure of the District Attorney to challenge him, demonstrate that the real purpose of this evidence was (we repeat) to improperly influence the jury—made a fair trial impossible and hence constituted a violation of due process. For reasons which we shall hereinafter state we disagree with this conclusion—far more important it flies in the teeth of two recent decisions of this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">**</a>

      <p id="b526-7" data-blocks='[["BL_526.7",526,[242,1996,1147,354]]]'> We have considered this contention of Johnson’s in the light of all the recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, including <em>Fay v. Noia, </em><a href="/us/372/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="372 U.S. 391" data-case-ids="1765582" data-case-paths="/us/372/0391-01">372 U.S. 391</a>; <em>Gideon v.

    <p id="b527-7" data-blocks='[["BL_527.8",527,[163,1502,1149,637]]]'>An examination of the entire record discloses that the prosecution had a very flimsy case against the defendant. As former . Chief Justice Charles Alvin Jones so aptly stated in his concurring opinion to the <em>first Johnson </em>case, “[t]he books will be searched in vain 'for a more startling example of a synthetically constructed case of murder against a suspect.” <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/368/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="368 Pa. 139" data-case-ids="1230353" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0139-01">368 Pa. 139</a>, 148, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20A.2d%20569" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="81 A.2d 569">81 A. 2d 569</a>, 573 (1951). I agree. It is abundantly clear that the prosecution would never have secured a conviction without the introduction in evidence of defendant’s prior convictions.</p>
    <p id="b527-8" data-blocks='[["BL_527.9",527,[163,2151,1147,211]],["BL_528.1",528,[246,339,1147,847]]]'>The majority places considerable emphasis upon <em>Commonwealth v. Parker, </em><a href="/pa/294/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="294 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="1113376" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0144-01">294 Pa. 144</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20A.%20904" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="143 A. 904">143 Atl. 904</a> (1928), in which the validity of the split-verdict rule was upheld. As the majority correctly points out, this <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>rule has been subject to much criticism over the years. Finally, in <em>United States ex rel. Scoleri v. Banmiller, </em><a href="/f2d/310/0720-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="310 F.2d 720" data-case-ids="193805" data-case-paths="/f2d/310/0720-01">310 F. 2d 720</a> (3d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, <a href="/us/374/0828-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="374 U.S. 828" data-case-ids="8351,8359,8546,8601,8632,8688" data-case-paths="/us/374/0828-01,/us/374/0828-03,/us/374/0828-02,/us/374/0828-06,/us/374/0828-04,/us/374/0828-05">374 U.S. 828</a> (1963), the court of appeals for the third circuit disapproved the "Parker Rule" when it held under the particular facts and circumstances of that case that the introduction of prior convictions in evidence was violative of due process of law. Although it is doubtful whether the <em>Scoleri </em>decision should be applied to all cases involving the "Parker Rule", nevertheless the mood and tenor of <em>Scoleri </em>obliges us to scrutinize with care a finding of guilt which appears to be based on no more substantial evidence than a record of the defendant's prior convictions. Since the instant conviction is precisely that type of case, I must register my dissent.</p>
