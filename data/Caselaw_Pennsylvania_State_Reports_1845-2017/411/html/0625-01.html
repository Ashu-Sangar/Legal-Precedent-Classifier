Of approximately 1550 members of the Credit Union, more than 1500 left Local 89 to join the Clerks Union. On the same day as the withdrawal from Local 89, at a special meeting, the majority of a quorum of the Credit Union voted to amend its by-laws to limit membership in the Credit Union to members of the Clerks Union. These amendments, required to be approved by the Department of Banking before becoming effective, § 2 (14 P.S. § 202E), were denied approval by the Department because they would exclude from the Credit Union those members still in Local 89.</p>

The ruling of the court en banc, and of the majority here, fails to give effect to Section 18 of the Act (14 P.S. §218) which specifically provides: <em>“A member may expelled by a two-thirds’ vote </em>of the members present at a regular or a special meeting called to consider the matter, <em>but only after a hearing after due notice to the member </em>of the time and place of the meeting and of the reason or reasons for such proposed expulsion.” (Emphasis supplied.) Not one step of this mandated <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>procedure was followed. Further, there is no provision in the by-laws of the Credit Union which authorizes the <em>automatic </em>expulsion of a member.. The requirement of membership in good standing of Local 89 found in Article II, §1 of the by-laws is a requirement for eligibility upon election to membership, not disqualification or expulsion. Moreover, Article II, §6 refutes the contention that expulsion was automatic since that section permits a member to retain his membership in the Credit Union even if he leaves the sphere of operation of his employer, which would, in all likelihood, result in his leaving Local 89.</p>
    <p id="b651-4" data-blocks='[["BL_651.5",651,[189,991,1148,314]]]'>In its brief as amicus curiae, the Department of Banking explained that the first amendments were dis? approved because the result would have been to expel 48 members and to deprive them of Credit Union benefits for failure to disassociate from Local 89. The approved amendments would eliminate this result.</p>
    <p id="b651-5" data-blocks='[["BL_651.6",651,[188,1323,1150,747]]]'>The decree of the court en banc, in my opinion, erroneously concluded that the purpose of the defendants was to deprive the plaintiffs of their properly rights without due process of law. But that decree, now with the support of the majority of this Court, will even more severely deprive over 1500 persons of their property rights. The view of the. majority permits 48 members to penalize, without justification or authority, over 1500 fellow employees who left Local 89. Such a harsh result is unsound and unnecessary, and it may not be justified on the mere technicality that had the 1500 adopted the amendments prior to disaffiliation, their property rights in the Credit Union would have been preserved.</p>
