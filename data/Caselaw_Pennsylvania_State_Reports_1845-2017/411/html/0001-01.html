There is no provision in the City Charter for an “acting” Mayor, and certainly such an entity is not specifically covered or governed by Section 3-400. It is difficult, therefore, to appreciate how counsel for Tate can so often blow hot and cold—to have him Mayor when it suits their purpose, and only a Councilman and President of City <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>Council (on leave of absence) when that suits their purpose.

Although a Councilman is paid out of the City treasury, he is, according to Tate, the only person on the City payroll who (a) can engage in <em>certain </em>political activities which are prohibited to all officers and employees of the City, and (b) does not have to résign when he is a candidate for another office.

The fallacy of this contention is apparent from the fact that many provisions of the Charter deal specifically and solely with the Mayor, and yet even Tate agrees that the Mayor is a City officer. While certain powers are specifically granted to, and duties are specifically imposed upon the Mayor and City Councilmen, respectively, an examination of the Charter will demonstrate that these provisions are inserted for the purpose of clarity and certainty, and not to erect <em>in matters of public policy such as </em>this, a Berlin Wall between a Councilman on the one hand, and a Mayor and all other City officers on the other hand. In an attempt to demonstrate the soundness of this contention, Tate quotes, inter alia, Section 4-400(a), which provides that the Law Department “shall furnish legal advice to the Mayor, to the Council, and to <em>all officers, </em>departments, boards and Commissions.” Instead of supporting Tate’s position this has exactly the opposite effect. If there were any logic or merit to Tate’s argument on this point, it would have been entirely unnecessary for the Charter to mention the Mayor in this Section, because, we repeat, the Mayor is an <em>officer </em>of the City within the meaning of many provisions of the Charter, as even Tate admits.</p>

In addition to Section 10-107(5) of Article X, upon which Tate bases (erroneously) his principal if not his entire argument on this point, Article X, Section 10-107(3) and Sections 10-100, 101 and 105, refute this contention.

Throughout the Charter, a dichotomy is drawn between “officers or employees” on the one hand, and “council-' men” on the other. For example, section 3-306 states that “all officers and employees of the City shall be citizens of the United States-.” If “officers and employees” includes councilmen, what is the need for a separate section—section 2-103—which provides that “a councilman shall be a citizen of the United States.” Section 10 itself further illustrates this dichotomy between legislative and executive officials of city government. Section 10 is entitled “Prohibited Activities of Councilmen, City Officers, Employees' and Others.” Section 10-100 enumerates certain prohibited activities for councilmen; section 10-102 sets forth comparable <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>restrictions, for “city officers and employees.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>.

Section 10-107(5) was passed to prevent elected officials from improperly utilizing the powers of their present office to gain another office. Members of the executive branch, who control large numbers of employees, present a more serious threat of such abuse than do councilmen who <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>may control only one or two employees. Moreover, in enacting section 10-107(5) the Charter framers were fearful that an officer might neglect his official duties in pursuance of his candidacy. It is much more disruptive of city government where the single individual in charge of an executive department neglects his duties in order to campaign, than where one of the seventeen members of City Council so acts. Herein lies the rationale for the different treatment of the executive and legislative branches of city government by the Charter framers.</p>

When he became a “candidate” is a question of fact to be determined by the record and not by any arbitrary test which is unrelated to what long experience and observation have demonstrated. The complaint filed on January 7, 1963, alleged that “On December 17th, 1962, James H. J. Tate announced that he was seeking the office of Mayor . . . and he offered himself for said office . . . and is at the present time a candidate for the office of Mayor.” This well-pleaded averment was undenied and on the record presented was an undisputed fact in the court below, as it is here.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> It is legally sufficient and conclusive on this factual issue. The word “candidate” in the Charter must be considered to have its usual and generally accepted campaign-for-election meaning. Cf. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Laughlin v.

Even if it be conceded that a “public announcement” is a prerequisite to becoming a candidate, such announcement can be accomplished in a variety of ways, depending upon the political strategy employed—by a speech, statement, advertisement, or other communication reported or appearing in public media, or by any other technique for achieving the desired political effect.</p>

His signed statement could have been no more articulate announcement of his candidacy.
