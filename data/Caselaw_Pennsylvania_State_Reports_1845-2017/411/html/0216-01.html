The undisputed facts show that a vacancy occurred on the <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>Bristol Borough Council by virtue of the resignation of one of its members. At the regular monthly meeting of council held on July 9, 1962, Nicoletti and Why-no were nominated to fill the vacancy. A roll call was taken and Nicoletti received a majority of the votes. The result of the vote was accordingly entered in the minutes of the meeting.</p>

On the basis of the mayor’s veto, Nicoletti was refused his seat in council and another election was held at which Whyno was elected.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Nicoletti thereupon instituted this action claiming that he was entitled to the councilmanic seat.</p>

The court below held that Nicoletti was properly appointed and that the mayor possessed no power to veto the appointment. Accordingly, it entered judgment for the plaintiff. We hold that the court below acted correctly in this matter.</p>

In that case, as here, the only indication of council’s choice to fill the vacancy was the entry made in the minutes of the meeting. We held that the entry was sufficient compliance with section 901 since the substance and not the form of council’s actions must govern. We stated: “The substance of the procedure followed herein was manifestly expressive of the will of the majority. The fact that the appointment was not in the form of a resolution does not invalidate its significance.” (<a href="/pa/403/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="403 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1299481" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0117-01">403 Pa. at 122</a>).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In that case, however, council not only failed to adopt a resolution naming its choice, but affirmatively indicated that its choice was not finalized by passing a motion to table the vote. The opinion clearly points out that its rationale is not the fact that a resolution was not adopted, but rather that “no action was taken by motion, resolution, agreement, amendment or in any other parliamentary way which would show that the Borough Council had filled the vacancy. . . .” (<a href="/pa/374/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="374 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1241420" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0412-01">374 Pa. at 418</a>).</p>

Moreover, .as-noted above, §1007 contemplates councilmanie reconsideration of the mayor’s veto only at the next <em>regular </em>session of council. Consequently, if the mayor possessed the power to veto councilmanie appointments, one, of two undesirable situations would occur: either the 30-day period would expire before the next regular session of council, thus precluding any. councilmanie reconsideration of the appointment upon presentation’ of a petition to the court;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> or the imminence of the expiration of the 30-day period would preclude any careful councilmanic reconsideration.
