However, the basic issue herein is the right of the petitioner to an accounting and distribution of the income of a trust inter vivos. The. orphans’ court has <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction of the administration and distribution of the property of an inter vivos trust under Section 301 <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>of the Act of August 10, 1951, P. L. 1163, 20 P.S. §2080.301. The question of the reformation of the instrument involved was brought into the present action by way of answer to the petition for a citation to compel the accounting and distribution. So . too, the action in equity in the common pleas court was not filed until after the jurisdiction of the orphans’ court had attached herein. The request for reformation was not an indepedent action in the orphans’ court, but rather an incidental one. The crucial test in evaluating jurisdiction is the relief requested by the initiating party. Section 304 of the Act of 1951, supra, provides that, “the orphans’ court shall have all legal and equitable powers required for or incidental to the exercise of. its jurisdiction.” We agree with the lower court that it would be a vain act for the orphans’ court to suspend action of the petition for an accounting and distribution until the reformation question. was settled in another court. Such action would be unfair and tend to the inefficient administration of justice.</p>

In the answer to the petition for the citation, the trustee admitted the existence of the deed and the terms thereof. However, he contended that the trust instrument did not comply with his intention at the time of the creation of the trust, because it did not include <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>therein provisions <em>entitling him </em>to receive the income from the trust property for his own personal benefit during his lifetime and also failed to give him the power of revocation.

He first testified, “I can’t read,” then he said, “I can’t read very good.” He did not say in answer to a direct question as to whether he could read the deed, that he could not read it. His answer to that question was' unresponsive. Yet on direct examination, he read from several exhibits and understood them. If a party who can read will not read a deed put before him for execution, he is guilty of supine negligence, which is not the subject of protection either in equity or at law: <em>Miller v. Houseworth, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b664-8" data-blocks='[["BL_664.5",664,[239,2249,1145,99]],["BL_665.1",665,[181,346,1154,578]]]'>We have thoroughly read the record in this case and we are of the opinion that the testimony of Joe <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>La Bocea did not measure up to the standard required to reform a written instrument. He did not distinctly remember the details of the preparation of the deed, nor did he recite them in order. His testimony instead of being clear, direct, weighty and convincing was evasive and contradictory in itself. In his answer to the petition, the settlor averred that he intended that the trust instrument include a power of revocation. In his proof, no mention is made of this alleged mistake. His testimony does not carry “a clear conviction of its truth.”</p>
    <p id="b665-4" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[188,946,1149,583]]]'>The court below attached great significance to the fact that an accounting and distribution had not been demanded earlier. But, this is understandable. The parents of the beneficiary separated, as noted before, in May 1959. Before the separation, with the age of the beneficiary an added factor, there was no need for the trust income for support purposes. As soon as the need occurred, the demand was made. Further, there was substantial testimony that the settlor on several occasions stated that he was saving the income for the future needs of the beneficiary.</p>
    <p id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.6",665,[189,1540,1147,143]]]'>Decree reversed, record remanded with directions to issue the citation prayed for. Costs to be paid out of the income of the trust.</p>
