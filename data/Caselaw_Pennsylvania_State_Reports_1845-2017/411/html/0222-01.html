(Keystone), is a dealer in diesel engines, and the defendant, Floyd T. Irwin (Irwin), operates tractor-trailers as a contract carrier. Sometime prior to July 1960, Keystone sold Irwin a diesel engine for approximately $3000 which was subsequently installed in a tractor. The engine did not function properly and the plaintiff Keystone performed certain modifications and repairs to the engine at its own expense. Subsequent repairs were required and the plaintiff performed the additional work allegedly based upon an oral contract with the defendant whereby the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff for the additional work. The defendant refused to pay for the last mentioned repairs and the plaintiff brought this action of assumpsit to recover the amount due of $623.08. Defendant filed a counterclaim for loss of profits totalling $5150. The basis for this latter claim was the inability of the defendant to use the tractor for 27 days because of various breakdowns of the engine furnished by the plain<a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>tiff, all in contravention of an implied warranty of merchantability.</p>
    <p id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.4",246,[248,447,1145,317]]]'>The lower court struck off the counterclaim on the basis that the claim for. loss of profit was too speculative to permit recovery. For the purpose of this appeal, we must assume that all allegations of the defendant, are true, and determine whether or not the counterclaim was properly stricken as a matter of law.</p>
    <p id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[245,773,1149,1018]]]'>Where a contract is breached without legal justification, the injured party is entitled to recover (absent contrary provisions in the contract) whatever damages he suffered, provided (1) they were such as would naturally and ordinarily follow from the breach; (2) they were reasonably foreseeable and within the contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract; (3) they can be proved with reasonable certainty: <em>Taylor v. Kaufhold, </em><a href="/pa/368/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="368 Pa. 538" data-case-ids="1230354" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0538-01">368 Pa. 538</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20347" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="84 A.2d 347">84 A. 2d 347</a> (1951); <em>Adams v.

There is no doubt that in a contract of this nature a breach causing malfunction of the engine would produce a halt in productive capacity and some damage could flow therefrom. Moreover, there would be no difficulty in measuring these damages with reasonable accuracy. The real issue to be determined is whether the damages sought for loss of profit were within the contemplation of the parties to the contract here in dispute.</p>

If [a liability for the full profits that might be made by machinery which the defendant was transporting . . .] had been presented to the mind of the ship owner at .the time of making the contract, as the basis upon which he was contracting, he would at once have rejected it... .

Following the defendant’s theory to its logical conclusion, whenever a motor vehicle is sold for use in a profit motivated enterprise and the seller warrants that the vehicle will function properly, the seller will be liable in damages for a breach of warranty to the extent of profits lost on completely unrelated business contracts, where those profits are lost due to the vehicle malfunctioning.</p>

Few persons would enter into contracts of any considerable extent as to subject-matter or time if they should thereby incidentally, assume the responsibility of carrying out, or be held legally affected by, other arrangements over which they have no control and the existence of which are unknown to them Sutherland on Damages, 4th ed. vol. 1, p. 182, §47.” Anticipated profits are not recoverable unless within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made: <em>Macchia v. Megow, </em>supra. Clearly, the claim for loss of profits in the instant case was not within the contemplation of the parties to this contract.</p>
