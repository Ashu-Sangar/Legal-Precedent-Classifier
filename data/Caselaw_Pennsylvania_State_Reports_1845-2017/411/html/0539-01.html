Davidson made no post trial motions and, in due course, judgment was entered on the jury’s verdict for Eagal in the case in which Davidson was plaintiff. The court below granted Eagal’s motion for a new trial in the Eagal v. Davidson matter and also, on its own motion, granted a new trial in the Davidson v. Eagal case. Eagal appeals from the latter action of the court below.</p>

    <p id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[145,1442,1149,417]]]'>The court below assigned only one reason for the granting of Eagal’s motion for a new trial. That reason was that as the court summarized the contentions of the parties in its charge, it appeared that the court was finding the facts for the jury. The sole basis for the award of a new trial to Eagal as plaintiff is contained in the following excerpt from the opinion below:</p>
    <blockquote id="b563-6" data-blocks='[["BL_563.6",563,[144,1877,1150,310]]]'>“It is the practice of this Court in charging juries to set forth for them as clearly and fairly as possible the respective contentions of each party in interest that juries may fully understand the issues involved and to be decided. All this we attempted to do in the consolidated trials of these two cases.</blockquote>

Eagal, which is an action of tres<a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>pass and was filed in behalf of the plaintiff, John Kobert Davidson, to recover from the defendant, John L.

    <blockquote id="b564-4" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[261,561,1147,424]]]'>“Page 119 of the record discloses that said claim is set forth in the following paragraph, the same being the version of the accident or contention of John Kobert. Davidson. As recorded, it would appear that the Court was making findings of fact as to the way and manner in which , the accident complained of occurred, placing the blame, therefore, upon John. L. Eagal, and exonerating Davidson of all liability.</blockquote>

    <p id="b564-8" data-blocks='[["BL_564.8",564,[258,2042,1150,316]]]'>The court then goes on to say: “For this reason we are compelled to conclude that the charge of the Court was in error and it is immaterial to speculate whether the use of the word ‘that’, missing from the record, thus changing- the ‘facts found’ to contention of a litigant would have affected the verdict in any way.</p>

The fact that the two actions were consolidated and tried together is insufficient reason for granting an unasked for new trial in the Davidson v. Eagal suit, where the record is free from error affecting the outcome of that suit. Hence, we conclude that the court below abused its discretion in granting a new trial in the Davidson v. Eagal action. This is the only case which is before us on the present appeal.</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[162,1155,1147,95]]]'>The order of the court below granting a new trial in Davidson v. Eagal is reversed.</p>
