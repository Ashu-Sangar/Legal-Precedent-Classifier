He deduces this amount by deducting the total amount of interest paid by each bank on uninvested funds from the bank’s total earnings on such deposits for the period covering approximately 30 years and claims that the difference was payable to each rightful owner and consequently was recoverable under this proceeding. Banks earn interest or profits by using the so-called uninvested funds in loans to bank customers and by investing these so-called uninvested funds in securities. The banks have always claimed that these profits or so-called excess interest belonged to them and they have never been held by any appellate Court in Pennsylvania to be escheatable. Nevertheless, the Attorney General, we repeat, contends that they were escheatable for the period from 1900 to 1933 and consequently could be recovered in the present action. The Attorney General therefore further petitioned and prayed for a discovery and an accounting by Pennsylvania as to all these innumerable transactions and an order directing Pennsylvania to pay into the State treasury this escheatable property and any additional escheatable funds that such accounting and discovery may disclose, plus interest and penalties.</p>

If there were funds—to which cestui que trustent or trust depositors or corporations or former bondholders or creditors were entitled during the years between 1900 and 1933—which were erroneously and unlawfully appropriated as bank income, such sums should have been set aside in the reserve account of the respective banks, or deducted in determining and paying the dividends paid to persons owning stock in those years, and this “eseheatable” liability should have been taken into account in computing the book values which are (and were) so important and material in an exchange of shares of stock in mergers. The stockholders today are not the bank stockholders in the period 1900 to 1933.

    <p id="b155-6" data-blocks='[["BL_155.8",155,[171,1106,1151,639]]]'>After devoting nearly half of its opinion to dicta concerning the question of whether the petition states a cause of action, the majority then abandons that ground and bases its decision solely on the ground of laches—a matter not decided by the court below and only mentioned in passing by the parties on this appeal. The majority’s observations and innuendoes as to whether these funds are escheatable will serve therefore only to confuse future litigants and to cause this Court unnecessary problems when the issue is again presented. I must respectfully disassociate myself from such judicial behavior.</p>
    <p id="b155-7" data-blocks='[["BL_155.9",155,[168,1758,1150,584]],["BL_156.1",156,[251,341,1145,263]]]'>As for the question of laches, I disagree with the majority that the issue can be decided on the basis of appellee’s preliminary objections. We have consistently held—as the majority recognizes—that laches can be raised by preliminary objections only where it clearly appears on the <em>face of the petition. </em>See, e.g., <em>Bowie Coal Company Petition, </em><a href="/pa/368/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="368 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1230311" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0102-01">368 Pa. 102</a>, 108, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.2d%2024" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="82 A.2d 24">82 A. 2d 24</a>, 27 (1951). But the allegations of prejudice upon which the majority relies—payment of past dividends and mergers based on these funds—do <em>not </em>appear in the petition but are mentioned for the first time in <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>the preliminary objection itself. Since these factual assertions are not admitted by appellant, we have, to use the majority’s term, “a speaking demurrer” and consequently the defense of laches has been improperly raised.</p>
    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[252,611,1148,480]]]'>Moreover, as Ave stated in <em>Rush v. Butler Fair &amp; Agricultural </em>Association, <a href="/pa/391/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="391 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1276878" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0181-01">391 Pa. 181</a>, 186-87, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20245" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="137 A.2d 245">137 A. 2d 245</a>, 248 (1958), “usually the question of laches can be determined only after the court has had an opportunity to appraise the evidence and so determine whether a valid reason exists for the delay in bringing suit.” Consequently, even if the factual assertions of prejudice prove to be true, appellant should be given the opportunity to explain and defend its actions.</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[321,1103,477,42]]]'>Accordingly, I dissent.</p>
