The Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, being of the opinion that the News Company’s complaint did allege “such a property right as is the subject of an action in unfair competition”, held that it could “retain jurisdiction for the purpose of determining that cause even though [such cause] is joined with a ‘substantial and related claim under the copyright laws’ ” and the court denied the Broadcasting Company’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.

      <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>The Broadcasting Company’s initial contention is that jurisdiction to entertain <em>both </em>causes of action declared upon in this complaint is <em>exclusively </em>in the federal courts by virtue of the provisions of the Act of June 25, 1948, C. 646, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A71338" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="28 U.S.C. §1338">28 U.S.C.A. §1338</a>(a), (b), which provides: “(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction <em>of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to </em>patents, <em>copyrights and </em>trademarks.

In line with this contention, the Broadcasting Company argues that the instant complaint contains <em>two </em>causes of action, i.e., one cause of action which arises under the United States laws relating to copyright <em>and </em>another cause of action which asserts an unfair competition claim joined with a substantial and related claim under the United States copyright laws, and that, <em>as to both causes of action, </em>the 1948 statute, supra, vests <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction in the federal courts. Since an examination of the complaint clearly indicates that it does state these two causes of action, our initial inquiry is whether the 1948 statute confers <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction in <em>both </em>causes of action upon the federal courts.</p>

Until <em>Hurn v. Oursler, </em>in the absence of diversity of citizenship, claims based upon unfair competition were determinable only in state courts but, under <em>Hurn v. Oursler </em>and its doctrine of <em>pendent </em>jurisdiction, federal courts were then permitted to consider claims of unfair competition if related to a substantial federal issue when both issues were based on substantially the same facts and federal courts were permitted to determine such a claim of unfair competition even though the court eventually denied the validity of the claim that a patent, trademark or copyright had been infringed or declared the validity of the patent, trademark or copyright invalid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

However, such <em>permissive </em>jurisdiction does not render the jurisdiction of the federal courts <em>exclusive </em>in nature or oust state courts of their jurisdiction over claims of unfair competition. In this connection, it is highly significant to note that the Congress in the enactment of §1338(a) <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>specifically prescribed that, in the class of action therein considered, the jurisdiction of the federal courts should be <em>exclusive </em>but did not do so in its enactment of §1338(b). The inclusion of the sentence specifically rendering exclusive the jurisdiction conferred in §1338(a) and the omission of such a sentence in §1338(b) is a revelation of the Congressional intent that jurisdiction under §1338(b) be permissive rather than exclusive. The purpose of §1338(b)—to avoid piecemeal litigation—is not persuasive of a Congressional intent to render the jurisdiction conferred as <em>exclusive. </em>In our view, even if the second cause of action in this complaint be considered a claim of unfair competition which is joined by a claim under the copyright laws which latter is substantial and related, such cause of action is cognizable by and within the jurisdiction of state courts and the court below properly refused to dismiss the complaint as to this second cause of action.</p>

The United States Supreme Court held that the Associated Press, as against the International News Service, possessed an equitable “quasi-property” right in the news, even after its publication, and that the appropriation of such news for its own gain and profit amounted to unfair competition and such conduct was enjoinable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Our examination of the pleadings convinces us that, insofar as the News Company pleads a violation of the copyright laws of the United States, such cause of action is cognizable only in the federal courts but insofar as the News Company pleads that the Broadcasting Company has “pirated” news items gathered through the special services of the News Company, such states a violation of a property right and a claim of unfair competition which the state courts have jurisdiction to determine.

The falsehood is a little more subtle, the injury a little more indirect, than in ordinary cases of unfair trade, but I think that the principle that condemns the one condemns the other.
