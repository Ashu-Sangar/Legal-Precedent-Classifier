He was offered by plaintiffs as an expert on lighting fixtures, theater seats, and carpeting. On direct examination, he testified: “Q. What about such items as fixtures attached to the buildings, such as seats, lighting fixtures and things of that nature; what has been your experience so far as they are concerned. A. 'With seats I have had no experience, however, in this case, however, I talked to three different manufacturers, and, of course, they were often conversations, explained to them what my problem was, and they came up with what I thought was the proper answer.”</p>

A. Are you finished? Q. Yes? A. I have never examined seats of any kind at any time. Q. Then you don't feel as though you yourself could evaluate the cost insofar as repairing a condition, or making a condition similar to what it should be insofar as seats are concerned? A. I believe that if I could not have gotten that answer, I could have talked to — Q. Now, you have never had any experience regarding theatre seats, that is true, isn't it? A. That is true. Q. And if you never had any experience insofar as theatre seats are concerned, you then of your own knowledge could not formulate an opinion as to what it would cost to repair the damages to seats, would you? A. I believe I could, Mr. Dean. I have upholstered a chair, and painted a chair, and I can come up with a proper answer to reupholster a seat or a chair. Q. And who did you repair these for? A. For myself. Q. Oh, for youself? A. That's right. Q. How many chairs did you upholster for yourself? A. Oh, in my lifetime, five or six. Q. Five or six? A. Yes. Q. And now you think you are an expert upholsterer? A. I think I could estimate the cost. Q. And they are the qualifications that you are going to use in conjunction with giving an opinion here of your own knowledge and experience as to the condition or cost of repairing or replacing seats in a theatre? A. In this case I came up with my own figure, and then talked to suppliers of theatre seats and upholsterers who gave me a foundation to work with. Q. But the only experience you had was the reupholstering the five or six chairs for yourself? A. That's right. Q. You never had any experience with theatres, with theater seats? A. That's right. Q. Your business is really construction business, isn't it? A. That's right. Q. And when you talk about construction business, you mean the building, and parts that <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>are parts of the building, isn't that true? A. That's right. Q. Your business in the construction business has nothing to do with carpets, is that right? A. That is true. Q. Can you tell me when you ever examined a theatre to evaluate insofar as carpet damage is concerned, if at all? A. The only theatre was the Bellevue Theatre. Q. The only theatre was the Bellevue Theatre? A. That's right. Q. And prior to that you have had no personal experience insofar as carpets, seats, etc. in a theatre are concerned, is that true? A.
