The Association and the unions <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>agreed upon a master contract binding on all members of the Association and the unions in the Local Joint Executive Board of Philadelphia. Brown was a member of the Association and, therefore, bound under the .master contract. There is some evidence that Broad-Race had become a member of the Association and there is certainly evidence that Broad-Race did not contribute to the Welfare Fund established under the master contract, or, at the least, did not contribute voluntarily.</p>

Broad-Race’s delinquency to the Welfare Fund also was discussed. At a subsequent meeting between the same parties, attended also by the secretary-treasurer of the Union, Ronnie’s Bar informed the Union that they would not join the Association.

The Union took the position that the waitresses were entitled to this length vacation under the master contract previously in effect; Mr. Chesnick, the secretary-treasurer of Ronnie’s Bar, felt that only the length of service with Ronnie’s Bar should count toward the computation of vacation entitlement and that previous service with other owners should not be taken into account. Mr. Chesnick had been manager of the restaurant when it was owned by Brown and knew that Brown had a labor contract with the Union and that the employees were Union <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>members, but he denied that he knew that Broad-Race had such a contract.</p>

An examination of the opinion of the Board reveals its rationale in so finding: (a) interpreting the word “regular” in the statute as exclusive of the idea of that which is “occasional, <em>accidental, </em>incidental or casual”, the Board, relying in large measure on testimony of the two women that their new employment was only on a temporary basis<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and that they <em>intended </em>to return to Ronnie’s.

We question this . . . it seems to us that <em>lack of equivalence must be disclosed in realms more material than the mind and sensibility of one of the individuals </em>concerned." (emphasis supplied). If the <em>intent </em>expressed by these two women is to determine whether the employment they have obtained is <em>regular employment </em>then the status of such women as employees under § 3(d) is determinable on rather a nebulous basis. In our view, such was not the legislative intent or purpose. Whether these women are eligible as employees under § 3(d) should depend on objective, rather than subjective, factors if the statute is to have meaning. The emphasis placed by the Board on the expressed intent of these two women to eventually return to work at Ronnie's Bar clearly indicates that the Board deemed the expression of such intent controlling in large measure in concluding that these two women had not obtained "regular employment"; in so doing, the Board clearly erred.</p>

The Board reasoned that by virtue of long employment with Ronnie’s Bar these two women had built up a following among the customers of Ronnie’s Bar which resulted in their receipt of more generous tips than they would receive in another restaurant where they had worked <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>but a comparatively short period of time. The difficulty with the Board’s conclusion is that it finds, no support on this <em>record; </em>there is not a scintilla of evidence as to the amount of tips received in Ronnie’s Bar as compared with the amount of tips received in the new restaurant. With the same lack of evidence the Board well might have concluded that a waitress could take her following with her from.the old to the new job and be no worse , off economically. : In its conclusion, that the new employment was not equivalent to the old employment because of the. difference in tips' received by the two waitresses the Board erred simply because there was no evidence on that subject whatsoever.</p>

In fairness to these two.women they should be granted an- opportunity to prove, if they can, that their remuneration by way of tips in the <em>new </em>restaurant is so greatly different than that in <em>the 'old </em>restaurant that the new employment cannot be considered the. equivalent of employment in the old restaurant.

Remanding this case “to the Board for the production of [such] testimony, if any there be”, is, in my view, uncalled for and unnecessary. This venture into a search for such theoretical evidence is an unwarranted basis for further delay and expense, particularly since no party in interest offered to produce any such evidence or requested further hearing.</p>
