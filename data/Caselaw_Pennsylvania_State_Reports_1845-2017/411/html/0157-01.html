There, an automobile attempted to pass a wagon, the horses slipped on ice, the wagon skidded and struck the automobile, killing the plaintiff’s decedent. The plaintiff contended that the accident occurred because the defendant’s driver “jerked' his horses toward the curb,” and that this jerking was the proximate cause of the accident. Justice Drew, speaking for the Court, said that if the accident happened in this manner, the defendant’s act constituted negligence, and the verdict, which had been returned in the court below, should' not be disturbed. ' He said, however, that the evidence did not substantiate this claim and accordingly sustained the judgment n.o.v., which <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>bad been entered by tbe lower court. Then, in summing up the case, he made the broad statement that: “The skidding of a vehicle does not of itself establish or constitute negligence. It is encumbent upon the plaintiff to prove the skidding-resulted from the negligent act of the defendant; otherwise he is absolved from the consequences.” This ample assertion has undoubtedly caused a great deal of misunderstanding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It was not necessary in justifying the ratio decidendi. It was, like firing a shotgun to bring down a butterfly. In attempted buttressing of this thesis, Justice Drew cited the ease of <em>Ferrell v. </em>Solski, <a href="/pa/278/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="278 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="1080491" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0565-01">278 Pa. 565</a>, which had nothing whatever to do with skidding, the word not having been mentioned once in the entire opinion written by Justice Sadler.</p>

There, the plaintiff Richardson testified that while he was driving westwardly on the Pennsylvania Turnpike the defendant’s car, being driven by Mrs. Patterson in an eastwardly direction, skidded across the medial strip and struck Richardson on <em>his </em>side of the highway. The Majority Opinion in that decision, a strong dissenting opinion having been filed by Justice Ladner, said: . “Had the plaintiff been content with proving that the collision occurred in the westbound lane where Mrs. Patterson’s car, proceeding eastwardly, should not have been, the burden would have been upon the defendant to offer exculpatory proof if she wished to be found not guilty of causitive negligence. The presence of an automobile on the wrong side of a highway is-prima facie evidence of the driver’s negligence.”</p>

      <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>This kind of a ruling amounts practically to an invitation to strategic testimony instead of forthright testimony. Although the plaintiff saw the defendant skid across the medial strip and so stated, the Court suggests he should not have so stated because, and here is the blast of the shotgun, “the explanation of how the Patterson (defendant) car came to be in the wrong traffic lane was supplied by the plaintiff himself when he offered evidence that it was the result of skidding.” But the plaintiff’s statement was no explanation of the <em>cause </em>for the defendant’s car being on the wrong side of the highway. No matter how the defendant found herself in the wrong lane, she was where she had no right to be, and it was her obligation to explain what she was doing there, and how she got there. The majority opinion cited, as authority for its decision, the telltale above-quoted declaration in the <em>Johnson </em>case, supra, and then added: “That rule has been frequently recognized and reiterated.” It may have been frequently reiterated, but it is still error. It does not comport with the law and certainly not with fundamental justice, logic or reason.</p>

Certainly a pedestrian on the sidewalk, when he is struck by a car which skids from the highway on to the sidewalk, injuring him, is not required by the law to employ mechanics to inspect the invading vehicle, and surveyors to measure the distances, and to look for witnesses to testify to the undue speed, mechanical difficulties or other causes for the intruder’s violent trespassing.</p>

For instance, if it is established that the defendant was driving at 125 miles per hour before he skidded into the plaintiff’s car, the plaintiff’s use of the word “skidding”, in describing the accident, would in no way save the defendant from the necessity of explaining away his highly dangerous speed.</p>

      <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>What the rule about skidding amounts to is simply this. If the plaintiff, in a given accident, shows that the defendant was proceeding at a proper speed, that he (the defendant) was on his own proper side of the road,, that the road was in good repair and dry, and he (the defendant) was obeying all the rules of the highway, and the plaintiff then merely adds that the defendant’s car skidded, the plaintiff, in that kind of a situation, will not have made out a prima facie case of negligence. But where, as here, the defendant’s tractor-trailer appropriated both lanes of the highway, throwing before the plaintiffs’ decedents a wall of body-crushing slate, the plaintiffs had no obliga-, tión, in making out a prima facie case, to explain how and why this highway monopolization occurred. It so happens, in any event, as already indicated that the explanation for the skidding did not come from the plaintiffs or anyone representing the plaintiffs. The police officer Kowitz did not in his direct testimony testify to this conversation with Parsons. It was only when defendants’ counsel cross-examined Parsons with regard to that conversation that plaintiffs’ counsel then brought out what Parsons had said about “skidding.” Thus, even under the rule in <em>Nixon v. Chiarilli, </em>the plaintiffs made out a prima facie case.</p>

There, the plaintiff Pascale was injured when his car was struck in the rear by the car of the defendant Simmons. Immediately after the collision, Simmons said: “I am sorry but my brakes failed me.” Because this statement was introduced into the case by witnesses for the plaintiff, the defendant argued that there was a burden on the plaintiff to show how and why the brakes had failed. It was also argued, as was done in the <em>Richardson </em>case, that because the plaintiff produced more than was required to prove <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>his case, the burden was thrust upon him to prove what otherwise would not have been within the purview of his evidentiary responsibility. To this argument we replied: “It is fallacious to argue, as the court below did, and as the defendants here repeat, that if the plaintiff had merely shown that he had been struck in the rear by the defendant’s truck, his case would have been for the jury, but because by speaking the whole truth and relating what the defendant Simmons said, the case is to be taken away from the jury. Such an argument has the aspects of recommending guile; it gives the impression of stating that- a trial should be a game of wits and not a candid disclosure of reality. Moreover, it places upon the plaintiff the strange burden of vouching for the truth of his opponent’s words. Pascale did not know and would have no way of knowing whether Simmons was telling the truth or not when he said his brakes failed. Nor was it Pascale’s concern, and certainly not his duty, to show that the brakes failed because they were defective and that Simmons knew they were defective. Suppose Simmons had said that he ran into the plaintiff’s car in order to avoid striking a child, would the plaintiff then have had the obligation to find and produce the hypothetical child?”</p>

On the other hand, experience would support the view that it works more often on the side of justice than injustice. To allow the survivor of a clash between contending individuals to tell the story of what occurred, giving himself the advantage on every controversial point when his opponent cannot rise from his grave to refute, deny or answer, spells out an unfairness so clearly that one need not linger on the subject unduly. However, it is to be noted here that Parsons could have testified to the nature of his conversation with Officer Kowitz if he believed Kowitz had not correctly related what he (Parsons) said to him. The fact that Parsons in no way contradicted Kowitz’s narrative as to what occurred would suggest that he was satisfied Kowitz had taken no liberties in relating the conversation.
