    <p id="b326-42" data-blocks='[["BL_326.28",326,[247,1353,1148,155]]]'>(Emphasis supplied). This document was admitted over appellant’s objections and appellant was convicted of speeding. An appeal to this Court followed..</p>
    <p id="b326-43" data-blocks='[["BL_326.29",326,[243,1516,1150,477]]]'>Appellant raises two contentions: First, he maintains that the foregoing certificate does not satisfy §1002(d.l) <em>(2) </em>which provides that a “certificate . . . showing . . . that the radar apparatus was accurate . . . shall be competent and prima facie evidence of the . . . accuracy of the radar apparatus. . . and second, that the certificate of accuracy is incompetent as hearsay evidence to prove that the Secretary of Revenue had approved this type of machine.</p>
    <p id="b326-44" data-blocks='[["BL_326.30",326,[242,2004,1147,316]],["BL_327.1",327,[156,331,1150,255]]]'>With regard to the first question, it is not necessary for the official testing station to make the precise statement that “this machine has been found accurate” in order to meet the statutory requirement set forth above. The title of the document manifests this conclusion by the statement that it is a “Certificate of <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>Radar Speedmeter Accuracy.” Having adjusted the machine for accuracy, the testing station issued, thé certificate in question. Had they been unable to adjust and calibrate the machine within acceptable limits, such certificate would not have been issued.</p>
    <p id="b327-3" data-blocks='[["BL_327.4",327,[155,608,1151,968]]]'>Since this document is prima facie' evidence of- the accuracy of the machine, the burden of proof was upon appellant to establish that it was not accurate. Appellant failed to. sustain this burden. By its' use of- the word “accurate” the legislature did not require absolute exactness since no machine is capable of such precise measurement. However,- it did not intend that the variance between true speed and indicated speed should be of such a magnitude as to prejudice the driver. Applying the statistics contained-in the table of the certificate to the facts of the instant case, it is evident that the differential between true speed and indicated speed did not prejudice appellant who was timed at 59 miles per hour. After making adjustment for this variance, we find that the true speed of appellant at the time he was stopped for speeding was 58.7 miles per hour, considerably in excess of the 50 miles per hour legal limit for trucks.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Since the statement in question is hearsay, <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>in the absence of an exempting statutory provision it is only admissible if it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[243,498,1150,801]]]'>The only two pertinent exceptions are those dealing with business records and official statements. Appellee was apparently under the erroneous impression that the exempting provision of §1002(d.l) (2), supra, also applied to the Secretary’s approval and consequently made no effort to lay a foundation for the introduction of this item under the business records exception. There was no evidence introduced to show the identity and mode of preparation of the document, nor was there any testimony that it was made in the regular course of business at or near the time of the event. See Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act of May 4, 1939, P.L. 42, No. 35, §2, 28 P.S. §91b. Therefore, this item is not admissible under the business records exception.</p>
    <p id="b328-5" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[239,1319,1150,635]]]'>This item is also inadmissible under the official statements exception. In order for a record to qualify under this exception, it is necessary that it be made pursuant to an official duty. See 5 Wigmore, Evidence, §1630 et seq. (3rd ed. 1940). Cf. <em>Fauceglia v. Harry, </em><a href="/pa/409/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="409 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1883319" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0155-01">409 Pa. 155</a>, 160, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20598" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="185 A.2d 598">185 A. 2d 598</a>, 601 (1962). The official testing station, the Bendix Corporation, was under a duty to test and record the accuracy of the radar machines, but it was not part of its duty to approve the <em>type </em>of radar apparatus employed. Hence, this evidence is not admissible under the official statements exception.</p>
