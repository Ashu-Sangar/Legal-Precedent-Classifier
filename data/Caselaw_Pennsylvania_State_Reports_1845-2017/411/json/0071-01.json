        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nThe basic, question raised upon this appeal is whether the search of an automobile and the seizure of some of the contents of the trunk of that automobile were incidental to a concededly valid arrest.\nIn the early morning of April 7, 1960, a dwelling house, located on North Frazier. Street, Philadelphia, and occupied by a Mrs. Quattlebaum (the deceased), and her two small children, was destroyed by fire and its occupants burned to death. While the fire was still burning, Detective Raifer went to the scene of - the fire where he learned that \u201cthe fire had probably been caused by an accelerant.\u201d\nWhile at the scene of the fire, Detective Raifer, having learned that the deceased had recently been having difficulties, with. a \u201cboy friend\u201d, known as \u201cBill\u201d, interrogated a Miss Planet, the deceased\u2019s next door neighbor. Miss Planet identified \u201cBill\u201d as Charles Cockfield, a resident' of the \u201c200 block\u201d of South Alden Street. She told the police officer that Cockfield had exhibited \u201ca pattern and action of violence\u201d and, on one occasion, had put a knife to the deceased\u2019s throat'; that the deceased had received threatening letters from Cockfield which Miss Planet had seen; that deceased\u2019s dwelling house had previously had a fire of unknown origin. .\nActing upon this information, Detective Raifer went to Cockfield\u2019s home on South Alden Street but was unable to secure admission. Leaving other officers to maintain a surveillance of Cockfield\u2019s home, Detective Raifer, through his superior officer, ascertained that Cockfield- was the registered owner of a 1953 Dodge automobile and, about 5:30 a.m., April 7th, this automobile, its motor still warm, was located about three-quarters of a block from Cockfield\u2019s home. Detective Raifer examined the automobile and its glove compartment and kept the automobile under surveillance until about 8:15 a.m. on that date, at which time the car trunk was examined and, in addition to tools, a fruit basket and construction paraphernalia, there was found a \u201ctwo gallon Gulf, blue and orange . . . gasoline can that was lying on its side\u201d and under it \u201c. . . a wet spot-on top of the fruit basket. . . which smelled like gasoline\u201d together with \u201ca roll of sort of pale, green toilet paper, and,' on the edge of the roll, itself, there, were charred marks, charred as if. from fire.\u201d The trunk was then closed and its contents left undisturbed.\nThereafter, the Cockfield automobile was removed by the police and placed in front of a nearby police precinct station where its distributor cap was removed and certain wires disconnected. All police districts were notified to report any inquiry concerning the whereabouts of this automobile. The automobile disappeared from in front of the precinct station that afternoon.\nIn the early morning of April 8th, Cockfield was taken into custody at his home and in the early morning of April 9th made a statement to the police wherein he admitted that he had thrown gasoline from the can on the porch of the deceased\u2019s honse in order to frighten her and show her what might happen, but he denied having ignited the gasoline or having anything to do with the fire. Thereafter, Cockfield was taken to his home for a change of clothing and then arraigned on charges of murder, manslaughter and arson.\nThe next day\u2014April 10th\u2014Detective Eaifer searched Cockfield\u2019s car and seized the gasoline can and toilet tissue from the trunk. Neither in connection with the arrest of Cockfield nor with the search of his automobile and the seizure of some of its contents did the police officers have any warrant.\nOn Iday 5th, 1962, Cockfield\u2019s counsel moved to suppress as evidence the gasoline can and toilet tissue on the ground they had been obtained through an illegal search and seizure. After a hearing in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia County before the Honorable Gerald Gleeson, that court directed the suppression of the evidence. From that order, the Commonwealth has appealed to this Court.\nTwo questions are raised: (a) does Mapp v. Ohio, supra, require state courts to conform to federal tests as to the \u201creasonableness\u201d of a search and seizure?; (b) was the search of Cockfield\u2019s automobile and the seizure therefrom of the gasoline can and toilet tissue a reasonable search and seizure within the Constitution purview?\nThe first question raised has been considered and determined in Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, 411 Pa. 56, 190 A. 2d 304 (1963). In Bosurgi, we have held that state courts are still free, in passing upon the \u201creasonableness\u201d of a search and seizure, to apply their own, rather than federal, standards as to what constitutes \u201creasonableness\u201d.\nAs to the second question raised, since the validity and the legality of the arrest of Cockfield is not questioned, the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the search and the seizure depends basically upon whether such search and seizure were incidental to the arrest.\nIt is well established that, if an arrest is valid, a search and seizure which are incidental to that arrest are valid: Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, supra (p. 56) and cases therein cited.\nIn passing upon the validity of the search and the seizure in the case at bar certain facts have been established or assumed: (a) the search and seizure to which objection is made is that which took place on April 10, subsequent to the arrest, and not the alleged search which took place on April 7th, prior to the arrest; (b) the search and seizure took place 57 hours after Cockfield was taken in custody and 25% hours after Coekfield\u2019s formal arraignment; (c) prior to Cockfield\u2019s arrest his automobile had been in the custody of the police for approximately 7 to 8 hours. before it was repossessed by Cockfield and, during this period of time, no. seizure of evidence took place although the evidence had been seen; (d) in Cockfield\u2019s written statement to the police, given approximately 23 hours prior to the search of the automobile, reference is made to both the gasoline can and the toilet tissue in the trunk.\nThe court below, as clearly appears from an examination of its opinion, took the position that \u201cample opportunity was presented to obtain a search warrant and there was no compelling sense of urgency which would justify the search of the car without a warrant\u201d and that \u201cthe search and seizure conducted two days later cannot be seen as being incident to the earlier initial arrest\u201d. On both grounds the court erred.\nThe absence of a search warrant cannot per se be equated with \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of a search. The United States Supreme Court in U.S. v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 65, 66, 70 S. Ct. 430, stated: \u201cThe relevant test is not whether it is reasonable to procure a search warrant, but whether the search was reasonable.. That criterion in turn depends upon the facts and circumstances\u2014the total atmosphere of the case.\u201d In Commonwealth v. Czajhowski, 198 Pa. Superior Ct. 511, 516, 182 A. 2d 298, the Superior Court said: \u201cWe think that the search of the car at the police station turned upon its reasonableness and propriety under the circumstances rather than upon the practicability of procuring a search warrant.\u201d The fact that the police officers might have had the opportunity to secure a search warrant does not detract from the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the instant search if the \u201ctotality of the facts\u201d surrounding the search and seizure were reasonable and, particularly, if the search and seizure were incidental to the valid arrest.\n\u201cIncidental\u201d, in its pertinent meaning, refers to that which follows as an \u201cincident\u201d, i.e., \u201can event of accessory or subordinate character\u201d (The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. V, p. 152). In our view, the search and seizure of the contents of Cockfield\u2019s automobile were clearly \u201cincidental\u201d to the arrest and the one logically followed the other. The time which elapsed between the time of the arrest and the time of the search does not destroy the character of the search as incidental to the arrest. The search and seizure flowed naturally from and were part and parcel of the normal and logical consequences of the arrest. Had the police officers not searched this automobile and seized this gasoline can and tissue they would have been derelict in their duties. Their actions did not constitute an unlawful or unconstitutional invasion of the right of privacy of Cockfield and, viewed under all the circumstances presented on the instant record, the search and seizure were clearly \u201creasonable\u201d in nature and \u201cincidental\u201d to the valid arrest.\nThe court below in suppressing the evidence, secured by this lawful search and seizure was clearly in error.\nOrder reversed.\nCockfield, in the meantime, found his automobile in front of the precinct station, apparently was told the police did not want it, went out and bought the parts necessary to start it and removed the automobile to the residence of one Curtis Wally, Cockfield's friend.\nThis was a post-indictment motion made over two years after the arrest (April 9th, 1960) and almost two years after indictment (May 19th, 1960) but prior to trial on the charges. It is difficult to understand, and the record discloses no reason, why Cockfield remained untried for a period of over two years after his arrest. Even though the search and seizure took place prior to Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, Mapp governs this situation and, if the evidence was illegally obtained, such evidence would be subject fco suppression.\nOn the right of the Commonwealth to appeal from this order, see: Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, 411 Pa. 56, 190 A. 2d 304 (1963).\nIn 1948, in Trupiano v. U.S., 334 U.S. 699, 68 S. Ct. 1229, the Court held that a valid arrest did not in itself justify a search without warrant and that the Government must show that under the circumstances it was unreasonable or impracticable to require the arresting officer to obtain a warrant. In Rabinowitz, supra (p. 66), in 1950 the Court said: \u201cTo the extent that Trupiano v. United States, requires a search warrant solely upon the basis of the practicability of procuring it rather than upon the reasonableness of the search after a lawful arrest, that case is overruled.\u201d\nSee: State v. Brooks, 57 Wash. 2d 422, 357 P. 2d 735, 736.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen:\nIn attempting to justify the searches and seizures in Commonwealth v. Bosurgi and Commonwealth v. Cockfield, the Commonwealth presents alternative arguments: (1) either the searches were valid under federal standards, or (2) Mapp v. Ohio does not require state courts to follow federal standards and the seizures involved do not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment since they resulted from reasonable police activity. In holding that the evidence need not be suppressed, the majority first declares that Mapp v. Ohio does not require state courts to follow federal standards. It then proceeds, however, to uphold the searches under federal standards, a decision which renders its statements about the impact of Mapp v. Ohio as obiter dictum.\nI dissent from the decisions in Bosurgi and Cock-field for two reasons. First, I disagree with the majority\u2019s view that these seizures can be upheld under federal standards. Secondly, even assuming that Mapp v. Ohio permits state courts to adopt less strict standards for judging the reasonableness of a search and seizure, the police activity in these cases violates the fourteenth amendment\u2019s guarantee against invasions of privacy.\nIn Bosurgi, the majority holds that an uncorroborated tip from an anonymous informant constitutes \u201cprobable cause\u201d to arrest, thereby validating a search without a warrant incident to the arrest. Such holding is directly contrary to the federal cases on this point. The federal law is summarized as follows: \u201cAll the cases in which a \u2018tip\u2019 has been heavily relied upon to establish probable cause have stressed the need for \u2018a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay,\u2019 (citing a case), or a record of \u2018accurate and reliable information,\u2019 (citing a case) ; in short, \u2018a previously reliable informant,\u2019 (citing a case). Prudent and cautious men would not act in so decisive a fashion in reliance on an uncorroborated anonymous caller. . . .\u201d (Costello v. United States, 298 F. 2d 99, 101 (9th Cir. 1962). Therefore, the search and seizure in Bosurgi cannot be upheld under federal standards.\nThe majority\u2019s conclusion that there was \u201cprobable cause\u201d under the federal cases for the arrest of defendant-Bosurgi is all the more surprising in view of the fact that the Commonwealth places little emphasis in its brief upon justifying the seizure under federal standards. The Commonwealth\u2019s main argument is that we should break away from the rigid federal formulas for judging the legality of searches and seizures, and instead establish a test of whether the police activity in question was reasonable under the circumstances. Without deciding whether we are free to adopt the standard proposed by the Commonwealth, I cannot agree that the police acted in a reasonable manner in Bosurgi. No explanation is offered why the police did not first observe, defendant\u2019s activities in the taproom and attempt to corroborate the anonymous tip, instead of. immediately arresting and searching him. Therefore, even, under the test suggested by the Commonwealth, I would hold that the evidence seized in Bor surgi must be suppressed.\nTurning next to the Cockfield decision, the majority holds that the search of the automobile without a warrant was justified under the federal rule of \u201csearch incident, to arrest,\u201d although at the time of the search defendant-Cockfield had been safely - behind bars for. 24 hours and the automobile was parked across the street from the police station. The meaning and rationale behind the search incident, to arrest doctrine\u2014 the only occasion under federal law where, a search can be conducted without a warrant\u2014is not to be sought in the Oxford English Dictionary, as the. majority-does, but rather in the considerable body of federal law dealing with that concept. The two. purposes of the rule are to protect the arresting officer from bodily harm, and. to prevent the defendant from destroying evidence which is \u201cwithin his control.\u201d See United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56 (1950). Where, as here, the defendant has been in custody for 24 hours the rule is obviously inapplicable. Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20 (1925).\nIn addition, no explanation is. offered why a search warrant was not secured. Although Rabinowitz -holds that it is not necessary for the prosecution to justify in each case the failure to obtain a search warrant, the failure to secure a warrant where, as in the instant case, one could easily, be obtained without danger of a disappearance of the evidence, is a factor in determining the validity of the search and seizure. See Chapman v. United States, 365 U. S. 610 (1961).\nThe failure to obtain a warrant under the circumstances presented in Cockfield would also lead me to hold, under the test suggested by the Commonwealth, that the police activity was not reasonable or proper. Therefore, I would hold that the evidence must be suppressed under either alternative presented by the Commonwealth.\nFor the above reasons, I dissent in Commonwealth v. Bosurgi and Commonwealth v. Cockfield.\nThe possible interpretations of the Mapp decision are set forth in Note, The Supreme Court 1960 Term, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 40, 152-58 (1961). See also, Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion in the recent United States Supreme Court decision of Gideon v. Wainwright, 31 U.S. L. Week 4291 (March 18, 1963).\nIn Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25 (1949), the United States Supreme Court held that the fourth amendment\u2019s protection against invasions of privacy is embodied in the fourteenth amendment. In Mapp, the Court took the next logical step and held that evidence obtained in violation of this Constitutional guarantee must be excluded by state courts.\nThe most recent United States Supreme Court eases on what constitutes \u201cprobable cause\u201d to arrest are Henry v. United Stales, 361 U.S. 98 (1959) (no probable cause) ; Draper v. United, States, 358 U.S. 307 (1959) (probable cause where a paid, reliable informant and tip corroborated by personal observations of the arresting officer) ; and Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257 (1960) (probable cause where a reliable informant and defendant a known user of narcotics).\nThe practical signifance of such a test would be to permit arrests where only reasonable suspicion exists that defendant has committed an offense, and to permit searches without warrants although not made incident to an arrest.
