The lower court, in refusing the motion for a new trial, said: \u201cIn essence, the d\u00e9fendants complain that the jury disregarded testimony presented by them, but in the very nature of things the jury cannot accept both plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 versions of'a disputed fact. Where there is a conflict in the testimony between opposing parties, it is the function and the duty of the jury to determine which of the contradicting statements is the more credible\u2014in the absence of a possible reconciliation of the controverting evidence.\u201d\nThis is a correct statement of the law, and we find the lower court did not abuse its discretion in refusing a new trial on the basis of the evidence as to the color of the traffic light when the accident occurred, or any other factor in the case.\nThe appellants argue also that the trial court erred in affirming the plaintiff\u2019s fifth point for charge which stated in effect that the jury\u2019s conclusion did not need to be the only one possible under the facts. This question was definitively decided by this Court in Smith v. Bell Telephone Co., 397 Pa. 134, and the trial court acted properly in the matter.\nJudgment affirmed.",
