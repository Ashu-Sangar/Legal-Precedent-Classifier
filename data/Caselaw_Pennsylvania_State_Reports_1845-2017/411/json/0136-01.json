        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nLouis Klemow died April 22, 1961, survived by his wife Bessie and six adult children. He left ah estat\u00e9 of approximately $30,000. He bequeathed inter alia $1,000 to his wife, $9,000 to two named children, $500 to Azudas Israel Congregation of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and his residuary estate to his six children.\nThis is an appeal by Lucy Arman, sometimes referred to as Mrs. Arman, and by Susie Guba from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Luzerne County, which disallowed several of their claims against the Estate of Louis Klemow, deceased.\nLucy Arman\u2019s Claims\nFor 18 years immediately preceeding his death, Klemow and Mrs. Arman cohabited and were known in the community in which they resided as husband and wife. They occupied a five room apartment located on the second floor of the Valley Hotel, Nuremberg, Pennsylvania. This hotel was owned by Mrs. Arman. The hotel had a restaurant which was licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages, and a milk bar. Mrs. Arman contends (a) that the deceased was the, sole owner of the milk bar and that he never paid rent for the occupancy of this part of her hotel which he used for his milk bar, and (b) that the deceased never paid for his apartment, or for his board and meals for 18 years, and (c) that he never paid for board, meals and personal care in the last six months of his illness.\nLucy Arman filed several claims totaling $13,916.95 against Klemow\u2019s Estate. Some of these claims were allowed and some were disallowed. Only two of her claims which were disallowed by the Orphans\u2019 Court are involved in this appeal, viz., (1) a claim in quantum meruit totaling $7,200 for \u201cMilk Bar Rent Bed Board Room Meals Apartment and Milk Bar rent September 1943 to April 22, 1961 18 years Charge for 6 years @100.00 per month 1200 - 6 years 7200.00\u201d and (2). another claim in quantum meruit totaling $2115. This last claim is apparently for board, meals and special care rendered decedent from November 9, 1960, the termination of his first hospitalization, to April 1, 1961, which was shortly before he reentered the hospital. Mrs. Arman\u2019s statement of claim lists this claim as follows: \u201cWhile Louis Klemow was sick at his home: . . . November 9, 1960 to April 1, 1961 141 days @ $15.00 $2115.00\u201d\nIt is apparent (as the auditing Judge stated) that tbe first enumerated claim includes at least part of the second claim and consequently both claims will be discussed together.\nThe evidence in this case indicates that Louis Klemow tended bar and at times purchased supplies and sundries for both the milk bar and the restaurant. He also selected and paid for various items of furniture used in the apartment which he and Mrs. Arman occupied in a meretricious relationship of 18 years duration, and participated in the arrangements to construct a garage in the rear of the hotel.\nWe note that a witness for claimants, Carrie E. Singley, testified that Klemow said to her on the 3d day of April, 1961, when he was in the hospital, and cried \u201cHe wanted to give Susie $500. . . . for her taking good care of him . . . and Lucy Arman was supposed to get half of what he had . . . for the wonderful care she gave him in the years that he lived with her.\u201d We further note that Lucy Arman makes no claim to half of Klemow\u2019s Estate under this statement allegedly made by him.\nThe record is devoid of any evidence which would indicate that Mrs. Arman ever asked or demanded payment for rent or for board and lodging or for any services or facilities furnished decedent during the 18 years he lived with her. If there was any express or implied agreement to pay for any of the aforesaid claims, Lucy\u2019s, failure to seek payment while Klemow was living is incomprehensible, particularly in view of the fact that decedent had ample money to pay his debts.\nCountless decisions of this Court have held (a) that claims against a dead man\u2019s estate\u2014if reasonable time and circumstances would have enabled claimant to demand payment in decedent\u2019s lifetime\u2014are viewed with suspicion and (b) that all claims against a dead man\u2019s estate must be proved by evidence which is clear, direct, precise and convincing: Petro v. Secary Estate, 403 Pa. 540, 543, 170 A. 2d 325. See to the same effect Sivak Estate, 409 Pa. 261, 185 A. 2d 778; Religa Estate, 409 Pa., 267, 186 A. 2d 42; Secary Estate, 407 Pa. 162, 180 A. 2d 572; Consentino v. Vittoria, 394 Pa. 538, 147 A. 2d 839. Furthermore, no recovery can be had against a decedent\u2019s estate for services rendered in expectation.of a legacy: Consentino v. Vittoria, 394 Pa., supra; Braden Estate, 363 Pa. 42, 68 A. 2d 734.\nIn Consentino v. Vittoria, 394 Pa. 538, 147 A. 2d 839, this Court said (pages 542-543) : \u201c. . . In Braden Estate [363 Pa. 42] (p. 45), in discussing the quality of evidence required to sustain a claim of this nature, we said: \u2018In respect to the contention that the furnishing of a room and of board and care to Lizzie Braden and her acceptance of the same during her lifetime created an implied contract, and that her estate should pay a. reasonable amount by way of compensation,, and that the complainants should be. permitted to recover on a quantum .meruit basis, what this Court held in G-ilbraith\u2019s Estate, 270 Pa. 288, 113 A. 361, in negativing such a claim is apposite here. In that' case we said, quoting from the syllabus: \u201cIn claims for board and nursing, the presumption is that the services were actually paid for periodically, exactly as is the rule in the case of servants\u2019 wages; and this presumption cannot be overcome by vague and uncertain testimony. Claims against a dead man\u2019s estate, which might have been made against him while living, are always the subject of just suspicion, and require clear proof before they will be allowed. ... No recovery can be had against a decedent\u2019s estate for services rendered in expectation of a legacy.\u201d \u2019\u201d\nWe agree with the following statement of the lower Court:\n\u201cIt would appear unusual to say the least to demand rental and/or board from a person with whom one shares an apartment for a period of eighteen years in a meretricious relationship. Because of the intimacy resulting in such relationship, in the absence of any demand for payment, there is strong indication that such services were rendered gratuitously. . . . because of the existence of that same relationship there is no presumption of a liability to pay for such services, n\u00f3r is an implied promise or intention to pay to be presumed.\u201d\nThe lower Court correctly rejected these claims of Lucy Arman.\nSusie Guba\u2019s Claim\nSusie Guba, the other appellant herein, filed a claim against the estate in the amount of $500 \u201c[f]or services rendered Louis Klemow while he was sick at the Valley Hotel, Nuremberg, Pennsylvania.\u201d These services covered a period of four or five months and included bathing, dressing and walking Klemow to the lavatory, as well as the preparation and serving of tea, milk, snacks, and the performance of other personal services.\nWe are constrained to deny Susie Guba\u2019s claim, although we believe she did in fact perform the aforesaid services. However the lower Court correctly. disallowed her claim because she failed to establish both the extent and the reasonable value of her services with evidence which was clear, direct, precise and convincing. Claimant Susie had one witness to prove the extent and reasonable, value of her services, Carrie E. Singley. - Mrs. Singley testified that she knew Mrs. Ar-man and Klemow for 18 years or more, that she worked for Mrs. Arman, and also worked for Mr. Klemow on Friday nights; and from the time Klemow got ont of the hospital until his death, four or five months later, she saw Susie Guba take care of him, give him baths and everything, rub his back, cut his toe nails and finger nails \u201cand done everything like that\u201d and she even cleaned his dirty clothes. She further testified that these services were worth more than a dollar an hour, and that Klemow told her shortly before his death \u201che wanted to give Susie $500 . . . for taking good care of him.\u201d\nWe agree with the lower Court that the extent and the reasonable value of Susie\u2019s services to Klemow were not established by evidence which was clear, direct, precise and convincing.\nDecree affirmed; costs to be equally divided between Lucy Arman and the executor of the estate of Louis Klemow.\nAppellants incorrectly joined in this appeal. Supreme Court Bule 20 provides: \u201cA. Parties interested jointly, severally or otherwise in any order, judgment or decree in the same case or in joint actions or in cases consolidated for the purpose of trial or argument, may join as appellants or be joined as appellees in \u00e1 single appeal where the grounds for appeal are similar\nIn' this ease the grounds for appeal were not similar. Lucy Arman and Susie Guba each had a separate and unrelated claim against the Estate of Louis Klemow. The Arman claim was for rental for.use of her milk bar for 18 years and board and lodging, and for care in his last illness. The Guba claim was for personal services rendered to the decedent in the last six months of his illness.",
