Dig. 510, pi. 12. This act provides the manner of service of a subpoena in divorce, and there is nothing in it which says either expressly or by inference that the service must be by the sheriff; on the contrary, the writ is directed to the respondent, and all that is required is that the respondent shall be served peronally, <em>wherever found, </em>within the State of Pennsylvania, and can be so served by anyone competent to make proof of service If the Act had contemplated a service by the sheriff <em>only, </em>there would have been no provision for the affidavit of proof, as the return of the writ on his official oath, as with other process, would have been sufficient. The writ was served by the sheriff of Montgomery county, because, although not required, service by the sheriff is always the best service, and the sheriff of Montgomery county was the only one who could serve the writ in that county as <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>sheriff: Keen <em>v. </em>Keen, 2 "W.

The courts of Philadelphia county have no authoriey to <em>order </em>the sheriff of this county to deputize the sheriff of another county to serve its process.

    <p id="b302-8" data-blocks='[["BL_302.10",302,[297,1202,1168,596]]]'>The service of the subpoena in this case appears to have been in strict conformity to the Act of Assembly. The libellant was domiciled in the county of Philadelphia and the proceeding for divorce was commenced there. The respondent resided in Montgomery county, and the subpoena was served by the sheriff of that county, who made the following return: “ Served Jacob Fillman, the within named respondent, by giving him April 30th 1881, a true and attested copy of the within writ, and making known unto him the contents thereof.” Upon application to the court below the service was set aside, the learned judge saying: “ The practice has been, ever since the time of J udge King, to get an order from the court of original jurisdiction before the service can be made by the sheriff of another county.”</p>
    <p id="b302-9" data-blocks='[["BL_302.11",302,[295,1799,1164,341]]]'>This practice appears to be peculiar to the county of Philadelphia ; at least the contrary prevails in many other counties. This is the first time, so far as I have been able to ascertain, that the question of its validity has been before this court. Undoubtedly a service in accordance therewith would be good. But is a previous order from the court of original jurisdiction essential ? If it is, many divorce proceedings throughout the State where the respondent has not appeared may be invalid.</p>

It requires, that it shall be served personally on the said party, wherever found, or that a copy shall be given to him or her fifteen days before the return of 'the same. There is nothing in the Act, either by its express terms or by necessary implica<a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>tion, which requires a service by the sheriff. The subpoena is not directed to him, but to the respondent; and it may be served by any one. A service by the sheriff is the better service, and this course is usually followed. In such case the return is more likely to be accurate. In either case due proof is required to be made of the service. Here the sheriff made an affidavit of the manner of service, which is the “ due proof ” referred to in the act. The said act does not require a special authorization from the court of original jurisdiction, nor has any reason been shown why such order should be obtained.</p>
    <p id="b303-6" data-blocks='[["BL_303.6",303,[189,834,1161,289]]]'>It has long been the practice in this state for a defendant to move to set aside a sheriff’s return, where he believes the writ to have been defectively served : Bujac <em>v. </em>Morgan, <a href="/yeates/3/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Yeates 258" data-case-ids="6772954" data-case-paths="/yeates/3/0258-01">3 Yeates 258</a>; Kleckner <em>v. </em>County of Lehigh, <a href="/whart/6/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Whart. 66" data-case-ids="1836989" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0066-01">6 Wharton 66</a>; Winrow <em>v. </em>Raymond, 4 Barr 501.
