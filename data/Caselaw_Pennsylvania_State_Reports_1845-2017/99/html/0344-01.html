The plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant as upon a failure of consideration and a rescission of the contract.

When we did rescind, the relations between Kurtz and Fry had not changed. We did not waive our right to rescind by suing the railroad company. Although the fact of over-issue of stock was then known, no one could tell whether the stock he held was genuine or fraudulent, and we, in common with others, joined in suits against the company to ascertain that fact, and to recover what could be saved out of the general wreck, for the benefit of whom it might concern.</p>

The fallacy of the argument of the plaintiff in error rests on the significance which he attributes to the word “ genuine,” as applied to certificates of stock. It really means that the instrument is genuine only in the sense that the corporation is bound by it. The plaintiff in error contends that the seller warrants that the <em>contract evidenced by it </em>is a genuine, <em>i. e., </em>a lawful and honest contract of the corporation, and that the corporation has dono no act to affect its value. The implied warranty of title and of genuineness, if traced to its origin, will be found to rest on the presumption of superior knowledge on the part of the seller, but where both parties have equal opportunities for knowledge, or where it is impassible for the seller to acquire knowledge, the warranty ceases to apply. Such is the case here. The sellers warranted the liability of the corporation upon the certificate, not that its real value, based upon the assets of the corporation, was and should remain equal to the market value, on the basis of which it was pledged. The plaintiff’s title, as against the corporation, was affirmed in their suit <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>against the corporation, wherein they recovered the actual value of the stock, which was the same as the actual value of the authorized stbck. The holders of the authorized and the unauthorized stock participated equally in the assets. To hold that the plaintiffs may also recover against their vendor, on the ground that the stock was unauthorized, would put them in a better position than if they had obtained authorized stock: Benjamin on Sales (2d ed.) 516, § 641; Iloe-u.

The certificate is the evidence of such ownership, and there can be no doubt that if the certificate is forged, or the holder is not such bona fide, so that ho lias no claim on the corporation, the vendor would be liable to his vendee on the implied warranty of title. His possession of the certificate would be as to his vendee possession of the stock, just as possession of a bond or note is possession of the debt which they represent. Where, however, there has been a fraudulent over-issue of stock, evidenced by certificate under the genuine seal of the corporation, the case presented is somewhat different. It has been settled, that a corporation is liable to bona fide holders of such fraudulent certificates, because, like individuals, they are responsible for the fraudulent exercise of the power intrusted by them to their officers or agents. It is unnecessary, in this case, to consider whether they are bound to permit a transfer on their books and to deliver a new certificate to the bona fide vendee. It may be that when the over-issue is in excess of the amount authorized by the charter, they would not be. But it seems to be established, upon principle as well as authority, that the bona fide holder of such a fraudulent- certificate would have a right of action against the corporation, and that his measure of damages would be the market value of his stock at the time the transfer was demanded: Willis <em>v. </em>Philadelphia &amp; Darby R. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.N.C.%20461" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 W.N.C. 461">6 W. N. C. 461</a>, and eases cited in the opinion of Judge Hare. The vendor of such a certificate has then a title which ho can transfer, and a remedy against the corporation. Suppose the shares in the case before us had been transferred by an original subscriber, his vendee would have been in the same position as the assignee of shares subsequently issued in excess of the charter. He would have had a clear right to demand a transfer and new certificate. Such certificate, however, would liave been worth to him only the value of the stock in the market at the time. If his transfer had been refused, he would be entitled to the same remedy and the same measure of damages. The vendor of shares of stock certainly does not warrant the solvency of the corporation. Corporations are especially liable to be made insolvent by the embezzlement and fraud of <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>tbeir agents or officers. It matters not whether the loss arises from robbery or embezzlement, or by the fraudulent issue of stock, the value of the stock is depreciated. It matters not whether such fraud or robbery was before or after the sale of the stock, the bona fide vendor cannot, under the rule in question, be held responsible for the depreciation in value. It is one of the risks yvhich are assumed by all dealers in such securities. It is agreed in the case stated, that “the certificates were in the usual form, and regular od their face, and were issued by the duly constituted officers of the company, and were sealed with the genuine seal of the corporation.” We are of opinion that the implied warranty of title extended no further, and that there was no breach.</p>
