The record of a suit wherein judgment had been obtained for want of a plea against the administrator of a married woman, disclosed the fact that the action W’as brought to recover the price of necessaries furnished to the defendant's intestate during her lifetime, at her instance and request, for the use of herself and family. The suit was originally against the administrator alone, but the husband of the intestate was, by order of court, made a party thereto before judgment was obtained. The copy of book entries filed showed that, with a few exceptions, the articles furnished liad all been such as might be fairly classed as necessaries. <em>Held, </em>that the record disclosed upon its face nothing sufficient, to impeach the regularity or validity of the judgment.</p>

In an action of ejectment against the heirs of said married woman for a tract; of laud whereof she had died seised, plaintiff put in evidence the above judgment. He then offered in evidence a record, whereby it appeared that a scire facias upon said judgment had been issued against ail the said married woman’s heirs but one, and that all of said heirs thus brought in luid defended and submitted the cause to arbitrators, who had found against said heirs. Said record further showed'that this judgment being unappealed from execution had issued thereon against the premises in question, and that the same had been sold to the plaintiff. Defendants objected to the admission of this testimony on the ground that the original judgment was invalid, the articles for which suit had been brought not being necessaries. The court admitted the evidence, but instructed the jury that plaintiff was not entitled to recover the undivided share of the heir who was not brought in by scire facias. <em>Held, </em>that the heirs, having had a full opportunity to set up any defence that could or ought to have been made by the administrator in the original action, and having either neglected or failed in their attempt to do so, it <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>was too late to question the validity of the judgment on the scire facias, and that therefore the evidence was rightly admitted.</p>

We also showed that it was procured by fraudulent collusion with Mrs. Johnston’s administrator, who was appointed at the instance of the plaintiff, Weavei*, and who, acting under the instructions of Weaver’s counsel, made no defence, and allowed' judgment to be taken by default. While a judgment, apparently regular, may not be attacked in a collateral proceeding, the rule does not apply where fraud is alleged, or the judgment is void on the record. And a judgment obtained on a scire facias, founded on a void judgment, is also void, having nothing to support it: Dorrance <em>v. </em>Scott, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%20313" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Whart. 313">3 Whart. 313</a> ; Caldwell <em>v. </em>Walters, 6 Har. 19, 83; Hoffer <em>v. </em>Wightman, <a href="/watts/5/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Watts 205" data-case-ids="1844007" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0205-01">5 Watts 205</a>. The evidence showing that Weaver was Mrs. Johnston’s agent, and as such rented the property and retained the rents, should have been admitted, to show bad faith on his part in bringing the action. The heirs can defend in ejectment on the ground of fraud : Shields <em>v. </em>Miltenberger, 2 liar. 18; St. Bartholomew’s Church <em>v. </em>Wood, 11 P. F. Smith 103 ; McOasky <em>v. </em>Groff, 11 Har. 326 ; Sharp <em>v. </em>Long, 4 Cas. 433 ; Brotherline <em>v. </em>Swires, 12 Wr. 68; Levick <em>v. </em>Brotherline, 24 P. I1. Smith, 149. Mrs. Morton was a competent witness to prove the offer <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>of agency. Mrs. Johnston was, in no sense, “the assignoi’ of the thing or contract in action.” Weaver’s claim arose solely out of his own act, not under a sale or legal devolution of title from her. Both parties here were living, and on an equality: Waltman <em>v. </em>Ilerdic, 9 Norris 459.</p>

The surviving husband was not a necessary party: Davidson <em>v. </em>McCandlish, 19 P. E. Smith 172. Because the claim showed that some articles were included that were not necessaries does not impair the validity of the judgment. If there was a single necessary it would justify the judgment, as a foundation for a scire facias against the heirs, which differs from a scire facias to revive.

In the latter proceeding judgment was entered November 8th 1865, on an award of arbitrators for $1,417.34, and by virtue of an execution based thereon the lots in controversy were sold by the sheriff and conveyed to Weaver, the plaintiff below.</p>

By order of court the surviving husband was added as a defendant, but the judgment, in default of a plea, was rendered against the administrator alone. There is nothing whatever upon the face of the record to impeach either the regularity or validity of the judgment, and there was, therefore, no error in admitting it in evidence as the foundation of the subsequent proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b65-6" data-blocks='[["BL_65.6",65,[228,749,1157,642]]]'>In the scire facias to bring in the heirs, we fail to discover any irregularity in the proceedings of which the plaintiffs in error have any reason to complain. One of the heirs, it is true, was omitted, hut that has inured to their benefit by limiting the recovery of the plaintiff below to the undivided three-fourths of the land in controversy. Those who were made parties to the scire facias appeared by counsel, and, in a full affidavit made by their agent, Mr. Fullerton, took defence; but, when the arbitrators awarded against them, they did not appeal, and the judgment became final and conclusive. They had a right to make any defence that could or ought to have been made by the administrator in the original action. Having either neglected to do so, or having failed in the attempt, it is now too late to question the validity of the judgment on the scire facias, and the record thereof was properly admitted.</p>

Aside from the question of Mrs. Morton’s competency as a witness to prove the several matters therein mentioned, we are of opinion that the testimony was irrelevant in this case. Doubtless it would have been otherwise in the original suit, or in the scire facias and, in the affidavit of defence filed in the latter case, we find it alleged, inter alia, that the “ heirs have a just and legal set-off against the said plaintiff’s claim of about seven hundred and twenty dollars, with interest thereon for eight years, for rents of the aforesaid lots commencing in September or October, a. n. 1855.” That was the proper time and place to prove the agency of Weaver, and the alleged receipt by him of “ a large amount of rents.”</p>

There was no evidence from which the jury would have been justified in finding collusion or fraud, either in the procurement of the judgments or in the sheriff’s sale, and it would have been error in the court to have submitted to them any such question. If the administrator failed to make such <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>defence, as he should have done, in the original suit, the heirs when brought in on the scire facias had their day in court. It cannot be .presumed that the attorney who appeared for them and entered on the record of the scire facias their defence thereto, conspired with the plaintiff for the purpose of procuring a fraudulent judgment. There is no evidence of such collusion. If we were to permit judgments and other judicial proceedings to be brushed aside on naked allegations of fraud and other flimsy pretexts, titles would indeed rest upon a very insecure foundation. It is not enough to charge fraud and prove in support thereof slight circumstances of suspicion only. To be of any avail it must be clearly proved.</p>
