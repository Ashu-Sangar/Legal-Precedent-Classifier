The defendant testified, under objection and exception, that on the entire series of loans, interest in excess of six per cent, per annum had been charged and included in said notes, and that the said prior satisfied judgment (August Term 1877, No. 800) included a large amount of interest in excess of six per cent, per annum.

The plaintiff entered judgment upon it for six hundred and thirty dollars and thirty-one cents, and the plaintiff claims that is a part of the consideration of the note now in suit, and that, being a judgment and being a part consideration of the note, you cannot go back of that note to inquire its consideration, whether usurious or not. We decline so to say. You have the right to take the series of loans from the beginning made by the plaintiff to the defendant, and if you find any usury connected with it you have a right to abate it from the plaintiff’s claim in this suit. The precise question we now decide has not been decided in this Commonwealth to my knowledge. Some decisions have been made by the Supreme Court which tend to show, in so far as the causes were then before the court that you could not inquire into the consideration of a judgment of a court of record collaterally. Ye have no intention of negativing that theory or that decision.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b281-6" data-blocks='[["BL_281.6",281,[158,1116,1159,982]]]'>“We say to you that when a creditor lends money from time to time to an individual, vaho of course thereby becomes his debtor, adds usury, takes usury, and takes notes for interest and enters them up and renews them from time to time, and then satisfies the judgments, it does not prevent the defendant from giving in evidence the transaction from its inception. Otherwise the judgment of a court of record would be prostituted to the very basest of purposes. A man might loan an individual one hundred dollars for a year or a shorter time and take his judgment note for two hundred dollars, which would be enormous usury and enter the judgment up, the next day satisfy the judgment, and take a new note. For a court to hold that you could not reach the note, because the bearer had entered it up, and satisfied it himself, would be a prostitution of the courts for the very basest of purposes — the purpose of protecting usury and assisting in the violation of law. When it is suggested that it is contrary to the policy of the law to attack judgments or to attack the consideration of judgments, when they are not paid, but simply when new notes are given and lesser security taken, it does not seem to us to be any more contrary to the policy of the law than it would be to connive at taking usury for the loan of money, whether it be one per cent., one hundred per cent., or one thousand per cent.</p>

It is settled that when an original judgment is revived after the payment of usurious interest tliereon, without allowing credit for such payment, the defendant cannot, upon an execution or in any other proceeding, avail himself of the defence of usury. The judgment of revival standing unopened is conclusive: Rutherford <em>v. </em>Boyer, 3 Norris 347; Federal Insurance Co. #. Robinson, 1 Norris 357; Hopkins <em>v. </em>West, 2 Norris 109. So where a bond was given for a debt and usurious interest thereon, it was held that a judgment obtained on amortgage given as security for the bond was conclusive, and that usurious interest paid by defendant in settlement could not be recovered back: Carlisle #. Bindley, 8 W. N. O. 69. The principle of those decisions rules this case.</p>

Sloan, 12 P. F. Smith 481; Miller <em>v. </em>Irwin, 4 Norris <em>376; </em>Macungie Savings Bank#. Hottenstein, 8 Norris 328; Heath #. Page, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20132" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Wright 132">12 Wright 132</a>. If the simple device of entering an office judgment by confession on any note in the series, and satisfying it on the giving of a new note, estops the defendant from setting up the usury in the satisfied judgment, it enables usurers to evade the above doctrine. We do not attack the conclusiveness of the 1877 judgment. We simply respond to the demand in the suit on the last note that it is made up of several usurious renewals.' The fact that on one of the former judgment notes the creditor had entered judgment and afterwards satisfied it, does not affect the case. That judgment was made up of the same loans that went into the making up of the last note, on which this judgment was entered and opened. When the former judgment was satisfied it was wiped out of existence. Its temporary existence does not change the continuing nature of the transaction.</p>

In no other respect is there any <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>difference, and a judgment confessed is conclusive, and cannot be attacked collaterally by the defendant: Braddee <em>v. </em>Brownfield, <a href="/watts/4/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Watts 474" data-case-ids="1842756" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0474-01">4 Watts 474</a>; Hageman <em>v. </em>Salisberry, 24 P.

In Hopkins <em>v. </em>West, 2 Norris 109, a judgment was confessed which included a greater rate of interest than six per cent., and on it the same rate continued to he paid. Afterwards the defendant paid the amount of the judgment and it was satisfied of record. He then brought an action to recover back the excess, and it was held by this court that while he could recover the money paid beyond six per cent, subsequent to the judgment, lie was precluded from going behind it and recovering that which was included in it.</p>

Here the judgment confessed November 2d 1877 was paid and satisfaction entered June 28th 1878. It was not indeed paid in money, but it was paid in law. The notes upon which it was entered wore surrendered, additional notes for new debts taken, and a new judgment — the one in question —was entered for the whole amount. Satisfaction was entered on the old judgment, which, no doubt, was part of the arrangement. It cannot be doubted that in law the old judgment was paid. If there had been any fraud or mistake in the transaction the defendant might have taken a rule to strike off the satisfaction, open the judgment and let him into a defence. The new excess of interest entering into the new judgment was no doubt a defence after it had been opened, but as to the old judgment the defendant was precluded. He had full opportunity from November 1st 1877 to June 28th 1878 to have applied and had the old judgment opened, lie did not avail himself of it. If the satisfying of the old and the giving of the new judgment had been simultaneous or nearly so, the court might have considered it a mere device fraudulently to conclude the debtor, and on that ground have struck off the satisfaction and opened both judgments; but as long as the old judgment stood unopened and unreversed it was conclusive upon the defendant that he owed the debt, and it would be a dangerous precedent which would shake this rule on account of the hardness of a particular case.</p>
