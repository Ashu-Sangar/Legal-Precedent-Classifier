The turnpike was laid out accordingly, and prior to 1854 the grade thereof was neither changed nor regulated by the authorities of the district of Penn. In 1871 city councils ordered a change of grade, which was physically effected in 1873. In 1878 certain property owners filed a petition for a jury of view, to assess the damages which, they had suffered by said change of grade. <em>Held, </em>that the petitioners, having failed to comply with the provisions of the general road law of June 13th 1836, section 7, Pamph.

The Act applied only to country roads, where there wras no special system of road laws; it expressly excepted incorporated boroughs, and roads laid out under local and special Acts. Ridge avenue was laid out by a special Act, and this part of it was in the incorporated towuship of Penn, which had its own system of road laws, viz.: the same as the district of Spring Garden had under its old charter of 1832, P.

By resolutions of councils approved October 1st 1870, and June 21th 1871, the Board of Surveyors were authorized to revise the lines and grades of the locality within which this portion of the Ridge Turnpike road (now Ridge avenue) was situated, and, pursuant to such authority, the lines and grade regulations for Ridge avenue were fixed and determined by the confirmation of Plan No. 163, on file in the Survey Department of the city of Philadelphia. Subsequently, in 1873, the city changed the roadway from an ordinary rural turnpike to a paved avenue or street, with cartway, gutters, curbing, and sidewalks, constructed in conformity to the grade regulations laid down upon plan No. 163. It appears from the record that the physical change of grade referred to, was actually made in the summer of 1873, and that the property owners, claiming damages for the injury resulting from said change, did not file their petition, or commence any proceeding, until the 21st of November 1878.</p>

      <em>4 </em>Barr 303, cited by petitioners, the proceeding was to view and ]ay out streets in an incorporated borough, which had already been laid out by competent authority or dedicated to public use by the original proprietor. In the opinion of the court it was said : “ The road before us, as it is called, consists of many parallel roads, and many more cross ones surrounding entire squares, and having many endings and beginnings. It is in fact, a dislocated fragment of the plan of an incorporated borough, whieh is the seat of justice of a county. And why should the road law be applied to streets and alleys which are already laid out by competent authority, and which, can gain no additional sanction from it ? The authority of the owner of a town plot, to dedicate his ground to public use, is as effective as that of the legislature.” The Act of 1836 not only applies to the laying out of roads, but it also expressly provides for assessing the damages to property owners for opening. Smedley <em>v. </em>Erwin, 1 P. F. S. <em>445, </em>is an authority directly in point, that the Act of 1836 applies to the city of Philadelphia so far as the assessment of damages is concerned. Nor is there any force in the suggestion that the Act applies only to roads of fifty feet in width. It is true, the fifth section of the Act declares that “ the breadth of a public road laid out as aforesaid, shall not exceed fifty feet,” but this has no relation to the question of damages, and does not affect the limitation as to time contained in the seventh section.</p>

It is not the provision relative to the assessment of damages, but the provisions respecting the appointment of viewers, that are declared not to extend to the city and county of Philadelphia. If the 7th, 8th and 9th sections are not in force in Philadelphia, so far as they relate to the lands taken for public use, then the Act makes no provision for any assessment at all in the city.” There is nothing in subsequent legislation which even by implication <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>takes away the limitation contained in the Act of 1836. While the Acts of 21st April 1855, P. L. 266; 13th of May 1856, P. L. 571; 21st April 1858, P. L. 386, and April 1st 1864, P. L. 206, have modified the road law of Philadelphia in many respects, especially in the manner of laying out and opening streets, they have not repealed the Act of 1836, in regard to the assessment of damages. Tims the Act of 1855 authorizes councils by ordinance to order any street that is upon the public plan of the city, to be opened upon giving three months notice to property owners ; whereupon any of the owners may forthwith petition the Court of Quarter Sessions for viewers to assess the damages. The Act further provides that security shall be given by the city before the ground shall be actually taken, and contains other matters not essential to the present discussion. The Act of 1856 contains an express recognition of the Act of 1836, as being in force in Philadelphia. It says : <em>“ </em>That whenever councils shall order- any street upon the plan of said city to be opened or widened, no damages, therefor, shall be paid, unless first assessed by a jury, and approved by the Court of Quarter Sessions, in accordance with the general road laws of the Commonwealth.” The Act of 1858 requires juries selected to assess damages for the opening, widening or vacating roads or streets in said city to ascertain, and report to the court first, what damages the parties claiming the same are entitled to, and second, to assess and apportion the same among and against such owners of land as shall be benefited by such opening, <em>&amp;o. </em>The Act of 1864 authorizes juries to inquire as to advantages accruing to property owners by opening of streets, and provides for the assessing of such benefits, and the collection of the same by the city solicitor.</p>

This statement is true as far as it goes, yet the legislation referred to is incomplete in itself. It is plainly supplemental to the general road law. That is the superstructure upon which it all rests. No one could ascertain from the Acts last cited how many jurors were required to assess damages for the opening of a street, when or by whom they are to be appointed, or when they shall file their report. We regal'd it as clear that the general road law of 1836 is in force, and applies to the city of Philadelphia excepting in so far as it has <em>been </em>supplied and modified by subsequent legislation. I have looked it through with some care, and I am unable to find any repeal of that portion of the 7th section of the Act of 1836 which requires the appointment of a jury to assess the damages, <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>to be made within one year from the opening of the street.</p>

    <p id="b492-5" data-blocks='[["BL_492.6",492,[310,652,1165,756]]]'>But if we are mistaken in all this, these proceedings cannot stand, for the reason that the case does not come within the 27th section of the consolidation Act, before referred to. I have already said the constitutional provision does not apply, and for this reason I have not referred to one or two recent, unreported cases which were decided under the constitution. It is at least probable the 27th section was introduced into the Consolidation Act in view of the decision of this Court in O’Connor <em>v. </em>The City of Pittsburg, where the city had changed its own grade, by means of which, a valuable property was seriously injured, without remedy to the owner. It was considered to be, and it undoubtedly was, a great hardship, when an owner had improved his property in accordance with a grade fixed by the city, to have it injured by a subsequent change of grade, and no remedy for such injury. The 27th section of the Act of 1854 was intended to give such remedy. But as none existed before the passage of the Act, we must limit it to such cases as come within its terms.</p>
    <p id="b492-6" data-blocks='[["BL_492.7",492,[303,1416,1168,980]],["BL_493.1",493,[189,399,1158,130]]]'>Prior to the Act of 1854, the present city of Philadelphia was composed of several distinct municipalities. Each had its special Acts, for the plotting, grading, regulation, and construction of streets, within its limits. There was no general plan, and no community of corporate interests. Each adopted such plans and regulations as specially suited its locality, and the special character of its municipal growth. The effect of the Act of consolidation, was to connect these outlying municipalities with the city of Philadelphia, and thus create one homogeneous corporate structure, co-extensive with the county limits. Each municipality had, prior, to the Act, its own street grades, and it was seen that to render these uniform, and to conform to any general plan for the enlarged city, would necessarily involve changes of grade in some localities. The 27th section, therefore, after providing for a Board of Surveyors, for the purpose, among other things, of making a general plan of the entire city, goes on to declare that nothing therein contained shall alter or interfere with any survey or regulation, made or directed by law to be made, of any portion of the county, but the same shall be completed, or if already confirmed, shall remain unalterable, unless such alteration shall be approved by councils. Then follows the provision, that if any alteration, shall be made, of any portion of the city, in conformity with the provisions of <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>said section, “ whereby damages may ensue to private property, compensation shall be made for such damages, to be ascertained and paid by law, as in case of damages for opening streets.”</p>
    <p id="b493-4" data-blocks='[["BL_493.5",493,[186,527,1162,802]]]'>It is too plain for argument that this section refers only to a change of a grade previously established,by the city of Philadelphia, or by one of the municipalities referred to, prior to consolidation. It speaks of nothing else, and gives a remedy for nothing else. However meritorious the claim of the petitioners may be, they must show an Act of Assembly to sustain it, and they have not done so. The grade of Ilidge avenue, prior to the adoption of city Plan No. 163, was not established by the city or any of the municipalities referred to. In the first report of the jury they find that “ there has been no evidence adduced before us of the establishment of a grade of the old Nidge avenue turnpike, within the limits of the said points last named, prior to the summer of 1873, when the improvements of Nidge avenue were made.” Notwithstanding this, the court below sent the report back to the jury, with instructions to assess the damages. This, we think, was error. The first report should have been confirmed, and the petition dismissed. It does not come within the Act of 1854, and, in any event, it was filed too late.</p>
