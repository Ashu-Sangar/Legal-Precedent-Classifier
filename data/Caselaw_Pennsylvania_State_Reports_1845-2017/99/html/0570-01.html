The allegations of this indictment undoubtedly develop a moral crime, but not one amenable to the criminal law. The false pretence, relied upon by the commonwealth, was merely a promise for future conduct, a. representation that the defendant could and would have the old note renewed by the new one. His representation as to what he could do was true — as to what he would do, it was false. All the authorities agree that the pretence must relate to a present state of things, and not to future acts. The pretence that the party would do an act that he did not mean to do, was holden by all the judges not to be a false pretence within the statute Geo. 2.

The rule as to when a case of this kind would be larceny, or only cheating by false pretences, is this : When the owner of the thing obtained is induced by trick, artifice or false pretence, to part with his property, intending to relinquish all further claim or dominion over it, the offence is the misdemeanor, of cheating by false pretences. When ljie is induced to simply part with his possession, but not with his dominion over his property, the offence is larceny.

It is very difficult to conceive how one can possibly steal the <em>indorsement </em>of a note. The <em>indorsement </em>was all that was obtained from Mr. Green. Besides, it would be unfair to the defendant to permit the commonwealth, after a defective indictment for a misdemeanor, to sustain a conviction because the offence might he a felony. That plea belonged to the defendant, not to the commonwealth, and <em>non </em>constat, if the charge of felony had been directly made, the jury might have acquitted him of so grave a crime. The offence was cheating by false pretences, or nothing but a private fraud; and, as we have shown that it does not amount to the statutory crime, the motion in arrest of judgment must be sustained, and the defendant discharged.”</p>

' It contains two counts, in each of which the ¡defendant below is charged with cheating by false pretences. The particular act alleged was the procuring of the prosecutor’s endorsement of the defendant’s promissory note, and the false pretence charged consisted in his representing to the prosecutor that he would use the note so endorsed to take up and cancel another note of the same amount then about maturing, and upon which the prosecutor was liable as endorser. In other words the note was given in renewal of another note of like amount, and the indictment charges that the defendant instead of using it for this purpose, as he promised to do, procured it to be discounted, and used a portion of the proceeds for other purposes.</p>

The man who assorts that he is the owner of a house, states a fact, and one that is calculated to give him a credit. But a mere failure to keep a promise, is another and very different affair. That occurs whenever a man fails to pay his note. It is true Chief Justice Gibson doubted in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Burdick, 2 Barr, at page 164, whether every naked lie by which a credit has been gained is, not a false pretence within the statute. This doubt has run i'ts course, and has long since ceased to disturb the criminal law of the state. There was nothing in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Burdick, to suggest such doubt, as the defendant had wilfully misrepresented that he had a capital of $S,000 in .right of his wife, while, in all the cases cited <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>therein, there was a misrepresentation as to existing facts, by means whereof a credit was obtained.

While the distinction is a nice one, it is, nevertheless, clearly defined. The difficulty upon this head is not in the law, but in the application of the law to the facts of a particular case. We are not called npon to pursue this inquiry in the present instance. It requires but a moment’s reflection to see that we could not reverse the court below upon this ground. How can we, as an appellate court, say whether it was proved upon the trial below that the defendant obtained the property in question in such manner as to amount in law to larceny, when not one word of the evidence is before us ? But it is said, the jury having convicted the defendants of the offence of cheating by false pretences, we must assume that the facts proved amounted to larceny. This does not follow. A general verdict of guilty <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>upon tbe indictment is a finding only of tbe facts sufficiently jfioaded, Neither of tbe counts would sustain a charge of larceny. Tbe first count contains no averment that Horace P. Green, the prosecutor, was, or ever bad been, the owner of tbe note in question and if never tbe owner, it could not have been stolen from him. The second count was evidently intended to cover both offences, but such criminal pleading is rarely a success, and certainly is not so in this case. It contains an averment at tbe close, that tbe said note was “ then and there tbe property of tbe said Horace P. Green.” Unfortunately for this averment, tbe prior portions of the same count show tbe fact distinctly that tbe note in question was tbe note of the defendant, drawn by him in favor of tbe prosecutor, and by tbe latter endorsed for tbe accommodation of tbe defendant and banded back to him. It was, therefore, tbe property of tbe defendant and not of the prosecutor. Tbe second count contradicts itself upon tbe facts, and the finding of the jury is wholly insufficient to enable us to say tbe facts proved upon tbe trial amounted to larceny.</p>
