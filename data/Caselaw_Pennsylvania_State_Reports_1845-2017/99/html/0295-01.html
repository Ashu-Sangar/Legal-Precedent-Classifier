It was first in order before any other proof could be considered, and, unless the jury affirmed it, the plaintiff had no right of áctiou. Until this was established, it would have been idle to inquire whether the plaintiff rescinded the. contract and gave the defendant notice of the rescission, promptly or otherwise. The right of Stuard to rescind rested upon the fraud of Davis in luring him into the purchase.</p>

Stuard testified that he paid the money in April 1865, and Davis promised to give him a certificate for the share of stock; that from time to time Davis sent him to divers places for the certificate, and on going to them he found no certificate or person to give it; that at last he was sent to the old Ledger building, where he found no secretary or certificate, and at once went to Davis and demanded his money, which Davis refused to give. This was within three months of the time of the purchase, and had it not been disputed, the court should have charged that Stuard had received nothing to return, and that the contract was rescinded in a reasonable time. At a later stage in the trial, Stuard said that he never heard of the alleged declaration of trust till in October or November 1875 ; and if this was true, a tender of the re-conveyance then was sufficient, although the suit was pending. What is a reasonable time or undue delay, when the facts are not disputed, is a question of law to be determined by the court: Morgan <em>v. </em>McKee, <a href="/pa/77/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="77 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="436279" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0228-01">77 Pa.

The defendant offered the summons for the purpose of showing when the action was commenced, and urn are of opinion that the offer was admissible. Upon the questions of fraud and prompt rescission the testimony was conflicting. Delay for six years to bring suit would bear against the plaintiff, unless he explained it; while, if the suit was promptly commenced upon discovery of the fraud, it would corroborate his allegation of immediate rescission. In such cases it has been the practice, if the date of bringing suit is not admitted, to show it by producing the writ. <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>It is an item of evidence which a party has the right to have considered.
