The fact that usurious interest has been paid upon a judgment note after the entry of judgment thereon does not necessitate the opening of the judgment in order to afford just relief to the defendant. The payment amounts to an equitable payment on the judgment to the amount of the excess of interest, and the court may stay execution, as in the case of any other alleged payment, until the facts can be ascertained and the just amount be applied to the judgment.</p>

O. died, whereupon A. and B. formed a new partnership with E. This last-named firm was wholly separate and distinct from the former. Its formation was duly advertised and well known. Its books were new and separate, and it assumed none of the obligations of the old firm. D. then borrowed money from the new ■firm of A., B. and E. wherewith to pay the notes held by the old firm, and actually applied the money borrowed for that purpose. In order to secure said new firm he gave them a judgment note for the amount borrowed. Judgment being entered upon this note, D. moved to open the same in order to compel the application of the usurious interest paid to the old firm on account of the judgment. <em>Reid </em>that the new note was a novation of the debt; that the defendant could not set ujo as against the new firm defences arising out of his transactions with the old one; and that, therefore, he was not entitled to the relief sought for.</p>

A rule to show cause was granted, testimony was taken, and after argument the court, Church, P.

Dick &amp; Co. consisted of James E. Dick, J. M. Dick and S. 33. Dick. On February 7th 1874, J. M. Dick died, and his death dissolved that partnership. A new copartnership was formed by the survivors J. E. and S. B. Dick which existed till July 1st 1874. On this last date a new copartnership was formed, under the firm name of J. E. Dick &amp; Co., by James E., Samuel B. and Sturgess T. Dick, and was the one in existence December 28th 1874.</p>

There is no evidence of any transfer of this indebtedness on this note of defendants by the firm of James E., S. B. and S. T.

    <p class="summary" id="b261-8" data-blocks='[["BL_261.8",261,[201,1376,1164,1027]]]'>“ If there was any indebtedness of the principal debtor here, Henry Shafer, to the firm of J. E. Dick &amp; Co. prior February 7th 1874, it was to a firm composed of J. E. Dick, J. M. Dick and S. B. Dick; and when, on the last named day, J. M. Dick died, that firm was dissolved; if any new note was given, it was given not to renew any old debt but to borrow the money from the new firm to pay the debt of the old firm. Tlie survivors of that old firm were, of course, the proper persons to settle up the old partnership business, and to settle with the personal representatives of tlie estate of J. M. Dick an account of the latter’s interest in the effects, rights and credits of the firm of which he was a member. The transaction operated as a discharge and extinguishment of all former contracts or debts by way of a substitution of one debt for another. In the civil law this is called a ‘ ‘ novation of tlie debt.” It arises when a now contract is entered into with intent to dissolve a former engagement, or when a new debt is substituted for an old one. This novation takes place by tlie intervention of a new creditor, where a debtor, for tlie purpose of being discharged from liability to his original creditor, by the order of that creditor contracts a new obligation in favor of a new creditor: Pothier Obi. No. 549. It had all the elements of a novation of the debt, and hence was equivalent to the payment of any original debt, if any there was. By the civil law it was known as delegation by payment.</p>

Dick, as survivors of the old firm; by j. R. Dick and S. B. Dick, as new creditors forming a new firm ; by Henry Shaffer and others as debtors of the old firm becoming debtors of the new firm, and receiving the old notes turned in as paid and canceled. In this case, under the evidence, each firm kept a separate and distinct set of books and the debt was actually transferred in these books from one debtor to another debtor, and with the knowledge and consent of all jjarties. The debtor was bound to know the members of the firm of which he was the debtor, and with whom he contracts.

There is no evidence that a new loan was made December 28th 1874, but, on the contrary, it was proved that the note then given was merely an extension of the old debt. No money was paid on the old note, and none was obtained on the renewal note. There is no evidence showing that either party intended to create a new debt, or that the makers intended to enter into a contract with new parties. A novation is never presumed, and there is nothing in the facts of this case to show that either of the parties thought of such a thing. The case is within the familiar principle of Campbell <em>v. </em>Sloan, 12 P. F. Smith 481; Miller <em>v. </em>Irwin, 4 Norris 376, and Stephens <em>v. </em>Monongahela Bank, 7 Norris 158.</p>

Dick <em>&amp; </em>Co. The appellants had been indebted to those persons and paid them usurious interest. The attempt was to compel the application of that interest on this note. It was to charge Sturges T. Dick with a liability he never incurred, and a responsibility he never assumed, lie was not a member of either firm, when such excess of interest was either charged or paid. The last firm was wholly separate and distinct from the <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>former. Its formation was duly advertised and well known. New and separate books were opened. It assumed none of the obligations of tbe preceding firms. The firm of which Sturges is a member, discounted the present note, and paid the money or its equivalent therefor. The learned judge' found as a fact, and on sufficient evidence, that this note was not given to renew any old debt; but to borrow money from the new firm to pay a debt due the old firm. This was the creation of a debt to. a new firm, to cancel a debt due to another firm. It was therefore a novation. It is unimportant that some of the persons in the earlier firm were also members of the last firm. This note was given with an intent, and for the purpose, of fully paying and discharging the debt due to the firm, of which Sturges was not a member, and to substitute an indebtedness to the firm of which he was a member. In furtherance thereof, all the other notes were given up and canceled, and a new note given to a new firm. The learned judge correctly held that this alleged equity of the appellants could not be invoked to the prejudice of Sturges. A contract, made under the facts shown,. cannot be successfully attacked in the manner proposed.</p>
