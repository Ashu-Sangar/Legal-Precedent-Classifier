    <p class="headnotes" id="b519-11" data-blocks='[["BL_519.10",519,[172,1647,1162,730]]]'>2. A. was walking upon the street of a city which was intersected at an angle by several parallel lines of railroad. On nearing the intersection, A. perceived a train approaching on one of the tracks, and stopped until it had passed. When the last car had gone by, she looked both ways and also listened, but neither saw nor heard anything to alarm her, and accordingly, when the rear of the train was about a car’s length off, attempted io cross. While doing so, she tripped and fell upon the track next beyond that upon which the train had just passed, and after lying there prostrate about fifteen seconds, was run over and injured by a train running upon that track in the opposite direction from the train which had just passed. A.’s view of the train by which she was injured was totally cutoff by the train which had just passed. The rear car of the last named train passed the engine of the first named train about three hundred feet from the place of the accident. In an action by A. against tire railroad company to recover damages for her injuries, the defendant requested the court to charge that the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence in attempting to cross while the train which had just passed prevented her seeing the train by which she was injured. The court declined to so charge, but left the question of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence to the jury. <em>Held, </em>under the circumstances, that this was not error.</p>

Meehan, was walking westwardly on Diamond street, in the outskirts of the city of Philadelphia, approaching the point where it is crossed by the tracks of the Germantown branch of the defendant’s railroad. Diamond street is crossed diagonally by four parallel sets of ¡tracks, the two centre ones being the main tracks and the outside ones being sidings. These tracks extend northwardly from Diamond street in a slight curve, but practically in a straight line for several squares or nearty two thousand feet. Beyond that is a considerable curve in the road.</p>

The evidence showed that had it not been for the up train, she would have seen the headlight of the engine of the train approaching in the opposite direction. This engine passed the rear end of the up train at a point about one hundred yards from the crossing.

If, therefore, the jury believe that Mrs. Can*, after stopping east of the railroad at Diamond street while the out train was passing, started across at a time when that train prevented her seeing the incoming train, she was guilty of negligence, and cannot recover. <em>Answer. </em>I have already told you that it was Mrs. Carr’s duty on approaching the track with a view of crossing it, to look and listen, to look in both directions, and listen for the approach of trains on either side, and I also said, or it was a necessary inference from it, that if she was delayed, as she was delayed in this case, by any cause — the approach of the up train in the case in hand — it would be her duty again to look in both directions and listen before setting out. I am asked to say to you, however, that if under those circumstances a train which passed up the road shut out any portion of the road from view, it would be her duty to wait until that obstacle to vision was removed, and that if she did not do so, it would necessarily be negligence, and preclude her recovery. What I say is, that it would have been a wise and proper precaution as the event shows. Whether the omission of that precaution be negligence would depend upon circumstances, and I am <em>not </em>willing to take upon myself the responsibility of saying that under the circumstances in this case she would necessarily be guilty of negligence in not waiting until the view of the other track was entirely clear.

The safety of passing trains and the lives of passenger’s traveling .therein, which are always endangered when obstructions of any kind are upon the track, <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>are of quite as mucli consequence,' as the safety and the lives of those who occupy the track even in the momentary act of crossing it. In the present case the charge of the learned judge of the court below is not printed, but so far as we can gather from the answers to the points submitted, he seems to have impressed upon the jury with emphasis, the full terms and import of the rule above stated. But a single error is assigned, and that is to the answer given by the court to one of the points of the defendant. The point was in the following words :</p>
    <blockquote id="b523-6" data-blocks='[["BL_523.6",523,[178,788,1170,471]]]'>“ The fact that a traveler stops and waits until a passing train gets by, does not absolve him or her from looking and listening for trains approaching upon the other track in an opposite direction, and a traveler waiting for a train passing in one direction, must wait sufficiently long so that that train shall not prevent him or her seeing a train approaching in an opposite direction. If, therefore the jury believe that Mrs. Carr, after stopping east of the railroad at Diamond street, while the out train was passing, started across at a time when that train prevented her seeing the incoming train, she was guilty of negligence, and cannot recover.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b523-7" data-blocks='[["BL_523.7",523,[179,1258,1169,1152]]]'>The point was thus answered: “I have already told you that it was Mrs. Carr’s duty, on approaching the track with a view of .crossing it, to look and listen, to look in both directions and listen for the approach of trains on either side, and I also said, or it was a necessary inference from it, that if she was delayed in this case, by any cause — the approach of the up train,,in the case in hand — it would be her duty again to look in both directions and listen before setting out. I am asked to say to you, however, that if under those circumstances a train which passed up the road shut out any portion of the road from view, it would be her duty to wait until that obstacle to vision was removed, and that, if she did not do so, it would necessarily be negligence and preclude her recovery.

That is for the jury to consider. If the jury find she was negligent, then the consequence would follow which has been already stated.” Was there error in this answer ? In a possible condition of the facts of the case, it might not have been erroneous to simply affirm the point. It probably would not have be.en, if the train going out had been at rest, at, or close to the point of crossing, for then it would have been a physical obstacle which manifestly obstructed vision on the other track.</p>
    <p id="b524-3" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[309,454,1174,887]]]'>
      <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>The conspicuous and palpable character of the obstacle would be direct notice to the plaintiff that she could not exercise her faculty of vision in that direction, and the effect would have been precisely the same as if the obstruction had been of a fixed and permanent character. The case would thus have been brought within the ruling in Railroad <em>v. </em>Feller, 3 Norris 226. There the obstruction was a watch-house, and wp held the party guilty of contributory negligence, because, although he stopped "and ioolced while in front of it, his looking in one direction was a vain act, and could yield him no information. The same doctrine was held in Railroad <em>v. </em>Beale, 23 P. F. S. 504. But here the train going out was not at rest, nor was it fit the point of crossing. It had gone beyond the crossing. All the witnesses to the accident agree in this. As to the precise distance it had gone before the locomotive of the down train passed the rear end of the up train, the testimony is not veiy distinct. The plaintiff, who had stopped on the east side of the road, to await the passage of the up train, says that after the train had passed, she stopped long enough to look, and did look, first up the* road and then down, and listened and heard nothing, and then started to cross.

Now it seems clear, the outgoing train was a hundred yards, or thereabouts, distant from the point of crossing, when the engine of the down train passed its rear. How would it be possible for a court to say, as matter of law, that the plaintiff would be guilty of negligence if she crossed the track, knowing that she could not see an incoming train at that distance ? The court did leave it to the jury to say whether it was negligence, in fact, for her to cross in such circumstances, and certainly nothing more than that could be asked on behalf of the defendant. As a matter of fact, it can scarcely be questioned that it is easily possible for one to step across a railroad track in safety, although a train is approaching at a distance of three hundred feet. In truth, it would seem from the testimony that the accident in this case was due to the fact, that the plaintiff stumbled, and fell upon the track, and remained prostrate from ten to fifteen seconds before the train reached her, rather than to a lack of time to get across the track. These considerations take the case entirely out of the <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>domain of legal control, by the application of a fixed rule which determines negligence, as the necessary consequence of definite action, or 11011-action, in precise circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b527-6" data-blocks='[["BL_527.6",527,[184,522,1165,374]]]'>The learned judge said all that could, be said when he charged, that the act of the plaintiff in crossing as she did, might be negligent according to the circumstances, and the force of these ho properly left to the determination of the jury. In this there was no error. We think the time has arrived when it would be well for all railroad companies, whoso tracks cross the streets of cities and towns at grade, to protect all the street crossings with gates. The growing practice in this direction deserves commendation.</p>
