The shares were not valid, having been issued by A. in collusion with the other officers of the company, in excess of the charter limit. The delivery was made in order to- secure the past and future indebtedness of C. &amp; Co. to B., and it was agreed that the shares should not be transferred into B.’s name without notice to A. Several years passed without any attempt on the part oí B. to effect said transfer, and in the meantime, A. became heavily indebted to the company. In certain equity proceedings after-wards instituted to determine the relative rights of B. and the railroad company as to the shares pledged by A. to the <em>former, </em>— Held,, that the provisions of section 7 of the General Railroad Law of February 19lh 1849, Pamph. L. 79, forbidding the transfer of shares so long as the holder is indebted to the company, were applicable, and that, therefore, B. was not entitled to demand from the company a transfer of the shares into his own name, or the payment of -the amount for which they had been pledged to him, without first discharging the indebtedness of A.</p>

Morton, president of the West Philadelphia Passenger Railway Company, at the request of Nagle <em>&amp; </em>Co., called upon the treasurer of the Mount Holly Paper Company, and made the following proposition, which was accepted, viz.: “ That if the Mount Holly Paper Company would advance the firm of J". R. Nagle &amp; Co. the additional sum of $5,000 in cash, and divide the whole amount of indebtedness into notes of a convenient size for said J. R.

Morton, a paper was given by Charles S. Mullen to John S. Morton, stating that the stock was to be held “upon the express understanding and agreement as collateral security for the payment of certain promissory notes then discounted, or thereafter to be, of John R. Nagle <em>&amp; </em>Co.” The notes were specified, amounting to $44,837.38. The agreement further provided, that if there should be default, “ before making any disposition of said stock, written notice should be served upon said Morton,” and that “upon payment of these notes, or those given in renewal, with the written consent of the said Morton,” the stock should be returned. By this paper it was further agreed that unless there was default, “ said stock shall not be transferred on the books of the company.” The sum of $5,000 was advanced as agreed, and the indebtedness divided <em>“ </em>into notes of a convenient size.” The notes now held in execution of this agreement amount to $22,000.

On this point, the Master reported as follows: — “ The Master is of opinion that the Act of 1849 in this particular has no application to the present corporation. All of the subject matters of the Act of 1849, relative to the organization, the subscription for stock, the election of directors, and the execution of the corporate franchise, are supplied in the text of the charter.

In the legislation of the State the franchises and charter of a horse railway company are not supposed to be included in the general railroad law. (City <em>v. </em>Passenger Railway, 8 Philada. 648.) The charter of the Philadelphia and Darby Railroad Company, upon which a similar question arose in Willis <em>v. </em>Darby Railway (6 Weekly Notes 461), contaihed an express provision that it should be ‘ subject to all the conditions and restrictions conferred and imposed by an Act to regulate railroad companies ’ (P.

This is a necessary conclusion from a comparison of the two Acts, which relate to essentially different classes of companies. The general Act relates to steam railways only running through the country, operated by locomotives, for the transportation of freight as well as passengers. All its provisions are based upon this assumption, and are inapplicable to a city passenger railway operated by horses. The latter is simply an omnibus company using tramways laid upon the public streets. That the legislature did not <em>intend </em>that the general railroad law of 1849 should apply to street passenger railways, is clear from the fact that such passenger railways were not known or in existence until long subsequently.</p>

The company admit a liability to the holders of over-issued stock, founded on the misconduct of their officers in issuing it. For them to contend at the same time that such misconduct gives rise to a right in them to withhold compensation to third persons who have suffered from the fraud, is self-contradictory.

Otherwise business could not be transacted as it now is. It often requires two or three days to complete a transfer, while the transactions are frequently for a single day or part of a day; moreover, the books of all corporations are closed annually against transfers for considerable periods óf time. It involves no hardship to corporations — they can protect themselves, oven against dishonest officers, by having a stock registry, which can be examined at any time, and which renders an over-issue impossible.</p>

Yet they now claim, they are in a better position, as holders of bogus stock, than if it had been good stock. It is argued that the bogus stock is in law nothing, and that a lien cannot exist on nothing. But if it is not stock, no claim can be founded on it, and if it is, the statutory restriction as to transfer, which is not a mere lien, applies.</p>

The Act of 1849 expressly provides that it shall be applicable to all railroad corporations, subsequently incorporated by special Act. The lack of specific provisions in the charter of this company as to the issue, and transfer of stock, throws the company back to the provisions of the general law, in this respect. No distinction can be drawn between the terms raÜROAD and railwAv; a general statute applicable to one is applicable to the other: Hestonville Railway Go. <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20Leg.%20Int.%20452" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="36 Leg.

There is no general representation for the benefit of purchasers of the certificate, with a blank power of attorney to transfer; the principle of estoppel does not exist as to strangers ; the certificate recites on its face, that it is not until after actual transfer, that assignees can claim: Central R. R. Go. <em>v. </em>Ward, 37 Georgia 531. The <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>case is an analogous to the liability of the recorder of deeds, for the issue of a false certificate of search — he is only liable to the party to whom it was issued : Peabody Building Association <em>v. </em>Houseman, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20W.N.C.%20193" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="11 W.N.C. 193">11 W.

The company made no untrue representation to these appellants; the latter agreed to take Morton’s indorsement of Nagle &amp; Co.’s notes, and his stock as collateral, expressly agreeing not to demand a transfer unless default was made in the notes. They prove no damage resulting therefrom ; on the contrary, Nagie’s indebtedness on the notes was at that time $44,000, while now it is only $22,000, and so long as a loss is not established, no estoppel can arise.</p>

It is not pretended that there is any such alteration or inconsistency so far as the provision as to the transfer of certificates is concerned. It is contended, however, that the Act of 1849 speaks of acts authorizing an incorporation, whereas, by the Act of 1857, the appellees were directly incorporated.

They had become holders by the delivery to them of a power of attorney from John-S.

They had not taken the necessary precaution to have them transferred on the books of the company. Had they done so without thei consent of the Board of Directors, a different question might have arisen. The company was liable, we may assume, for the fraudulent issue of the stock by their officers; but certainly, the holders can have no other or higher right than the bona fide holder by assignment and power of attorney of a real certificate issued to John S. Morton, as an original subscriber, and standing on the books of the corporation in his name. John S. Morton was heavily indebted to the company, on separate and independent transactions, altogether different,’ and superadded to i liis liability to the company for his fraud. The appellants, as to the stock standing in the name of John S. Morton, whether fraudulently issued in excess of the charter or not, stand in his shoes as against the company. It matters not when Morton’s debt to the company had been incurred. By the provision of the law he could not transfer such stock without the consent of the board of directors.

It is asked, triumphantly, How can there be a lien on that which had no existence? The argument is certainly ingenious, but it rests upon a misapprehension of the rights of the appellants. Their claim on the company was not, indeed, on the stock. It was a claim to be indemnified for the fraudulent acts of the officers of the company, from which they allege that they have suffered damage. They might have demanded a transfer, and upon refusal have brought an action for damages. The defence to such an action could have been Morton’s indebtedness. If, instead of taking that course, they had sued for damages for the fraudulent act, they could still have been met by the same plea. If you had been in possession of valid certificates, you could not have recovered for a refusal to allow you to transfer ; how, then, can you recover on these false and fraudulent certificates ? This would clearly be inequitable; and this proceeding is in a court of equity.</p>
