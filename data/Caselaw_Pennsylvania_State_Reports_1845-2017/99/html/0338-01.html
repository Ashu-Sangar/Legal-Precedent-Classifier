This suggestion met her approval, and, by her direction, McGrlade brought a magistrate, before whom Mrs. Daly executed, under seal, a power of attorney in blank, authorizing the sale and transfer of $2,400 of Philadelphia City Loan owned by her, and standing in her name. She then sent the eertifiates of said loan, with the power of attorney, to the Eev.

Mulholland, with instructions to sell the same, to the end that the proceeds should be, by him or Archbishop "Wood, distributed and paid to the religious and charitable purposes contemplated and mentioned in her will, intended, if possible, to prevent the loss to these charities and religious institutions, which she well knew would ensue in the event of her death within thirty days after the execution of her will. But, however laudable the motive, her benevolent wishes and intentions cannot be carried out, and express provisions of the law disobeyed. As was said by Lewis, C. J., in Erice <em>v. </em>Maxwell, 4 Casey 34, ‘ There may be some difference of opinion on the question of policy involved in its enactment, but there can be no doubt that it is our duty to carry out its provisions in good faith.’ Here there was not only a gift of personal property, but upon the express trust that it was to be sold and the moneys realized, paid and distributed as gifts or donations for ‘religious or charitable uses.’</p>

In this case, the Nev. Mr. Mulholland, himself a legatee, accepted the trust imposed by testatrix, and with full knowledge of the purpose of testatrix in delivering to him the certificate of city loan. The Act of 1855 is clear and explicit. It applies to real and personal estate, and prohibits a bequest, devise, or conveyance of either to a corporation or any person in trust for religious or charitable uses, except the same be done by deed or will, at least one month before the death of the testator or alienor. That in this manner only, can such a bequest or conveyance be made, is evidenced further by the fact that ‘ all disposition of property contrary hereto shall be void.’ This, of course, means any disposition other than by deed or will executed as the law prescribes.</p>

But to this inquiry the answer is straightforward and clear; about it there is neither obscurity nor ambiguity. She intended to make an immediate donation of a certain amount of money to the charities which she had already indicated. There was to be no intervening trust about it, excepting only so far as she must of necessity, in consequence of her sickness, have an intervening hand to pay it over. That she had to execute a power of attorney on her city bond, in order to raise the money, is of no kind of consequence. Had she, when in sound health, sold this bond, or for that matter, her real estate, if any she had, and of the money so raised made her intended donations, will any one pretend to say that, had she died within thirty days after the execution of such donations her beneficiaries would have bad to repay the moneys thus given to them ? Yet this is substantially what we have in the case as now presented to us. The testatrix, being unable to attend to her qwn business, ordered her city bond to be handed to the Rev. Mr. Mulholland, to he by him sold, at the same time directing the proceeds to he passed to Archbishop Wood for distribution, before her death, among the charities indicated. Accordingly, Mr. Mulholland did effect a sale of the bond, through Drexel &amp; Co., and passed the proceeds to the Archbishop in the shape of Drexel &amp; Co.’s check, to his, the Archbishop’s, order. All this was done under the direction of the donor and in her lifetime. The check was dated December 9th 1879, and she died on the 20th of the same month.</p>

To a doctrine such as this we cannot assent. Were we in doubt as to the intent of the statute we would, nevertheless, incline to that construction of it which would impinge the least on the right of persons so to dispose of their own property as to them may seem proper. We are not among those persons who regard this act as of doubtful utility; on the other hand we esteem it of great public value, and are, therefore, the less disposed so to construe it as to make it the object of public odium.</p>
