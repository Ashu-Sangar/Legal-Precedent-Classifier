As to them, specific salaries are fixed by said act for all county officers, including the treasurer. Then we have the act of June 12th 1878, P.

It was accordingly held, in Perot’s Appeal, 5 Norris 335, that section 18 of the above-recited act of March 31st 1876, relative to the salaries of county officers, which postpones the operation of the act until the expiration of the terms of the incumbents, was constitutional.</p>
    <p id="b274-5" data-blocks='[["BL_274.5",274,[294,839,1162,246]]]'>Under all the authorities the Act of 1834 must be regarded as still in force. If not preserved by section 2 of the schedule, it is apparent that since the adoption of the Constitution there has been no provision in counties containing less than 150,000 inhabitants for compensation of county treasurers, and all allowances to such officers have been without law.</p>

In Baldwin <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, decided at the last term at Pittsburgh <em>(ante, </em>p. 164), it was held, that the word <em>“ </em>law ” in this section of the constitution did not extend to the ordinances of a municipal corporation; that it included only such laws as emanated from the supreme power, which in this Commonwealth is lodged in the General Assembly. In Rucker <em>v. </em>Supervisors, <a href="/w-va/7/0661-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 W. Va. 661" data-case-ids="8641638" data-case-paths="/w-va/7/0661-01">7 W. Va. 661</a>, which arose under section 9 of article III. of ’ the Constitution of West Virginia, which provides, that the compensation of public officers shall not be increased or diminished during their term of office, it was held, that this language in the Constitution applies only to such salaries or compensation, of public officers as have been definitely fixed or prescribed by law; either by the Constitution of the state or by some statute made in pursuance thereof. If the ordinances of a city are not laws within the meaning of this clause in the Constitution, much less so are the orders or agreements of the couhty commissioners and county auditors in regard to the treasurer’s salary. The obvious meaning of the Constitution is, that the General Assembly should regulate — that is, ascertain and establish — the compensation which should be paid to the respective county treasurers, and that thereafter “ no law ” — that is, no Act of Assembly, should increase or diminish their respective salaries during the term for which they were elected. The whole difficulty in the case in hand grows out of the omission of the legislature to perform this duty. We have no doubt it will be promptly attended to, now that attention has been called to it. In the meantime the Act of 1834 remains in force, and the sal<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>aries of county treasurers not otherwise provided for by law, will have to be ascertained as heretofore.</p>
