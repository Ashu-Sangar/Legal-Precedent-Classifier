The proper construction of this Act is a question of law for the court. We instruct you, that according to the plain and unambiguous reading of this Act, a married woman is authorized to make a valid contract to purchase a sewing machine for her own use, without consulting her husband, or obtaining his consent to such purchase; and that such contract is binding on the husbarld, and can be enforced against him. She may not buy sewing machines to sell again, nor to rent or hire them out for profit; nor for any other purpose than her own use. But if purchased for her own use, she is made the only judge of the necessity or propriety of such purchase. This law says to all married women there is one article, to wit, a sewing machine for your own use, which you may buy, either for cash or on credit, without the permission of your husband.</p>

The construction contended for by plaintiffs in error requires the insertion after the word “ binding ” of the words “as to said married women and their separate estates.” The effect of the Act is to make a sewing machine purchased by a married woman for her own use a <em>“ </em>necessary,” without the necessity of submitting that question to a jury. The separate estate of the wife is only liable after the husband’s estate has been exhausted. The act of 1872 does not make the wife a feme sole as to the purchase of a sewing machine, and she cannot he sued separately therefor. The act must be construed in harmony with the spirit of the long series of Acts relating to married women, beginning with that of 1848 : Berger <em>v. </em>Clark, 29 P. F. S. 340.</p>
