J., the jury, under the instructions of the court, found a special verdict, setting forth the following facts: — On July 10th 1877, sheriff Walter received a writ of testatum fi. fa., directed to him, issued- out of the Court of Common Pleas of Yenango county, upon a judgment there obtained by Reynolds, Lamberton <em>&amp; </em>Co., against R. Chisholm. By virtue of said writ, Sheriff Walter levied on certain real estate belonging to Chisholm and subsequently sold the same for the sum of $500. He acknowledged the deed in the Court of Common Pleas of Butler county. On October 16th 1877 he returned the said writ into the Common Pleas of Yenango county, and on the same day he paid to the prothonotary of the said Court of Common Pleas of Yenango county the said sum of $500, less his costs. On the same day the said prothonotary paid over the said money to the attorney of the plaintiff in the writ of testatum fi. fa.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b196-6" data-blocks='[["BL_196.6",196,[269,1072,1160,246]]]'>Sheriff Walter had no actual notice of the existence of any other lien on said fund in Butler county. The records of Butler county showed, however, that the Oil City Savings Bank had obtained a judgment in said county June 1st 1874 against the said R. Chisholm, which judgment was a first lien on the real estate sold under the said testatum fi. fa.</p>

Where a sheriff makes a sale of real estate under a testatum writ of execution, he may elect to acknowledge his deed, and pay the fund for distribution, either in the court of the situs, or in the court whence the testatum writ issued: Borlin’s Appeal, 9 W. N. O. 545. Here the sheriff acknowledged the deed in the court of the situs, viz., Butler county, but he did not pay the fund either into that court or into the court of Yenango county. Payment to the prothonotary, without more, <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>is not payment into court. It was in effect a distribution by the sheriff to the plaintiffs in the testatum fi. fa., through the hands of the prothonotary of Venango county. In such case, as in all other cases of the distribution of the proceeds of a sheriff’s sale of real estate by the sheriff, it is on his own responsibility. lie may undertake to distribute the fund, but if he does, he is bound to apply it to existing liens of record in their order of priority : Mather <em>v. </em>McMicbael, 1 Harris 302 ; Luce <em>v. </em>Snively, 4 ‘Watts 399; In re Bastían, 9 Norris 476; Franklin Twp. <em>v. </em>Osier, 10 Norris 163.</p>

The sheriff thereby discharged himself of all liability; and the said prothonotary and the sureties on his bond thenceforth became responsible for its application: Deckert’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20344" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 344">5 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 344</a> ; McDonald <em>v. </em>Todd, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Grant%2018" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Grant 18">1 Grant 18</a>. The sheriff, in paying the money to the prothonotary, followed tbe universal practice in this state in writs of testatum execution, and it would be inequitable to hold him personally liabile to one who failed to notify him of his claim.</p>

L. J. 412. By so doing, he would have avoided all risk. It would then have been the duty of the court into which the money was paid, to distribute the same to the parties entitled thereto. In no other way could the sheriff relieve himself from responsibility. He had the right to distribute it himself; but, if he undertook to do so, he incurred the risk of misapplication and consequent liability on his official bond: Luce <em>v. </em>Snively, <a href="/watts/4/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts 396" data-case-ids="1842743" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0396-01">4 Watts 396</a>; In re Bastian, 9 Norris 472; Franklin Township <em>v. </em>Osler, 10 Norris 160. Instead of paying to the party entitled, or into either court, the sheriff returned the writ and paid the money to the prothonotary of Venango county, who in turn paid it to the plaintiff in the testatum, to the prejudice of the Oil City Savings Bank, which <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>had the first lien on the land out of which the fund was realized. This was all done without the intervention or even the knowledge of either the court of the situs, or the court whence the writ issued. In no proper sense of the term can this be considered a payment of the money into the Court of Common Pleas of Yenango county. To sanction such a practice would be productive of great mischief. If the sheriff has money,.which, in obedience to the command of his writ, he wishes to bring into court, it is his duty to have the matter brought to the attention of the court, so that it may be fully advised, and take such action as may be proper in regard to the distribution of the money and its safe keeping in the meantime. The recognized and proper practice in such cases is for the sheriff or his deputy to appear in person or by attorney, and, by leave of court first obtained, pay in the money. This being done, the prothonotary, as the officer and representative of the court, acting under its authority, takes charge of the fund subject to the special or standing orders of court in regard to its safe custody and ultimate disbursement. This is the only way in which money made on execution process can regularly go into the hands of the prothonotary. His authority to receive and receipt for money in any other way is quite restricted. In Watson <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 Casey 395, it was held that as a matter of public convenience, sanctioned by an almost universal practice, a suitor may lawfully pay, to the prothonotary, fees due to a former incumbent of the office; and as a necessary consequence his sureties are liable therefor. But, the prothonotary has no power to receive payment of a judgment, and he who makes such payment does so in his own wrong: Tompkins <em>v. </em>Woodford, 1 Barr 156. And, in Wells <em>v. </em>Baird, 3 Barr 351, it was held that money paid to the prothonotary and entered by him, on his docket, as paid into court, will not affect the right of the plaintiff to have the judgment revived.</p>

    <p id="b198-7" data-blocks='[["BL_198.7",198,[504,2047,946,214]]]'>Judgment reversed, and judgment is now entered on the verdict against the defendants, in favor of the Commonwealth for $8,000, penalty of the bond, and in favor of the Oil City Savings Bank, $128.35 damages.</p>
