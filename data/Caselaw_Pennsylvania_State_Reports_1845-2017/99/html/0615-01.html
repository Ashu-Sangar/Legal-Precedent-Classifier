Although prior to the adoption of the present constitution of this commonwealth corporations vested with the right of eminent domain were not usually liable for consequential damages, yet the legislature, in its grant of this right to a corporation, might so limit the exercise thereof, as to make it, subject to the payment of such damages.</p>

A water company was incorporated in 1805, with power to take the waters of any stream, “making compensation for the same.” Its charter further provided, that “if, in the location of ... . the works, an injury should be done to private property, and the parties could not agree upon the amount of compensation to be made to the owner,” either party might apply to the court to appoint viewers. The company in constructing its works used the waters of a certain stream, diminishing materially the flow of water therefrom, through a certain mili race, about a mile and a half further down. The owner of the null-race had purchased the right to use the water for his mill, from the owners of the land bordering on the stream at the point where the mill-race was built. <em>Held, </em>that the owner of said mill-race had a property, though of an incorporeal nature, in the waters of the stream, and that, unde^ the terms of the charter of the water company, he was entitled to recover compensation for tlie injury lie had sustained by the diminution in the flow of the water.</p>

On the trial of an issue framed in the said proceedings to determine the damages to which the owner of the mill-race was entitled, the water company proposed to prove that, after its taking of part of the waters of the stream as aforesaid, a railroad company had constructed its road by the side of the mill, and across the mill-race in question, destroying the same, and that a recovery liad been had for injuries sustained by the construction of the road as aforesaid, to the full value ol the mill and mill-race. Held, that the evidence was properly excluded, because (1) the railroad company must be held to have made compensation having reference to the deterioration in value already caused by the water company, and (2) the railroad company took no water, but only caused an obstruction, so that the claim against it for damages was wholly unlike that against the water company.</p>

We think this offer was properly rejected. The railroad company was liable for whatever damage it caused to the plaintiff’s property, and for that alone. The Lycoming Gas and Water Company had, before this, tapped Mosquito creek with its sixteen-inch pipe, and had to this extent, injured the power of the plaintiff’s mill, but for this the railroad company could not be held, and for this it certainly did not pay.

Again, as we understand the matter, the railroad company appropriated none of the water; it but daused an obstruction; hence, the claims for damages in the two cases are entirely dissimilar.
