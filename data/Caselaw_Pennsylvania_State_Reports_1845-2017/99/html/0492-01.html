The society made terms with the railroad company, and sold excursion tickets for its own benefit. The excursion train consisted of twenty cars, which afforded room, on the down trip, for all the passengers to be seated. On the return trip the train started from Atlantic City about six o’clock n. m. About ten minutes before it started the plaintiff got on the train on the next to the rear car; he looked in the rear car,'and seeing that it was over-crowded, and people were coming out from it, he walked through the train to the forward car, and found the entire train over-crowded and no seats vacant. After remaining standing in the front car for some time, he proceeded to walk back through the cars, the train being then in rapid motion. When he had passed through about two thirds of the cars, all over-crowded so that he was obliged to push through people standing in. the aisles and on the platforms, he stopped on the rear platform of a car, holding on to a railing under the window, the train being still in rapid motion. The plaintiff’s testimony at this point was as follows; “ I stopped to let people pass who were coming in the opposite direction to me; there were many people coming in the opposite direction; I stopped on the platform to let them get into the car; must have been there one or two minutes before I got a chance to go through; I stood one side outside on the platform to let them get into the car; I had been standing there one or two minutes; the train got a jerk of some kind and somebody struck mo on the shoulder and staggered me; then I made a grab with both bands and missed with my right and caught with my left; then ] fell down, and the train was going so fast that I fell between the platforms or dashers ; I called for help; stop the train, I hollered ; a young man caught hold of me; it was John Bannon; he tried to pull me on; I could not tell what he done, I was so excited; I must have held on for half a mile or more; may be a minute and a half or a little over ; Bannon was holding on all this time; I finally let go; could hold on no longer; I fell to the ground.”</p>

There appears to be nothing in the circumstances of this case to exempt the company from that general rule of duty; and if its negligence wras the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury, the liability of the company would necessarily follow, unless the plaintiff himself was guilty of negligence which contributed thereto. Iiis contention was that, in common with many other passengers, he was unable to procuro a seat, and while searching for one he was thrown from the platform of one of the cars, and thus sustained the serious injury which resulted in the loss of his arm. The over-crowded condition of all the cars composing the train, and the consequent inability of the plaintiff and others to procure seats, were facts clearly proven.</p>

This is precisely what the evidence as to the plaintiff’s position at the time of the accident clearly establishes. Apart from his own testimony, there is very little evidence tending to show precisely where he was at and shortly before that time ; and there is certainly nothing, that militates against his own version of what then and there occurred. He testified in substance that on entering the cars at Atlantic City and finding the rear one over-crowded he pushed his way forward, searching in vain for a seat, until he reached the front ear. After remaining there a short time, he stai’ted back: and quoting from his own testimony as found in the bill of exceptions, he says : <em>“ </em>1 left that car because I was tired standing there; had been there seven or eight minutes; started back through the cars; went through some ten or twelve cars ; stopped several times going through; can’t recollect time it took to go through back; could not get through for crowd ; it was pretty near the same going back as coming through;' I stopped outside on platform; rear platform of fourth or fifth car, right outside the door; stood on one side ; the right hand side coming up. When I got out first I had hold of a little rail or something across the window ; I held on to the little rail across the window to keep from falling off; let go to go through the ears ; I. was standing there a minute or two or so; it was two minutes to the best of my knowledge; can’t tell if it was longer; when I left I started to go through, when the’ car got a jolt, and somebody struck me; could not count how many passengers passed through while I was on the platform ; they were coming in the opposite direction, up towards the engine, and some were going through the same way, towards the rear of the train ; can’t say whether the car door of the car I passed out of was open; when I went out the door of the opposite car I am positive sure was open; saw parties coming from the opposite car; I did not stand aside inside of car because I could not see them well, and because I wanted to go through myself ’; I came out and stood with my back against the car, and hand on the rail, resting myself; I was leaning with my back against the car, and my hand, behind me ; people were passing through into the car I left; there was a crowd; I left that car to go into an adjoining car; while standing there the car got jolt, and somebody behind me struck me and staggered me ; the jolt and it had something to do with it, can’t tell whether the jolt, without the other, would have thrown me off; as soon as I got the jolt I made a grab with the right hand, and missed, and caught with the left the rail on the platform; there is a similar rail on the body of the <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>~car, to assist people in and off; I tried to get hold of the rail on the body; I was thrown partly round, and caught the dasher rail with iny left hand ; I was thrown with my chest towards the inside track; the train was traveling very rapidly; my arm was mangled.”</p>

He was not only in a position of known danger, but was there voluntarily and in disregard of the rules of the company. There is nothing in the testimony from which a jury would be justified in coming to any other conclusion. While he was thus standing on the platform, persons passed from one car to the other in both directions, and there is nothing whatever to show that he could not have gone into the next car if he had been so disposed. Neither he nor any other witness pretends to say it was necessary for him to stop and stand on the platform.</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.7",513,[151,1205,1172,1155]]]'>In the seventh point of the defendant below, the court was requested to charge “ That even if a search for a seat was the real purpose of the plaintiff in going out on the platform, and even if it were not negligence for him to have crossed from car to car for that purpose, yet, if the jury believe from the evidence that he lingered on the platform, instead of immediately crossing, the verdict should be for the deferidant.” The learned judge, in affirming this proposition, added the qualifying wmrds, “unless compelled thereto by circumstances.” The jury was thus authorized to inquire whether or not the plaintiff was compelled by circumstances- to linger on the platform. We see 'nothing in the testimony to warrant the submission of this inquiry to the jury. As already intimated, there was not a particle of testimony from which it could be reasonably inferred that plaintiff was compelled to take or retain the position he did on the platform. Having shown by his own testimony that at the critical juncture he was in a position where no one of ordinary prudence should have placed himself, it was incumbent on him to prove that he was there from necessity and not from choice. While the latter was clearly shown, there was no testimony tending to prove the former. The point should have been affirmed without the qualification complained of. But, for reasons already suggested, we think the court should have gone further, and instructed the jury as requested in defendant’s ninth point, which was : “ That the evidence shows negligence on the part of plaintiff which contributed to produce the injury complained of, and therefore he cannot recover.”</p>

If there had been any testimony from which it could have been reasonably inferred that he was there from necessity and not from choice, it would have been a question for the jury: but, in the absence of such evidence, it was error to refuse the point, and leave it to the jury to determine whether he was or was not guilty of contributory negligence.</p>
    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[317,743,1166,427]]]'>Of all the passengers on a long train of twenty over-crowded cars the plaintiff was the only one who appears to have been injured. If he had submitted, as many others did, to the inconvenience of standing inside the cars, or if he had been guilty of no greater imprudence than passing from car to car, while the train was in rapid motion, it is not at all probable he would have been injured. His inuch-to-be-regretted misfortune was the result of his own carelessness. This was clearly proved by uncontroverted testimony, from which no other conclusion could reasonably be drawn.</p>
