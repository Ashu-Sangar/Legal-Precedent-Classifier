    <p class="headnotes" id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.7",315,[151,977,1164,493]]]'>1. A boy of ten years old, bright, intelligent, strong, healthy and of rather exceptional capacity, was sent by Ms parents upon an errand along a street in a populous suburb of a city on which a railroad track was constructed. Ho was run over and killed by a passing train, moving at a very rapid rate of speed without whistle or other signal. The only witness of the accident declared that he saw the boy walking upon the outer ends of the sleepers a single instant before he was struck. The street was of ample breadth and had sufficient side-walks, and the errand upon which the boy was sent did not require him to cross the track at the point where he was killed. In an action by the boy’s parents against the railroad company to recover damages for his death, the plaintiffs adduced evidence which showed the facts to be as above. The court thereupon awarded a nonsuit on the ground of the boy’s contributory negligence. <em>Held, </em>that this was not error.</p>

J., the evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs was to the following effect: — The defendant’s railroad runs along Trenton avenue, in a populous part of the suburb of Frankford, in the 25th ward of the city of Philadelphia, uninclosed by a fence. The avenue at the point in question is not paved, but there is a sidewalk for pedestrians. The plaintiffs occupied a house on the west side of Trenton avenue, above Orthodox street. About half-past eight o’clock on the evening of April 30th 1879, Mrs. Moore sent her boy, Thomas, a bright lad of nine years of age, on an errand to a store on Orthodox street, east of Trenton avenue, which made it nec<a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>essary for him to cross the railroad. A few minutes later, his dead body was picked up on Orthodox street, on the west side of and near the track, where he had been dashed by the locomotive of the “ Cincinnati express,” bound south, wliich was running at a very rapid rate, being nine minutes late. At the moment he was struck a local train, coming in the opposite direction, was passing on the other track. A plan of the locality, put in evidence, showed that the boy at the time of the accident was upon the outer edge of the sleepers of the west line of tracks, at a point about twenty-five or thirty feet northward from Orthodox street, and about twenty to twenty-five feet from a telegraph pole against which he was thrown when struck by the engine. It thus appeared that he had not crossed the railroad at the time he was struck.</p>

He testified: “ The boy was on the outer side, on the end of the sleepers, walking at twenty to twenty-five feet north of telegraph pole; he was walking from sleeper to sleeper when I saw him; about a second of time from my sight of him, and when he was struck.” He also said, “ the lad was twenty or twenty-five feet north of telegraph pole when struck. . . . walking on outer edge of sleepers towards Orthodox street. Trees are planted in front of houses; there is a side-walk and trees outside; there is a three or three-and-a-lialf feet walk for passengers to Orthodox street.” At another place he testified: “I squatted down to look under train running up, and saw boy on outer end of sleepers, walking; the train then was right on him; train struck him.” The foregoing being the only testimony as to what the boy was doing at the moment he was struck, it was affirmatively established, and entirely undisputed, that the deceased was walking on and along the track at the time of the accident. He was not on the track at a public crossing, nor was he in the act of crossing. It is true that the railroad track at this place was laid upon the bed of a public street, and hence the right to cross it was not limited to the highway or street crossings. But the boy was walking <em>along </em>the track, and not across it, when he was struck. This he clearly had no right to do. There was an ample side-walk and roadway for all foot passengers and others desiring to proceed in the same direction with the railroad. The boy was sent on an errand to a store on Orthodox street. He had not yet reached that street, but was going toward it. Instead of walking on the foot-walk at the side of the street, or even in the roadway, until he reached Orthodox steet, and then crossing the railroad track, he appears to have diverged from both, if he was at any time upon either, and of that there is no evidence, and walked upon the cross-ties of the railway. This, at least, is all that appears in the testimony given by the plaintiffs, of which there is <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>no contradiction. Of course, in such circumstances, he was a trespasser, and not only put himself in peril by his rashness, but also endangered the safety of any passing trains, and the lives of passengers. We have so frequently held, that in such circumstances there can be no recovery, that it is unnecessary to quote the authorities. As the testimony was entirely undisputed, it was the duty of the court to pass upon it, which they did by directing a nonsuit. In this there was no error. The circumstance that the trespasser in this instance was a boy, ten years of age, cannot affect the application of the rule. The defendant owed him no greater duty than if he had been an adult. They are not subject to an obligation to take precautions against any class of persons who may walk on and along their tracks. In Railroad <em>v. </em>Hummell, 8 Wr. 375, the rule was applied to the case of a child seven years old. And so, also, in the latest case of the kind that has been before us, Cauley <em>v. </em>Railroad, 14 Norris 398, the rule was in no wise relaxed, although the person injured was a boy of tender years. In the first of these cases we used the following language, having reference to the facts in evidence:</p>
    <p id="b319-6" data-blocks='[["BL_319.6",319,[173,1263,1164,599]]]'>
      <em>“ </em>But if the use of a railroad is exclusively for its owners or those acting under them; if others have no right to be upon it; if they are wrong-doers whenever they intrude, the parties lawfully using it are under no obligations to take precautions against possible injuries to intruders upon it. Ordinary care they must be held to, but they have a right to presume and act on the presumption that those in the vicinity will not violate the laws; will not trespass upon the right of a clear track ; that even children of a tender age will not be there, for though they are personally irresponsible, they cannot be upon the railroad without a culpable violation of duty by their parents or guardians. Precaution is a duty only so far as there is reason for apprehension. No one can complain of want of care in another where care is only rendered necessary by his own wrongful act.”</p>
    <p id="b319-7" data-blocks='[["BL_319.7",319,[170,1859,1163,376]]]'>This language is entirely appropriate to the present case, with the added force derived from the testimony of one of the plaintiff's that the deceased, his son, was a bright, intelligent boy, strong and healthy, and of rather exceptional capacity, and nearly ten years of age. If the rule against trespassers on railroad tracks is made to depend upon the intelligence and age of the trespasser it is easy to see that the law upon that subject will very soon become involved in inextricable confusion. Seeing no error in this record—</p>
