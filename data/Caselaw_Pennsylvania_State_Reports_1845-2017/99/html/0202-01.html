      <em>“ </em>2.

We have not seen any evidence in the case that would go to show that these notes in suit were paid by the substitution of new notes or other collaterals. The evidence, as we understand it, is, that when these notes matured they were merged or included in other and larger notes, and additional collateral security taken; that when tiie additional collateral was taken the notes had grown larger, and then the collateral grew larger. Now, if at any time it was shown that these notes were reduced below the original amount of $2,000, it was a payment by collaterals, and the defendant would bo entitled to credit for whatever amount it is shown they were reduced below $2,000. But, if we understand the proof, the indebtedness never was reduced, but it kept increasing all the time, and new collaterals were taken when the notes were increased. The notes were given for $2,000 originally. As they were not paid, the debt due James E. Brown never was reduced below $2,000, and there is no foundation for saying that the proof shows that he should have given credit on these particular notes for the amount that he received on other collateral securities. We understand Mr. Pollock to say that neither of these notes of Frederic Miller, indorsed by Adam Miller, nor the notes of Samuel G-. W. Brown, have been paid by the'payment of this collateral or otherwise. That is what, we understand, he swore to on the witness stand; that the note of S. G-. W. Brown remains unpaid, and the collaterals taken, as appear by the list, remain unpaid. According to that, then, S. G-. W. Brown owed the estate of James E. Brown largely in excess of the $2,000 taken as collateral or part collateral. We believe that is all that is necessary to say to the jury. If the testimony of Mr. Pollock is relied on we do not see how there can be anything in this case but a verdict for the plaintiffs for the amount of the notes and interest.

This presented an obstacle that the defendant below could not overcome by the aid of any evidence in the cause, or any testimony, which lie proposed to introduce. The notes, made by Frederic Miller to the order of and indorsed by defendant below, were delivered to Samuel Gr. W. Brown in consideration of the sale and transfer of his interest in the firm of Brown <em>&amp; </em>Ivory, to Frederic Miller, the maker. Having thus originated in a regular business transaction, the notes were undoubtedly valid in the hands of the first indorsee, who before maturity and for a valuable consideration, passing to him at the <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>time, indorsed and delivered them to James E. Brown, whose personal representatives are the plaintiffs below. Each of the notes was separately taken by James E. Brown, as collateral to a larger note made by Samuel G-. W. Brown and simultaneously discounted for him on the faith of the collateral, and the .proceeds drawn by him. The larger notes were renewed, but neither of them was ever paid or reduced. It is, therefore, a mistake to suppose that J ames E. Brown did not thus become a bona fide holder of the notes in suit for value. It is true, they were indorsed and delivered to him as collateral security, but not as collateral for a pre-existing indebtedness. The discounting of the larger notes, on the faith and credit of the note that accompanied each respectively, was a new and valuable consideration passing between the parties at the time; and the principal notes not having been paid, either in whole or in part, the collaterals were outstanding and valid in the hands of James E. Brown for their full face, and according to well settled principles the plaintiffs were entitled to recover: Munn v. McDonald, <a href="/watts/10/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="10 Watts 270" data-case-ids="1850972" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0270-01">10 Watts 270</a>; Spering’s Appeal, 10 Barr 235; <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Am.%20Lead.%20Cas.%20231" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Am.

The cause of action was unchanged. In its inception the suit was against the payee and first indorser of the notes by a party supposed to be the legal holder thereof. But it'clearly appeared, during the progress of the trial, that this was a mistake; that, instead of the Kittanning Insurance Company being the legal, <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>and James E. Brown the equitable, owner, at tbo time suit was brought, the latter was both legal and beneficial owner of the notes; and hence the amendment was properly allowed, in order that the case might be tried on its merits. The act of May 4th 1852, expressly authorizes the court, at <em>“ </em>any stage of the proceedings, to permit amendments, by changing or adding the name or names of any party, plaintiff or defendant, whenever it shall appear that a mistake or omission has been made in the name or names of any such party.” Our statutes of amendments have been liberally construed, and it has been repeatedly held that parties might be stricken out or added whenever, by so doing, the canse can be tried on its merits ; and the right to so amend is not confined to a more mistake of fact in the name of the party. As is said in Commonwealth ex rel. <em>v. </em>Dillon, 32 P. F. Smith, 44: “ An action may be commenced in the name of a wrong party by mistake of law, and the legislature meant the power of amendment to extend to that case.” If the defendant below was surprised by the amendment he had a right to ask a continuance, but instead of doing so his counsel informed the court that he did not claim surprise nor ask a continuance.</p>
