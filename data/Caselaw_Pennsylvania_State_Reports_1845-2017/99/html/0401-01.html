Two testamentary papers were presented for probate, in one of which the appellees were appointed executors, and in the other, purporting to he of subsequent date, Messrs. Sheetx and Negns were named as executors. In the issue directed to tost the validity of the last mentioned paper, a verdict against it was taken by consent of the parties thereto, and the other paper was immediately admitted to probate as the last will of Mr. Whitaker. Nearly six months thereafter, the verdict was set aside and a new trial ordered. After a protracted contest, the paper was again pronounced invalid on the ground that it was a forgery, planned and executed by persons who were subsequently indicted, convicted and sentenced for the crime.</p>

Pursuant to the authority thus given, the agents above named filed a caveat against the probate of the forged will, and conducted the issue devisavit vel non to its termination in the compromise verdict of April 1st 1879, in favor of the genuine will.

Upon the death of Mrs. Whitaker, the paper referred to undoubtedly ceased to be operative as a power of attorney, so far as her estate was concerned, unless it was coupled with such an interest as rendered it irrevocable. It is well settled that the interest, necessary to render a power irrevocable, must be an interest in the subject upon which it is to operate, not an interest in that which is' produced by the exercise of the g&gt;wer: Hunt <em>v. </em>Rousmanier’s Administrators, <a href="/us/21/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="8 Wheat. 174" data-case-ids="6136577" data-case-paths="/us/21/0076-01">8 Wheat. 174</a>; Hartley’s Appeal, 3 P. F. Smith 212; Blackstone <em>v. </em>Buttermore, Ib. 266; Lightner’s Appeal, 1 Norris 301. The paper in question gave no interest in or right to anything, nor does it provide for compensation payable out of any particular fund, v iewing it as a power of attorney, it is lacking in every essential ingredient of irrevocability. But, it is claimed that it may be enforced as a contract between several parties, by which they are mutually bound to contribute to the common object, and that it became irrevocable as soon as expenses were incurred or legal obligations assumed in furtherance of that object. Conceding for the sake of argument that such would be its legitimate effect, it is a sufficient answer to say, that before the decease of Mrs. Whitaker, the agreement, according to the understanding of all parties thereto, was executed. The will had been established by a formal verdict, and letters testamentary issued to the executors named therein, and all expenses incident thereto were apportioned and paid. The liability of all parties to the contract was thus ended, and no legal reason existed to prevent Mrs. Whitaker from receiving one half of her husband’s estate. Before the litigation was resumed, and without assuming any new obligation in relation thereto, Mrs. Whitaker died, and that event was speedily followed by the notice above mentioned.</p>

    <p id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[171,570,1164,848]]]'>Nor do we think the claim in controversy can be sustained on the alleged ground that the expenditures of which it is composed, were made in the interest of Mrs. Whitaker, or for the benefit of her estate. She had elected to take under the intestate law, and «was therefore not interested in the result of the feigned issue. Moreover, timely notice was given by her executors that her estate was not interested in the controversy and would not be responsible for any expenses connected therewith. It is well settled that an executor or administrator who becomes a party to an issue devisavit vel non must look to those who authorized him to engage therein, and cannot charge his expenses to the estate he represents, unless the latter is benefited by the proceeding: Dietrich’s Appeal, <a href="/watts/2/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="2 Watts 332" data-case-ids="1840105" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0332-01">2 Watts 332</a>; Koppenhaffer <em>v. </em>Isaacs, 7 Ib. 170; Geddis’ Appeal, 9 Ib. 284; Mumper’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 441" data-case-ids="1854576" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0441-01">3 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 441</a>; Rankin’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.N.C.%20235" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="10 W.N.C. 235">10 W. N. C. 235</a>; Royer’s Appeal, 1 Harris 569. The general principle, underlying these cases, is that an executor is not bound to defend his testator’s will, but if he undertakes to do so, it must be as the agent and in the intosest of those benefited by his action.</p>
    <p id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.6",423,[171,1425,1162,387]]]'>But, it is' claimed that if the forged will had been established, the estate, or a considerable portion thereof, would probably have been squandered by those who, in that event, would have had the custody and management of it, and lienee Mrs. Whitaker’s estate was interested in maintaining the genuine will. This position is untenable. Apprehended danger of such disaster, even if well founded, cannot bo recognized as a just basis of liability, especially in the case of a party who expressly refuses to participate in the controversy.</p>
