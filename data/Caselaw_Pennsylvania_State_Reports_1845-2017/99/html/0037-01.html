Wilson took immediate possession, and for a number of years occupied the premises as a tannery.

In this he was mistaken in fact, they being only tenants under Wilson. When he discovered that Weaver had purchased Wilson’s title from his heirs he rightly moved to strike off the judgment against Donaldson et al., and the court rightly .granted the motion. Weaver, as terre-tenant, was entitled to have the judgment opened, and he suffered no injury by the plaintiff’s action. Where a plaintiff has been injured by the entry of a judgment in his favor by mistake, he may move to strike it off. Equity will relieve in such a case: Gross <em>v. </em>Leber, 11 Wr. 520; Reigel <em>v. </em>Wilson, 10 P. F. Smith 394. Even a third person, not a party to the suit, whose interests are affected by a judgment, may have it opened: Brown <em>v. </em>Simpson, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20239" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Watts 239">2 Watts 239</a>. The Supreme Court will, for cause shown, reverse a judgment in favor of plaintiff below on a writ of error taken by him : O’Donnell <em>v. </em>Allegheny Yalley R. R. Co., 14 Wr. 490. The judgment, when stricken off, ceased to have any existence. Tlie action of the court was res adjudicata, and the court could not reverse its former action in this collateral action. Weaver was properly made a defendant in the alias summons, and as he represented Wilson’s title, under his deed from Wilson’s heirs, he was bound to pay the residue of the purchase money under the articles of agreement with Wilson, or give up the land. He mild not escape from the position in which his deed placed him, and if he set up any equitable defence he must show affirmatively such a state of facts as would authorize a chancellor to interfere by injunction : Wain <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Phila.%20362" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Phila. 362">1 Phila. 362</a>.

In March 1861 judgment was taken against them for want of an appearance. In 1873 the plaintiff obtained a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be stricken off. In March 1876 this rule was made absolute. Soon thereafter the death of the plaintiff was suggested, and the names of his administrators substituted. An alias summons issued, and in June following was served on Weaver and his tenant, Mcltae. Weaver, under protest that he was not in possession of the premises, either by himself or tenant, at the time of the service of the writ, and that he should not be made a party to the suit, or bis rights affected thereby, pleaded not guilty, and MeBae did the same. Before the case came on for trial all the original defendants died, Weaver had been decreed a bankrupt, and Irwin appointed Ms assignee.

On the contrary Weaver recovered by ejectment against tbe tenants of Wilson six years after tliis suit was commenced, and as the evidence indicates on a title hostile to Wilson’s. It is true evidence was offered by tbe plaintiffs for the alleged purpose of showing that Weaver claimed under Wilson; hut it was rejected by the court, and there is no assignment of error to this rejection.

This they wholly failed to do. They gave in evidence a judgment against one Simon Snyder, an execution thereon, and a sale of the land and deed to Williams. They did not give evidence of any title in Snyder, nor did any witness testify that Snyder ever claimed to own the land. Snyder had moved away from the neighborhood, and was not called as a witness. It was not shown whether he was living or dead. It appeared that Snyder lived on the premises and operated the tannery thereon for several years, and built a house which he occupied. No evidence was given showing under what right or claim he entered or con<a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>tinued in possession, nor whether all the improvements he made were not more than compensated by his use of the premises. The purchase of Williams gave him a right to the possession of Snyder. Under that right he agreed to sell to Wilson who put his tenants in possession. Weaver, having recovered by legal proceedings adverse to that title, can retain possession against the plaintiffs until they show a superior title in themselves. This they wholly failed to establish, and the learned judge committed no error in taking the case from the jury.</p>
