A., being the owner of a farm in the oil regions, agreed, verbally, to lease ten acres thereof to B. for twenty years, in order that the latter, a practical driller, might test the same for oil. B. entered upon the land and began the drilling of an oil well. Subsequently, upon coming to execute the lease, B. discovered that it had been prepared by A.’s instructions for five acres instead of ten. He at first declined to accept it. A., however, stated that he preferred to sign a lease first for the five acres upon which the well had been begun, and that if that well paid he would execute a lease for the other five acres. B. consented to this arrangement, and executed and accepted the lease. He then proceeded with his well, expended about §10,000 thereon, and finally struck oil in paying quantities. He then demanded from A. a lease of the other five acres, which was refused. Subsequently B. sold his interest in the five-acre lot on which the well he had sunk was situate, for §18,000. In an action by B. against A. to recover damages for the breach of his parol contract to lease the other five acres, the court instructed tlje jury that plaintiff was entitled to recover as his damages one-half the expense of sinking the well on the tract actually leased to him with interest from the time of the breach. <em>Held, </em>that this was error. Plaintiff had incurred no expense on account of the land as to which the breach had taken place, other than that involved in sinking the well on the first tract, which sinking he had effected upon the faith that, on its successfnl completion, the defendant would lease to him the land in question. This expense, however, had been paid and overpaid by the profit which plaintiff realized from the sale of his interest in the tract whereon said well was sunk. He was, therefore, entitled to recover nominal damages only.</p>

He at first proposed to give them a lease of five acres on certain conditions. The plaintiffs declined to take a lease of less than ten acres. After some negotiation, the parties agreed verbally that the lease should be for a square ten acres of land out of the south-east corner of McCafferty’s farm, for the term of twenty years, the lessee to bore for oil, and prosecute the work to success or abandonment, and in case of success, the lessor to be entitled to a royalty of one-fourth (afterwards reduced to one-sixth) of the oil obtained; and in case any well should produce more than forty barrels per day, the lessees should pay, in addition, to the lessor the sum of $200 per acre. The plaintiffs immediately took possession, built a rig, etc., at a cost of about $600, and commenced drilling. On August Blst 1872, after the commencement of the work, the parties met at the office of M. S. Bay, a justice of the peace, to execute the lease. A lease was produced, which had been prepared by Justice Bay under the instructions of McOafferty, for five acres of land instead of ten. The plaintiffs at first refused to accept this lease. McOafferty stated that he would prefer to sign first a written lease for the five acres on which the well was begun, and if that well should prove to be a paying one, he would then give a written lease for the other five acres. Griswold objected at first, but afterwards consented to the proposed arrangement, and the lease for the five acres was duly executed.</p>

Within a few days after its completion, Griswold demanded from McOafferty a written lease for the other five acres, which he refused to give; and for the breach of this alleged verbal agreement, Griswold brought this suit. It appeared that the plantiffs had sold their interest in the well and five-acre lease for the sum of $18,000 ; also, that McOafferty, within a month after the completion of the well, had sold his farm for $90,000, and that two wells, producing each about 250 barrels a day, were afterwards sunk on the five acres which were the subject of the alleged parol agreement.</p>

This was shown by the facts that we refused McCafferty’s first offer of five acres, and upon his acceding to our proposition for a lease of ten acres, we began work and expended several hundred dollars on the faith of that parol contract for ten acres before the production by McCafferty of the written lease for five acres. This was a surprise to us, and we only accepted it, at his request, on the faith of his contemporaneous agreement that he would sign the lease for the other five acres upon a successful completion of the well. The written lease for a part, and the parol agreement that accompanied it and upon the faith of which it was accepted, effected no change in the original contract, except that the time for signing the lease of one-half the land was postponed until the completion of the well already begun on the other half. The consideration for the whole was the sinking of one test well. By accomplishing this, we have paid the consideration for the whole; but have received only one-half. Why then can we not recover back the consideration we paid in advance for the second half, viz., the amount we spent on the faith of McOafferty’s promise to give it ? The court below in their instruction to the jury equitably measured this amount as one-half of what we expended on the well, although the jury did not give us so much. If McCafferty had agreed, in consideration of our sinking the test well, to sell us ten acres, the deed for five acres to be made on commencement of the work afid the deed for the other five acres to be made on its completion, he could not, after its completion, have refused <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>with, impunity to execute the second deed. There is no difference, in principle, between a sale and a lease. The fact, that we sold our live-acre lease for more than we spent upon it, is immaterial. Our right to recover, in this action, is the same as if we had sold it for less or had retained it.</p>

Ón the 31st of August 1872 MeCafferty made a written lease to the plaintiffs for five acres of land for the term of twenty years, in consideration of which the plaintiffs agreed to enter upon the land immediately and bore for oil, and, if they were successful, render to MeCafferty one-sixlh of the oil which might be produced. They were also to pay him one hundred dollars an acre for the land, if for ten successive days the well yielded twenty-five barrels of oil a day, and two hundred dollars an acre if the yield was forty barrels or over.</p>

After-wards they sold this lease for the sum of eighteen thousand dollars. Now, according to the testimony of the plaintiffs, MeCafferty had, previously to the time of the execution of the lease above mentioned, promised orally that it should cover ten acres. It was further proved, that these plaintiffs refused to execute this paper or to proceed with the work except on the premise then made by MeCafferty that he would afterwards lease to them the additional five acres.</p>

Not the difference between the price to be paid and the actual value of the lease, in other words, the value of the bargain. For since the case of Hertzog <em>v. </em>Hertzog, 10 Casey 418, which overruled Jack <em>v. </em>McKee, 9 Barr 235, and the cases which followed it, no such rule can be applied. On the other hand, we have in Thompson <em>v. </em>Sheplar, 22 P. F.

But, it is urged that without this promise the plaintiffs would not have put down the well upon the five-acre lease. Let this be admitted; what then ? They would have lost, according to their own showing, a bargain of eight thousand dollars. What kind of damages are these: they put down a well at a cost of ten thousand dollars for which they got eighteen thousand ? What nonsense to talk about damages for the breach of an oral contract, which led to such a result as this! But let us suppose the well to have been put down on the faith of a parol lease, and the result had as above stated; on a breach of the contract by entry of the landlord and ouster of the tenants, what would be the damages recoverable by the lessees ? Nothing save the expenses they had incurred in the prosecution of the work; but, as these are paid and overpaid from the land itself, they can get nothing more, for they have suffered no loss. There seems, indeed, to be- a constant disposition on the part of courts to revert to the exploded doctrine of Jack <em>v. </em>McKee; to impinge upon the statute in giving to the plaintiff some compensation for the loss of a good bargain. But this must not be allowed. Injury enough has resulted from that doctrine to demonstrate the wisdom of a strict adherence to the statute, and, it is to be hoped, that the ruling of Jack <em>v. </em>McKee will never again find a place in the jurisprudence of Pennsylvania. Manifestly, here is an attempt to get back upon the forbidden ground; an attempt to compensate the plaintiffs, at least in part, for the loss of a good bargain; otherwise, how could the court have permitted the plaintiffs to recover when they had suffered no loss ?</p>
