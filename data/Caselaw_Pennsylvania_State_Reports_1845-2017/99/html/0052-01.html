    <p class="summary" id="b67-7" data-blocks='[["BL_67.7",67,[253,774,1162,473]]]'>The material facts of the case were as follows: By virtue of said writ of execution the sheriff levied upon certain personal property in the possession, of the defendant found upon separate premises used as a planing mill, a lumber yard and a dwelling-house. Thereupon one George Reineman served notice on the sheriff, claiming that he owned all the personal property thus levied upon. The sheriff thereupon demanded and received a bond of idemnity from the plaintiff for 05,000, with two sureties, upon which bond judgment was entered, and the sheriff then on February 27th 1880, sold the property, and, by leave of the court, paid into court the net-proceeds, $1,160.28.</p>

      <em>First. </em>— Because, having claimed the goods as his own, Reineman was estopped from claiming the proceeds of the goods for rent.</p>

      <em>Third. </em>— That if the relation of landlord and tenant did exist at the time of levy and sale, it existed, as claimed by Reineman, under the extension of the agreements which he put in evidence; and as these agreements include personal property, separate and apart from the realty, no warrant of distress could have issued, and, therefore, the landlord cannot claim the fund in a case like this, where he could not have distrained.</p>

Certainly, that was a matter for themselves to settle, and if they were satisfied with the arrangement, no third party can be heard to complain.</p>

By this claim he compelled Vetter, the use plaintiff, to protect the sheriff by a bond of indemnity: by it be then held, and still does hold, both Vetter and the officer as trespassers, and by it he sets up a title adverse to the proceedings which has brought the money into court, hence, on the authority of Bush, Bunn <em>&amp; </em>Co.’s Ap., 15 P. F. S. 363, ho cannot be permitted to take any of that money. But it is alleged that lie is entitled to take as landlord : we answer, yes, so far as the money was made from the tenant’s goods, for they were distrainablo for the rent due, and that fact, under the Act of Assembly, gives tlic landlord the right to claim, from the sheriff, the money made from them. But not so as to the landlord’s own goods, for they are not subject to distress, therefore, unless he can claim the money as made from his own property, he cannot claim it at all, for, se judice, it was not the property of the tenant.</p>
