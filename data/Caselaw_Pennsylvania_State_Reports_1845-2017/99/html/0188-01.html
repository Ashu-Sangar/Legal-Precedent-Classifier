Letters of administration were granted upon his estate ; the mules were included in the inventory and appraisement, and were afterwards sold at public sale by the administrators. In an action by said administrators against B., the purchaser of the mules at said sale, for the price bid by him, B. defended on the ground that he held a note of A. exceeding in amount the price so bid by him, that he had agreed with A. in his lifetime that the mules in question should be put into the possession of the persons who were after-wards A.’s administrators with instructions to sell them and apply the price on account of said note; that in pursuance of said agreement the mules were put into the possession of those persons prior to A’s death and so continued; that they remained unsold until after letters of administration were granted on A.’s estate; that when B. purchased them at the sale he did so under the belief that he was buying under the agreement made with A.; and finally that after the sale the administrators agreed that the sum bid by B. should be credited and indorsed on the note. Plaintiffs, in order to contradict this evidence, offered to show that they did not take possession of the mules until about the time of the appraisement. <em>Held, </em>that this evidence was competent and relevant, and should have been admitted.</p>

The defendant objected thereto, first, as it tended to prove a fact prior to the death of Israel, and second, that where they found it, when they took possession after his death "was irrelevant. The objections were sustained. In this we think there was error. It is not concealed that one purpose of this evidence was to create a presumption that the <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>present plaintiffs had not taken possession of the property before the death of Israel.

Although the evidence may, in its effect, tend to prove the same fact existed prior to his death that is no cause for its exclusion : Rothrock <em>v. </em>Gallaher, 10 Norris 108. It was entirely competent to prove, as bearing on both positions contended for by the defendant, where the property was found, and in whose possession, at the time the administrators, as such, took possession thereof.</p>
    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[318,787,1166,1022]]]'>As no sale of the property was made during the life of Israel, and it was inventoried, appraised, and sold, after his death, as the property of his estate, nothing less than clear and. specific evidence should be permitted to divert the money for which it sold, from a distribution among all the creditors. Having been sold as the property of the estate, it is the interest or property of the estate only, which is presumed to have passed by the sale, and for this alone, the defendant bid. There is no evidence of any notice given at the sale, that the exclusive and unquestioned right of property was not in Israel at the time of his death. The plaintiffs, as administrators, held all the personal estate of the decedent, in trust for his creditors. Acting as such they sold the property. They had no power to prefer a creditor whom the law did not prefer. They could not by agreement change the due course of distribution to the prejudice of any of the creditors. It was held in Fritz <em>v. </em>Thomas, <a href="/whart/1/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Whart. 66" data-case-ids="1829021" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0066-01">1 Wh. 66</a>, that an administrator sued in his representative character for a debt due by the decedent, may plead the statute of limitations as a. bar to the action, although such administrator may have made such an acknowledgment of the debt as in the case of a person sued for his own debt, would be sufficient to take the case out of the statute. The administrator cannot be compelled to adhere to an agreement made by him with one creditor in fraud of other creditors : Steel <em>v. </em>Steel, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Jones%2064" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Jones 64">supra.</a></p>
