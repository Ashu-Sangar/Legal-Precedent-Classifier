A. died bequeathing a legacy to B., and appointing C. his executor, to whom letters testamentary were granted. About twenty-one years afterwards, O. died, having never filed his account as executor of A. Subsequently, B. filed a petition, alleging that her legacy had never been paid, and praying that O.’s executors be decreed to file C.’s account as A. ’s executor. The decree prayed for was entered, and the account filed, the executors claiming credit therein for the amount of B.’s legacy. B. testified that she had never received the legacy, and gave evidence showing that C. had in his lifetime told a third party that he would not pay B. her legacy, as she was rich enough without it. The Orphans’ Court thereupon surcharged the accountants with the amount of said legacy. <em>Held, </em>that this was error; that from the lapse of time a presumption of payment had arisen, that this presumption was not overcome by the evidence and the particular circumstances of the case, and that, therefore, B.’s claim should be disallowed.</p>

The answer of said executors to this citation set forth that they had no personal knowledge of the matter, but that, so far as they had information and belief, they believed that the said legacy had been paid on May 20th 1857, and they set up lapse of time, viz.: more than twmnty-one years from testator’s death, and presumption of payment, as a bar to the granting of the petition. A replication having been filed, the matter was referred to an Examiner, before whom the petitioner testified that the legacy had not been paid to her. The only other material testimony taken before the Examiner, was that of J ulia Ann N orth, an aunt of the petitioner, who testified that she had hoard David B.

The court below decided that inasmuch as only 19 years and 11 months had elapsed prior to the death of David 11. Bentley, no presumption of payment arose, although upwards of 21 years had elapsed before demand was made. We submit that this decision confounds the distinction between the bar of the Statute of Limitations and the presumption of payment. By the Statute of Limitations no action shall be brought after the lapse of six years. The statute denies the remedy, irrespective of any question of actual right. The executors did not set up the bar of the statute but the common law presumption of payment after twenty years. This presumption is not weakened because the testator’s executor happened to die before the whole period had expired, inasmuch as the presumption is, not that the debt was paid in the last, but in the first, part thereof. Why does the death of the trustee make any difference <em>% </em>The presumption runs from the time there was a liability to pay, viz., one year after the testator’s death, and becomes conclusive twenty years from that time. The death of an executor or a change of trustees has nothing to do with the question. The failure to make any demand, out of which the presumption a,rises, continues as much after, as before, death, and with like significance as to the reason therefor, viz., a prior liquidation. The mere fact that a trust was created does not prevent the ripening of delay into proof; it is settled that after the expiration of the twenty years, the assignor of a fund in trust for creditors is entitled to demand a reconveyance, because of the presumption of payment that then arises: Power <em>v. </em>Hollinan, <a href="/watts/2/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Watts 218" data-case-ids="1840163" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0218-01">2 Watts 218</a>; Drysdale’s Appeal, 14 Penna. 531; Potter’s Estate, 54 Penna. 465 ; Ingraham <em>v. </em>Cox, 1 Pars. 10.</p>

The executors of David B. Bentley, in the account filed by them of his executorship of the estate of John B. Bentley, showed that there is nothing left of John B. <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>Bentley’s estate to be administered. It would thus appear that-David B. Bentley, who neglected to file an account in his lifetime, disposed of, spent or made away with, the whole of the testator’s estate; the liability to pay this legacy thereupon became a personal liability on his part; he then died in 1877, and the presumption of payment as against him ran from his death. But if we are wrong in this, the evidence of Mrs North that she had frequently demanded payment of David B. Bentley in his life-time, on behalf of the legatee, in addition to the negative testimony of the legatee herself that the legacy was never paid to her, was ample evidence to rebut the presumption : Reed <em>v. </em>Reed, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20239" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Wright 239">10 Wright 239</a>.</p>

    <p id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.8",518,[301,1035,1175,980]]]'>A debt which has been due and unclaimed, and without recognition, for twenty years, in the absence ¡ of explanatory evidence, is presumed to have been paid. This presumption, prima facie, obliterates the debt, and the onus of proof is upon the creditor, not to establish a new contract as is the case when a debt is barred by the statute of limitations, but to show that payment of the debt has not been made: Reed <em>v. </em>Reed, <a href="/pa/46/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="46 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="420615" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0239-01">46 Pa. St. 239</a>. In that case, within twenty years, the debtor admitted to the creditor and to strangers that he had not paid the debt, and said he would not, and it was held that the presumption of payment was rebutted. .Here the sum of the testimony is that the executor said to a third person that he would not pay' the legacy, because the legatee was rich enough without it. This is far short of the direct admission in Reed <em>v. </em>Reed, and the court below rightly held that it was insufficient to overeóme a presumption of payment ai'ising from lapse of time. When a person in conversation with a stranger respecting the claim of another, says he will not pay it, there is not the same reason for inferring recognition that exists when the creditor requests and the debtor refuses payment. In the latter case, not to deny is to admit. Besides, the debt is claimed. But it does not concern the stranger whether the claim is existing or has been paid ; he has no right to ask payment.</p>
    <p id="b518-7" data-blocks='[["BL_518.9",518,[304,2014,1170,384]],["BL_519.1",519,[175,393,1165,588]]]'>The executor lived almost twenty years after the legacy became due and payable. It was not claimed by the legatee, for more than twenty one years after it was due. The debt was unrecognized and unclaimed, for over twenty years, and the time of payment is deemed to have been before the beginning of the period, else payment would not be presumed. Were the debtor living, the reason for invoking the presumption would not be so strong as now, for his representatives are not so likely to know of the actual evidence of payment as he <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>would be. The difficulty in proving a fact, which occurred many years before its existence is questioned, lies at the foundation for its presumption from lapse of time. Then, the mere fact of the debtor’s death ought not to be a sufficient explanation of the creditor’s delay. Immediately, he may make claim against his debtor’s estate. The case differs from one where the debtor was in extreme poverty, or beyond sea. And if the debtor be a trustee ho may avail the rule respecting stale demands, though he could not the statute of limitations: Power <em>v. </em>Hollman, <a href="/watts/2/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Watts 218" data-case-ids="1840163" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0218-01">2 Watts 218</a>. In that case the court, conceding that claims against an insolvent who had assigned his property, in trust for creditors, would not be barred by the statute, ruled that lapse of time would raise a presumption of their payment.</p>
