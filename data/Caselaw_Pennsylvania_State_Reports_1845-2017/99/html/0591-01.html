Its title reads thus: “ An Act to provide for appointing viewers to assess damages where streets and alleys are changed in grade or location in the several boroughs of this Commonwealth.” The use of the word “location” shows that the legislative intent was to supplant the former Act. You can change the location of a street without changing the grade, and you can change the grade without changing location. When you widen a street, you change its location ; not so when you fill it up or cut it down — then you change the grade. Further, if we take the Act in that part where it prescribes the duties of the viewers, it is provided, that they “ shall view the said street or alley and premises affected by the change or enlargement thereof.” Does not this mean a widening or spreading out, not a change of grade ? The title to an Act need not be a complete index of its contents: Commonwealth®. Green, 8 P. F. S. 226; Yeager ®. Weaver, 14 P. F. S. 425. All that is required is that the title fairly give notice of the subject of the Act, so as reasonably to lead to an inquiry into its body: Allegheny Home’s case, 27 P. F. Smith 77; Mauch Chunk ®. McGee, 31 P. F. Smith 433. Then if this Act means what we contend it does, it is plain that it repeals so much of the Act of 1856 as relates to the widening of streets or alleys and assessing the damages caused thereby. A subsequent affirmative statute is a repeal, by implication, of a former one made concerning the same matter, if it introduce a new rule upon the subject, although it contains no express words repeal<a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>ing it: Ledlie <em>V. </em>Mon.

Acts which, although in pari materia, grant a right conditioned on different things, are inconsistent; and the inconsistency operates as a repeal: Gwinner <em>v. </em>The Lehigh and Delaware Gap R. R. Co., 5 P. F. Smith 126.

On the contrary, we think it clear no such repeal was intended. The provision for the assessment of benefits is omitted in the Act of 1878, which would not probably have been the case if it was intended to supply the Act of 1856. The Acts of 1878 and 1856 must be construed in pari materia. They are part of a system. As before observed, the Act of 1856 expressly provides for assessment of the damages where a street is opened or widened by the authorities of a borough. What then was the object of the Act of 1878 ? If we apply the familiar rule of interpretation, the old law, the mischief, and the remedy, the solution of this problem is not difficult. The mischief was that while the old law provided a remedy for assessing the damages to the property owner for taking his land in the opening or widening of a street, it afforded him no remedy where his property was injured by a change of grade. This principle was settled by the decision in O’Connor <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh, 6 Harris, 187; In re Ridge street, 5 Casey, 391. The Act of 1856 furnishes a remedy for this hardship, and was undoubtedly passed for that purpose and no other. It speaks of a change of the “ grade or lines” of any street or alley, and while the succeeding words, <em>“ or </em>in any way alter or enlarge the same,” might seem to apply to widening a street, yet, looking at the manifest object of the Act, <em>we </em>must read these general words in connection with such object. Tested by this familiar rule, it is manifest the general words referred to are qualified by the preceding special words, and that the Act has no application where there is no change of grade. It may be, although we do not decide the point, that where the town council of a borough direct the change of the grade of a street, and at the same time alter the lines thereof so as to widen it in whole or in part, whereby the land of a property owner may be taken, his damages, both for the taking of his land and the <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>change of grade, could be assessed under the Act of 1878. Otherwise two juries might be required to assess the damages sustained by the same owner, one for the change of grade and the other for the land taken. 'This proceeding was for the opening and widening of a street, without any reference to its grade, and is directly within the Act of 1856. The petition should have been filed in the Quarter Sessions. The Common Pleas had no jurisdiction.</p>
