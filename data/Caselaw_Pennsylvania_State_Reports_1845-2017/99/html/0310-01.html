A. took an assignment from B. of a bond and mortgage, B. agreeing that if A., on foreclosing the mortgage, should be obliged to buy in the mortgaged premises, he would repurchase the same at a price sufficient to save A. harmless. A. did foreclose the mortgage, and was obliged to buy in the premises, but B. refused to repurchase the same. A. thereupon filed a bill for specific performance. Held, that after tendering a deed, an action at law would give the complainant a full and adequate remedy, and that therefore he was not entitled in equity to the relief sought.</p>

The complainants, who have performed their part of the agreement, cannot be put in statu quo by an action at law, and are therefore entitled to relief in equity to compel the appellant to perform his agreement. Equity considers as done what is agreed to be done, and upon an agreement for the sale of real estate the vendor is regarded as á trustee for the purchaser, and the purchaser as a trustee of the purchase money for the vendor, and a court of equity will enforce the trust: Larison <em>v. </em>Burt, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 27" data-case-ids="1856293" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0027-01">4 W. &amp; S. 27</a>; Bispham’s Eq. 420-429; Kerr <em>v. </em>Day, 2 Harris 114.

That our courts will not entertain equity jurisdiction to give such relief where there is an adequate remedy at law, is well settled. Care should be taken that there be no unnecessary encroachment on the province of the courts of common law: McGowin <em>v. </em>Remington, <a href="/nc/47/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Jones 63" data-case-ids="8681243" data-case-paths="/nc/47/0063-01">2 Jones 63</a>; Strasburg Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Echternacht, 9 Harris 21; Gallagher <em>v. </em>Fayette County R.
