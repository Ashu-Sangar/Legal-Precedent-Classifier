    <p class="headnotes" id="b535-6" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[179,529,1168,672]]]'>A paper box manufacturing company, in order to prevent the possible consequences of an injunction for the infringment of existing patents, and also in order to place itself in a better position to control the trade, contracted with A., the holder of a patent for making such boxes, and was granted exclusive privileges under said patent. It was also authorized to prosecute all persons infringing the same, and undertook to pay to A. certain royalties on all boxes manufactured. A clause in the contract provided that if in the course of litigation an injunction should bo refused by the United States courts against any party infringing A.’s patent, thereby declaring the same untenable and invalid, all royalties were to cease. The company manufactured boxes under the contract, and continued for some time to pay to A. the stipulated royalties. Ultimately, however, it ceased to do so, whereupon A. filed a bill in equity to enforce payment. The company set up as a defence the invalidity of A. ’s patent for lack of novelty. <em>Held, </em>that under the contract, the company was bound to pay the stipulated royalty until the judicial determination of the invalidity of A.’s patent by the refusal of an injunction against an infringer, and that, therefore, A. was entitled to the relief sought by him.</p>

Palmer in October 1872, granted to the Novelty Paper Box Company, the appellee, the sole and exclusive right and license to make, use and sell all the devices for the manufacture of paper-or pasteboard boxes, covered by said patent, and to make and sell such boxes. He also granted to said company full and irrevocable power and authority to license any other parties to use the said devices and to make and sell such boxes, with the right to charge and receive, to its own use, such royalties as the sub-licensees might agree to pay; and also, in his name, but at its expense, to prosecute all parties infringing said patent, and recover, for its sole use and benefit, all damages or penalties that might be awarded against them by courts of justice or otherwise. In consideration of the license and powers thus <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>granted,, the appellee agreed to give appellant one hundred shares of its capital stock and pay him a royalty of fifty^ cents per thousand for all the paper boxes sold and delivered by it during each month, until the expiration of the patent: <em>“ </em>provided however, that should, in the course of litigation, an injunction by the United States courts be refused against any party or parties infringing the said Palmer patent, thereby declaring the same untenable or invalid, then and from such period all royalties accruing and payable to the said party of the first part shall cease.”</p>
