A creditor of a mutual fire insurance company reduced his claim to judgment, and issued an attachment execution thereon, wherein a mutual member of the company was summoned as garnishee. Said garnishee was indebted to the company on his premium note for his proportion of losses sustained. The amount of said indebtedness was not, however, at the time, fixed by assessment. Subsequently, the company was dissolved by decree of the court, and a receiver appointed who proceeded to levy an assessment on all the premium notes to meet outstanding liabilities at the time of the dissolution. <em>Held, </em>that the attaching creditor by virtue of his attachment was entitled to the amount thus assessed by the receiver on the garnishee.</p>

The possession of the receiver is the possession of the court appointing him. All the assets are in the custody of the law for the benefit of whomsoever may be ultimately determined to be entitled to them. The parties entitled to the assets of a dissolved corporation must be ascertained by the court having custody of the same, or at least by its consent, and in the meantime the assets cannot be seized or distributed by process from any other court. The appointment of a receiver does not operate to derange the priority or affect the validity of legal or equitable lieus or rights lawfully acquired and in existence at the time of his appointment. As the receiver of a corporation succeeds to the estate of and derives his title through the court from the corporation, he is bound by all its lawful and authorized acts done before the receivership, and he will not be allowed to disaffirm or set them aside. So where receivers are appointed over an insolvent .corporation, they are not liable to garnishee process, since the <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>property, whicli they hold is entrusted to them, not by the Act of the party, but by' operation of law. The court of equity being the actual custodian of the property or fund in litigation, it will not yield its jurisdiction to a court, of law and permit the right of property to be there tried. In other words, since the receiver’s possession is that of the court, it will not permit itself to become a suitor in another forum concerning the property in question. And an additional reason for holding the receiver not subject to garnishment is, that such liability would tend to a conflict of jurisdiction, and would also defeat the very ends for which he was appointed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b637-6" data-blocks='[["BL_637.6",637,[173,866,1159,673]]]'>“ I am of opinion that under our statutes all actions pending at the date of the dissolution of an insurance company must abate. That when a master or auditor is appointed to make distribution in the court having custody of the assets and of the receiver, it will be the duty of all parties claiming any portion or interest therein to present their claims, and they will then be entitled to distribution as of the date of the dissolution of the corporation. The rights of creditors and claimants must be adjudicated in the court having possession of the funds for distribution, and in the same proceeding whereby the court acquired such possession. If in such distribution questions of fact arise whicli should be determined by a jury, they can readily be sent to court for such trial. Whoever had a right of action against the corporation on the day and before it was dissolved will have precisely the same rights on distribution before the master or auditor.</p>

Such a debt is subject to attachment: Walker <em>v. </em>Gibbs, 2 Dallas, 211; Fulweiler <em>v. </em>Hughes, 5 Harris 440; Nieifer <em>v. </em>Elder, 6 Harris 388; Franklin Fire Ins.

There was no question of the assets being in custody of the law, for the premium notes of the garnishee came into the receiver’s custody subject to the attachment and -were assets of the company only after payment of that lien: Merchant’s Bank <em>v. </em>Petersburg E.

Hntil assessment there is no debt, and no action could be maintained on the note : hence, until assessment, it is not the subject of attachment: Savage <em>v. </em>Medbury, <a href="/ny/19/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="19 N.Y. 32" data-case-ids="497749" data-case-paths="/ny/19/0032-01">19 N.

The principle that an attachment will bind money of defendant coming into the garnishee’s possession after the service of the attachment, does not apply, because, at the time the receiver’s assessment was levied, whereby the garnishee became indebted, the assets of the company were in the custody of the law, and therefore not subject to the attachment. The rights of creditors were fixed at the time of the dissolution, and the receiver’s duty was to collect and distribute the assets: Dean <em>&amp; </em>Son’s Appeal, 2.Out. 101.

The question now presented is, whether assessments on the premium notes of the garnishee, made during the pendency of the attachment suit by the receiver of the company, are bound by the attachment. It can hardly bo denied, that if so bound, the plaintiff is entitled to recover and collect the money from the garnishee. If by virtue of the writ of attachment, he is entitled to the debt attached, neither the company defendant, if still in being, nor the receiver, if the company has been dissolved, can collect the money for him against his will. A receiver has no right to property of the defendant which was taken in execution before his appointment. This proceeding was pending at the time and before the civil death of the company. It is by no means the case of an execution, or an attachment, issued and levied after the appointment of the receiver.</p>
    <p id="b639-4" data-blocks='[["BL_639.5",639,[147,1121,1161,642]]]'>The garnishee gave his notes to the defendant, to be paid in such portions and at such times as the directors may, agreeably to the act of incorporation, require. The losses by fire occurred, and this judgment for one of said losses was obtained prior to the proceedings for dissolution of the company. Before its dissolution, the garnishee became indebted on his premium notes for the proportionate sum necessary for payment of said losses, and nothing remained to be done, except to ascertain the proper amount of his indebtedness, prior to his liability to an action to enforce payment. The writ of attachment was issued and served before the dissolution of the company, and the debt owing to the defendant by the garnishee became bound by it. After the receiver was appointed by order of the court, he ascertained the measure or amount of the debt which had been levied upon by the attachment of the 'plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b639-5" data-blocks='[["BL_639.6",639,[144,1762,1160,511]]]'>A garnishee is liable for money belonging to the defendant in the attachment which is received by him after service of the writ: Sheetz <em>v. </em>Hobensack, <a href="/pa/20/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="20 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="972304" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0412-01">20 Pa.

But if a debt was attached before the dissolution and appointment, though not due, it will be held as if due, the garnishee having the right to withhold payment till it becomes due ; and if the debt was subject to a condition, he may hold the money until the performance of the condition. In such cases, an existing debt is attached, though not presently due, or some action is necessary to ascertain its amount.</p>

It is a credit given for a part of the consideration of the contract. The promise of the insured is to pay upon such conditions, and the existence of the conditions must be established officially before a call for the payment of the note or any part thereof can be enforced : May on Ins. § 557. The assessments, in pursuance of the contract, fix the amount the insured shall pay on his note. He may be liable for the whole of it. How much, depends upon the losses and expenses for which he is bound to contribute, to be ascertained by the directors of the company, or, if it has been dissolved, by the receiver. The debt owing by the garnishee was attached, its amount has been ascertained by the assessments, and the plaintiff’s third point should have been affirmed, namely, the garnishee became liable upon his premium notes when losses by fire occurred, and this attachment covers assessments levied by the receiver on said notes for his proportion of the losses.</p>

Primarily, the latter is to compel an appearance, to obtain judgment against the defendant, and should judgment be obtained by default, the defendant afterwards may appear and disprove the debt. But an execution attachment is for collection of a judgment already obtained. By this writ, debts owing to the defendant “ may be attached and levied in satisfaction of the judgment, in the manner allowed in the case of a foreign attachment.” It is none the less an execution, because the manner of proceeding is prescribed, in which the garnishee may have an issue and trial for adjudication of the question of his indebtedness. The defendant may, if he can, show that the judgment has been paid, or that the thing attached is not liable to be taken in execution, but he cannot disprove the debt or impeach the judgment. That stands till satisfied. If the judgment be against a natural person, and he die, or against a corporation, and it be dissolved, it remains, and property which had been seized in execution before the death or dissolution, may be held against the administrator or receiver. Judgment cannot be rendered against the dead. The civil death-of a corporation béfore judgment in a foreign attachment against it, dissolves the attachment, and the garnishee may take advantage of this by pleading it, notwithstanding judgment had been entered of record after such death for default of appearance : Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ Bank <em>v. </em>Little, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 207" data-case-ids="483277" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0207-01">8 W. &amp; S. 207</a>.
