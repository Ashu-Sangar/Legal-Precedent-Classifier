At a coroner’s inquest upon a murdered person the evidence of a witness was taken down by a bystander, the report being expressed to be “for whom it may concern.” The evidence was not taken down under the direction of the coroner, nor was it certified and returned by him with the inquisition. Subsequently, on the trial of the alleged murderer, the witness was unable, through temporary illness, to appear in court. The report of his evidence before the coroner was offered in evidence on behalf of the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that it was rightly rejected.</p>

On a trial for murder there was but a single witness for the Commonwealth who testified to having seen the crime committed. • There was, however, much evidence tending to corroborate him. The defendant introduced considerable evidence to discredit the single witness. The court laid due stress upon all the discrediting evidence, but instructed the jury that it was not essential that the single witness should be corroborated. <em>Held, </em>that this instruction did not constitute error.</p>

Where a murder of great atrocity was committed without discoverable motive on the part of the accused, the court in its charge, after dwelling at length upon the evidence as to the good character of the accused and impressing the jury with the weight of such evidence, said: “ Where it is a question of great and atrocious criminality, the commission of the act is so unusual, so out of the ordinary course of things and beyond common experience, it is so manifest that the offence if perpetrated must have been influenced by motives not frequently operating on the human mind, that evidence of character and of a man’s habitual conduct under common circumstances must be considered far inferior to what it is in the instance of an accusation of low'er grade.” The court then added that evidence of reputation might of itself create in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt of the existence or truthfulness of the criminating circumstances, and thus induce them to acquit the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that this instruction as qualified did not constitute error.</p>

On a trial for murder the testimony tended to show that the crime had been committed with a certain shovel which had stains upon it. These were subjected to chemical analysis and microscopic examination by different experts, some of whom asserted that the stains were caused by human blood, while others failed thus to identify them. Certain unlearned observers testified that in their opinion the stains were caused by human blood. The court, remarking that if scientific research gave no aid in such an investigation it was deplorable, instructed the jury that they might convict upon the testimony of the unlearned observers if they were satisfied of its truth. <em>Held, </em>that this was not error.</p>

In tbe absence of any clue to the murderer suspicion fell on him, also on Samuel Gisal, who was also engaged about the stable, and on a colored man named Theodore Gross, all of whom were arrested. A day <em>or two </em>after their imprisonment Gross was told by the police that McLain and Gisal had charged the crime on him, and that McLain and Gisal would be discharged from custody. Gross Ilion charged the murder on McLain. He testified on the trial that on the evening in question he was standing at the watering trough when he saw Hunter take his mule into the stable, and McLain follow him in; that he then went to the stable door, looked in, and saw Hunter put bis mule in tbe stall, and as lie was backing out from the stall McLain hit him twice on the head with a coal shovel, and Hunter fell dead after the second blow; that Gisal, who was silently standing by, then got a coffee-sack which was lying on the hay-rack, into which the two men put the dead body, and McLain slung it over his <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>shoulder, and with Gisal took it towards the river’s edge, towards the place where it was found.

One of the physicians testified that in his microscopical examinations of specimens of the substance scraped from the shovel, he found well-defined blood disks or corpuscles which resembled human blood corpuscles, and which he' believed to be such. Several other physicians testified that they failed to find blood corpuscles in similar specimens. Unlearned witnesses testified to the effect that stains on the shovel looked as if they had been caused by human blood. One or more of the physicians testified that it would be impossible to determine by inspection by the naked eye the presence of human blood upon a rusty and dirty shovel several days after the stains had been made; also that while it might be possible to detect blood in old stains by chemical, microscopic or spectroscopic tests, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to discriminate between human blood and that of other mammalia.</p>

It was also shown that McLain’s young son was present at the stable at tbe time in question, and the boy himself testified he was there and accompanied his father home. McLain’s whereabouts were traced and accounted for during that evening. After he left the stable, lie went home, ate bis supper, went to East Liberty and purchased a lot of groceries, which he brought home on the eleven o’clock train.

The answer to this on the part of the defence, if I understand it, is that no one by the unaided eye can distinguish blood of any animal from madder, or from certain paints, dyes and fruit juices, and that by no chemical test or scientific appliance can human blood be distinguished from that of many animals, and that any testimony to the effect that blood, if any, found on the shovel or coat is human blood, is utterly unreliable. The claim is, that in order to know that anything discovered is truly blood there must be a scientific examination, and that such examination will utterly fail to show that the blood if such be found, may not be that of some domestic animal, [in fine, that to know the blood of man with sufficient certainty to make it of avail as evidence, it must be seen to flow from human veins.] . . .</p>

As the defendant had been wounded shortly before the murder, and was bleeding profusely, the evidence, if believed, tended to show that he was near the place when the gun must have been fired; that he had returned to the house of the deceased without any other apparent motive for his return than a desire for revenge upon the deceased, who had wounded him, and had retreated again along the route over which the blood was traced to the place where he was afterwards discovered. Indeed, it was most pregnant evidence, difficult to be reconciled with any other hypothesis than that of his guilt. Whether what the witnesses saw was really blood, was, therefore, a vital question.

Cox was there examined as a witness for the Commonwealth in the presence of the accused. At the time of .the trial, the witness was ill and unable to attend. Under several British statutes, believed to be in force in Pennsylvania, as well as at common law, the coroner, as a high judicial officer, takes the evidence at his official inquest with fairness, <em>“ </em>whether against or in favor of the party charged : ” Stat. 3 Henry YII. cap. 1; 4 Edw. I. cap. 2; 1 <em>&amp; </em>2 Phil, and Mary; 2 &amp; 3 Phil, and Mary; Robert’s Dig. p. 106. The question has been virtually decided in this state in Brown <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 23 P. F. Smith 321, upon which we rely. The facts there are similar to this case, except that the examination was before a magistrate, and the witness was dead at the time of the trial; but these differences are shown by the opinion of Read, C. J., in that case to be immaterial. The reason of the rule is the same in case of sickness as of death; the former is as much the act of God as the latter. When the reason exists, the rule exists. The English authorities support the proposition that the testimony of witnesses taken before the coroner on inquests, may be read in evidence on a subsequent trial in court, where by the act of God the witness is unable to be present, whether by reason of death, sickness or inability to travel; and the rule is the same in civil and criminal cases: Powell on Evidence, *254; Rex <em>v. </em>Morly, 1 Levinz 180; 2 Keble 18, 19; Kelyng’s Rep. 55 ; 2 líale 284; 2 Hawkins P.

We j&gt;roved the accuracy of the written testimony by the short-hand writer, who took it down.

The testimony of all the experts except one was concurrent that under the circumstances human blood could not be distinguished from blood of other mammalia by any scientific test, much less by the naked eye. This is sustained by all the medical and scientific text-books: Taylor’s Med.

The court also erred in its comments in the charge on the scientific testimony, and in charging : “ I undertake to say that a jury-may, if satisfied of its truth, lawfully convict upon the proof of the existence of human blood by the testimony of unlearned observers.” This is a dangerous doctrine, where human life is at stake.</p>

IV e ask the especial attention of this court to this case in view of the subsequent acquittal of Samuel Gisal on the same indictment, and on precisely the same evidence on behalf of the Commonwealth, except that the defence had the advantage of the presence and testimony of James Cox, the exclusion of whose testimony in our case is insisted on as grave error.</p>

It was not taken by or for the coroner, nor adopted nor certified by him. It was taken by a volunteer, as he stated, <em>“ </em>for whom it may concern.” At the inquest there was no accused — there was no accuser. The witnesses did not appear for either side, but in the interests of public justice. Hence, there was no opportunity for cross-examination, which is a test of the subsequent admissibility of depositions. An inquest is a common law proceeding by virtue of power vested in the coroner long before any statute. The British statutes referred to were passed not with reference to testimony taken at a coroner’s inquest being read at a subsequent <em>trial </em>of the prisoner, but they related <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>to its being used for tbe “ bailment of tbe prisoner.” It is said that these statutes are substantially in force in Pennsylvania, but this cannot be so, as the parts of the statutes relating to bailment of the prisoner have been supplied by our own statutes, and other portions of the British statutes relate to matters which do not exist here, <em>e. g., </em>inquests in cases of rape, deodands, etc. The British statutes, if ever in force here, are now obsolete by non-user. The authorities relied on, both English and American, do not sustain the contention. In every case, the witness whose testimony given at the coroner’s inquest was admitted on a subsequent trial was <em>dead. </em>Although the resolution of the Judges, on the trial of Lord Morly, as reported in Kelynge, 53-55, was, that the testimony taken before the coroner of witnesses who were “ dead or unable to travel” could be read on the trial, yet it appears by the reports of the trial of Bromwich, as aiding and abetting Lord Morly, Levinz 180, and 2 Keble 19, that the witnesses referred to were dead. So, also, the witness was dead in Brown <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 23 P. E. Smith, 325; and United States <em>v. </em>Macomb, <a href="/f-cas/26/1132-03" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 McLean 286" data-case-ids="12116859" data-case-paths="/f-cas/26/1132-03">5 McLean 286</a>. Emig <em>v. </em>Diehl, 26 P. F. Smith 359, was an ejectment, and clearly not in point. Such testimony of an absent sick witness has been refused even in a civil case: Harrison <em>v. </em>Blades, 3 Campbell 457. The extreme limit reached by any of the authorities is thus stated in Queen <em>v. </em>Scaife, 1 Moody <em>&amp; </em><a href="/citations/?q=Robards%20551" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="Robards 551">Rob. 551</a>: “ If a witness is dead or insane, or where there is no probability of his ever being able to attend, or where he is kept away by the prisoner, his deposition, if properly taken, is admissible, but other absences are insufficient ground to admit the evidence.” See also, 1 Whart. on Evidence, § 179; Rex <em>v. </em>Savage, 5 Car. &amp;P. 143; People <em>v. </em>Restell, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Hill%20290" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Hill 290">3 Hill 290</a> ; Regina <em>v. </em>Austin, 1 Dearsley Crown Cas. 612. If the rule, as contended for, governed in criminal cases, it would be a temptation to perjury before the coroner, there being no cross-examination, and to feigned sickness during the trial.</p>

The authorities are not in entire harmony as to the application of the same rule in criminal cases. The preponderance of authority is that the rule does so apply, if the witness be dead: 1 American Crim. Law, § 667; 1 Whart. Law of Ev. § 177; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Richards, <a href="/mass/35/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="18 Pick. 434" data-case-ids="2025445" data-case-paths="/mass/35/0434-01">18 Pick. 434</a>; Crary <em>v. </em>Sprague, <a href="/wend/12/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="12 Wend. 41" data-case-ids="11267997" data-case-paths="/wend/12/0041-01">12 Wend. 41</a>; Brown <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 23 P.

    <p id="b111-7" data-blocks='[["BL_111.7",111,[146,919,1176,1013]]]'>The witness Cox was not dead, nor was his sickness of a character imposing permanent disability. On the contrary, he was recovering from typhoid fever, so there was reason to suppose ho would be able to attend on some future day to which the trial may have been postponed. In civil cases, the recognized rule in this state, is to admit the testimony of a witness, unable to attend court, without regard to the permanency of his sickness ; yet we are not aware that the precise point has ever been decided by this court, in a criminal case. Under the rule declared in Harrison <em>v. </em>Blades, 3 Camp. 458; Jones <em>v. </em>Brewer, 4 Taun. 47, and Whart. Law of Evi. § 179, the evidence of a witness temporarily ill would be excluded in a criminal case. It however is not necessary to invoke that distinction in the present case. The action of the court rests on firmer ground. The hearing before the coroner was not between the 'parties to the issue in which the evidence was offered. No issue was there formed between the Commonwealth and the plaintiff in error. An inquiry there takes a broad range. It is not to ascertain the guilt of any particular person, but of every person that the evidence might implicate. No technical rules. restrict or control the admission of evidence. No cross-examination of witnesses is Lad. The coroner’s discretion marks the line where the evidence of a witness shall begin, and where it. shall end.</p>
    <p id="b111-8" data-blocks='[["BL_111.8",111,[132,1942,1185,473]],["BL_112.1",112,[300,410,1172,1535]]]'>It was contended that the evidence should have been received under the British statutes, more especially under the 1 <em>,&amp; </em>2 Phil. <em>&amp; </em>Mary, and the construction given thereto.. Chapter 13, § 5, of that statute, does require the coroner in inquisitions finding murder or manslaughter, to put in writing the effect of the material evidence given to the jury before him, and to certify and return the same with the inquisition, thus making it a part of his judicial action. When so taken, certified and returned, and the witness be dead, the courts in England have held the evidence admissible. Our attention has not been called to any Pennsylvania authority giving such con <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>struction to the statute. If, however, it were otherwise, the rule could not apply to this case, as the witness is still living. Other reasons exist for its exclusion. The testimony offered was not taken down by the coroner nor under his direction or supervision. Nor was it certified or returned by him with the inquisition. It was taken by a short-hand writer at the instance of some person not clearly disclosed by the evidence, and, as testified by the writer, for “ whomever it might concern.” It is further urged that the evidence should have been admitted under the ruling on the trial of Lord Morely, reported in Kelynge 53, 18 Chas. II. It was then resolved, <em>‘ </em>that in case any of the witnesses which were examined before the coroner were dead or unable to travel, and oath made thereof, that then the examination of such witnesses might be read, the coroner first making oath that such examinations are the same which he took upon oath without any addition or alteration whatsoever.” This was the case in which Lord Morely and Bromwich wore indicted for the murder of Hastings. The former was tried by his peers before the Lord High Steward; the latter before the Court of King’s Bench; Levinz’s Reports, part 1, page 180, and again reported in <em>2 </em>Keble, 19. In each case it is shown that the witnesses were dead when their testimony was offered. The admission of the evidence did not rest on any temporary disability, but on their death, and the sworn testimony of the coroner as to the correct taking of the evidence offered. As the testimony of Cox was in no manner proved by the coroner the present case does not come within those authorities under the broadest rule there indicated. Nor does the case of Brown <em>v. </em>Commonwealth make the evidence admissible. There the testimony of the witness was taken before a justice of the peace on a hearing wherein Brown was charged with the crime. He was present and represented by counsel. Full opportunity was thus given for cross-examination of the witness. The accused had “ met him face to face,” and the witness was dead when his evidence was offered on the trial. The evidence given by Cox was properly rejected.</p>

If Gross was believed, the guilt of the accused was established. It was therefore of vital importance to the accused to cast discredit on the testimony of this witness. Evidence was given which, if believed, was very proper for the jury to consider in determining the credit to be given to Gross. It consisted, in part, in showing that this testimony was contrary to his previous statements; that the number of cuts found on the head of the murdered boy proved the infliction of more blows than Gross swore were struck; that <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>other evidence indicated lie could not have been killed in tho stable at the time and in tho manner testified to by Gross.

The court well said the Commonwealth was not bound to establish an adequate motive for the alleged crime, and declared, in the words of this court, “ the fact of murder being established the inability to discover the motive does not disprove the crime.”</p>
    <p id="b113-7" data-blocks='[["BL_113.7",113,[154,917,1165,1238]]]'>Tho fact that Hunter was murdered was unquestionably proved. The only contention was whether the accused committed the act. He gave evidence of a previous good reputation. The instructions of the court gave due weight to this evidence. It said, “ evidence of good character, when proven to exist, is not a mere make-weight thrown in to assist in the production of a result that would happen at all events, but it is positive evidence. A. case may be so made out that no previous character, however good, can make it doubtful; but there may be cases in which evidence given against a person without character would amount to certainty, in which a high character would produce a reasonable doubt, or indeed, actually outweigh evidence which might otherwise appear conclusive.” The learned judge then submitted for “their consideration” tho language of Chief Justice Shaw in the case of Professor Webster: “'Where it is a question of great and atrocious criminality, the commission of the act is so unusual, so out of the ordinary course of things, and beyond common experience, it is so manifest that the offense, if perpetrated, must have been influenced by motives not frequently operating on the human mind; that evidence of character, and of a man’s habitual conduct under common circumstances, must be considered far inferior to what it is in the instance of accusations of a lower grade.” After reading this, he added that such evidence “ may of itself, by the creation in your minds of a reasonable doubt of the existence or truthfulness of the criminating evidence, cause you to acquit the defendant.” We are not prepared to dissent from the doctrine declared by Chief Justice Shaw ; but qualified as it was by the court below the accused has no just cause of complaint.</p>

Gross testified that tho murder was committed with a shovel. Stains or discolored spots were found on the shovel and also on the clothing of the accused. These were subjected to chemical analysis and microscopic examination by different experts. <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>Some succeeded in finding well-defined blood corpuscles, indicating human blood, other's failed to find them. It was contended on the part of the accused that human blood could not be distinguished from that of many animals by any chemical test or scientific appliance. In answer to this, the court substantially said, if scientific research gave no such aid in the discovery of a heinous crime, it was deplorable. Nevertheless he charged that if the jury was satisfied of its truth, they might lawfully convict, upon proof of the existence of human blood, by the testimony of unlearned observers. The correctness of this view is fully sustained by Gaines <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20319" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="14 Wright 319">14 Wright 319</a>. That was a case of homicide, and the court below said to the jury, “We cannot instruct you that because no analysis had been made of the substance which the witnesses supposed to be blood, no chemical test, no microscopic examination, that you are therefore to reject the evidence as insufficient to show that it was blood. We feel it to be our duty to refer the question to you, and leave it for you to say whether the Commonwealth has satisfied you beyond a reasonable doubt that the spots seen by the witnesses were blood.” The correctness of that ruling was affirmed by this court.</p>
