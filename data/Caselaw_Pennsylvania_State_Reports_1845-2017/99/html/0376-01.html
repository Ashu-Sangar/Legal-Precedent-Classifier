In the meantime, a claim for taxes had been filed against the premises, under which a sheriff’s sale was threatened in December 1878, when Bowman paid the claim, about §500, and had the same marked to his use. This amount he collected from the sheriff, out of the proceeds of the said sheriff’s sale. Bowman had entered judgment on the bond accompanying his mortgage on August 18th 1877. The sheriff’s sale did not produce enough to pay either the building association mortgage or Bowman’s mortgage, both of which were discharged by the sale.

Bowman accepted the trust and collected the rents, but did not apply them as directed, claiming to retain them towards the payment of his mortgage. But it is well settled that an agent or attorney, who has received money in his agency, cannot, when called upon by his principal to account, set off a debt due to him in a matter not arising out of his agency. By accepting the trust, the defendant waived any claim to set off. There is no mutuality between the two debts, the same not being due in the same right or capacity; this is essential to set off : Turnpike Road <em>v. </em>Watson, <a href="/rawle/1/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Rawle 330" data-case-ids="1819317" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0330-01">1 Rawle 330</a>; Smullor <em>v. </em>Canal Co., <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%2068" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Wright 68">1 Wright 68</a>; U.

He, therefore, had no rents in hand with which to pay the interest on the building association mortgage, and prevent the sheriff’s sale, which was inevitable. When <em>it took </em>place, it ipso facto terminated the agency, and changed the relation between Tagg and Bowman to one simply of debtor and creditor, leaving a large balance due to Bowman. The doctrine, contended for by the plaintiff in error, that an agent may not set off a debt due him in his own right is, therefore, inapplicable.</p>

It authorized him to collect of a certain tenant of the plaintiff, the rents of a property specified, and directed him to pay the same to lien creditors named, designating the order of payment, and to pay the residue, if any, over to the plaintiff. The defendant collected rents, but failed to pay the same according to directions. He held a judgment against the legal plaintiff, aud on the trial of this cause was permitted to set it off, and recover a judgment against Tagg, for the amount which it exceeded the rents in his hands. The allowance of this judgment, as a set-off, is assigned as error.</p>
    <p id="b393-8" data-blocks='[["BL_393.12",393,[143,1545,1158,554]]]'>While a liberal construction is given to the Act of 1705 allowing set-off and defalcation of a debt of a proper character, yet, as a general rule, the debt must be due in the same right. It is inadmissible when the plaintiff’s cause of action is for a breach of contract to fulfill an official, or a fiduciary obligation. Although the debt may be between the same parties, yet it is not due in the same right within the true meaning of the statute. Hence the treasurer of a corporation, vdien sued for money in his hands as treasurer, cannot set off a debt due him from the corporation: Russell <em>v. </em>Church, 15 P. F. Smith 9. So in an action by a collector of school taxes, for taxes assessed on the defendant, the latter cannot set off a debt due him from the board of school directors: McCracken <em>v. </em>Elder, 10 Casey 239.</p>

It thereby became his duty to collect the rents and pay over the same to the several persons, in the amount therein specified. ITis right to retain any portion thereof, or to apply it to the debt due him was expressly limited to the interest thereon. PLis power to collect was coupled with the specific trust prescribed in the same instrument. Having received the money under authority of the plaintiff for a specific purpose, he cannot apply it to the payment of a previous indebtedness. It cannot thus be diverted from its legitimate purpose: Jarvis <em>v. </em>Rogers, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Mass.%20397" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="15 Mass. 397">15 Mass. 397</a>; Turnpike <em>v. </em>Watson, <a href="/rawle/1/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Rawle 330" data-case-ids="1819317" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0330-01">1 Rawle 330</a>.
