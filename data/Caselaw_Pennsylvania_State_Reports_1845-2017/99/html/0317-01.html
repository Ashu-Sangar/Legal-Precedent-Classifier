F., agent.” The bank discounted certain notes for W. F., and placed the proceeds to his credit ; but the notes were dishonored at maturity. Subsequently, one A. recovered judgment against J. F., and issued an attachment, wherein the bank was summoned as garnishee. The bank pleaded <em>nulla bona, </em>averred that it had no knowledge of J. F., and claimed to set off the amount of the notes discounted by it. The case was afterwards tried on the issues thus raised. <em>Held, </em>that the garnishee was not entitled to the set-off claimed. <em>Held, </em>further, that said garnishee was liable for interest on the funds in its hands from the time of the attachment.</p>

James Payer himself could not have demanded anything else ; has then his attaching creditor a higher right ? Again; how could the bank pay a depositor’s money into court in a suit to which that de-. positor is not a party ? Our only contention is, that we had a right to have a court pass upon that evidence before we paid out money deposited by one man on a claim against another.' The fact that the bank claimed a right of set-off against this fund can have no bearing upon this question unless it is shown that the proceedings have been thereby prolonged or complicated. This is not pretended. The true question is, could the bank have been required to act otherwise if they had had no such claim ?</p>

Had the answer and plea shown a readiness to pay whenever it should be determined whether Jones, or James Payer was entitled to the money, the garnishee would not be liable for interest. But the garnishee was unwilling to pay the money, claimed the amount of said notes as a set-off, and raised an issue in which it was determined that James Fayer owned the money, that the garnishee was not entitled to the set-off, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover.
