He further directed his executors, on completion of the building, to deposit a certain sum in trust, the income therefrom to be applied towards the support of the pastor of said church. In case no congregation should be formed within the stipulated period, the testator directed the above devise and bequest to fall into, and become part of his residuary estate. The executors notified the presbytery in whose ecclesiastical jurisdiction the town of T. was situate, and said presbytery thereupon proceeded to organize and constitute a regular congregation and church in said town, notifying the executors of their action in the premises. The executors wrote to tlic presbytery accepting its action as binding upon them, and acknowledged their obligation to carry out the wishos of the testator. Subsequently, however, at the instance of the residuary legatees and devisees, they declined to go on, averring that they liad not sufficient evidence to justify them in building. A bill in equity having been filed in the Common Pleas by the members of the church established in T., as aforesaid, to enforce their rights under the will against the executors, and said executors having filed an answer averring that a respectable number of persons had not been found to form the nucleus oí a <em>congregation, </em>— Held, that if such a nucleus onco were established it was the clear duty of defendants to locate, build, convey and deposit as directed by the will, and that the presbytery, having regularly, and apparently in good faith, organized a congregation, the prima facie presumtion was that there existed a proper nucleus ; that the burden of proof was on defendants to show want of good faith, or gross error of judgment on the part of the presbytery, aud that they having failed to do this, complainants were entitled to the relief sought. <em>Held, </em>further, that the Common Pleas had jurisdiction in the premises, and that the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court was not exclusivo. <em>Held, </em>further, that under the circumstances of the case, the executors having acted in good faith and made no unreasonable delay, the costs should be paid out of testator’s residuary estate, not out of the fund in controversy.</p>

Around this question all the contention in this case centres; the defendants virtually admit, that if, within the prescribed period, a respectable number of persons have been found, to form the nucleus of a congregation, such as was contemplated by the testator, and if the court have power to compel the trustees to carry into effect the directions of the will, contrary to their judgment in the premises, the complainants are entitled to the relief for which they pray, which is, that the defendants be ordered to proceed and execute their duties as executors under the said sixth clause of the will, set apart a lot of ground and erect a church edifice thereon, and convey the same to the trustees of the general assembly, in trust for the Macalester Memorial Church in Torresdale.</p>

So is it, also, a manifest misreading of the will, to interpret it as restricting the residence of the membership to what, in strictness, may be called Torres-dale, within the bounds of which the church building was to be erected: by no word or sentence of the will, can be justified the conclusion that it was to be restricted in its use, to the people residing within the boundaries of Torresdale ; the contrary of this appears in the first paragraph of the sixth clause, which reads: ‘ the erection of a Presbyterian church at Torresdale, has been a favorite object with me and would have been carried out before this time, but for the want of sufficient Presbyterian element in the neighborhood.’ It was to the neighborhood then, that the testator looked with the hope, that within its bounds might be found a sufficient number of Presbyterians to constitute a respectable number to form the nucleus of a church. With the knowledge which Mr. Maealester had of the persons who resided in what may be termed the village which he had founded, he could have had little expectation of finding the element necessary for the formation of such a church, as he' intended should be established : and therefore, the implied hope, that others might find in the neighborhood that which he had not found, it this was not so, he probably would have described the persons to be found, as respectable, in the sense of being wealthy or well-to-do, which would, have a meaning entirely different from the phrase, inserted in the will, £ a respectable number : ’ this respectable number in the judgment of presbytery has been found, which establishes a prima facie case in favor of the complainants, because it is the action of a judicatory which, at least, in conjunction with the executors, is required to act, before the intention of the testator in this respect can be carried into effect. This declared intention was not simply to secure the finding of the nucleus of a congrega<a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>tion, made up of Presbyterians, that is, those of Presbyterian predilection or preferences, or who may have been members of other churches of that denomination, and who adhered to the doctrines of the church but the purpose is clearly expressed, that the structure or building, was to be for the use and benefit, as a place of worship, of a church and congregation, duly organized at Torvosdale and being in connection with the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America. The words, ‘duly organized’ have a special significance in their application to the organization of a Presbyterian church, when used by one who may fairly be presumed to have understood the full force and accurate meaning of the language employed, to express the thought as it lay in his mind; for as we have found, he was a Presbyterian; an intelligent man and one who for years stood forth as an ordained officer of the church with which he was connected. It is not, therefore, straining the language of the will, to hold, that the testator intended that the church for which he was making provision, was to be duly organized according to Presbyterian law and usage; and that law and usage make it absolutely essential that such organization must be supervised and approved by presbytery, for they only can decide what constitutes the due organization of a Presbyterian church. In all cases in which a nucleus of a congregation has been gathered, presbytery alone can decide, whether it shall be duly organized or constituted with the rights and privileges which belong to a completed church organization, and from this it follows, that no authority could as well do the entire work as presbytery, commencing with a due investigation of Torresdale and its neighborhood, in looking for and searching out the Presbyterian element of that locality, in order to ascertain whether it was possible to carry out that which the testator designates as having long been a favorite project of his own. In no other way and through no other channel, 'could this work be as well done as by presbytery, and of all this, the testator may be supposed to have been well acquainted. And this raises a fair presumption, that his intention was to give to presbytery exclusive, control over the entire matter. Whether this is or is not a correct interpretation of the will, it does no violence to its letter or to .its spirit, to hold, that that judicatory should at least co-operate with the executors in the effort to find a sufficient body of Presbyterians out of which it was to duly organize a church, before it was called upon to exorcise its exclusive jurisdiction of organization and of bringing the church into proper connection with the general assembly. It is to be remembered, that the language of the will is not, ‘ if my executors can find,’ or ‘ I direct my executors to try and find,’ on the contrary it reads, ‘ if a respectable number of persons can be found ;’ this <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>clearly carries with it the idea that effort should be made to find, but no express direction is given as to who should make this effort, and ascertain if it was possible for the persons or body making search for a respectable number of persons, to find them. . It is very certain that the executors did not understand that it was incumbent on them to make this effort in the first instance. This is placed beyond dispute by the testimony of Mr. G-est, who, when asked the question, whether from the time of sending the will to the date named, did the executors or any one for them, make any investigation as to this church matter at Torresdale, he answered, ‘ having communicated to presbytery as I have stated, I did not deem that any action, on our part, was necessary until we should hear from them, . . . I considered the establishment of the church was for them, while I think the executors and trustees under this will, have a responsibility as to how the church was to be constituted, with reference to the number and character of its members.’ This concession admits that the true construction of the will is, that Mr. Macalester intended that presbytery should ascertain if the respectable number of persons could be found, and if this was committed to-presbytery, as a duty to be performed by them, if they were to exercise an exclusive judgment and discretion over the matter in the first instance, their action is conclusive and binding on the executors, unless they can show that presbytery has acted in bad faith, or that their action is unwise, and has no proper basis to support it. And this, in substance, is what the defendants have undertaken to do. The opposition now made to this application raises just this issue, which places the burden of proof on those seeking to maintain it; their testimony must not only be sufficient to overcome the prima facie ease, which arises upon the presumption of honest and judicious action on the part of presbytery, but it must also be sufficient to disprove the case which the plaintiffs have made by their testimony. Ve do not see how the defendants could do otherwise than concede the right and the duty of presbytery to make the effort to find the element necessary to a due organization of a Presbyterian church; to do less would bo to convict themselves of a gross neglect of a duty imposed by the will. Eor four years after sending a copy of the will to presbytery, they rested content with doing nothing; from April 1874 to May 1878, not a word was spoken nor an act done by them' to carry out a clearly expressed purpose of the testator. It must be taken, then, as admitted by the defendants, that, having given notice to presbytery, the executors rested satisfied, under the belief that they had performed their whole duty, until presbytery, who had five years within which to make the effort, ascertained whether the proper nucleus of a congregation could be found ; so entirely <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>were defendants of this mind, that when notified by presbytery that a elmrch had been formed, they expressed entire acquiescence in what had been done, and communicated such acquiescence in the letter of the vice-president of May 27th 1878.</p>

Several of these witnesses were connected with this enterprise by appointment of presbytery for all of the period from 1874: until 1878 ; most of them are gentlemen of long association with the Presbyterian church, familiar with its laws and usages, and having experience in the work of organizing new churches. Their testimony shows that they felt themselves not only justified in organizing the Macalester Memorial Church, but that the prospects of the enterprise are, that it will be successful: that fourteen communicant members, with an attendance on the preaching services of from twenty-five to thirty-five persons, are quite equal to and even greater in numbers, than those with which other church enterprises have been begun and carried on successfully; to which, in this case, is to be added a house of worship clear of debt and income of $5,000, applicable to the payment of the pastor’s salary. Of the other witnesses, it is to be said that Mr. Thomas is a lumber merchant; Mr. Myers has a cottage or summer residence at Torresdale; Mr. Sweeny is a storekeeper in the neighborhood, and Mr. Campbell and Mrs. McLean are plain working people; the last two have resided at Torresdale one twenty-six and the other seven years.</p>

Mrs. Laughton is herself unable to say, of her personal knowledge, that her father ever made inquiry among the people residing in the neighborhood, as to the feasibility of organizing a church; or that he ever made an effort, like that which the committee of presbytery made, to call together, at his own house or elsewhere, those who were willing to join in, or favor such an undertaking. If it had been done, Mrs. Laughton and Mr. Nicoll would be most likely, of all persons, to have known all about it. But how does it affect the question, whether Mr. Macalester knew of the Presbyterian element residing in the neighborhood of Torresdale, or whether he did not know? It is sufficient, that having committed to others the duty of seeking out that which he had not found, and the result of their effort being a church well constituted, in the opinion of experienced and competent judges, which was duly organized by presbytery : possessing in its start in life, elements of strength and hope, not belonging to many of the strong Presbyterian churches of to-day, in the dawn of their existence. The fact, after all that may be said to the contrary, stands forth that the nucleus has been found, a church has been duly organized, and all that it now asks is, that the purpose of the testator may be carried into effect by giving to it the shelter and support which he provided for it.</p>

The law is too well settled to require more than a reference to it here. The principle is equally applicable to the case of a trustee, who has a duty enjoined on him to be performed in conjunction with others; in this case, regarded in a light most favorable to the defendants, the duty was a joint duty with the presbytery; all that was required has been accomplished, which being done the testator then said, I direct my executors to do that which the complainants seek to obtain from them through the controlling power of the court because they have refused to go forward. And upon what ground do they justify the course which they have adopted? We think a careful reading of the testimony <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>will show that a change of purpose on the part of the defendants, and their refusal to erect a church building, was probably founded on the advice of Mr. Ilopkins alone, which from Mr. Gest’s testimony, shows was volunteered, not solicited. It is true that Mr. Gest speaks of obtaining information from Mrs. Laughton and Mr. Nieoll, but the action of the board of directors of the company defendant was based on the report which Mr. Caldwell says he made to them at a meeting in July 1878, his information on the subject having been obtained from Mr. Gest, and Mr. Gest could not have conferred with Mrs. Laughton, who at the time was absent in Europe, and did not return home until October 1878.

If they had but the one interview on the subject, then it must have been as late as October 1878. It is admitted, that other than this, there was no investigation by the officers or agents of the executors ; that no search was made by them at Torresdale, or in its neighborhood, and that tbe only information which they sought, or in any way obtained, was from a source which was either hostile or indifferent to the success of the enterprise. Can this be regarded as fulfilling the full measure of tbe duty of defendants, or justify them in ignoring the action of presbytery and in refusing to erect a church at Torresdale? We think that it cannot; in no aspect in which the case can be viewed are they justified in maintaining the stand which they have taken; they have shown no reasonable or sufficient cause, which will excuse them from the performance of that which we regard as a manifest duty imposed on them by the testator.</p>

His will is silent as to the mode of ascertaining this fact, and as to who should determine how many persons would constitute the nucleus. It may he justly inferred that all persons in the neighborhood who would attend worship and belong to the congregation in Torresdale, would be included in the number. Contemplating a small beginning, he ordered the conveyance to be made to an already organized and permanent Presbyterian body. The implication is that the persons entitled to the bounty must bo organized under the laws and usages of the Presbyterian Church, and be subject to its discipline. If there is no such organization the plaintiffs have no right; and if there is, such as the testator intended, the devise and bequests will not be defeated by any discretionary act of the executor. When the fact of the nucíeus is established; the duty of the executor is plain, and the executor is not made the final judge of its existence. The direction is to locate, build, convey and deposit, in case the described persons can be found ; and if not found the bequests become a part of the residuary estate. This is not a case for the executor to form an opinion that the circumstances render it unnecessary, inexpedient and impracticable to recognize a duly organized Presbyterian Church which fulfils the requirements of the will in order to be entitled to the bounty.</p>

      <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>That this is a proper case for determination by a proceeding in equity is unquestioned. The bill is not to compel the distribution of the testator’s estate, but to establish the right of The Macalester Memorial Church under the sixth paragraph of his will. This right being established, the decree accords with the provisions of the will. Its enforcement will be governed by similar principles as are prescribed in the statute providing for the recovery of legacies in the common-law courts. The defendant has not averred that the land is necessary for payment of debts, or that there is a deficiency of assets for payment of the bequests. Should such averment be made it would be followed by action of the court in granting a stay till an account be taken and tbe question of deficiency bo determined.</p>
    <p id="b474-6" data-blocks='[["BL_474.6",474,[319,963,1170,674]]]'>As already stated, it appears that the executor declined to set apart the laud and erect tbe building, agreeably to the wish of the residuary legatees. There was sufficient doubt of the claimants’ right to justify the delay until the claim, disputed by said legatees, should be adjudicated. In an action at law for the recovery of a legacy, tbe statute directs the court, according to justice and equity, either to award costs or no costs out of the testator’s estate, or if the executor has been faulty in delaying payment, without sufficient excuse, then the costs shall be paid by him out of his own estate. That rule is fitting in this case. The executor has made no unreasonable delay, and the vigorous defence has been made in good faitb, if not at the instance, in the interest of them who denied the plaintiffs’ right. We are of opinion that tbe costs should not be paid out of the fund in controversy, but out of the residuary moneys of the estate of the decedent.</p>
