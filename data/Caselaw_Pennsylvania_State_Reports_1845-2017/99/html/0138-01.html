The deed does not pretend to dispose of the proceeds in case Daniel McAleer should choose to sell the property. There is no direct trust as to them, and the words used could not bo construed as applicable to such proceeds, aside from the difficulty of raising a trust as to this fund. From the inference that the proceeds were to stand in place of the property, it is a convincing argument that the power to sell was not in execution of the trust, but intended to be used by Daniel McAleer for his own benefit and at his own will.

Power was given to the trastee to sell and convey the whole or any part of the land, at any time, and for such prices as he should deem best for the interest of his children.</p>

It is conceded that he had the right to create the trust in favor of his wife and children, and himself be the trustee. He mortgaged the premises, and he could have done this only by virtue of the power contained in the trust deed.

He made an absolute gift of the land to his wife and children. In equity the entire estate was vested in the children of “ said Daniel McAleer and Mary Ann McAleer, begotten,” subject to the use of their mother during her life or widowhood. We are unable to adopt the view of the learned auditor, to wit: <em>“ </em>In case she survived her husband and died unmarried, there is no provision in the deed for the children, and the estate would then revert to Daniel McAleer’s heirs.” This is too strict a reading of the deed, avoiding its plain intent and the clear meaning of the language used, namely, that the children shall take the use immediately after their mother’s death, or before, should she become a widow and marry. Had McAleer’s wife died before him, and the power not exercised, at once they would have come into the enjoyment and use of their estate, and so will they if the widow mar<a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>ries, by the express terms of the deed; the necessary implication is, that they shall have it if the widow dies unmarried.</p>

The interest, or use, of the money belongs to them who were entitled to the rents, or use, of the land, and the omission to express in the deed that in ease of sale, the same persons should receive the interest of the money, who were entitled to the rents of the land, will not defeat the purposes of the trust. Conversion gave the trustee no interest, in the money, no power of appointment, no right of disposition for his own benefit, and will not deprive the owners of their property.</p>
