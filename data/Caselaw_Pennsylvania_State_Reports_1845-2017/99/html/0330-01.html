This work was executed in accordance with the directions of said ordinance, by "William Armstrong, the use plaintiff, as contractor. No fault seems to have been found with the character of the work, nor is the general power of the city to charge the cost of such work upon the adjacent property, under the provisions of the Act of March 27th 1865, called in question.</p>
    <p id="b349-6" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[170,782,1170,1492]]]'>Nevertheless, several exceptions are taken by the defendants to the ruling of the learned judge of the court below, of which, so far as they have been assigned according to rule, we must take notice. These exceptions relate, 1. To the admission of a certain item of evidence and the rejection of another. 2. To the power of the city councils to order the constrution of this sewer. To particularize: the complaint is, first: “That the learned judge below erred in admitting in evidence the report of the sub-committee of the board of surveyors of November 23d 1869, with the resolution annexed. That the learned judge below erred in refusing to admit in evidence the resolution of the city councils, instructing the chief commissioner of highways not to proceed with the sewer in question until the property owners along the line could be heard in opposition to the same.” We may premise the examination of the points thus set forth, by the statement that the main question in this case is one involving the power of the city councils to order the construction of the sewer for which the assessment in controversy was made. If they had such power, everything else appearing to be regular, the judgment of the court below was well rendered, and the defendants’ complaint is without merit and must be dismissed. As we said in the case of McKnight <em>v. </em>City of Pittsburgh, 10 Nor. 273, “It is indeed but a question of power; that being determined, all is determined.” Now, as under the Act of 1869, before the councils, by ordinance, could order the construction of the branch sewer in question, the approval of the board of surveys was necessary, it becomes important to inquire whether such approval is found in this case. The defendants contend that not only does no such approval appear, but that any prima facie presumption that might otherwise arise in favor of the validity of the ordinance, is rebutted by the fact that the contrary is made apparent by the records of the board of surveys. That in fact the recommendation of the board was for the building of a sewer from Locust to Spruce street, and not, as in the ordinance, from Locust to Manning street.</p>

Í am also clerk of the survey committee of city councils, and as such clerk drew the ordinance which was reported from that committee and passed by councils. I made the draft from the resolution of the sub<a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>committee of the board of surveyors.” This is the evidence to which exception has been taken, but to us there appears nothing in it exceptionable. Surely the report of the sub-committee, with its resolution appended, was part of the official records, and the accompanying minutes identify that report by the names of the persons who made it. If this he so, then we have all that is necessary to support the ordinance directing the construction of the sewer from Locust to the south side of Manning street. At the very most, however, nothing but obscurity can be charged against these minutes ; a doubt as to what was the character of the report to which they refer. But, surely, it was altogether proper to remove that obscurity and resolve that doubt by a witness who could produce and identify the original report. Certain it is, that the papers of a county commissioner’s or treasurer’s office, or even those constituting the records of a court, may be thus produced and identified, and there is no imaginable reason why those belonging to the board of surveys should not be subject to the same rule.</p>

The second assignment charges the court below with error in refusing to admit in evidence the resolution of the city councils instructing the chief commissioner of highways not to proceed with the construction of the work until the property owners could be heard in opposition to the same. But according to the case of Sower <em>v. </em>The City, 11 Ca. 231, a resolution of councils is but another name for an ordinance, which, in order to have the force of law, must be signed by the mayor, published and recorded. As, however, the paper offered in evidence was wanting in all these requirements, it was properly rejected.</p>

This provision of the act addresses itself to the judgment of the councils exclusively. Presumptively they acted for the public good, but if they did not, we cannot go back of their action and sit in judgment upon their motives, or search out the causes that moved them.</p>
    <p id="b351-8" data-blocks='[["BL_351.8",351,[798,2073,477,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
