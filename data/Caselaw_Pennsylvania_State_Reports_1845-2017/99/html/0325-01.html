The thing prohibited by the Act <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>is the accumulating of income beyond a certain term, not the donor’s free disposition of the income accumulated within a permitted term.

St. 102</a>, it was decided that so much of the will as directed that the accumulations of the estate of the testator, during the minority of his only child, upon her arrival at full age should form a part of his estate, and thereafter the income of the estate to be paid to said child during her life, was in conflict with the Act of April 18th 1853, and that <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>said accumulations, by virtue of the statute, vested in and were payable to the child' at her majority. The petition averred that when the <em>minor </em>should become of age she would be entitled to the whole of the accumulations, which the answer denied, and asserted that they did not belong to the minor, but to the remaindermen. TJpon this issue the cause was heard. As shown by the printed argument the counsel for the appellant declared at the outset that but one question of law was involved, namely, “ Did the court below rightly decide, that, in order to justify an accumulation under the Act of April 18th 1853, the income directed to be accumulated during a minority must he given to the minor upon his attaining Ms majority, otherwise the direction is an excess ?” Both the master and the court below elaborately considered the points now raised, and reviewed the English decisions under the Thelusson Act, and the American cases under similar statutes. Possibly the cause might have been decided the same way upon another point, hut it was not, for no other was considered by the court below or this court.</p>

The opinion in the Orphans’ Court was delivered by Justice Paxson, who was then one of the judges thereof, in which he said, “ It is difficult to see the wisdom of any act which requires, in a large estate, the accumulated income of a minor to be paid to him, in all cases, upon his arrival at full age. There are mauy instances where such a thing would be in jurious to him in the highest degree. The capitalization of the income, and the payment to him only of the interest after his majority, would often promote his best good. There would seem to be no reason of public policy demanding such a change in the right of disposing of property. And I desire to call the attention of the profession to the fact that our Act does not, as the Thelusson Act does, allow accumulation for the purpose of the payment debts, or to provide for raising portions for children.’ 8 Phil. R. 182. Time enough has elapsed for legislative correction, if the intendment of the statute has been misapprehended by the courts.
