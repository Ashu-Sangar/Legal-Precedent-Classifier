A railroad company authorized as aforesaid, obtained from the councils ot the city from which it was to construct its road a grant of a right of way along a river bank to a certain street. It formally accepted the grant,, constructed its road along the river bank to said street, and subsequently bought a lot upon said street on the opposite side of an avenue running along the river from that on which its tracks were constructed. The greater part of this lot it allowed to be used as a lumber yard. It fitted up, however, an old frame house standing thereon as a passenger station and erected a small slied for freight. Most of its freight business in the city was done elsewhere, and but a single track connected the shed with the main line. <em>Held, </em>that the power reposed in the railroad company to locate and establish a terminus had not been exhausted and that it was clearly competent for it subsequently to establish a terminus at another point within the city limits.</p>

In pursuance of this petition an ordinance was on December 21st 1877 passed by said councils, whereby they granted to said company a right of way “ along the bank of the Allegheny river or upon Kiver avenue, from the eastern terminus of the city to the east line of Sandusky street.” This ordinance was duly accepted by the company on December 31st 1877.</p>

The greater part of this lot was occupied by a board yard which the company has since allowed to remain there. Upon the residue of the lot stands an old frame building which the company fitted up for a passenger station and for offices. Near by they erected a small frame shed for freight. A single track connected this shed with defendant’s main line upon the opposite side of Kiver avenue, and it appeared that the greater part of the freight business was done elsewhere.

The company, immediately after its organization, commenced the work of construction, obtained from the city of Allegheny the right of way for a single or double track “ along the bank of the Allegheny river, or upon River avenue from the eastern terminus of the city to the east line of Sandusky streetand in less than two years had completed the greater part of its road outside the city limits. In August 1879, all its property, rights, franchises, &amp;c., were sold by the sheriff and duly conveyed to the purchasers, who associated themselves as the Pittsburgh and Western Railroad Company, by which name they were incorporated in October of that year. The new company, having thus succeeded to <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>all the property, rights and franchises of the Pittsburgh, New Castle and Lake Erie Railroad Company, took possession of the road and proceeded to complete the same.

On the other hand, it was contended that the western terminus of the road had never been definitely settled either by the original company or its successor; that it had always been the fixed purpose of both companies, while they respectively owned and controlled the road, to reach the western boundary of Allegheny city, as soon as the necessary consent thereto of the city councils could be obtained. After a careful consideration of the evidence bearing on this subject, the learned master found in favor of the appellee ; and in this we think he was clearly right. Without referring specially to the grounds on which his conclusions are based, it is sufficient to say that they are entirely satisfactory. The power to locate and establish the western terminus of the road in Allegheny city had not been exhausted by any act of appellant or its predecessor; and, by virtue of its charter and the ordinance of September 9th 3 880, granting the right of way to the appellees, it is clearly authorized to construct and operate its road along the banks of the Allegheny and Ohio rivers, or upon River avenue to the western boundary of the city, subject to the conditions and restrictions imposed by the ordinance last mentioned.</p>

This is a general law, manifestly intended to provide for a class of cases in which, before the adoption of our present constitution, special legislation was frequently invoked. As the natural result of the rapid development of our material resources and growth of population, especially in our larger cities, the public interest, convenience and safety from time to time require changes both in the location and construction of railroads. The legislature, recognizing these facts, authorized the proper authorities of the respective municipal districts mentioned in the act to enter into contracts for making such changes as in their judgment may be best- adapted to secure the safety of life and property, and at the same time promote the interest of the particular municipality. The Ordinance of September 1880, which was accepted by the appellee and forms a contract' between it and the city of Allegheny, is carefully drawn, and its provisions well guarded with the view of securing the several objects contemplated by the Act of 1874. If, in the judgment <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>of the city councils, the terms and conditions on which the right of way was granted, to the appellee were best calculated to secure the safety of life and property and promote the interest of the city, their right to make the contract cannot be questioned; and it is equally clear that the appellee was authorized to accept and carry out the provisions of the ordinance.</p>

      <em>Wo </em>think, therefore, that on either of the grounds stated and discussed at length by the master, the appellee has the necessary corporate authority to construct its road from the eastern to the western boundary of the city on the route specified in the ordinances granting the right of way.</p>

The validity of appellant’s title, and its right to hold and use the strip of land known as the canal lot for railroad ■ purposes cannot be doubted. It has been definitively settled, by an unbroken line of decisions, that the Commonwealth acquired an absolute estate in perpetuity in the land taken and occupied for canal purposes; and by virtue of the Act authorizing the sale of the main line of the public works and sundry mesne conveyances, that title, which for all practical purposes was a fee simple, became vested in the appellant company: Comm. <em>v. </em>McAllister, <a href="/watts/2/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Watts 190" data-case-ids="1840173" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0190-01">2 Watts 190</a>; Haldeman <em>v. </em>Penna.

By subsequent legislation the appellant was authorized to construct and maintain on the bed of the canal a railroad with branches, etc.</p>

If a crossing can be effected, either at grade or by means of a viaduct, without materially interfering writh appellant in the exercise and enjoyment of its franchise, the right to make such crossing, upon paying or securing the payment of adequate compensation, cannot be doubted. As yet, appellant has not constructed a branch road at the point of the proposed crossing, but it is no doubt practicable to do so; and it is averred in the bill that in the judgment of its board of directors the time has come when a track should be built from low-water mark on the Allegheny river to the Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne and Chicago Railway, by means whereof the company will have an <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>outlet for its traffic to and from the river, as the Commonwealth had, when the canal was in operation. Assuming then that a transfer track will forthwith be constructed on the canal lot from the Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne &amp; Chicago Railway to low-water mark on the river, will the proposed crossing, by a viaduct at least twenty-one feet in the clear above low-water mark, supported by abutments located entirely outside the lines of appellant’s lot, materially interfere with the use and enjoyment of such transfer 'branch? The decided weight of the testimony is that it will not; and the finding of the master, concurred in by the court, is to the same effect. The decree is accordingly so framed that the appellee, in constructing its bridge across the lot in question, is required to place the same “ at such an elevation as to leave at least twenty-one clear feet between the lowest part of said bridge and the datum line of the city of Allegheny.” The decree further provides “that said bridge shall rest on abutments entirely astride of the lines of plaintiff’s property, and shall not be supported by any pier or other support resting on plaintiff’s land ; that defendant’s road and the whole width of ground taken at the crossing of plaintiff’s land shall not exceed twenty-four feet, and the length thereof shall be the width of plaintiff’s land, which is sixty-two feet, more or less.” And, in view of the future practicability or necessity for the appellant company to cross appellee’s road at grade, the court has also very properly secured to it that privilege, coupled with the right to make application to the court for a decree defining the terms and conditions upon which such grade crossing shall be constructed and maintained.</p>
