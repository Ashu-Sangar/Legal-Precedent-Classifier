    <p id="b126-6" data-blocks='[["BL_126.8",126,[300,833,1172,1153]]]'>The cause of action in this case is an alleged contract of apprenticeship. The plaintiff is the minor, and the defendant corporation, is claimed to be the master. The affidavit of claim sets forth an article of agreement, dated May 1st 1876, by which the plaintiff .claims to have bound himself <em>as an apprentice </em>to the defendant “ for the purpose of learning the machinist trade,” for the term of three years from the date of the agreement, and annexes a copy of the agreement; and further avers that the plaintiff entered the service of the defendant <em>as an ap</em>prentice, and continued therein for some time, when he was discharged without cause, and claims ten thousand dollars damages for breach of the agreement by the defendant'. The narr. counts upon a contract in'writing, “ that the plaintiff should be employed as an apprentice to the said defendant, and as such apprentice to be taught the art and trade of machinist in their shops at Dennison,” rendering good and faithful service “in consideration of his being taught and permitted to learn the art and mystery of said trade.” Throughout the entire narr. the contract is described exclusively as a contract of apprenticeship, and the breach alleged is a refusal “ to allow the plaintiff to continue longer to work as an apprentice,” and “ to complete and finish said apprenticeship,” thereby “ preventing plaintiff from acquiring and learning said trade of machinist.” He claims ten thousand nine hundred dollars damages as the reasonable value of the trade as machinist, of which he was deprived and of the sum he might have made had he been permitted to learn the said trade according to the agreement.</p>

These offers, also, were rejected, and the action of the court in refusing <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>them constitutes the subject-matter of the several assignments of error.</p>
    <p id="b127-4" data-blocks='[["BL_127.5",127,[172,499,1156,639]]]'>We are clearly of opinion that the learned judge of the court below was right in refusing to receive the testimony offered. The contract of apprenticeship is special and peculiar. Being made by a minor with an employer, who is sui juris, it is in this state regulated by statute, so as to make it obligatory. In order to produce this result the statutory requirements must be complied with. These are to be found in our Act of 29th September 1770, Purd. Dig. p. 72, pl. 4. The characteristics of the engagement are thus indicated by the statute : “ All and every person, or persons, that shall be bound by indenture to serve as an apprentice in any art, mystery, occupation or labor, with the assent of his or her parent, guardian or next friend, although such persons, or any of them, were, or shall be, within the age of twenty-one years at the time of making their several indentures, shall be bound to serve the time,” &amp;c.</p>
    <p id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.6",127,[172,1137,1156,674]]]'>There must be a binding by indenture, the service must be that of an apprentice, and in some art, mystery, occupation or labor; and the contract must have the assent of a parent, guardian or next friend, or, by another act, of two or more magistrates when the contract is made by overseers of the poor. All these features are essential to the creation of a valid contract of apprenticeship. Thus, in Respublica <em>v. </em>Keppele, <a href="/us/2/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Dall. 197" data-case-ids="11741479" data-case-paths="/us/2/0197-01">2 Dall. 197</a>, it was held that an indenture “to serve ” only, and not to learn any trade, occupation or labor was not valid, either at common law or under any statute. In Guthrie <em>v. </em>Murphy, <a href="/watts/4/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Watts 80" data-case-ids="1842739" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0080-01">4 Watts 80</a>, it was held that an indenture executed without the consent of the minor’s guardian was void, and no action could be sustained upon it, even for necessaries furnished by the master to the minor who had left his service before the term expired. To the same effect is Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Vanlear, 1 S. &amp; R. 248.</p>
    <p id="b127-6" data-blocks='[["BL_127.7",127,[173,1821,1156,470]]]'>The contract itself must be an indenture, and this has been held, both in England and in this state, to import an obligation under seal. In Iieeves’ Domestic Delations 484, the doctrine is thus stated : “ Apprentices are persons bound to a master to learn some art or trade. . . . An apprentice to be holden must be bound by deed. ... It would seem that an apprenticeship by parol, so far as it lays any obligation on the contracting parties, is utterly void. It will not amount to a hiring by the year, which may be by parol: 8 T. R. 374. That an apprentice cannot be bound, unless retained as such in a deed, is ascertained by the doctrine of the books. ■</p>

    <p id="b128-5" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[303,623,1163,1237]]]'>In the case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Wilbank, 10 S. &amp; R. 416, the very point was before this court, and it was held that although the contract was in writing and signed by both parties, yet as it was without seal, it was invalid as an indenture of apprenticeship. On p. 417 the court say: “ On inspecting the writing, which is called an indenture, it appears to be subscribed by the parties, but not under seal. This is the only objection, so that the single question is, whether there can be <em>a binding, </em>by writing without seal, under the act of 29th Septembef 1770. ... I will not say that the word indenture in its largest sense might not comprehend a writing indented though not under seal. But certain it is, that when an indenture is' spoken of, and particularly an indenture of apprenticeship, an instrument under seal is generally understood. It was said by Holt, O. J., in the case of the Queen <em>v. </em>Callingwood, 2 Ld. Raym. 1117, that an apprentice cannot be bound without deed. And the law is so laid down in Burn. Inst, title Apprentice p. 37, and 1 Salk. 68. It might be fairly inferred, therefore, that our Act of Assembly required a deed, from the sense in which the word <em>indenture </em>was usually taken. But we are not left without explanation from other parts of the Act, in which the <em>covenants, </em>both of the master and the apprentice, are several times spoken of, which could not be without deed. The binding of apprentices is a matter of importance, and the forms prescribed by law should be preserved, as they give solemnity to the transaction. It is the opinion of the court, that a writing without seal, is not an indenture within the meaning of the Act of Assembly. This being the case, the writing now produced is not a valid indenture.”</p>

F. Phelps, Apprentice,” and “ Susan Phelps.” To neither of these signatures is any seal appended. There is no execution by the defendant in any manner whatever. Neither the corporate seal, nor its name, is appended, nor that of any officer or person in its behalf. The paper itself is produced by the plaintiff, and it does not appear that any copy of it was ever in the possession of the defendant. On its face it only purports to be a declaration by the plaintiff that he agrees to bind himself to serve the defendant as an apprentice for the purpose of learning the machinist trade, upon certain terms as to payment. There are no covenants or stipulations of any kind on the part of the defendant. We are <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>clearly of opinion that in no point of view can this paper bo sustained as a contract of apprenticeship, either under the Pennsylvania statute or at common law.</p>
