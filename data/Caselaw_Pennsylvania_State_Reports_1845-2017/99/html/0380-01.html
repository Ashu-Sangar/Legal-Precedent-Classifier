An affidavit filed by the plaintiff in a cause setting out that “defendants fraudulently contracted the debt and incurred the obligation for which this claim is begun,” to which is appended a statement of account containing no further specification of the goods in question than “ merchandise” and “ goods returned,” is insufficient to warrant the issuing of a writ of attachment under the provisions of the Act of March 17th 1869, Pamph.

It is only where the attachment was properly issued in the first instance, that the suit goes on, after appearance and dissolution of the attachment, as though commenced by a summons. In any case, the depositions were insufficient to support the attachment, and the dissolving of the attachment was proper. Mere insolvency of the buyer, though known to himself, is not a fraud: the goods must have been obtained by artifice, trick or false pretence: Rodman <em>v. </em>Thalheimer, 25 P. E. Smith 232; Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 Harris, 367. Even if the writ should not have been quashed, the attachment should not be reinstated by reversing the order, but the order should be modified.</p>

    <p id="b396-6" data-blocks='[["BL_396.8",396,[315,1069,1173,598]]]'>The learned judge committed no error in dissolving the attachment. . The affidavit is defective. It does not set forth specifically, the fraudulent acts of the defendant: nor is it made in the words of the statute. It does not sufficiently describe the kind of property, and is wholly silent as to the time the merchandise was purchased. The evidence did not establish that possession of the goods was obtained by artifice or false pretences, indicating an intention to defraud the vendors. Mere insolvency and knowledge of it by the vendees do not establish fraud in the purchase: Rodman <em>v. </em>Thalheimer, 25 P. F. Smith 232, and cases there cited. It was error, however, to quash the writ. There had been a personal service on the defendant. While the property was justly released, yet the suit goes on: Sharpless <em>v. </em>Ziegler, 11 Norris 467.</p>
