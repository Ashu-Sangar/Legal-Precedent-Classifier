Her confidence and assurance that such would be the effect of giving the mortgage were derived from the two persons who acted as a committee from the bank. To such an extent did Hall assume power and authority to stipulate in regard to all the conditions on which she should give a mortgage that it was given to him.

Was or was not it understood by both parties to the mortgage that a part of the consideration was that the criminal proceedings should be stopped <em>% </em>If it was, it matters not whether they were stopped or prosecuted to judgment. The agreement itself vitiated the mortgage as it rested on an illegal consideration.</p>

We discover no error in the third assignment; nor, under the evidence, do we see error in refusing to affirm the point covered by the fourth assignment. The fifth and sixth assignments are sustained, and the second so far as the error therein alleged is in conflict with this opinion.</p>
