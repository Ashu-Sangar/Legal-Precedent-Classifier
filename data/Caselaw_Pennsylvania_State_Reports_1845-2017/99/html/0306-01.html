That the grand jury made a special presentment to the quarter sessions of the said wooden buildings as common nuisances, dangerous to life and property, whereupon the judge then holding said court, ordered the defendant, as mayor, to abate said nuisance by tearing down and removing said buildings, if the owners thereof, after forty-eight hours’ notice, failed so to do; and the plaintiff, having failed to remove the building in question after notice, the defendant caused the same to be torn down, doing as little damage as he reasonably could, &amp;c.</p>

The ordinance gave no one the summary right to tear it down, and no common law right to abate it accrued. If it were so occupied as to become a public nuisance the statute law provides a remedy by indictment; the presentment of the grand jury was a foundation for such indictment, but was no justification for its summary destruction; nor was the extrajudicial order of the judge of the Quarter Sessions to the mayor. No individual has the right to abate a purely public nuisance, i. e., one that does not damage one individual of the community more than another. In such case the fact that the defendant was mayor of the city is no justification. Every man proceeds to abate any nuisance at his peril; if he misjudges, he is answerable in damages. There may be circumstances which do not admit of the delay involved in an appeal to the law for redress, as in case of an existing conflagration ; bxxt this was not such a case. Redress by indictment, under the Crimes Act (Purd. Dig. 336, pi. 108), or by an application for a mandatory injunction to remove the building, under the Inspection of buildings Act of May 7th 1855 (Pamph. L. 464), could have been had without more delay than actually oecuiTed after the presentment of the grand jury.

The plea, inter alia, avers that the houses mentioned in the declaration and for the removal of wdiich this action was brought were composed wholly of highly inflammable and combustible materials, and were insufficiently provided with chimneys and the usual and ordinary appliances for protection against fire, and were so used constantly, night and day, by drunken and disorderly persons, that the lives, health, and property of citizens were greatly endangered and the public safety imperilled. The question whether they were a public nuisance was fairly submitted to the jury by the learned judge below, and the verdict of the jury in favor of the defendant established that fact. Had the presentment by the grand jury been followed up by an indictment, trial and conviction of the plaintiff below, the judgment thereon would have been that the nuisance should be abated, and would have been a conclusive justification of the action of the defendant. The defendant was the mayor of the city, and charged with the conservation of the peace and the protection of the property of the city. He was the representative of the city. It is true that a wooden building, though erected contrary to law, is not per se a public nuisance. But it may become such by the manner in which it is used or allowed to be used. It is true that a private person not specially aggrieved cannot abate a public nuisance, and especially where a statute provides a remedy for an offence created by it, that must be followed. It is well settled, however, that a private person, if specially aggrieved by a public nuisance, may abate it. In Rung <em>v. </em>Shoneberger, <a href="/watts/2/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Watts 23" data-case-ids="1840039" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0023-01">2 Watts 23</a>, it was held by this court that the erection of a building upon the public square of a town was a public and not a private offence, and may be abated by any one aggrieved. In that case the buildings were removed by officers of the town by virtue of the authority of the town council, and the persons in possession, and who had erected the buildings, had recovered in an action of trespass. The judgment, however, was reversed, Mr. Justice Eogers saying, “ A nuisance, whether public or private, may be abated by the party aggrieved, so that it is ’done peaceably and without a <em>riot. </em>The reason (says Blackstone, 3 Coni. 5) why the law allows this private and summary method of doing justice, is because injuries which obstruct or arrest such things as are of daily convenience and use, require an immediate remedy, and cannot wait for the slow progress of the ord inary forms of justice.” The jury, under the charge of the learned judge, has found these buildings to be of that character. <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>The city of Philadelphia was the owner of large and valuable property in their neighborhood. Any hour of the daty or night they were in danger of being set on fire by those who frequented them with the owner’s permission. It is stated as a fact in the special plea, and of course a fact admitted by the agreement, that the public safety was imperilled. Nothing more was necessary to justify the action of the defendant. If the owner or tenant of a powder magazine should madly or wickedly insist upon smoking a cigar on the premises, can anyone doubt that a policeman or even a neighbor could justify in trespass for forcibly ejecting him and his cigar from his own premises? It is true, that a private person assuming to abate a public nuisance takes upon himself the responsibility of proving to the satisfaction of a jury, the fact of nuisance. The official position of the defendant, as mayor of Philadelphia, did not relieve him from his personal responsibility in this respect. Rut he has been sustained by the verdict of the jury, which is a justification of his alleged' trespass. We are of opinion that this case was properly submitted to the determination of the jury, that there was nothing in the charge calculated to mislead them, and that it would have been manifest error if the learned judge had affirmed the plaintiff’s point, and thereby in effect instructed the jury to find a verdict in his favor.</p>
