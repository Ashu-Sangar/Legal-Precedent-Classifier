This intention was, that the maker should have the use of his brother’s money, without interest, until demand for payment, the due-bill being “ a continuing soenrity, so that on the one side, the maker is not deemed in default until the money is actually demanded, while on the other, the holder may make demand when he pleases, and is not chargeable with neglect if he does not make it within any particular timo:” Merritt <em>v. </em>Todd, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20N.Y.%2028" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="23 N.Y. 28">23 N.

A due-bill “payable on demand,” is not payable until demand ; and, as interest is payable only from the time the principal ought to have been paid, such a due-bill does not bear interest until demand made: Bi’eyfogle <em>v. </em>Bookley, 16 8. <em>&amp; </em>11. 264; llayne <em>v. </em>Guthrie, Add. 137; ergo, until demand made, no cause of action arises, and the statute does not run. It is the remedy, not the debt, that the statute regulates : Marsteller <em>v. </em>Marsteller, 8 IV. N. C. 555. The authorities cited on the other side relate to commercial paper, except Laforge <em>v. </em>Jayne, 9 Barr 410, which was overruled in principle in Girard Bank <em>v. </em>Bank of Penn Township, 3 Wr. 92, and expressly ovemzled in Finkbone’s Appeal, 5 Norris 369. There are many reasons why in the case of a negotiable instrument made payable on demand the statute z’uns from its date, — among others, the necessity for some certain time at which to charge indorsers, — but where the contracting parities are alone to be affected, a contract to pay on demand is not converted by technical rales of law into one to pay immediately. Even in the case of negotiable paper payable on demand the authorities are not uniform that the statute runs from the date. The following cases are to a contrary effect: Brooks <em>v. </em>Mit<a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>chell, 9 Mees. <em>&amp; </em>Weis. 15; Merritt <em>v. </em>Todd, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20N.Y.%2028" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="28 N.Y. 28">28 N.

    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.8",438,[287,612,1183,1576]]]'>At what time is a due-bill payable on demand barred by the statute of limitations? Does the statute begin to run at its date, or not until payment is demanded ? It is a well-recognised rule of law, that the statute begins to run on a promissory note, whether negotiable or not, whenever a cause of action accrues thereon : that is, from the time the holder has a right to demand the thing claimed: Bucklin <em>v. </em>Ford, <a href="/barb/5/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Barb. 393" data-case-ids="5778908" data-case-paths="/barb/5/0393-01">5 Barb. 393</a>; 2 Parsons on Notes &amp; Bills 641-2. The words “on demand” in a note do not make the demand a condition precedent to a right of action.; but import the debt is due and demandable immediately, or at least that the commencement of a suit therefor is a sufficient demand: Byles on Bills *342; Taylor’s Adm’rs <em>v. </em>Witman’s Adm’rs, <a href="/grant/3/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Grant 138" data-case-ids="229118" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0138-01">3 Grant 138</a>; Milne’s Appeal, decided at the- present term (post, p. 483). A promise in writing to pay a note “ at any time within six years from this date” was held a promise to pay on demand, and the statute ran from its date: Young <em>v. </em>Weston, <a href="/me/39/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="39 Me. 492" data-case-ids="8847272" data-case-paths="/me/39/0492-01">39 Maine 492</a>. The attempt was made on the argument to subject this due-bill- to the rule applicable in case of a promise to return specific property or securities on demand, as in Finkbone’s Appeal, 5 Norris 368; and of a deposit in bank as in The Girard Bank <em>v. </em>The Bank of Penn Township, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%2092" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="3 Wright 92">3 Wright 92</a>. The due-bill now in question does not admit the application of that rule. It reads “due William Andress, four hundred dollars, payable on demand.” It was signed by the appellant’s testator, and dated August 1st 1867. The maker died on the 16th May 1879. Thus he lived nearly twelve years after the statute began to run against the claim. The payee died in November 1870, and letters of administration on his estate were granted on the 18th January 1871. So there was a party to sue, as well as one to be sued. As, then, the due-bill was barred by the statute long before the maker thereof died, the appellants did not take nor hold any of the assets of his estate in trust for its payment. There was no evidence of any promise to pay other than that contained in the due-bill, nor of any demand for payment until it was presented at the audit, March 8th 1881. The statute of limitations was then interposed, and the learned judge erred in not disallowing the claim.</p>
