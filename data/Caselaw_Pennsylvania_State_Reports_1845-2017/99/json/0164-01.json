        "text": "Mr. Justice Paxson\ndelivered the opinion of the court, November 17th 1881.\nIt appears, from the case stated, that when the plaintiff was first elected chief commissioner of highways for the city of Philadelphia, the salary of the office was $4,000 per annum. Subsequently, and during his first term of said office, the salary was reduced to $3,600. This reduction was acquiesced in by the plaintiff, no one doubting the power of councils to make it. During his second term councils increased his salary to $4,500, which increase the city declined to pay, and it forms the subject of this contention.\nThe court below held that the plaintiff was a public officer within the meaning of section 13 of article III. of the Constitution, which declares that, \u201cNo law shall extend the term of any public officer, or increase or diminish his salary, or emoluments, after his election or appointment.\u201d\nWe need not discuss the question whether the plaintiff is a public officer, as it is not necessarily involved in the case. The error into which the learned judge below inadvertently fell was in applying the above section of the constitution to this case. The language of that instrument is: \u201c No law shall . . . increase or diminish his salary,\u201d &c. The word \u201claw\u201d has a fixed and definite meaning. In its general sense it imports \u201c a rule of action \u201d ; in the particular sense in which we are now considering it, it means, \u201c a rule of civil conduct, prescribed by the supreme power in the state, commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong.\u201d Blackstone. A law is an emanation from the supreme power, and cannot originate elsewhere. It is a rule which every citizen of the state is bound to obey.\nThe ordinance of councils by which the plaintiff\u2019s salary was increased is not a law, and therefore does not come within the constitutional prohibition. It is a mere local regulation for the city of Philadelphia. It has perhaps the force of law in the community to be affected by it, but it is not prescribed by the supreme power, it concerns only a subdivision of the state, and does not rise to the dignity of a law.\nThere is no ambiguity in this section of the Constitution. It is clear and explicit. But when we consider it in connection with the other portions of the 3rd article, there is no room for doubt. It is the article upon \u201c Legislation,\u201d and is very elaborate. It contains thirty-three sections, and is throughout a restraint upon the powers of the general assembly. iHmposes numerous restrictions upon the mode by which\u2019 laws shall be passed, and prohibits legislation upon a large variety of subjects. When, therefore, section 13 declares that \u201c no law' shall extend the term of any public officer, or increase or diminish his salary or emoluments, after his election or appointment,\u201d the obvious meaning is that the General Assembly shall not pass such a law. There is nothing in the article, even by implication, that would justify us in extending the word \u201c law \u2019\u2019 to the ordinances of a city. Such an interpretation would not be expounding the constitution ; it would be altering it.\nThe judgment is reversed and judgment is now entered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $875.",

    "head_matter": "Baldwin versus City of Philadelphia.\n1. A municipal ordinance is not a \u201c law \u201d within the meaning of article III. section 13 of the constitution of Pennsylvania. Hence, the councils of a city may by the passage of such ordinance increase the salary of a municipal officer during his term of office.\n2. Whether the chief commissioner of highways for the city of Philadelphia is a \u201cpublic officer\u201d within the meaning of said section of the constitution, not decided.\nNovember 12, 1881.\nBefore Shaeswood, O. J., Merotjr, Paxson, Thunkky and Steeeett, JJ. Gordon and Greek, JJ., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas No 3 of Philadelphia County : Of July Term 1881, No. 33, Eastern District.\nAmicable action in debt, by William Baldwin against the City of Philadelphia to recover a sum alleged to be due plaintiff for salary as chief commissioner of highways for said city.\nThe following case stated was submitted to the court:\u2014\n\u201c By an ordinance of the councils of the City of Philadelphia, approved December 23d 1874, the Department of Highways, Bridges and Sewers for the city of Philadelphia was constituted, consisting of a chief commissioner and six assistants. The former at a salary of four thousand dollars per annum, and the latter each two thousand dollars per annum. The chief to be elected by viva voce vote of councils in joint convention, to serve for two years, and with power to appoint his assistants, whose duty was to superintend all work done on the bridges, culverts, sewers and highways in the city of Philadelphia, and enforce all ordinances relating to said department.\n\u201c By an ordinance of said councils, approved the twelfth day of December 1876, it was provided that \u2018the chief commissioner of highways shall hereafter be elected for the term of three years.\u2019 On January 1st 1877, the plaintiff was elected by city councils aforesaid, in joint convention, chief commissioner of the highways for three years from that date, and reelected in like manner on December 30th 1879, for three years. By an ordinance of said councils, approved the nineteenth day of December, 1877, making an appropriation for 1878, to said department, item one provides, inter alia: \u2018 For salaries of the officers of said department: chief commissioner, three thousand six hundred dollars.\u2019 The plaintiff\u2019s salary was thus reduced during his term of office; and for the year 1878, and thereafter he received but thirty-six hundred dollars per annum. By ordinance\u201d approved the thirty first day of December 1880, making an appropriation to the department of highways, it was provided, inter alia, in item one as follows: \u2018 For salaries of officers of the department: chief commissioner, forty-five hundred dollars.\u2019 The plaintiff\u2019s: salary was thus increased during his term of service as chief commissioner of highways. It is admitted that if the increase made by the above ordinance was lawful, that then the sum of three hundred and seventy-five dollars was, and is due and owing by defendant to plaintiff as his salary for the month of January 1881, and that the city has refused to pay the same.\n\u201c It is agreed, that if the court shall be of opinion upon the-facts of this case that the plaintiff is not a public officer within the meaning of article III. section 18 of the Constitution of the state of Pennsylvania, so that his salary could be lawfully increased during the period for which he was elected, that then judgment shall be entered for plaintiff in the sum of $375, and if the court shall be of opinion that he is a public officer, and that his salary could not lawfully be increased as aforesaid, that the judgment shall be entered for plaintiff in the sum of 300.\u201d\nThe court entered judgment for the plaintiff, Baldwin, in the sum of $300.\nA similar case was submitted to the court, wherein William Dixey, the commissioner of the city property, was plaintiff and City of Philadelphia defendant.\nLudlow, P. J., filed the following opinion:\u2014\n\u201c Two cases have been submitted to the court, both of which involve the consideration of the same question, and both will be decided in the present opinion.\n\u201c The plaintiffs are officers of the City of Philadelphia: one is \u2018 The Commissioner of Highways/ and the other \u2018 The Commissioner of the City Property.\u2019 Both have been elected by councils, are paid by virtue of ordinances legally adopted, both are serving for the terms designated by law, both receive moneys belonging to the municipality, and both, pending their respective terms of office, have, by virtue of the action of councils, been authorized to receive additional remuneration.\n\u201c Does the constitution of the Commonwealth prohibit this increase of salary ?\n\u201c That is the question now to be determined. By article III., \u00a7 13, of the Constitution, it is provided that \u201cno law shall extend the term of any public officer, or increase or diminish his salary, or emoluments, after his election or appointment.\u2019\n\u201c It is manifest that the decision of these cases turns upon the true meaning of the words \u00a3 public officer \u2019 in the constitutional provision.\n\u201c It is to be observed that \u201c The City of Philadelphia \u2019 is a municipal, and therefore a public and not a private corporation, and it exists by virtue of the sovereign authority of the Commonwealth. Th\u00a9 corporate authority of the city was created for the benefit of the people, and the duties of its legislature, and of all its officers, are in one sense public duties.\n\u201c The great departments of the government, such as its \u2018 Police\u2019 and \u2018Fire Departments/ \u2018Commissioner of Highways/ of \u2018 City Property/ and the like, exist for a public purpose, and wherever money is to be collected, it is to be used, not for pxivate gain or emolument, but for a pxxblic use.\n\u201c It does not necessarily follow that every person engaged in the service of the city, no matter how humble the employment may be, is a public officer, but it is, we think, very plain, that if the functions performed by an employ\u00e9 are of a public character; if he handles the public money, or performs public duties for the municipality, he is public officer.\n\u201c Indeed, upon this distinction rests the principle now settled, that the city is not liable for many acts of her police officers, firemen, surveyors, &c. See Elliot v. City, 7 Phila. Rep. 128; Freeman v. The City, 36 Legal Intell. 148 ; Rosenberry v. City, 7 W. N. C. 558.\n\u201c It may be admitted to be the law, that in the \u2018 usurpation of a municipal or corporate office, no franchise or liberty of the Commonwealth is invaded or withheld,\u2019 as was decided in Commonwealth v. Burrell, 7 Barr 37, and that \u2018 a quo warranto directed to one holding the office of mayor of a municipal corporation may be prosecuted by a private relatorCommonwealth <o. Jones, 12 Penna. St. 367. l)oes it, therefore, follow that such officers as the mayor, city solicitor and receiver of taxes, are not public officers ? True, as was said in Kilgore v. Magee, 4 Norris 411, \u2018this act (respecting the treasurer of Pittsburgh) concerns a municipality \u2014 a division of the -state for governmental purposes \u2014 and falls within the power of repeal and revision ;\u2019 but that decision did not determine the question now before us, and only re-affinned in substance the old doctrine that the creature is not greater than the creator-, and is therefore the subject of legislative will.\nIt seems to us that our appellate tribunal, in Commonwealth v. Evans, 24 P. F. Smith 139, after declaring that it is a difficult matter to distinguish betweeix a public officer and a person employed by the goveruxnent to perfox\u2019rn some special service by contract, announced the doctrine when it declared, \u2018We are of the opinion that all persons who by authority of law are entrusted with the X\u2019eceipt of public moxxeys, through whose hands money due to the public, or belonging to it, passes on its way to the public treasury, must be so considered, by whatever name or title they may be designated in the law authorizing their appointment, and whether the sex-vice be special or general, transient or pennaxxent.\u2019 Commonwealth v. Evans, it may be ax-gned, was a case which involved the liability of a sjxecial agent appointed by the governor; but, ixx principle what distinction can be made between that case and the present % The municipality is a public corporation, the moneys paid to it are xnoxxeys 2>aid for public purposes to \u2018a division of the state for governmental purposes,\u2019 and to officers who ax-e appointed to x-eceive it. All is done under the authority of law, and the money collected is designed to go into the pxiblic treasury.\nIf the Legislature of the Commonwealth and her executive cannot by any legal device inflict upon the state officers, who shall be quasi private officers, can it be possible that the creature of the sovereign power, to wit, the municipality, may create officers, who, while handling the princely revenues of the first city in the Commonwealth, shall escape, upon the merest of technical constructions, the commands of the Constitution ?\n\u201c One other thought as to the construction to be placed upon the constitutional provision before we close this opinion.\n\u201c In Heydon\u2019s Case, 3 Rep. 18, the judges resolved, \u201c that the true way to arrive at a sound construction of a doubtful statute is to consider the old law, the mischief, the remedy, and the true reason of the remedy.\u2019 This principle has received the sanction of our highest tribunal (see Commonwealth v. Burrell, supra), and it is therefore our duty, in looking at a constitutional provision, to apply it.\n\u201cThe old organic law unfortunately neglected, in most instances, to guard the public treasury. The mischief was apparent, and the remedy applied had to be stringent. It is needless to refer to the reason, for that is so clear that it requires no comment. The old law was the former constitution, and the language of such an instrument, as well as the new one, is not to receive a technical construction, like a statute, but is to bo read and construed according to the natural and usual meaning of the words used. When we declare that the salaries of \u2018the Commissioner of Highways,\u2019 and \u2018the Commissioner of City Property,\u2019 cannot be \u2018increased or diminished,\u2019 after their election, and during the current terms, we only give a natural interpretation to the language of the constitution, which makes this provision applicable to \u2018 public officers.\u2019\n\u201c As the officers whose cases are now before us would receive but a reasonable and fair salary under the ordinances of councils, we regret in these particular cases the conclusion at which we have arrived, but we have but one duty to perform, and that is to enforce the sovereign will of the people, as embodied in the Constitution of the Commonwealth.\u2019\nThe plaintiff took this writ of error, assigning for error the entry of judgment on the case stated for $300, instead of for $375 ; and the decision of the court that the plaintiff was a public officer within the meaning of article III., \u00a7 13, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and that his salary as such could not be lawfully increased during the period for which he was elected.\nGeorge B. Graham, for the plaintiff in error. \u2014\n\u201c Public officers,\u201d within the meaning of the constitution, are officers of' the state, appointed by the governor or elected by the people of the state: Commonwealth v. Burrell, 7 Barr 37; Commonwealth v. Jones, 2 Jones 367; People v. Devlin, 33 N. Y. 269 ; Conner v. The Mayor, 1 Sold. 285; Evans v. Commonwealth, 24 P. F. S. 124. The plaintiff is not such an officer, but is only the servant of a municipal corporation appointed by the city councils.\nThe words of the constitution, \u201c no law shall be passed,\u201d occurring as they do in an article on its face designed to direct and control the legislation of the state, and denominated \u201c legislation,\u201d do not apply to an ordinance of council. An ordinance of council is not a law, and cannot, therefore, be within its meaning. The first section of this article, by its reference to \u201c either house,\u201d shows the relation of the whole article to the Legislature of the Commonwealth. The 13th section of this article is no more applicable to councils than is the 1st. Justice Gordon, in the case of Kailroad v. Ervin, 7 W. N. C. 73, says that a \u201c law emanates from the supreme power. An ordinance is bnt a mere police regulation enforceable by lino or penalty.\u201d The councils of Philadelphia cannot pass a law; hence the ordinance increasing the plaintiff\u2019s salary, not being a law, is not within the meaning of the article in question.\nCharles li. McMichael and William Nelson West, city solicitor, for the defendant in error. \u2014\nThe language of the constitution is to be construed in a broad and popular rather than in a legal or technical sense, and when it declares \u201c no law shall extend the term of any public officer,\u201d etc., the court is not warranted in confining the term \u201claw\u201d to a general Act of Assembly, or the term \u201c public officer \u201d to an officer elected by the people of the entire state. The term \u201claw\u201d in its broad sense includes an ordinance of councils, which is a law to the citizens of the municipality; and if the functions of a city official are of a public character, if he handles public moneys for the municipality and has charge of highways (which are public to all citizens of the state), he is a public officer in the constitutional sense: Donohugli\u2019s Appeal, 5 W. N. C. 196 ; Alcorn v. City of Philadelphia, 8 Wright 352 ; Dean v. New Milford Twp., 5 W. & S. 545 ; Erie City v. Schwingle, 10 Harris 384; Freeman v. City of Philadelphia, 7 W. N.
