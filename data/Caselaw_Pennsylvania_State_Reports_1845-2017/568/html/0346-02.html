Thus, appellant contends that the trial court erred in: (1) prohibiting him from presenting evidence of other crimes committed by his co-conspirators (Argument II); and (2) allowing his co-defendant to present testimony of a witness which identified appellant as the shooter after ruling that the Commonwealth could not present the same evidence (Argument III). Appellant argues that these claims were not previously litigated on direct appeal because, there, he argued that these trial court errors were only examples of how he was prejudiced by a joint trial with co-defendant Bruce Reese, rather than as separate, standalone claims of trial court error. Appellant’s distinction is immaterial for previous litigation purposes. The relevant point is that, on direct appeal, this Court addressed the propriety of those evidentiary rulings in our determination that the trial court did not err in denying appellant’s motion for severance. <em>Lambert, </em><a href="/pa/529/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="529 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1831156" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0320-01">603 A.2d at 574</a> (holding that, even in separate trial, other crimes evidence would not have been admissible and identification testimony would have been admissible). Moreover, that discussion was not meré <em>dicta </em>but was necessary to the ruling on the severance claim. We could not grant relief to appellant on his present claims without disavowing the previous ruling. Because the merits of these claims were decided by the Court on direct appeal, they have been previously litigated and are not cognizable under the PCRA. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(3); <em>Commonwealth v.

As to that first claim, which alleges a <em>Brady </em>violation, appellant asserts that, although the alleged "true extent” of Jackson’s plea arrangement with the Commonwealth was unavailable to counsel at trial, it was available at the post-verdict and appeal stages. Brief for Appellant at 16. This is undoubtedly so. The factual basis for appellant's allegation that there was more to Jackson’s arrangement than had been disclosed is a June 18, 1984 guilty plea and sentencing proceeding pertaining 1o Jackson's eight open robbery cases, where the prosecutor detailed Jackson’s cooperation in this and other cases and recommended a favorable plea and sentence. Appellant alleges that this proceeding proves that there musí have been an agreement at the time of trial that encompassed the open robberies. The June 18 proceeding occurred two months after trial here, while post-verdict motions in this case were pending until May 5, 1986, wüh appellant’s last set of motions being filed in March of 1986. <em>See </em>Opinion, Geisz, J., 2/9/87, at 4-5. Furthermore, trial counsel actually interviewed Jackson, at Jackson's request, during the pendency of post-verdict motions. That interview served as the basis for an after-discovered evidence claim that was rejected by this Court on direct appeal. <em>See Lambert, </em><a href="/pa/529/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="529 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1831156" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0320-01">603 A.2d at 572, 579-80</a>.

Appellant argues for the first time in this appeal that he was denied the right to testify at the guilt phase (part of Argument XII; his argument concerning the penalty phase was raised below); that trial counsel abandoned him by failing to present an opening argument during the penalty phase (Argument XVII); that the trial court erred in failing to ho(d a hearing to determine his competency to waive his right to present mitigating evidence (part of Argument XIX); and that the cumulative effect of the errors entitles him to relief (Argument XX). Appellant also alleges for the first time in this appeal that trial counsel "abandoned” him at trial by making personal attacks on witnesses, the prosecutor and ihe trial judge and by engaging in other unprofessional conduct (Argument XI); and by failing to present mitigation evidence or a closing argument during the penalty phase (Argument XVII).

In rejecting the layered, boilerplate claims of appellate counsel ineffectiveness presented in <em>Marrero, </em>this Court looked to the underlying claims of counsel ineffectiveness, which it deemed meritless. That is an available and appropriate, but not. a required or exclusive, approach to claims of ineffectiveness. <em>See Rivers, </em><a href="/pa/567/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="786 A.2d 923" data-case-ids="404588,9456066" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0239-01,/a2d/786/0923-01">786 A.2d at 929-30</a> (Castille, J., concurring).

Notably, the concurrence cites to no cases from the U.S. Supreme Court articulating a different standard. Mr. Justice Zappala, of course, dissented in <em>(Charles) Pierce, </em>where he expressed the view that this Court should not follow <em>Strickland </em>but should follow a different standard for assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the Pennsylvania Constitution. Notwithstanding that dissent, however, <em>(Charles) Pierce </em>and <em>Strickland </em>are the settled law in Pennsylvania. Moreover, there is no claim in this case for a different or more exacting test for counsel effectiveness under the Pennsylvania Constitution.

      <em>Williams </em>placed great emphasis on the function of the PCRA court as a gatekeeper in the arena of post-conviction litigation. In <em>Williams, </em>this court provided a roadmap for the post-conviction review process in capital cases, by putting meat on the bones of the process described in the PCRA. Essentially, we instructed the bench and bar that before this court will undertake appellate review in a PCRA matter the level of advocacy must meet the requirements of pleading and proof demanded by the. Act, the decisional law following therefrom, and the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal and Appellate Procedure.</p>

In recognition of that learning curve, I anticipated that some PCRA capital cases would require a remand. Remand is not needed in those instances where the PCRA court carried out its function by conducting a merits review of the pleadings, holding a hearing where necessary, and explaining the reasons for its rulings. A remand is only necessary in those cases where the PCRA court failed to meet its obligations as gatekeeper. It is essential that the PCRA court force petitioners to prepare all collateral claims in accordance with the provisions of the Act for it is only if such compliance is mandated in a consistent manner that practitioners can fully understand what is expected of them. As gatekeeper, the PCRA court has the responsibility to explain where and how a PCRA petition is deficient, <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>to provide the opportunity for amendment to correct those deficiencies, to supply a forum for the full and fair opportunity to litigate evidentiary claims when needed, and to file an opinion adequately setting forth the reasons for its rulings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

Although this is not a traditional layering case, experience teaches that most PCRA claims are couched in terms of layered allegations' of ineffectiveness of counsel. At the collateral stage, il is essential lo consider the independent actions of all prior counsel at each stage of the proceeding, as they relate to the current claim of error in the collateral proceeding. 11 is not enough for a petitioner to argue the merits of the underlying claim and the prejudice suffered. At the PCRA stage, a petitioner must go the next step and elucidate how the underlying claim of error was handled by, or overlooked by, each intervening attorney in order to present a cognizable claim for collateral relid. Prior to <em>Williams, </em>this court permitted a merits review of the underlying claim of error by the PCRA court if the petitioner provided a boilerplate allegation of layered ineffectiveness. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Williams, </em><a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="566 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="706331" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01">566 Pa. 553</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">782 A.2d 517</a> (2001). In my view, the accounting for <em>Williams </em>offered by the lead opinion here merely represents a restyling of points advanced by Mr. Justice Castille’s concurring opinion from that case, embodying, <em>inter alia, </em>the concept that “this Court should deny review based solely upon deficiencies in post-conviction appellate briefs, although the briefs may themselves manifest ineffective assistance on the part of appellate post-conviction counsel for failing even to invoke the Court’s review.” <em>Williams, </em><a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="566 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="706331" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01">566 Pa. at </a>567 n. 5, <a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">782 A.2d at </a>526 n. 5. However, the express intent of <em>Williams’ </em>approach of requiring adherence to the rules governing post-conviction proceedings was to “protect the integrity of the process and the rights of a capital petitioner in the common pleas setting, [and] also to provide the essential predicate for appellate review of the post-conviction proceedings.” <em><a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">at 569</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="135" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">782 A.2d at 527</a>. By enforcing the rules, including the requirement that post-conviction courts provide reasonably specific pre-dismissal notice of the reasons supporting a summary disposition, such potential ineffectiveness should be exposed early in the process and, where appropriate, corrected by amendatory pleadings in furtherance of the interests identified above.
