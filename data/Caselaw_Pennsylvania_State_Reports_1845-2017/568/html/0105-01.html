On the face of the declarations page (as of at least November, 1992), the policy provided, <em>inter alia, </em>bodily injury liability coverage limited to $500,000 per person and per accident; uninsured motorist (“UM”) and underinsured motorist (“UIM”) coverage with limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident; and stacking of UM and UIM benefits by virtue of multiple <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>vehicle premium payments. The UM/UIM coverage appears to have been modified in November of 1992 via a form provided by Erie and signed by Mr. Lewis as the first named insured.

According to the Lewises, such question is definitively answered by Section 1731(c.l)’s express admonition, not merely that the act of waiver/rejection is void, but that the form itself is void, <em>see </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1791(c.1) (“[a]ny rejection form that does not specifically comply with this section is void”), thus negating its effectiveness for any purpose and necessarily implicating Section 1731(c.1)’s remedy of reformation. <em>See <a href="/a2d/753/0839-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="753 A.2d 839" data-case-ids="11213876" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0839-01">id.</a> </em>The Lewises find support for this interpretation in: the principle of statutory construction favoring the reading of related statutory provisions <em>in pari materia </em>(as did the <em>Irex </em>majority); the reasoning employed in this Court’s recent decision in <em>Winslow-Quattlebaum v.

The Lewises dismiss as irrelevant the Superior Court’s citations to <em>Salazar </em>and <em>Donnelly, </em>and point to other decisions of Pennsylvania appellate courts in which failure by an insurer to comply with the specific statutory requirements resulted in the provision of UM/UIM coverage extending to bodily injury liability limits.</p>

Further, Erie endorses the Superior Court’s invocation of <em>Salazar </em>and <em>Donnelly, </em>contending that the affordance of relief in favor of the Lewises would be inconsistent with those decisions, as the Court has found remedies for violations of certain technical statutory criteria of the MVFRL unavailable in the absence of an express statutory prescription. In response to the Lewises’ argument that the remedy may be found in Section 1731(c.1), Erie contends that a close review of such provision reveals that it provides a remedy only for improper “rejections” of coverage, and a request for coverage at specific limits is not a “rejection” within the contemplation of Section 1731. Since under Erie’s view it is not attempting to enforce a rejection, the statutory language to the effect that “any rejection form that does not specifically comply with this section is void,” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(c.1), is simply inapplicable. Moreover, according to Erie, the Lewises’ present effort to obtain a benefit not purchased with or provided by the policy contravenes the cost containment goal of the MVFRL in that it would require an insurer to provide more coverage than was actually purchased, resulting in the attendant costs being passed along to other insurance consumers in the form of higher premiums.

Section 1731’s cross-reference to Section 1734 makes this distinction explicit in describing Section 1734 as “relating to request for lower limits of coverage.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1735(a). Therefore, although we view the statutes as <em>in pari materia </em>in a broad sense, the material difference in their subject matter allows for differential treatment to the extent that this would appear to be legislatively intended. <em>Accord </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1932 (prescribing for particularized treatment concerning statutes deemed <em>in pari materia </em>only where related to the same (or same class of) persons or things). In line with the <em>Lewis </em>panel’s reasoning, this subject-matter distinction heightens the significance of the attachment of technical requirements and corresponding remedial provisions to Section 1731 waiver/rejection but not to Section 1734 specific-limits designation. <em>Accord Leymeister, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/100/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="100 F.

As Erie posits, it is reasonable to conclude that the General Assembly attached the additional requirements to outright waiver/rejection to confer explicit warning upon consumers who chose to drive without any financial protection from injury on account of uninsured or underinsured motorists.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Further, as noted by <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>Judge Brosky, requests for specific 'limits coverage, in contrast to outright waiver/rejection, require not only the signature of the insured, but also, an express designation of the amount of coverage requested, thus lessening the potential for confusion. Additionally, as concerns the Lewises’ arguments regarding notice of the extent of available coverage, Section 1791 of the MVFRL occupies a central role as it concerns the conveyance of information regarding, <em>inter alia, </em>the insurer’s obligation to offer UM and UIM coverage of up to at least $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident, and of the insured’s option to purchase coverage carrying lower benefit limits. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1791. Indeed, by the terms of the statute, an insured’s awareness of the benefits and limits available under the financial responsibility provisions of the MVFRL is presumed upon the provision of such notice, and “no other notice or rejection shall be required.” M<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> The fact that notice may be presumed in certain situations involving the selection of specific-limits coverage although no Section 1731 waiver/rejection form is produced also favors the conclusion that Section 1731(c.l) serves a more limited and directed function than as a core notice provision pertaining to all UM/UIM requests.</p>

While cost containment is not the only objective of the statute, it has become an increasingly significant one, and it is apparent that the General Assembly has been employing the vehicle of free consumer choice with greater latitude and frequency in furtherance of this objective. Addi<a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>tionally, we credit the observation of other courts to the effect that Section 1731(c.1)’s separate-page requirement is a technical one in the sense that essential notice of the consequences of waiver/rejection can be provided in absence of such prescribed formality. <em>See, e.g., supra </em>note 14.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Given this aspect of the requirement, and its correspondingly limited role in terms of furthering the remedial purposes of the statute, it is most reasonable to conclude that the Legislature intended its application to be limited according to its prescribed context.

Despite the efforts of the insurer in <em>Irex </em>1o cast that case in a different posture, <em>Irex </em>was a rejection case. Squarely addressing the question before us, the only applicant/insured who will be exercising the option to request reduced coverage for UM and/or UIM under section 1734 is one who has elected not to reject the coverage in its entirety under section 1731. As I see it, the remedy provision of section 1731 protects against, the possibility of an uninformed rejection of coverage and recognizes that an insured may very well reject coverage where he would not have done so had he been fully informed of the consequences of his action. Not only are the same provisions not explicitly provided with respect to section 1734, but also the underlying concern is not presented. Whereas there may be a reasonable concern that coverage was rejected unknowingly, a person who reduces coverage must first "accept” coverage by choosing not to reject it, then must take an affirmative action to reduce the coverage. This requirement of taking an affirmative step of making a reduction request in writing, along with a designation of the coverage amount desired, provides adequate protection against a reduction request being made "unknowingly.”</blockquote>
