Appellant refused to stop the vehicle and eventually crashed into a building. Appellant immediately jumped out of the vehicle and onto the hood and roof of Officer Boyle’s cruiser while brandishing a 9 mm automatic handgun. He then jumped off the cruiser, pointed his gun at Officer Boyle and instructed the officer not to touch his weapon. When, Officer Boyle tried to reverse his car to remove it from the area, Appellant fired no less than eight shots into the cruiser and fled the scene. Officer Boyle died two days later. Physical evidence and several witnesses linked Appellant to the crime and one witness identified Appellant as the shooter.</p>

In response, the Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss the petition based upon the existing record. Following a hearing, the PCRA court found that all but one of Appellant’s claims could be decided on the existing record. Therefore, the PCRA court granted Appellant’s request for an evidentiary hearing on the sole issue of whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the penalty phase of Appellant’s trial and denied Appellant’s request for an evidentiary hearing on all remaining grounds.

Likewise, a mental health evaluation report prepared by Philadelphia court psychologist Lawrence Byrne in 1984 indicated that while Appellant had schizoid personality traits, he suffered from no psychological factors which would interfere with the court’s ability to sentence him. Both Dr. Camiel and Mr. Byrne, who also evaluated Appellant for the instant ease and found him to be competent for sentencing, testified at the evidentiary hearing that they saw no signs of organicity or organic brain damage during their evaluations of Appellant.

Here, even if there was any evidence that Officer Boyle was using anything but lawful force in his encounter with Appellant, Appellant clearly could not establish that he was free from fault in provoking the event that led up to Officer Boyle’s murder. Before fatally shooting Officer Boyle, Appellant jumped on the hood of Officer Boyle’s car, aimed a loaded handgun at him and ordered him not to touch his weapon. Since there was <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>absolutely no evidence that Appellant acted in self-defense— imperfect or otherwise — Appellant’s claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to present such evidence necessarily fails.

This claim is without merit. As Appellant concedes, the only alleged evidence of any potential intoxication at the time of the murder was Appellant’s own statement that he had been drinking before the offense. Clearly, Appellant’s bald assertion that counsel should have somehow mounted a voluntary intoxication defense from this statement, when he offers absolutely no other evidence to support his claim that he was intoxicated at the time of the shooting, fails to offer him any basis for relief. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In response, Mr. Justice Zappala, writing for a majority of the Court which included the author of <em>Zettlemoyer, </em>explained that the notion of the unavailability of PCHA review in capital cases was simply mistaken. Section 9711(i) of the Judicial Code, the only authority cited for the proposition that PCHA review was unavailable in death cases, stated only that a full and complete record must be forwarded to the Governor following affirmance of a death sentence. “[T]he statute does not require that the <em>official </em>record be transmitted to the Governor. Nor does the statute in any other way, either expressly or impliedly, remove the case from the jurisdiction of the courts to prevent further action by the courts.” Justice Zappala went on to note that the language in the <em>Zettlemoyer </em>majority opinion suggesting the unavailability of PCHA relief, in addition to being mistaken, was <em>dicta. </em><a href="/pa/502/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="502 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1784536" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0474-01">467 A.2d at </a>304 n. 5.</p>

When an issue is waived under the PCRA, it is not because of our appellate preservation/waiver doctrine, but because a legislative judgment has been made as to what types of claims should be available at all on collateral review. We cannot simply ignore that legislative judgment as if it were a judicial concern subject to weighing against other judicial concerns.

In my view, the majority's statement that an allegation of ineffectiveness suffices to "avoid waiver” misperceives the inquiry under the Sixth Amendment and the PCRA. An allegation of ineffectiveness does not "avoid” waiver of a claim under the PCRA; rather, it is itself a distinct and cognizable claim under the PCRA. As with any other substantive constitutional claim under the PCRA, a claim of ineffectiveness is available only if it has not been waived, <em>i.e., </em>only if the petitioner did <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>not have a previous opportunity to raise it. Focusing in this manner recognizes the constitutional nature of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, respects the terms of the PCRA, and ensures that like claims are treated similarly. In this case, as I explain more fully in the text, the only non-waived claims are the claims sounding in appellate counsel's ineffectiveness. The other versions of appellant’s claims, <em>i.e., </em>those sounding in trial court error and ineffective assistance of trial counsel, are waived under the PCRA because they could have been raised on direct appeal, but were not.</p>

The fact of the matter is that PCRA review does exist, and .ineffectiveness claims are cognizable under the PCRA. Abolition of relaxed waiver, or restriction of the doctrine to fundamental constitutional claims, relating to the capital nature of the case, which are apparent on the face of the record, would be a much more realistic and principled approach than what has come into being. Through direct appeal relaxed waiver, this Court reviews a claim in an analytical vacuum, for example, passing on whether something, not objected to, was objectionable, or whether a cautionary charge, not asked for, should have been issued if it had been asked for. The trial judge is in the best position to evaluate these matters in the first instance; the relaxed waiver practice, however, erases the trial judge and his discretionary authority from the picture. Also, there are often specific, tactical reasons why counsel deliberately chooses not to raise an issue. Failing to consider the waived claim for what it really is excludes both the trial judge and trial counsel from the analysis, and leaves this Court to review what amounts to a theoretical claim. Review under the PCRA, on the other hand, allows for consideration of claims in light of what actually happened, and also provides a mechanism by which a record, when necessary, can be generated for review. Also, the substantive advantage that the relaxed waiver doctrine creates for capital defendants raises concerns. Unlike capital defendants, non-capital defendants may raise waived claims only under the rubric of ineffectiveness, which places a burden of proof upon them, including the requirement of proving prejudice, rather than requiring the Commonwealth to prove harmless error. Whether a claim is subject to harmless error or <em>Strickland </em>píejudice can be outcome-determinative. <em>See Commonwealth v. Howard, </em><a href="/pa/538/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="195" data-cite="538 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="475553" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0086-01">538 Pa. 86</a>, <a href="/pa/538/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="196" data-cite="645 A.2d 1300" data-case-ids="475553,7874424" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0086-01,/a2d/645/1300-01">645 A.2d 1300</a> (1994). Since the claims subject to relaxed waiver are not limited to the penalty phase, the capital nature of a case cannot rationally justify such a preferential, substantive treatment of otherwise identically situated defendants.</p>
