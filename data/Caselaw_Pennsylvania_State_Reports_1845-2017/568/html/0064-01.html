Kozura (“Kozura”) was suspended without pay from his position as a math and science teacher in the Tulpehocken Area School District (“District”). When Kozura’s employment was terminated following notice and a hearing, the Tulpehocken Education Association (the “Association”), the union representing Kozura, invoked Article XIX of the governing collective bargaining agreement to file a, grievance on Kozura’s behalf and to request reinstatement and an award of back pay and corresponding benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Because the Association and the District were unable to resolve the grievance, the <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>matter ultimately was presented to an arbitrator, who conducted hearings and issued an award reinstating Kozura based upon a determination that just cause for discharge did not exist.

The District responded with a motion to quash the appeal, arguing that Kozura lacked standing to challenge the arbitration award, as he was not a party to the arbitration proceedings. Following the submission of stipulated facts and arguments, the common pleas court granted the District’s motion to quash. The common pleas court acknowledged that, as Kozura argued, Section 606 of the Public Employee Relations Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> 43 P.S. § 1101.606, afforded individual employees the right to present grievances to their employer and to have such grievances adjusted without their bargaining representative’s intervention, as long as the bargaining representative was allowed to be present at such adjustment, but determined that the statute did not specify whether the employee could also appeal, on his own, an adverse arbitration award. In the present case, the common <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>pleas court concluded, allowing Kozura to do so would conflict with the relevant collective bargaining agreement, since, in the common pleas court’s interpretation, that agreement vested in the Association the exclusive right to pursue arbitration. Accordingly, the common pleas court explained, the Association and the District were the sole parties to the arbitration proceeding, and Kozura therefore lacked standing to appeal.</p>

    <p id="b345-4" data-blocks='[["BL_345.5",345,[180,621,1150,365]]]'>Significantly, Article XIX includes several references to the concept of representation. As previously noted, the fourth step of the grievance procedure provides that “[t]he employee(s) and School District may be represented at the arbitration by counsel and the Employee(s) by a representative of the Association.” In addition, the general principles stated in Section B include the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b345-5" data-blocks='[["BL_345.6",345,[224,1005,1107,96]]]'>10. An Employee may be represented at any and all steps of this procedure by a person of their choice.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b345-6" data-blocks='[["BL_345.7",345,[222,1119,1109,149]]]'>11. When an Employee does not want to be represented by the Association, the Association shall have the right to be present.</blockquote>

In delineating these steps, the agreement states that it is the employee who shall pursue each step and, further, that the "[e]mployee(s) and the School District may be represented at the arbitration by counsel and the [e]mployee(s) by a representative of the Association.” In addition, the agreement provides that the employee may be "represented at any and all steps of this procedure by a person of their [sic] choice,” but that the Association has the right to be present if it is not chosen as the employee's representative.
