Accordingly, the court entered judgment in Pantuso’s favor as to liability, reserving for trial the determination of damages. An order was subsequently entered, awarding Pantuso $235,858.36 in liquidated damages, an amount representing 50% of the initial judgment of $471,716.71, pursuant to the statutory formula contained in Section 8104(b), 42 Pa.C.S. § 8104(b).

The Superior Court deemed the two-year statute controlling, relying upon dicta from its prior decision in <em>Hanover Plumbing Supply, Inc. v.

The panel then concentrated its review upon the arguments pertaining to renewal of the limitations period. In this regard, it analyzed and compared the three statutes involved in Pantuso’s initial complaint — Sections 681 and 682 of Title 21, Pennsylvania Statutes, Section 8104 (Title 42, Pa.C.S.), and Section 9404 (Title 13, Pa.C.S.) — taking special note of the mandate in Section 682 that the mortgagee be fined for “every such offense,” as well as the absence of similar language in Sections 8104 and 9404. Given such omission, the court determined that, for claims based upon the latter provisions, the statute of limitations could not be renewed with each additional demand for satisfaction. However, the court agreed that, for claims based upon Sections 681-682, the limitations period could be renewed for “each offense,” i.e., each unheeded written request for satisfaction of the mortgage. <em>See Pantuso, </em><a href="/a2d/745/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="745 A.2d 614" data-case-ids="11479072,11479138,95782" data-case-paths="/a2d/745/0614-01,/a2d/745/0614-02,/pa/560/0409-01">745 A.2d at 618-19</a>.

CoreStates points to the <em>Hanover Plumbing Supply </em>dicta and argues that, notwithstanding its “liquidated damages” label, <em>see supra </em>note 4, the remedy provided by Section 8104(b) is primarily punitive in nature, as it is designed to encourage timely removal of satisfied judgments from court dockets, rather than to compensate the debtor for any harm suffered. CoreStates thus contends that the applicable limitations period is governed by Section 5524(5), 42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(5). Pantuso and <em>amicus curiae </em>disagree, and indicate that Section 8104 is remedial, not punitive. They argue that it is governed by either the four-year statute, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5525(7) and (8) (pertaining to actions upon bonds, notes, written contracts, or similar instruments), or the residual six-year period set forth at Section 5527 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5527.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In either case, they maintain, the action was timely, as it was brought less than four years after the initial demand for satisfaction of the obligations was made.</p>

Although the underlying transaction that ultimately led to entry of the confession of judgment may have included an agreement reduced to writing, Pantuso’s claim under Section 8104 is founded upon the statute itself, and not upon a contract, bond, or other written instrument. The question, then, distills to whether Section 8104(b) is a remedial statute intended to compensate debtors for the harmful effects of stale judgments, or instead constitutes a “civil penalty or forfeiture” for purposes of the two-year statute, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(5), as indicated by the Superior Court.</p>

Manifestly, absent constitutional infirmity the courts of this Commonwealth may not refuse to enforce on grounds of public policy that which the Legislature has prescribed. <em>See Commonwealth ex rel.

It would likewise be anomalous for this Court to declare, on grounds ultimately rooted in public policy, that a remedy which the General Assembly has specifically designated as liquidated damages is in fact a statutory penalty or forfeiture. This is particularly true where, as here, the harm to be remedied reasonably lends itself to a liquidated damages solution: the injury resulting from paid judgments remaining unsatisfied of record — including possible damage to the debt- or’s reputation, credit rating, and financial affairs generally— is likely to be difficult to quantify, and, like the Section 8104 formula, may increase with the amount of the stale judgment and the duration it remains of record. Thus, we are skeptical of the <em>Hanover Plumbing Supply </em>court’s declaration that Section 8104(b) is penal in nature, which, in any event, lacked supporting analysis or authority.</p>

CoreStates argues by analogy that, given the similarity between that enactment and Section 8104(b), the latter remedy is punitive as to the judgment creditor, and hence, operates as a statutory fine or forfeiture subject to the two-year statute. While it is true that <em>Werner </em>characterized the remedy under the mortgage statute as having the dual purpose of compensating the aggrieved party and punishing the offending party, <em>see id. </em>at 219, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20A.2d%20898" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="31 A.2d 898">31 A.2d at 899</a>, we do not view that decision as indicating that Section 8104(b)’s remedy constitutes a penalty as to the judgment creditor, as there are important differences between the two statutes. For one, the penalty prescribed by Section 682 is discretionary with the court and designed as a “[f]ine for neglect.” <em>See </em>21 P.S. § 682. The award under Section 8104(b), by contrast, is specified in precise terms and denominated “liquidated damages.” <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8104(b). Further, the <em>Werner </em>court referred to the penalty aspect of the mortgage statute’s remedy chiefly to emphasize that trial courts could consider the defendant’s culpability when fixing the damage award and should reserve the harshest penalties for mortgagees who act unreasonably or wantonly. <em>See, e.g., Crawford v. Simon, </em><a href="/pa/159/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="159 Pa. 585" data-case-ids="850195" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0585-01">159 Pa. 585</a>, 589, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20A.%20491" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="28 A. 491">28 A. 491</a>, 492 (1894).

Notably, it is that prior legislation that the <em>Werner </em>Court stated was similar to Section 682.

Thus, to the extent an analogy existed at the time of the <em>Werner </em>decision between the prescribed schemes for compensating mortgagors and judgment debtors, it has been diminished via legislative change. Consequently, we are not inclined to contravene the General Assembly’s present designation of the award at issue as liquidated damages, but rather, defer to its judgment in terms of the approach that it has chosen to employ.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

CoreStates argues in the alternative that, even if the two-year statute for civil penalties and forfeitures is not implicated, the limitations period for tortious injury to persons or property bars the present suit, as its failure to enter judgment satisfaction amounted to negligent conduct. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(7)(imposing a two-year limitation period for "[a]ny other action or proceeding to recover damages for injury to person or property which is founded on negligent, intentional, or otherwise tortious conduct ... ”). CoreStates fails to cite any authority for the conclusion that violating the requirements of Section 8104 constitutes a tort controlled by Section 5524(7). Moreover, die award of liquidated damages — rather than damages premised upon the plaintiff's proof of specific injuries together with proximate causation— undermines CoreStates’ theory in this regard. <em>See Commonwealth v.
