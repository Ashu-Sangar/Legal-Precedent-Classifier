    <p id="b772-14" data-blocks='[["BL_772.13",772,[257,1660,1161,411]]]'>The issue before the court is whether exigent circumstances excused the Commonwealth’s warrantless search of a vehicle, after the occupants had been removed from the vehicle and taken into police custody. I conclude that under the unique facts of this case, there existed a potential threat of deadly harm to the police, and thus, exigent circumstances that justified the Commonwealth’s failure to obtain a search warrant.</p>

On Saturday June 8, 1996, at approximately 3:00 a.m., Javon Jones and Bobby Mahalati were driving a GEO Tracker to Illusions, an after-hours club. At the same time, Appellant Perry was driving a white Lexus <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>and Appellant Stewart was a passenger in the vehicle. Perry had stopped the Lexus at a green light on 7th Street which was around the corner from the club. Perry and Stewart were blocking a lane of traffic while the men conversed with some women who were in the car behind them. Jones, driving the Tracker with the top and windows down, pulled along side the Lexus as the light turned red. Stewart turned to Jones and remarked, “What the f — you looking at?” Jones and Mahalati ignored Stewart. When the light turned green, Jones drove around the Lexus and stopped in front of the entrance to Illusions. Perry pulled the Lexus along the passenger side of, the Tracker. Perry asked Mahalati, “What the f — you looking at?” Perry then repeated several times, “What do you want to do? Do you want to f — us?” Mahalati responded, “All right, What ever p — .” One or both of the Appellants shouted, “What? Do you want to take care of this” and “We can take care of this around the corner.” Perry and Stewart then drove to the end of the block and turned left onto 8th Street.</p>
    <p id="b773-5" data-blocks='[["BL_773.4",773,[181,1343,1151,360]]]'>Perry positioned the Lexus on 8th Street so as to leave only enough room for a single vehicle to pass. Jones and Mahalati drove past the Lexus, passing it on the right. Jones and Mahalati observed that both Perry and Stewart were holding guns. Mahalati threw his seat back in an attempt to protect himself while Jones attempted to speed away. Shots rang out and Mahalati lost feeling in his legs.</p>
    <p id="b773-6" data-blocks='[["BL_773.5",773,[180,1727,1152,458]]]'>Jones drove around the block in an effort to seek help. Jones flagged down Philadelphia Police Officer Tyrone Forrest, who was on duty outside of Illusions. Officer Forrest observed the bullet hole in the side of the Tracker and noted blood on the seat. After summoning an ambulance, Officer Forrest broadcasted an alert over police radio at 2:59 a.m., stating that a man had been shot and that his assailants were two black males who had driven southbound on 8th Street in a two-door white Lexus.</p>
    <p id="b773-7" data-blocks='[["BL_773.6",773,[180,2218,1152,147]],["BL_774.1",774,[251,321,1160,250]]]'>Officer John Barker received the police broadcast. Approximately one minute later, he observed Perry and Stewart in the white Lexus which was proceeding south on 8th Street. <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>Barker requested back up and followed. Officer Barker and Sergeant Glenn Katz, who had joined in the pursuit, ultimately stopped the men near the intersection of 11th and Federal Streets. The Lexus was blocking one of two southbound lanes of 11th Street.</p>
    <p id="b774-5" data-blocks='[["BL_774.4",774,[250,605,1160,420]]]'>The officers directed Perry and Stewart out of the car. The officers did not request that Perry turn off the engine, and thus, the motor remained running. The police frisked the men as a safety precaution but no weapons were found on their persons. The police took Jones to the stopped vehicle in an attempt to identify the assailants. Jones arrived within fifteen minutes after Officer Forrest had reported the shooting over the radio.</p>
    <p id="b774-6" data-blocks='[["BL_774.5",774,[248,1052,1162,528]]]'>■ Upon seeing Perry and Stewart, Jones immediately exclaimed, “that’s them and they have two guns.” At that point, Perry and Stewart were handcuffed and placed in police vehicles. Jones informed police that at least one of the guns appeared to be an “automatic” weapon. This information was relayed to Lieutenant Thomas McDevitt who had arrived on the scene. Determining that as a matter of public safety it was imperative for the guns to. be recovered, Lieutenant McDevitt requested that Officer Barker search the Lexus for the weapons.</p>
    <p id="b774-7" data-blocks='[["BL_774.6",774,[247,1606,1162,526]]]'>Officer Barker returned to the vehicle and shined a flashlight into the passenger compartment. He noticed that the floor mat on the driver’s side was askew. Concerned that one of the guns may be lying beneath the mat, Officer Barker lifted the mat and uncovered a 9mm Helwan, loaded with six bullets. Officer Barker then searched under the passenger side floor mat and uncovered a .22 Beretta. Once the weapons were removed, the Lexus was driven to police headquarters. No other search was made of the vehicle, and the vehicle was immediately driven to an impoundment area.</p>
    <p id="b774-8" data-blocks='[["BL_774.7",774,[247,2160,1160,202]],["BL_775.1",775,[182,330,1155,467]]]'>Perry and Stewart were held for trial for attempted murder, aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy, and related charges. On March 9, 1998, a joint suppression motion was filed in which Perry and Stewart claimed that the police had <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>acted illegally in conducting a warrantless search of the Lexus and in seizing the guns. The court suppressed the weapons seized from the Lexus finding that the police were not permitted to search the vehicle without a search warrant. More specifically, the suppression judge noted that at the time the police entered the Lexus, both Perry and Stewart had been handcuffed and taken into police custody. Thus, no exigent circumstances were present which would justify the warrant-less search.</p>
    <p id="b775-5" data-blocks='[["BL_775.4",775,[181,831,1157,520]]]'>The Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court, certifying that the suppression of the weapons had substantially handicapped its prosecution of Perry and Stewart.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Superior Court reversed the order of the suppression court. The Superior Court found that exigent circumstances existed with respect to public safety and with respect to police safety that excused the warrantless search of the Lexus.

This court has consistently embraced the principle that Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution requires that searches by the state be permitted only upon obtaining a warrant issued by the neutral and detached magistrate. Thus, as a general proposition, warrant-less searches are unreasonable for constitutional purposes. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <em>White </em>involved a warrantless search of an automobile for drugs. In <em>White, </em>the police were informed that William White and another individual, Henry Bennett, had a large supply of cocaine and that they were expected to make a sale of the drugs on a particular date. Moreover, the police understood that the cocaine was being moved back and forth between White’s residence and Bennett’s residence. The police obtained a search warrant for Bennett’s residence, vehicle, and person and obtained a warrant for the search of White’s residence and person. However, the police failed to obtain a warrant for White’s vehicle. As fate would have it, White drove his vehicle into the stakeout area and an unidentified man entered White’s vehicle. As this was happening, Bennett also drove by and passed White’s car a number of times. Bennett then left the area and the police took White and his passenger into custody. Without obtaining a warrant for White’s automobile, the police then entered his vehicle and retrieved a bag containing cocaine as well as a marijuana cigarettq that was in plain view on the vehicle’s console. The suppression court suppressed the evidence. The Superior Court reversed.</p>

In <em>White, </em>the court determined that the police had ample information that White’s automobile would be involved in criminal activity and that there were no unforeseen circumstances that would justify a warrantless search of the vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b778-8" data-blocks='[["BL_778.7",778,[253,1469,1164,898]]]'>The court also spoke to a second type of exception dealing with an exigency that justifies a search in the absence of a warrant — a search incident to an arrest. The <em>White </em>court, citing <em>Commonwealth v. Timko, </em><a href="/pa/491/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="491 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1765690" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0032-01">491 Pa. 32</a>, <a href="/pa/491/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="491 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1765690" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0032-01">417 A.2d 620</a> (1980), explained that a warrantless search may be permissible as a search incident to an arrest. However, the court reaffirmed the extent of such a search and limited the warrantless search of a vehicle incident, to an arrest to areas and clothing immediately accessible to the person arrested. <em><a href="/pa/491/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="491 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1765690" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0032-01">Id.</a> </em>The purpose of this second type of exception was to prevent the arrestee from securing weapons or destroying contraband. <em>White, </em><a href="/a2d/669/0896-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="669 A.2d 896" data-case-ids="11335272,461498" data-case-paths="/a2d/669/0896-01,/pa/543/0045-01">669 A.2d at 902</a>, citing <em>Timko, </em><a href="/pa/491/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="491 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1765690" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0032-01">417 A.2d at 622-23</a>.

      <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>The <em>White </em>court also touched upon a third excuse to the warrant requirement dealing with another type of exigent circumstance. The court recognized the propriety of a warrantless search where there is potential danger to the police or to others, but where the harm does not lie at the direct hand of the defendant. As explained in <em>White:</em>

The court, again citing to <em>Timko, </em>found that an inventory search is permissible, but only when the police demonstrate that the search was in fact conducted as a search for purposes of the protection of the owner’s property which remained in police custody, the protection of police against claims of lost or stolen property, and the protection of police against danger. <em><a href="/a2d/669/0896-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="669 A.2d 896" data-case-ids="11335272,461498" data-case-paths="/a2d/669/0896-01,/pa/543/0045-01">Id.</a> </em>citing <em>Timko, </em><a href="/pa/491/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="491 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1765690" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0032-01">417 A.2d at 623</a>.

Furthermore, as Perry and Stewart were secured in a police cruiser prior to the time the search of the vehicle was conducted, a search of the vehicle incident to the arrest could not have been lawfully performed. Finally, it is plain that the search was part of a criminal investigation and not conducted as part of the inventorying of property. Thus, it is the potential danger to police or others, as discussed in footnote five of the <em>White </em>opinion, that is the proper focus in this appeal.</p>

As to concern for the public in general, the Superior Court credited the Commonwealth’s explanation that unless the guns were located in the car, the police would have to organize an immediate search of the entire route that the defendants had traveled while fleeing through the city in order to recover the weapons. Lieutenant McDevitt testified that police resources were low at that time and obtaining a search warrant at approximately 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning would have taken several hours. Lieutenant McDevitt opined that by that time, there could be children on the streets.</p>

Specifically, Officer Barker noted that the motor of the Lexus was still running when the men were in custody and that the vehicle was in the middle of one lane of 11th Street. This constituted an unsafe situation. Furthermore, in attempting to drive or to park the vehicle, an officer ran the risk of injury from a concealed weapon. The police believed from Jones’ statement that a 9mm “automatic” was allegedly used in the crime. Finally, Lieutenant McDevitt testified that such a weapon could “easily go off on the officer, if he hit a bump or <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>stepped on it or kicked it by accident with his foot.” N.T. 3/10/98 at 261.</p>

The concurrence first claims that the court's discussion in <em>White </em>regarding the first type of exigent circumstances is dicta and is not precedent for the proposition that this court follows an Article I, Section 8 approach to automobile searches that is distinct and different from the approach under the Fourth Amendment. In the concurrence's expansive view of dicta as applied to <em>White, </em>and carried to its logical conclusion, the only statement in an appellate opinion strictly necessary to the decision of the case is the order of the court. Of course, such a parsimonious interpretation of what is “necessary” to a decision is jurisprudentially unsound. Yet, it is what the concurrence suggests in its ultra-broad view of dicta.

If an exigency were required to search an automobile where there exists probable cause beyond (1) the inherent exigency presented by the mobility of the vehicle (the traditional exigency that permits a warrantless vehicle search under the Fourth Amendment), and (2) the lack of an opportunity for police to secure a search warrant before probable cause to search the vehicle arose unexpectedly (an additional exigency uniquely required by Pennsylvania caselaw), then I would certainly agree with Mr. Justice Cappy’s lead opinion that the danger to police here justified this particular search. However, I write separately because I do not believe that this Court’s existing jurisprudence requires, nor do I think that our jurisprudence should require, any exigency beyond the mobility of a vehicle and the unexpected development of probable cause. Accordingly, I respectfully disagree with the analytical approach employed by the lead opinion.

My disagreement with the lead opinion concerns what in fact is commanded by <em>stare decisis </em>in the area of automobile searches.

In contrast to the Opinion Announcing the Judgment, I do not believe that this single footnote in <em>White </em>supplies the basis for a separate and distinct exception to the warrant requirement.

According to the lead opinion, the police were “required” to remove the car from the right of way and to turn off the car’s engine. I disagree. First, the record reveals that the car was stopped on a four-lane road, with two lanes running in each direction plus angle parking on both sides of the street. N.T., 3/10/98, at 265. The car was stopped in the right hand lane of southbound traffic, leaving three lanes open to traffic. N.T., 3/10/98, at 204-06, 265. Clearly, the car was not totally obstructing traffic, especially in the early morning hours on a Sunday.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a> Second, the police did not need to enter the car in <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>order to turn off the ignition and remove the keys. According to police testimony, the car doors were left open when Appellants were removed from the car and taken into custody. N.T., 3/10/98, at 273. If there was any danger created by the car running while parked in the road, an officer could have easily reached into the car and turned the ignition off and removed the keys. Thus, I cannot accept the lead opinion’s assumption that it was necessary for the police to immediately move Appellants’ car, and therefore enter and search the car, prior to obtaining a warrant.</p>
    <p id="b814-5" data-blocks='[["BL_814.4",814,[239,867,1171,1380]]]'>I also disagree with the lead opinion’s conclusion that the possible presence of a weapon in Appellants’ car posed a threat to any officer who attempted to move the car. In my view, the reasoning of the Opinion Announcing the Judgment .is faulty for two reasons. First, the only basis for the leading opinion’s conclusion that the police were in danger was the bald assertion by Lieutenant McDevitt that one of the weapons alleged to have been used in the shooting, a 9mm automatic handgun, was fragile and could easily go off if bumped or stepped on. N.T., 3/10/98, at 257, 261. Lieutenant McDevitt was not qualified as a firearms expert and there was absolutely no evidence to support his assertion that the gun could somehow discharge on its own. Second, police officers may not create exigent circumstances, which they then use as justification for failing to follow the warrant requirement. <em>See Commonwealth v. Melendez, </em><a href="/pa/544/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="296" data-cite="544 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="463598" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0323-01">544 Pa. 323</a>, <a href="/pa/544/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="297" data-cite="676 A.2d 226" data-case-ids="463598,7859918" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0323-01,/a2d/676/0226-01">676 A.2d 226</a>, 230 (1996). In the instant case, there was no evidence of an emergency that required the police to move the car before procuring a search warrant. Thus, by moving the car immediately, the police created a perceived exigency that they used as justification for failing to obtain a warrant. Furthermore, the police created exigent circumstances' by claiming that a gun, which could <em>possibly </em>be in the car, <em>might </em>go off <em>all by itself. </em>Thus, in my view, the leading opinion’s unfounded reliance on danger to the police does not justify the warrant-less search of Appellants’ car.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">3</a>

      <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>The Opinion Announcing the Judgment further justifies the warrantless search by explaining that the police engaged in a search limited solely to establishing the safety of the passenger compartment of Appellants’ car. According to the testimony of the police, two police officers simultaneously searched the floor on both the driver and passenger sides of the vehicle after observing that the driver’s side floor mat was “askew.” N.T., 8/10/98, at 212-13. However, if the safety of the officer moving the car was a basis for exigent circumstances, I fail to see why the passenger side of the vehicle was part of this exigency. Under the lead opinion’s reasoning, Appellants’ entire car would have been subject to a warrantless search because a weapon or other device contained <em>anywhere </em>in the car could have potentially injured an officer moving the car. In effect, the Opinion Announcing the Judgment automatically subjects entire vehicles to warrantless searches if the police invoke police danger as an exigency, regardless of the object of their search.</p>

In fact, Lieutenant McDevitt testified that he never even <em>considered </em>obtaining a warrant. N.T., 3/10/98, at 264. As the trial court noted at the suppression hearing, there are magistrates and emergency judges on duty twenty-four hours a day for the express purpose of issuing warrants. N.T., 3/11/98, at 333.
