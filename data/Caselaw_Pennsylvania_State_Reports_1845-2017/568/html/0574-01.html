The appeal also presents the question of whether, and when, expert medical testimony is necessary to prove damages resulting from a medical battery. On this question, we are in agreement with the careful distinction drawn by the Superior Court and, hence, we affirm its mandate.</p>

Sehgal took a history, performed a complete physical examination and ordered tests. Sehgal’s ultimate diagnosis was that Montgomery’s impotence was caused by Peyronie’s disease<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and a <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>slight venous leak, resulting in an insufficient blood supply to his penis to form and maintain an erection. The following month, in an effort to treat Montgomery’s impotence non-surgically, Sehgal administered injections of Papaverine and Regitine, medications which are designed to increase the blood flow in the penis.</p>

Sehgal decided that corrective surgery was necessary. On March 30, 1990, Sehgal performed surgery on Montgomery at Aliquippa Hospital during the course of which he implanted an inflatable pump prosthesis in Montgomery’s penis. The facts to this point are undisputed; it is the nature of the surgery performed, and whether Montgomery consented to the specific procedure, that is disputed.</p>

Appellees claimed that, prior to the surgery, Sehgal merely told them he intended to perform a revascularization, an outpatient procedure. A revascularization is designed to open and repair the blood vessels leading to the penis to increase blood flow. Appellees alleged that the possible insertion of a penile implant was not discussed with them prior to the surgery, nor did John Montgomery ever consent to the implantation of the prosthesis — a procedure which resulted in Montgomery being admitted to the hospital for several days. Appellees claimed that they first learned of the implantation when Montgomery awoke from the surgical anesthesia and a nurse presented him with a warranty card for the prosthesis. Montgomery asked the nurse whether there was some mistake, whereupon the nurse informed him that the prosthesis had been implanted in his penis. Dr. Sehgal denied appellee’s claim that he never informed appellees about the prospect of implanting a penile prosthesis.</p>

Appellees asked Sehgal why he had implanted the prosthesis, and the doctor explained that he was saving Montgomery from a second surgical procedure at some later date. John Montgomery replied that it was not up to the doctor, but up to him to determine whether he wanted such an object placed in his body. Montgomery also told Seghal that he did not want the prosthesis and wanted it removed, but Sehgal informed him that removal was not an option because there was “nothing there now.”</p>

John Montgomery testified that he has never gotten used to the device. He explained that he had to be careful how he sits because it is “like sitting on a pin cushion,” the device hurts at times, and there had been times “that it felt like it wanted to come out through the head of it and it is plain discomfort.” Montgomery also testified to the mental effect of the implantation of the prosthesis, explaining that:</p>

Appellees failed to identify any liability expert witnesses by the date established by the trial court, causing the trial court to issue an order on June 15, 1995, which precluded appellees from calling any liability expert witnesses at trial. On September 15, 1995, Dr. Sehgal and Greater Pittsburgh Impotence Center,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> relying on the trial court’s preclusion order, filed a <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>motion for partial summary judgment arguing that appellees could not prove their professional negligence claim absent expert testimony and requesting that the negligence claim be dismissed.

At the close of appellees’ case, appellants motioned for compulsory non-suit on the grounds that appellees could not prove a connection between the alleged battery and the requested damages without expert testimony. The trial court denied the motion, finding that Montgomery’s testimony regarding his objection and reaction to the presence of the prosthesis and the fact that it was cumbersome did not require supporting expert testimony because the connection to the tortious conduct was obvious:</p>

This time, the trial court, after reviewing Montgomery’s testimony that he had a reduced or different physical sensation in his penis, was unable to feel the physical pleasures of intercourse and could not sustain an erection without inflating the prosthesis with a pump, determined that expert testimony was necessary to connect this sort of physical injury to the implantation of the prosthesis and granted a directed verdict as to those damages. As to the mental anguish and loss of consortium components of appellees’ claims, the trial court initially denied the motion for directed verdict on the same basis that it had denied appellants’ motion for non-suit. After further discussion with the parties, however, the trial court reversed itself and found that appellees’ claims for mental <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>anguish and loss of consortium also could not be sustained absent expert testimony. The trial court concluded that it could not determine the dividing line between which damages would require medical testimony and which would not.

    <p id="ASlO" data-blocks='[["BL_854.4",854,[248,650,1165,840]]]'>Upon appeal by the Montgomerys, a divided panel of the Superior Court issued a published opinion reversing and remanding to the trial court to permit appellees the opportunity to pursue the battery claim and certain claims for damages without the necessity of producing an expert witness. <em>Montgomery v. Bazaz-Sehgal, </em><a href="/a2d/742/1125-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="742 A.2d 1125" data-case-ids="11502886" data-case-paths="/a2d/742/1125-01">742 A.2d 1125</a>, 1134 (Pa.Super.1999). The majority opinion, authored by the late former President Judge Cirillo, began by opining that the differences between a medical battery case and “a medical malpractice informed consent case grounded in negligence” were at the “heart” of the appeal. Among those differences was the fact that an informed consent case requires expert medical testimony to establish the physician’s duty, while a medical battery claim requires only a showing of a non-consensual contact. The court then noted that the matter <em>sub judice </em>involves a battery claim, and not a claim of negligence/informed consent.</p>
    <p id="b854-5" data-blocks='[["BL_854.5",854,[244,1516,1164,843]],["BL_855.1",855,[181,334,1155,470]]]'>On the battery claim, the court concluded that the evidence that Dr. Seghal had implanted an inflatable prosthesis into John Montgomery’s penis, without his permission, was sufficient to warrant the jury in a finding that a battery was committed. Turning to the question of damages, and whether medical testimony was required to prove damages, the court took issue with the trial court’s inability to draw a “dividing line” between which alleged damages resulting from the battery would require medical expert testimony and which would not. In the Superior Court’s view, the law was clear that compensatory damages were available in a medical battery action, even in the absence of expert testimony, for “direct, obvious and foreseeable results” of the battery. It is only where the connection between the battery and the harm is not obvious that expert testimony is required. Applying this distinction, the court determined that any injury involving <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>Montgomery’s “physical sensation” would require expert testimony since, in light of his preexisting condition, the causal connection between the battery and any diminished physical sensation was not so obvious as to be within the range of ordinary experience of non-experts. On the other hand, the causal connection between the battery and the alleged mental and emotional injuries arising from a non-permitted implantation of the prosthesis was sufficiently clear and direct that that question should have been left to the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Although we disagree with the Superior Court on the latter point, that disagreement does not affect our ultimate judgment, for we agree with the Superior Court that expert testimony was not necessary for appellees’ mental and emotional damages claim to go to the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Since surgery performed without a patient’s informed consent constitutes a technical battery, negligence principles generally do not apply. It follows, of course, that a claim involving a surgical procedure performed without any consent at all by the patient, such as the implantation in the case <em>sub judiee, </em>also sounds in battery, and negligence requirements have no bearing on the matter. Indeed, a claim concerning the lack of consent for surgery can be maintained even where there is no allegation of negligence in the actual performance of the procedure. While negligence claims and informed consent claims often co-exist in the same tort action, they need not do so. A lack of informed consent or a lack of consent claim is actionable even if the subject surgery was properly performed and the overall result is beneficial.</p>

Specifically, appellees testified that, during consented-to revascularization surgery on Montgomery, Sehgal implanted a penile prosthesis without Montgomery’s knowledge or consent. This contact left a palpable reminder in the form of the prosthesis, which Montgomery discovered only after he awoke. This evidence was sufficient to allow a jury to pass on the question of whether Sehgal committed a battery.</p>

Thus, John Montgomery spoke of diminished sensation in his penis during intercourse, the fact that he could not achieve an erection without pumping up the device and that he experienced pain and discomfort “like sitting on a pin cushion” emanating from the device itself. Likewise, Marsha Montgomery testified that John was in a great deal of pain subsequent to the procedure. But there was also ample evidence of anguish and harm arising from the very fact of the presence of the unwanted device. John Montgomery testified that the prosthesis was cumbersome and embarrassing, and made him feel like a machine because he had to pump the prosthesis in order to achieve an erection.

Expert testimony obviously was required to prove that Montgomery’s physical injuries resulted from the implantation of the device. This is true particularly in light of Montgomery’s prior medical history, which included difficulties with premature ejaculation and soft erections. Absent expert testimony, the ordinary layperson would be unqualified to determine whether these diminished physical sensations were a result of the prosthesis or a result of the natural progression of Montgomery’s pre-existing condition.</p>

It is within the range of comprehension of jurors whether emotional injuries might reasonably be attributable to the implantation of a penile prosthesis to which a patient did not consent and which he first became aware of only after awaking from anesthesia and being presented with a warranty card for the device. John Montgomery spoke directly to the emotional difference between his pre-existing condition and his condition after implantation of the prosthesis. The.jury did not require an expert to explain to it the connection between an unwanted implantation of a penile prosthesis and the emotional injuries for which appellees sought recovery.

Indeed, there would appear to be good reasons for the Court to select an appropriate case to undertake a reevaluation of the battery paradigm for informed consent, particularly in light of: the weight of authority in other jurisdictions; <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> the arguable incompatibility of the battery theory (and the corresponding concept of touching) with evaluation of informed consent in the context of some medical treatments such radiation therapy and administration of oral medications; the arguable disharmony between intentional tort theory and its associated scienter requirements with informed consent claims; and the discomfort of various appellate jurists with the approach such as is apparent from their opinions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Of <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>particular significance, the Court has not yet taken the opportunity to consider a series of recent legislative modifications to the informed consent statute,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> which, on their face, appear to incorporate central concepts of negligence theory.</p>
