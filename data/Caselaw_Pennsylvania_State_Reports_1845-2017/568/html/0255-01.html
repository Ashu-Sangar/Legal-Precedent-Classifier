Both parties subsequently moved for summary judgment. The trial court determined that the Pennland policy alone afforded primary insurance coverage; the Harleysville excess policy alone occupied the next, or secondary, tier of coverage; and the Aetna auto policy stood alone at the third tier of coverage.

However, we do not reach the same result as in those cases for the simple reason that the “other insurance” provisions in those policies did not specify that coverage was excess only over <em>“primary insurance </em>”, as does the Harleysville policy. Given the plain terms of the policies in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we conclude that the limits of the Harleysville policy must be exhausted before the Aetna policy is implicated.</p>

Harleysville notes that "primary policy” is defined in the Harleysville policy as "the underlying policies shown in the Declarations.” Harleysville maintains that "[t]his definition is modified, however, in the Other Insurance clause to include <em>all </em>underlying policies, <em>whether or not shown in the declarations.” </em>Harleysville’s brief at 22 n. 9 (emphasis in original).' In point of fact, the Harleysville policy's "other insurance" provision does not include the phrase "all underlying policies”, but refers only to "any valid and collectible primary insurance.”</p>

The Harleysville policy provides in pertinent part: "If other insurance provides for payment only in excess of a stated amount of liability for each occurrence, we will pay only our share. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total limits of all applicable policies providing insurance on that basis.” The Aetna policy provides in pertinent part: “If there is other applicable liability insurance we will pay only our share. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits.”</p>
