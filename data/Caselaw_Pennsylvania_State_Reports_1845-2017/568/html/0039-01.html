The purpose of this reconstruction was to afford a more controlled, orderly and safe traffic operational pattern in this area. The railroad tracks located within the project limits are owned by the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), and have been predominantly resurfaced. In 1986, in a proceeding before <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>the Interstate Commerce Commission, Conrail was granted authority to abandon the twenty-three rail-highway crossings that are the subject of this appeal.</p>

Approval of the project meant that any utility using the public right-of-way along this portion of Delaware Avenue, would have to relocate its facilities. PECO, Bell, the Philadelphia Gas Works, and the City of Philadelphia (City) all maintain facilities within the public right-of-way inside the project area. The Department and Conrail entered into a stipulation whereby Conrail agreed to pay the Department approximately $460,000.00 towards the project. Subsequently, the Department entered into stipulations with various municipal utilities to share the costs of relocation of their facilities that would be impacted by the reconstruction. The Department, however, did not enter into agreements with either PECO or Bell to share the costs of relocating any of their facilities located in the rights-of-way along Delaware Avenue. Consequently, both sought reimbursement from the Department for all costs actually incurred in connection with the removal and replacement of the PECO and Bell facilities; PECO sought $2,590,704.00 and Bell, $108,000.00. While the Department was using federal and state monies to fund the project, the Department had not applied for any federal funding to cover relocation costs for non-municipal public utilities and, therefore, refused to agree to reimburse PECO and Bell for the aforementioned costs.</p>

At the hearing, the ALJ admitted into evidence exhibits submitted by the City, the Department, PECO, Bell and Conrail. Further, a number of late-filed exhibits were admitted after the hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It was established that PECO had facilities <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>located in the Delaware Avenue right-of-way, but no documentary evidence was submitted in the form of permits to substantiate or define PECO’s authorization to place and maintain its facilities in the public right-of-way. On November 30, 1998, the ALJ issued a Recommended Decision containing thirty-eight findings of fact and five conclusions of law, and decided that the Department should reimburse PECO and Bell in full for their relocation expenses, minus any betterment to their facilities. The ALJ considered the following as a basis for his Recommended Decision: (1) benefits received by the ratepayers of the particular utility; (2) the availability of state and/or federal funding for the project; (3) imposing costs upon the party responsible for the situation (typically referred to as the “cost causer”); and (4) any additional equities relevant to the particular situation.

Historically, Pennsylvania’s non-transportation public utilities have been permitted to occupy highway rights-of-way free of cost, subject and subordinate to the police power of the Commonwealth to control and regulate the highways for the benefit of the public, such as in construction, relocation, alteration, protection or abolition of rail-highway crossings. <em>Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania v.

At common law, utilities were permitted to occupy highway rights-of-way without cost but could be ordered by the state or a municipal agency to remove and relocate their facilities, at the sole cost and expense of the utility. <em>See generally, City of Philadelphia; Delaware River Port Authority; Department of Highways v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm’n, </em><a href="/pa/394/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="394 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1280934" data-case-paths="/pa/394/0031-01">394 Pa. 31</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.2d%20538" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="145 A.2d 538">145 A.2d 538</a> (1958). The benefits to the utilities in locating along public rights-of-way were significant because, although they obtained no property rights in the highway right-of-way, they were not required to purchase expensive private rights-of-way or pay fees, taxes or upkeep for locating their facilities there. Thus, the basis for the common law rule was that, although the utility was permitted to use the right-of-way because it served a public interest, the primary purpose of the public easement was the public’s own use; any use by a public utility was subordinate to the interest of the public. Hence, any utility that chose to locate its facilities in a public right-of-way ran the risk that the public welfare would require changes that would mandate relocation of its facilities.</p>

PECO complains that the determination by the Commission that PECO’s ratepayers should bear the burden of its relocation costs because PECO has received, and continues to receive, substantial benefits from the location of its facilities in public rights-of-way, simply resurrects the old common law rule that utilities that occupy public rights-of-way are not entitled to compensation if forced to relocate their facilities because of rail-highway improvement projects. PECO posits that to apply the rationale underlying an abrogated common law rule defies logic and constitutes application of the rule itself. PECO also maintains that, if the Commission is permitted to utilize the <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>common law rationale, it will become the dispositive factor in any cost allocation decision that the Commission makes.</p>

The General Assembly has expressed its intention that the Commission should have the power to impose those costs on “the public utilities or municipal corporations ... concerned, or [on] the Commonwealth, in such proper proportions as the commission may, after due notice and hearing, determine ....” 66 Pa.C.S. § 2704(a) (emphasis added).

As a guide in the exercise of its discretion in cost allocation decisions, the Commission has emphasized four factors of the many it has considered, which include: (1) the party who originally built the crossing; (2) the relative benefits initially conferred by the construction of the crossing; (3) the party who is responsible for the deterioration of the crossing; and (4) the benefits accrued from the reconstruction of the crossing. <em>Application of the City of Wilkes Barre, </em>PUC Docket No. [ A-XXXXXXXX ] (filed April 9, 1981).

Consequently, the Commission based its decision on factors relevant to the matter before it and not blind adherence to an abrogated common law rule. We observe that the common law rule required that utilities pay all of the costs of relocation. What was abrogated was the requirement that the utilities remain unreimbursed, regardless of the equities of the reimbursement decision, rather than an outright determination by the General Assembly that the Commission should not consider any benefit to the utility in arriving at its decision. Attributing such <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>intent to the General Assembly would negate any allocation to the utility and render superfluous the portion of the statute that conferred discretion on the Commission to apportion relocation costs to the utility.</p>
    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[248,538,1169,679]]]'>PECO also complains that part of the Commission’s reasoning was based on its finding that no federal funds were available to reimburse non-transportation public utilities for their relocation costs. PECO asserts that this is so because the Department, which has adopted a policy that it not pay for relocating non-transportation facilities, circumvents any order to reimburse by the Commission by applying for federal funding for a project prior to any cost allocation hearing. •Thus, PECO contends, the Department is applying the common law rule and the Commission has turned the policy of the Department into a <em>de facto </em>regulation. We cannot agree with PECO on this point. The policies of the Department are not presently before this Court.</p>

The decision of the Commonwealth Court has created an artificial limitation on the results that the Commission can reach and impinged on the discretion of the Commission by removing the possibility that a non-transportation public utility could be required to bear its own relocation costs because of any benefit derived from its location in a public right-of-way. The Commission determined from the record not only that PECO received substantial benefits from locating its facilities in the public l’ights-of-way along Delaware Avenue, which fact PECO had admitted, but also that federal funding was unavailable to reimburse PECO’s relocation costs. The Commission also reviewed the role of the Department as the “cost causer,” but declined to attach any weight to this determination. We cannot view the Commission determination, as defined by the Commonwealth Court, as solely based on the abrogated common law rule. Moreover, as the legislature directed, the <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>Commission may assign relocation costs to the utilities, to the Commonwealth, or to any combination of the two. The legislature clearly did not intend to limit the discretion of the Commission as to an award of relocation costs, but expanded that discretion by removing the requirement contained in the common law rule that the Commission must allocate all of the cost for relocation to the utilities themselves. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that the Commission may not consider the factors underlying the common law rule when making a cost allocation.</p>

Further, the Commission determined that the relocation work performed by PECO would result in a betterment to some of PECO’s facilities. The record indicates that PECO intended to replace old lead paper-encased copper wire with new, higher capacity aluminum wire. Additionally, PECO observed that it would replace existing terra cotta or fiberboard ducts with new and larger PVC pipe. The Department presented testimony explaining the potential for increased capacity resulting from the installation of the new materials. These factors properly weighed in favor of an assignment of the relocation costs to PECO because PECO and its ratepayers would be the primary beneficiaries of the improved facilities.</p>

The use of federal funding to reimburse a utility for its relocation costs <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>is predicated on the Department’s obligation under State law to do so. <a href="/citations/?q=23%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20654.107" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="23 C.F.R. § 654.107">23 C.F.R. § 654.107</a>.

Moreover, even if one did, the Commission does not consider the availability of outside funding as a sufficient reason alone to justify allocating relocation costs to the Department.</p>

Moreover, the Commission noted that the record was silent as to the party responsible for the deteriorating conditions in the project area that necessitated the improvements to the affected crossings. The Commission determined that the Department should not be penalized for conducting a highway safety improvement project and that it was unrealistic to expect the Department to wait until all utility facilities in a project area had reached the end of their useful lives before commencing a project needed to ensure the safety of the public. Thus, while the Commission considered this factor, it did not assign it much weight.
