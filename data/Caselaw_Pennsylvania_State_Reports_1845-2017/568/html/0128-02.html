Const, art. 1, §§ 1 and 26, and the free and equal elections clause, Pa. Const, art. 1, § 5.

We believe such a narrow interpretation to be discordant with the reality of challenging a reapportionment scheme. In mounting such an attack, a litigant cannot logically confine his challenge to his particular district. A reapportionment plan acts as an interlocking jigsaw puzzle, each piece reliant upon its neighbors to establish a picture of the whole. An allegation that a litigant’s district was improperly gerrymandered necessarily involves a critique of the plan beyond the borders of his district.

In support of this contention, they note that the United States Constitution has given the state legislatures the power to draw congressional reapportionment plans. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, art.

We reject Petitioners’ arguments that we should declare that the right to vote guaranteed by our Commonwealth’s Constitution provides broader protections than those guaranteed by the federal Equal Protection Clause. We come to this conclusion for two reasons. First, to the extent that Petitioners’ gerrymandering claim is predicated on the equal protection <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>guarantee contained in Pa.

Second, we reject Petitioners’ claim that the Pennsylvania Constitution’s free and equal elections clause provides further protection to the right to vote than does the Equal Protection Clause. Petitioners provide us with no persuasive argument as to why we should, at this juncture, interpret our constitution in such a fashion that the right to vote is more expansive than the guarantee found in the federal constitution. <em>See generally Commonwealth v.

Yet, we find that by carefully parsing out the plurality’s language, we can arrive at a simple (although decidedly not simplistic) recitation of the test. Distilled to its essence, the plurality’s test states that a plaintiff raising a gerrymandering claim must establish that there was intentional discrimination against an identifiable political group and that there was an actual discriminatory effect on that group. <em>Bandemer, </em><a href="/us/478/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="478 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="6204370" data-case-paths="/us/478/0109-01">478 U.S. at 127</a>, <a href="/us/478/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="478 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="6204370" data-case-paths="/us/478/0109-01">106 S.Ct. 2797</a>.

The appellees, several Indiana Democrats, challenged the reapportionment plan, alleging that the plan constituted a political gerrymander intended to disadvantage Democrats. A three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana was convened to hear the claims; Elections were held under the new districting plan before the case was heard. Two years later, the divided district court issued a decision declaring the reapportionment to be unconstitutional and ordered the legislature to prepare a new plan. The United States Supreme Court reversed. A majority of the Court concluded that political gerrymandering was a justiciable question, but concluded that the district court had applied the incorrect standard in finding unconstitutional vote dilution.</p>
