Clearly, this administrative matter is within the supervisory power of this Court.</p>
    <p id="b510-8" data-blocks='[["BL_510.7",510,[247,1489,1163,635]]]'>i While Respondent does not dispute the authority of this Court to take action in this case, Respondent argues that the better course would be for this Court to decline exercising its jurisdiction and defer to the procedures set forth in the Pennsylvania Constitution relating to the Judicial Conduct Board. Specifically, Respondent argues that this Court would need to proceed as fact-finder in order to evaluate the current claim and determine an appropriate sanction. Respondent points out that the procedures set forth in Article V, Section 18 vest the Board with investigative powers, adversarial procedures and confidentiality protections that are not available in the within process. We disagree.</p>

Contrary to Respondent’s assertion that this Court will, necessarily, have to ■ engage in fact-finding, we note that here, based upon the <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>petition and the answer, there is no dispute of fact regarding Respondent’s failure, on several occasions, to meet with Petitioners regarding his judicial assignment. Respondent’s explanation for his failures in this regard does not compel a different result. Moreover, Respondent does not dispute that he attempted to resume his judicial duties without first meeting with Petitioners to discuss his assignment. While we do not view Respondent’s behavior as specifically rising to the level of Judge Avellino’s conduct,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> we conclude that the imposition of a thirty day suspension without pay is the proper response to Respondent’s unjustified defiance of Petitioners’ directives and our legitimate supervisory and administrative authority.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
