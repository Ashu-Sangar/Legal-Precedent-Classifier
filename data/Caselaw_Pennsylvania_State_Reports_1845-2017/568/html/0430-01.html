In addition, appellant sought a declaration that the manner by which the Board is selected may not be changed until all outstanding bonds of the PPA are fully met and discharged, as well as a temporary and permanent injunction preventing the seating of any new members of the Board until such bonds are fully met and discharged. Section 5508.1 authorizes the Governor to appoint immediately six additional members to the Board, to fill any vacancies in the Board as they arise, and to remove Board members upon clear and convincing evidence of misfeasance or malfeasance in office. <em>See </em>53 Pa.C.S. § 5508.1(e)-(h). In point of fact, the Governor did act to implement the new legislation by appointing six new members of the Board. Indeed, it was this action that triggered the instant lawsuit. Appellant’s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, if granted, would act to restrict the Governor and necessarily implicate the Governor’s specific powers and interest under Act 22.</p>
    <p id="b705-5" data-blocks='[["BL_705.4",705,[175,1577,1154,797]],["BL_706.1",706,[258,330,1165,840]]]'>I do not doubt the validity of the appellant’s argument that the fact that a challenged statute may be declared unconstitutional does not, of itself, make the Governor an indispensable party to an action. <em>See Pennsylvania School Boards, </em>696 A.2d at 867-68. Indeed, if that were the law, the Governor could be deemed indispensable to every action challenging the constitutionality of legislation. Here, however, the nature of the Governor’s interest is decidedly not, as appellant contends, merely a generic interest in seeing Act 22 declared lawful; it is a specific interest having to do with the unique character of this legislation, and the Governor’s authority under the statute. The challenged statute grants to the Governor certain powers and duties with respect to its implementation. Those powers are not merely ministerial. By vesting in the Governor the power to decide who will control the PPA, the legisla<a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>tion authorizes the Governor to frame and attempt to promote certain policies. Indeed, it is this very fact which aggrieves the City, <em>i.e., </em>the fact that it will be the Governor, rather than the Mayor, to whom the Board now will be responsible. No doubt this explains why the City sought to enjoin the seating of the new Board and joined the Governor in its federal lawsuit. The Governor thus has a direct interest in the litigation, <em>i.e., </em>an interest in participating in the determination of the validity and scope of his authority under this unique, take-over legislation. This is an interest that is not shared by the named defendants or any other party. <em>Contrast id. </em>at 868 (Governor not indispensable to counts challenging legality of law since they are not “directed towards the Governor in any way, and <em>law ... does not give the Governor any powers or duties with respect to its enforcement or administration”) </em>(emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b706-4" data-blocks='[["BL_706.4",706,[256,1196,1164,996]]]'>, This is not to say that the Governor is indispensable to any dispute involving a governmental body appointed by the Governor. Owing to the Governor’s expansive appointive powers, such a rule would render the. Governor indispensable to a vast number of lawsuits, many of which would, at most, only tangentially implicate his interests. This matter, however, is not a garden-variety action involving a governmental entity whose members happen to have been appointed by the Governor. It is a direct, constitutional challenge by the City of the Philadelphia to the very statutory provision authorizing the Governor to appoint and monitor the members of the Authority’s governing body and thereby direct PPA policy. It involves a statute that dramatically shifts control of an agency from the Mayor to the Governor. Moreover, the complaint seeks declaratory relief. <em>See </em>discussion <em>infra. </em>Where, as here, the Governor’s, appointive power is not merely incidental to the declaratory judgment litigation, but, in fact, is the <em>sine qua non </em>of the dispute, I believe that the Governor has a right to be heard in the matter.</p>

A party is essential if his “rights are so directly connected with and affected by [the] litigation that <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>he must be a party of record to protect such rights.” <em>Mechanicsburg, </em><a href="/pa/494/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="494 Pa. 476" data-case-ids="1769078" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0476-01">431 A.2d at 957</a> (quoting <em>Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v.

Appellant argues that granting its requested relief will not affect the Governor since he has already appointed six members to the Board pursuant to Act 22 and these individuals have taken their seats on the governing body.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> This argument ignores the fact that the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by appellant would nullify the appointments and remove the Governor from <em>any </em>role in the management or oversight of the PPA. <em>See </em>Commonwealth Court Slip Op. at 10 (“there is no question that the relief sought, <em>i.e., </em>a declaration • that Act 22 is unconstitutional, would, of necessity void the Governor’s appointments”). Moreover, the Governor has ongoing powers, <em>i.e., </em>to fill vacancies on the Board and to monitor and remove members for wrongdoing, which would also be abrogated by the invalidation of Act 22. Given the centrality of the Governor’s role in the legislative recasting of the administrative structure of the PPA, and the Governor’s decision to act' under the new legislation, the question of whether the General Assembly’s shifting of control of the PPA from the Mayor to the Governor was constitutional and otherwise lawful obviously is a matter that the Governor has a right upon which to be heard— irrespective of the position the Governor might ultimately take on the question.</p>

Appellant cites <em>Centolanza </em>and <em>CRY </em>in support of this argument. In <em>Centolanza, </em>the Court held that the Department of Environmental Resources (DER) was not essential to the case <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>since the plaintiffs had “not alleged that the Commonwealth ... failed to halt, cease, or abate the nuisance [complained of in the action and] the Centolanzas did not request any type of relief directly involving the Commonwealth.” <a href="/pa/540/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="658 A.2d 336" data-case-ids="472215,7864868" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0398-01,/a2d/658/0336-01">658 A.2d at 339</a>. In <em>CRY, </em>by contrast, the plaintiffs accused the DER, of failing to halt the defendant’s illegal discharge of hazardous waste and sought relief which, among other things, would require the Commonwealth to forebear in the issuance of any further permits to defendant as well, as the appointment of a natural resources trustee over defendant’s property. This Court held that DER was indispensable to the action. Appellant alleges that, like the plaintiffs in <em>Centolanza, </em>and unlike the plaintiffs in <em>CRY, </em>it is not claiming any wrongdoing on the part of the Governor and is not asking the Governor to do, or refrain from doing, anything. Thus, appellant argues, the Governor is not essential to the litigation. A closer examination of the cases shows that appellant is ihistaken.</p>
    <p id="b708-4" data-blocks='[["BL_708.4",708,[259,1234,1163,790]]]'>
      <em>Centolanza </em>involved an action by private citizens alleging that at least one of the defendants’ storage tanks and/or connecting pipes had leaked onto their property. The plaintiffs sought payment for the anticipated oil contamination cleanup costs and diminution in the value of their property under the Storage Tank and Spill Prevention Act. An issue arose as to whether the courts had jurisdiction to hear the matter because the plaintiffs had failed to join DER as an indispensable party. We held that DER was not essential to the case because the plaintiffs had not alleged that DER engaged in any wrongdoing with respect to its regulatory obligations nor had the plaintiffs requested any type of relief directly involving the Commonwealth. Accordingly, this Court held that DER was not indispensable to the action and that this Court had jurisdiction to resolve the appeal.</p>

The relief sought by the plaintiffs included enjoining the defendant from disposing or treating hazardous wastes at the site; enjoining the Commonwealth from issuing any further permits allowing the defendant to continue its <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>waste storage activities; and appointing a trustee of natural resources for the facility. Applying the <em>Mechanicsburg </em>criteria, this Court held that “[bjecause DER’s regulatory activity may be affected by any order entered in th[e] case, and because compliance with that order may require the cooperation of DER, its interest is essential.” <a href="/pa/536/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="640 A.2d 372" data-case-ids="1843154,7861709" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0462-01,/a2d/640/0372-01">640 A.2d at 376</a>. In addition, we noted that if DER were not a party to the suit, it would not be required to cooperate in the carrying out of any judicial remedy fashioned by the court, and such non-cooperation would, in all likelihood, require further litigation. We concluded, therefore, that DER must be included in the action.</p>
    <p id="b709-4" data-blocks='[["BL_709.4",709,[182,913,1156,1275]]]'>Appellant’s emphasis on the nature of the relief requested in its pleading ignores the context of this case. Unlike <em>Centolanza </em>and <em>CRY, </em>where the plaintiffs sought monetary damages or other remedial measures, appellant here seeks declaratory relief. Appellant seeks a declaration that Act 22 is unconstitutional, or, at a minimum, a declaration that the manner by which the Board is selected may not be changed until all outstanding bonds of the PPA are fully met and discharged. Thus, a focus on whether the plaintiffs have accused the Commonwealth of wrongdoing or sought relief specifically against a Commonwealth party is simply not appropriate here. Indeed, appellant does not allege that it has been aggrieved by <em>any </em>specific party, including the named defendants. The challenge, instead, is to the Act itself. Pennsylvania law is clear that in a declaratory judgment action <em>all </em>interested parties must be joined, regardless of the parties named in the pleadings. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 7540(A) (“When declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding”); <em>see also Mains v.

Under such a rule, a plaintiff could, through intentionally incomplete or tactical pleading, effectively preclude the joinder of a party whose rights are directly at issue and could be prejudiced by the litigation. The absence of an indispensable party, however, goes to the court’s jurisdiction. “[Ujnless all indispensable parties are made parties to an action, a court is powerless to grant relief.” <em>Sprague v.

Authorities are “public corporations, being corporate agencies, engaged in the administration of civil government.” Generally, authorities are established for the purpose of financing and managing various revenue producing projects of a public nature or other activities that are not considered to be part of core governmental activities; they are a governmental business venture, a form of quasi-privatization.
