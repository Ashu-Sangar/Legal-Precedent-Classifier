In <em>D.M., </em>this Court held that when a defendant has been tried and acquitted of a criminal offense, he is entitled to expunction of the arrest record as a matter of law, and that the <em>Wexler </em>balancing test is unnecessary and inappropriate. Just as we found it “improper to go behind a verdict of acquittal and purport to assess the strength of the prosecution’s case” in attempting to apply the first factor of the <em>Wexler </em>balancing test in a criminal expungement matter, <em>see D.M., </em><a href="/a2d/695/0770-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="695 A.2d 770" data-case-ids="11971819,960452" data-case-paths="/a2d/695/0770-01,/pa/548/0131-01">695 A.2d at 772</a>, it is equally improper to assess the strength of a PFAA petition that has since been dismissed by court order before the plaintiff even attempted to meet its burden of proving the allegation of abuse contained in the PFAA petition, in attempting to apply the <em>Wexler </em>balancing test in a PFAA expungement matter. We therefore hold that the <em>Wexler </em>balancing is unnecessary when: (1) a PFAA petition filed against a PFAA defendant has been dismissed by court order, as in <em>P.E.S.; </em>or (2) the PFAA proceedings never evolve beyond the temporary order stage,, as in the instant case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>
