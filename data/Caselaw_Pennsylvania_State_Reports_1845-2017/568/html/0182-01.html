On September 1, 1996, Labor Day, a group of family members gathered at Jay’s Big Shot Bar, which is located on the corner of Narragansett Street and Stenton Avenue in the City of Philadelphia. The family included Bernard Jackson (Jackson), his fiancée Ramona Caldwell, James Jefferson (Jefferson), his fiancée Marie Williams (Williams), Randall Rogers (Rogers), his fiancée Evette Bell, and Gilbert Green (Green).</p>
    <p id="b462-8" data-blocks='[["BL_462.8",462,[247,1376,1161,247]]]'>At approximately 1:00 a.m., Appellant entered the bar with two friends. Appellant and his friends ordered two forty-ounce beers from bartender, Jerry Fluellen. Appellant talked with Sheila Holloway and then moved to an area near the middle of the establishment.</p>
    <p id="b462-9" data-blocks='[["BL_462.9",462,[246,1657,1162,579]]]'>A verbal confrontation erupted between one of Appellant’s friends and Green. The situation ended quickly and the two men shook hands. Then, Jefferson joined the group of men. At some point, the bartender asked Appellant and his friends to take the argument outside or drop it. Green told Jefferson that there was not a problem and then walked toward the bar and sat down, turning his back to Appellant and the door that lead to Stenton Avenue (Stenton door). Some of the family members gathered at- the bar- opposite the Stenton door. Several individuals sat in a row with Rogers to the right of Green and an empty barstool between Rogers and Jackson.</p>

He shot <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>Jackson in the back, killing him. Appellant also shot Rogers twice in the lower back. A bullet grazed the chest of Williams, who had returned to her place at the bar just before the shooting. Both Rogers and Williams survived. Jefferson, who had been standing behind Appellant in the doorway of the Stenton door, ran outside. Appellant shot Jefferson in the back, which caused his death.</p>

Someone from Appellant’s family called the police. At 3:30 a.m. that same night, police arrived at the apartment and arrested Appellant. Police discovered two spent .357 caliber shells in Appellant’s pocket and recovered a .357 magnum revolver, containing three live rounds, from underneath a sofa cushion in the apartment.</p>

New counsel represented Appellant. On December 17, 1998, the jury returned the sentence of death on each of the two murder convictions after finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. For each of the first-degree murder charges, the jury found two aggravating circumstances: (1) Appellant caused a grave risk of death to another person and (2) Appellant had been convicted of another murder at the time of the offense at issue. Addition<a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>ally, for both convictions, the jury found two mitigating circumstances (1) the capacity of Appellant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct had been substantially impaired and (2) Appellant had allowed himself to be turned over to the police after the murders. The trial court imposed a sentence of death for each first-degree murder conviction and an aggregate consecutive term of twenty to forty years imprisonment on Appellant’s remaining charges.</p>

Then, after hearing gunshots, Appellant said that he panicked. Appellant testified that at that point he pulled out his gun and fired at his attacker. Consequently, Appellant contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove that Appellant had the specific intent to kill and that he killed with deliberation.</p>

When Appellant testified, he admitted that he pointed his weapon toward people and “shot until [his] gun was empty.” (N.T. 10/10/97, p. 159). Appellant shot both of the victims, who were unarmed, in their backs. Additionally, when the police arrested Appellant at his sister’s apartment several hours after the shooting, the officers discovered a .357 magnum revolver containing three live rounds and two spent .357 caliber shells in Appellant’s pocket. Appellant admitted that the .357 magnum was his gun. Police Officer Abdur-Rahin, of the Firearms Identification Unit of the Philadelphia Police Unit, testified that a bullet found on the floor of the bar was fired from Appellant’s gun. Also, Officer Abdur-Rahin stated that a bullet, which had been removed from one of the victims that had survived the shooting, had been fired from Appellant’s gun. Based upon our examination of the record, we conclude that the Commonwealth adequately established the specific intent of the Appellant to kill. We hold that the evidence sufficiently supports both of Appellant’s convictions for first-degree murder.</p>

The instruction in this case sought to channel the focus of the jury on concerns appropriate to its sentencing function and away from arbitrary and capricious considerations. While the present instruction was contrary to Pennsylvania law, we fail to see how an instruction that was more restrictive on the consideration of victim impact evidence than Pennsylvania law permits was unfair to Appellant. In the present case, the error of the trial court in instructing the jury regarding victim impact evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and Appellant is not entitled a new sentencing hearing.</p>

Grace Flannery, a drug and alcohol abuse counselor, testified that she treated Appellant for drug and alcohol addiction from January through March of 1995. (N.T. 12/11/98, pp. 97-103). The treatment sessions occurred over one year before Appellant committed the crimes at issue and Flannery did not offer any opinion as to Appellant’s mental or emotional state on the night of the shootings. Next, Leondra Rice, Appellant’s father, testified that Appellant was under the influence of drugs around four or five o’clock in the afternoon the day of the crime. (N.T. 12/14/98, pp. 37-38). Eight hours elapsed between when Mr. Rice saw Appellant and when Appellant fired shots in the bar. Mr. Rice did not testify that Appellant was high at the time of the crime.

You may consider this victim impact evidence in determining the appropriateness of the death penalty only if you first find that the existence of one or more aggravating circumstances has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt independent from the victim impact evidence, and if one or more jurors has found that one or more mitigating circumstances have been established by a preponderance of the evidence. Victim impact evidence is simply another method of informing you about the nature and circumstances of the crime in question. You may consider this evidence in determining an appropriate punishment. However, the law does not deem the life of one victim more valuable than another; rather, victim impact evidence shows that the victim, like the defendant, is a unique individual. Your consideration must be limited to a rational inquiry into the culpability of the defendant, not an emotional response to the evidence.

The circumstances of the instant case illustrate my point. Here, four witnesses were called upon to testify on behalf of the two murder victims. The victim impact witnesses testified as to the personal pain they had endured as a result of the murders. They explained in great detail how their daily lives had changed, describing sleepless nights, grim holidays and concerns for some of the children left fatherless by the killings. The Court has great concern for the tragic consequences arising from the commission of a criminal homicide and we are <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>sympathetic to the sheer torment suffered by the families of the victims in this case and in many others. We have an obligation, however, to follow the law and adhere to the narrowly crafted sentencing scheme that is essential to avoid the capricious and arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.</p>
    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[257,612,1163,896]]]'>The capital sentencing scheme was simply not crafted as a mechanism for an outpouring of victim’s grief, no matter how redacted, rehearsed or restricted the manner of presentation may be. The very nature of victim impact evidence is extremely prejudicial and could persuade a fair-minded juror in any capital case to resolve that the perpetrator of such sorrow be sentenced to death. Would the murders at issue be any less egregious if the victims were not upstanding citizens? Should Appellant be executed on the basis that a victim of his crime had children and family members who loved him? Or in the converse, should a perpetrator of a dastardly crime escape the ultimate penalty, that being death, simply because the victim was not the benefactor of friends, family, associates or loved ones? Query, then, where is the middle ground? I would choose life until such is resolved — for the whole purpose of the sentencing scheme, as noted <em>supra, </em>is to avoid the capricious and arbitrary imposition of death.</p>

Means, </em><a href="/pa/565/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="194" data-cite="565 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="124727,124760" data-case-paths="/pa/565/0309-01,/pa/565/0309-02">565 Pa. 309</a>, <a href="/a2d/773/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="195" data-cite="773 A.2d 143" data-case-ids="11088943,11089010,124727,124760" data-case-paths="/a2d/773/0143-01,/a2d/773/0143-02,/pa/565/0309-01,/pa/565/0309-02">773 A.2d 143</a>, 162-67 (2001), I believe that Pennsylvania’s statutory provisions governing victim impact evidence in the penalty phase of capital cases, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9711(a)(2) &amp; (c)(2), violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Despite my continuing belief that this statutory scheme is constitutionally infirm, I recognize that a majority of this Court has concluded that 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9711(a)(2) &amp; (c)(2) are constitutionally valid. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at. 351; <em>Means, </em><a href="/a2d/773/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="196" data-cite="773 A.2d 143" data-case-ids="11088943,11089010,124727,124760" data-case-paths="/a2d/773/0143-01,/a2d/773/0143-02,/pa/565/0309-01,/pa/565/0309-02">773 A.2d at 148-57, 159</a> (Opinion Announcing the .Judgment of the Court and Saylor, J., concurring). I therefore am compelled to concur with the lead opinion’s conclusion that Appellant’s claims regarding victim impact evidence, including his constitutional challenge to 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9711(a)(2) &amp; (c)(2), must fail.</p>

      <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>In my dissent in <em>Means, </em>I set forth a series of procedural safeguards that would, in my view, prevent a jury from using-victim impact evidence in an arbitrary and capricious manner when deciding whether the death penalty is an appropriate sentence. <em>Means, </em><a href="/a2d/773/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="197" data-cite="773 A.2d 143" data-case-ids="11088943,11089010,124727,124760" data-case-paths="/a2d/773/0143-01,/a2d/773/0143-02,/pa/565/0309-01,/pa/565/0309-02">773 A.2d at 165-66</a> (Nigro, J., dissenting). In doing so, I borrowed heavily from the procedures adopted by New Jersey for use in its capital sentencing scheme. <em>Means, </em><a href="/a2d/773/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="198" data-cite="773 A.2d 143" data-case-ids="11088943,11089010,124727,124760" data-case-paths="/a2d/773/0143-01,/a2d/773/0143-02,/pa/565/0309-01,/pa/565/0309-02">773 A.2d at 165</a> (Nigro, J., dissenting); <em>see </em>N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3c(6); <em>State v. Muhammad, </em><a href="/nj/145/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="199" data-cite="145 N.J. 23" data-case-ids="819545" data-case-paths="/nj/145/0023-01">145 N.J. 23</a>, <a href="/nj/145/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="200" data-cite="145 N.J. 23" data-case-ids="819545" data-case-paths="/nj/145/0023-01">678 A.2d 164</a>, 179-81 (1996). I also noted my belief that a jury instruction consistent with these proposed safeguards should be given to ensure the fundamental fairness of a capital sentencing proceeding. <em>Means, </em><a href="/a2d/773/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="201" data-cite="773 A.2d 143" data-case-ids="11088943,11089010,124727,124760" data-case-paths="/a2d/773/0143-01,/a2d/773/0143-02,/pa/565/0309-01,/pa/565/0309-02">773 A.2d at 166</a> (Nigro, J., dissenting). In the instant case, the Opinion Announcing the Judgment finds that the jury instruction was based on New Jersey law rather than Pennsylvania law. Although the Opinion Announcing the Judgment ultimately concludes that the instruction was not prejudicial to Appellant, and finds no error for that reason, I would affirm the instruction on the basis that it was consistent with the scheme I suggested in <em>Means.</em>
