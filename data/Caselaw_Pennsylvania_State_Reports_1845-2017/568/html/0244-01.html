Greer settled his claim with Devlin prior to trial. The case proceeded to a jury trial against the remainder of the defendants in January 1998. Before the jury began deliberations, the trial court granted motions for non-suit filed by the City of Philadelphia and Fischbach &amp; Moore.

In spite of the broad language in the indemnity provision, this Court held that the agreement did not provide indemnity to the contractor for its own negligence, reaffirming the rule previously announced in <em>Perry v. Payne, </em><a href="/pa/217/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="217 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="953727" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0252-01">217 Pa. 252</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20553" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="66 A. 553">66 A. 553</a> (1907), that “if parties intend to include within the scope of their indemnity agreement a provision that covers losses due to the indemnitee’s own negligence, they must do so in clear and unequivocal language.

Moreover, as this Court noted in <em>Perry, </em>it would be “contrary to experience and against reason” for a contractor to agree to indemnify another for the other’s negligence, when such indemnification would subject it to “uncertain and indefinite” liability. <em>Perry, </em><a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20553" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="66 A. 553">66 A. at 555</a>.</p>

Contrary to their assertions, the language of the indemnity provision in no way demonstrates an unambiguous intention by CTS to provide indemnification for the negligence of the indemnitees, as required by the <em>Perry-Ruzzi </em>rule. By agreeing to language stating that PennDOT and Green were indemnified for damages <em>“only to the extent that” </em>the damages were caused by the negligence of CTS and its sub-subcontractors, <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>employees and anyone for whom it may be liable, the parties communicated their intent to limit any indemnification to that portion of damages attributed to the negligence of CTS and those under its supervision. The chosen language simply does not evince an intent to . provide indemnification for damages due to the negligence of other unspecified parties, including an indemnitee. Moreover, we read the second part of the provision, which states that the indemnity clause will apply “regardless of whether or not such claim ... is caused in whole or in part by a party indemnified hereunder,” merely to clarify that any contributory negligence by PennDOT and Green will not bar their indemnification for damages due to CTS’s negligence.</p>
    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[254,1033,1164,1108]]]'>In coming to this conclusion, we have carefully considered the interpretations' proffered by Green and PennDOT. However, Green’s interpretation, the broader of the two, ignores the plain language of the indemnity provision, which confers indemnity <em>“only to the extent” </em>that the damages and/or claims are caused in whole or in part by the negligence of CTS or its agents. In fact, when Green argues that the indemnity provision is unambiguous, it tellingly excludes the “to the extent” language from its quotation of the contractual provision. Instead, it asserts: “The language of the indemnity provision specifically presents the circumstances in which indemnity will be required. Those circumstances are when the claim is caused <em>‘in whole or in part by the negligent acts or omissions of the Subcontractor.’ ” </em>Green Brief at 10 (emphasis in original). However, this is simply not what the indemnity provision says. It does not state that Green and PennDOT are completely indemnified “when” or “if’ CTS is negligent. Rather, it states that they are indemnified <em>“to the extent” </em>that CTS is negligent. Despite Green’s attempt to discount the “to the extent” language, that language is in the plain text of the contract and clearly must be given effect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

PennDOT Brief at 11-12 (“[T]he ultimate question for disposition by the court is really only what effect should be given to the indemnification clause’s ‘but only to the extent’ phrase.”) As stated above, PennDOT argues that the phrase limits CTS’s assumption of PennDOT’s and Green’s liability to an amount equal to that for which CTS, its sub-subcontractors and employees were independently liable.</p>

While PennDOT calls the analysis in these cases “unsophisticated and simplistic,” PennDOT Brief at 35, we find the cases to be persuasive evidence that the interpretation PennDOT advocates is anything but the clear and unambiguous meaning of the contractual language. In particular, in <em>Hagerman Construction Corp. v.

At a minimum, the indemnity provision provides PennDOT and Green with an additional means of recovering any amount they might be compelled to pay on account of CTS’s negligence. In addition, it unambiguously entitles them to recover attorney’s fees and other expenses arising out of CTS’s negligence, which they might not otherwise be able to recover.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Moreover, the indemnity provision gives them a meaningful benefit in that it unconditionally obligates CTS to indemnify them not only for its own negligence, but also for the negligence of its sub-subcontractors and “direct or indirect” employees. Accordingly, we do not agree that our interpretation of the provision renders it meaningless, when such an interpretation gives PennDOT and Green significant relief beyond that to which they are entitled under Pennsylvania’s contribution statute.</p>

PennDOT urges us to "reject <em>Ruzzt's </em>anachronistic views,” PennDOT Brief at 37, and instead to embrace "the most modem, most reasonable, and best and most correct approach," <em>id. </em>at 41, which, in its view, is to no longer subject provisions allegedly providing for indemnification of a party for its own negligence to "strict scrutiny.” <em>Id. </em>at 37-38. This argument is curious given PennDOT’s assertion elsewhere in its brief that Pennsylvania is in the minority of states that do not statutorily <em>prohibit </em>either indemnification generally or indemnification of a party for its own negligence. <em>See id. </em>at 27 n. 20. In any event, we do not believe that <em>Ruzzi’s </em>rule is "anachronistic,” but rather, continue to believe that it is a sound rule, carefully designed to ensure that no party is unwittingly subjected to liability that we have characterized as "hazardous . .. unusual and extraordinary.” <em>Perry, </em><a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20553" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="66 A. 553">66 A. at 557</a>.</p>

Under either approach, the resulting indemnification would be the same in light of the unique circumstances of this case, where PennDOT, Green and CTS were each found to be 22% liable. Namely, CTS would be saddled with 66% of the damages in an incident in which it was only 22% negligent.</p>

Even without applying the rules of strict construction that are employed under Kansas law when an indemnitee is seeking indemnification for its own negligence, that court concluded that the “to the extent” language limited the indemnitor’s liability to that portion of the attorney’s fees and costs that corresponded to the percentage of fault attributed to it for the plaintiff's injuries.</p>

This would be particularly meaningful in a situation in which a plaintiff brings a negligence action against PennDOT, Green, and CTS, and a jury finds CTS's negligence to be the sole cause of plaintiff’s injuries. Under the indemnity provision, CTS would then be obligated to reimburse Green and PennDOT for all of their attorney’s fees and costs in defending the action.</p>
