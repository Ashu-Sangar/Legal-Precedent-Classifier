We agree with Appellant that he was entitled to receive <em>Miranda </em>warnings before being questioned by the school police officer and therefore, we reverse the Superior Court’s order affirming Appellant’s adjudication of delinquency.</p>

On December 7, 1998, the Monroe County Sheriff notified the East Stroudsburg Area School District Police Department that someone had broken into and vandalized a classroom at East Stroudsburg High School. After entering the classroom, East Stroudsburg School police officers discovered that someone had written graffiti on the blackboards, overturned desks, and discharged the room’s fire extinguisher. <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>In addition, small sneaker footprints were observed in fire extinguisher residue on the floor and on the desktops.</p>
    <p id="b276-5" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[253,438,1162,842]]]'>The school police officers subsequently obtained a list of students with classes in the vandalized.classroom and looked for a person small in stature to match the footprints found in the fire extinguisher residue. After reviewing the student list, the school police suspected that Appellant had been involved with the break-in because he had classes in the room, he was a person of small stature and because his discipline record indicated that he had exhibited unruly behavior in the past. One of the school police officers escorted Appellant to the main building of the school, where Appellant was asked to remove his shoe for comparison with the footprints found in the fire extinguisher residue. After observing the bottom of Appellant’s shoe, the officer concluded that the print matched those found in the classroom. The officer then informed Appellant that he was keeping the shoe as evidence and that he was going to question Appellant about the break-in.</p>
    <p id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[251,1305,1160,472]]]'>The school police officer did not give Appellant <em>Miranda </em>warnings<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> prior to the questioning, nor was Appellant allowed to leave the room until the questioning was completed twenty-five minutes later. During the questioning, Appellant admitted that he was involved in the break-in. The school called the municipal police department and Appellant’s mother. The municipal police questioned Appellant and then permitted him to leave with his mother. Subsequently, Appellant was charged with various offenses in juvenile court.</p>

Appellant’s motion was denied and an adjudication hearing was held, wherein Appellant was adjudicated of burglary, criminal trespass, theft by unlawful taking, criminal mischief, institutional vandalism, and criminal conspiracy. Appellant was then sent to a residential <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>treatment center for nine months, to be followed by one year of probation. The Superior Court affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[170,441,1153,633]]]'>On appeal to this Court, Appellant asserts that his Fifth Amendment rights were violated when he was compelled to give evidence against himself. Appellant argues that he should have been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to any questioning by the school police. According to Appellant, school police are constitutionally indistinguishable from municipal police because they are permitted to exercise the same powers as the municipal police while on school property and because they wear uniforms and badges. Consequently, Appellant contends that his confession, given during custodial interrogation by a school police officer, should have been suppressed. We agree.</p>

      <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>In affirming the trial court’s denial of Appellant’s suppression motion in the instant case, the Superior Court concluded that school police officers are more akin to school officials than municipal police officers because school police officers are considered employees of the school district. <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 7-778(g). The Superior Court noted that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required when school officials detain and question a student about conduct that violates school rules.

When children are brought together in such a unique environment, their inexperience and lack of mature judgment often create physical hazards to others or disrupt a critical learning environment for ■ other students. In addition to the challenge of keeping our children safe, our schools are, of course, charged with the life determinant task of educating our young.

Unlike issues involving school searches or seizures, questions involving <em>Miranda </em>already involve a significant degree of attenuation from the basic right being protected, <em>i.e., </em>the Fifth Amendment trial privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.

Interviews of students by school employees in the familiar settings of their schools are not remotely so inherently coercive. Reason and common sense, rather than a further extension of the comparatively inflexible <em>Miranda </em>doctrine, should govern this Court’s approach to the question of the role of the Fifth Amendment in the school setting.</p>

The duties of the school police are not solely, or even predominantly, to investigate criminal conduct, but rather the prescribed duty is to “enforce good order in school buildings, on school buses and on school grounds.” § 7 — 778(c)(1). Thus, school police are authorized to detain individuals, but only “until local law enforcement is notified.” § 7 — 778(c)(3). Most importantly, the salaries of school police are paid by the school district, § 7-778(e), and they are, “at all times,” employees of the school district, § 7-778(g). Thus, it is the school district, not the police department, that school police answer to. When § 7-778 is read <em>in toto, </em>it is apparent that school police officers appointed under the statute are not so much law enforcement officials charged with ferreting out criminal activity' — as the lead opinion necessarily assumes in granting relief here — but are specialized members of the school staff, employed and compensated by the school district, whose purpose <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>is to assist teachers and school administrators in the important, unique requirement of maintaining safety, order, and discipline.</p>

Moreover, badges and uniforms do not determine the applicability of <em>Miranda </em>even when traditional police officers are involved; rather, it is the fact of custodial interrogation.

The identity of the interrogators plays little or no role in that decision. A focus on whether a student is <em>eventually </em>charged with criminal wrongdoing is thus both over-inclusive and under-inclusive. Law enforcement officials routinely engage in questioning that does not lead to criminal charges, and non-law enforcement personnel, on occasion, engage in questioning that does lead to charges by the police. Moreover, a rule focusing on whether charges are <em>eventually </em>brought offers no guidance in the real world, since that decision cannot be known at the time of the questioning.

        <em>. </em>In requiring a rigid application of <em>Miranda </em>in the fluid public school context, the lead opinion also fails to account for the multitude of practical problems which its ruling likely will create. For example, it is inevitable that many students, because of their youth, lack of maturity, or lack of experience will simply not understand the <em>Miranda </em>warnings when given. What is a fourth-grader, for instance, to make of the <em>Miranda </em>litany? Also, what happens if a student actually invokes his or <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>her right to remain silent? Can the child be punished by school authorities for doing so, <em>e.g., </em>segregated from the general school population, suspended or expelled, or must he or she be allowed to return to the normal scholastic routine? If the student invokes his or her right to counsel, how will this right be honored? Presumably, the child will be unable to retain an attorney on his or her own. Must the student's parents be notified so that they can retain an attorney on the child’s behalf? Or will the school maintain a list of “school attorneys” to notify in such an event to be provided most likely at taxpayer expense? What should/must be done with the child in the interim? These questions and many other practical concerns will necessarily arise following any application of <em>Miranda </em>to the schoolhouse, but are left unanswered by the Court’s unprecedented new formulation.</p>

The fifth factor presumes the existence of custody, and instead looks at the nature of the custody, specifically, the number of questioners present, the place of the questioning, and the tactics used to elicit the information sought. For example, if three or four persons are interrogating the student in the principal’s office and are threatening to file criminal charges if the student does not cooperate, this is a highly coercive environment. The more coercive the environment, the greater the need to ensure that the student’s constitutional rights are not violated. When a student is in custody and being interrogated, the right to be given <em>Miranda </em>warnings presumptively attaches. However, recognizing that the school setting is <em>sui </em>generis,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_4" id="ref_footnote_4_4">4</a> the school officials can demonstrate that the warnings are not necessary if, after balancing the factors articulated above, it was reasonable for them not to <em>Mirandize </em>the student.</p>

A student suspected of taking chalkboard erasers from a classroom need not be read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, even if he “blurts out” during the interview, unsolicited, that he committed a more serious crime; at the time of the interrogation, the prospect of discipline outside of the school context was minimal. If, however, during the questioning, it becomes clear to the questioner that the student may have committed serious crimes that would subject him to out-of-school disciplinary or criminal proceedings, at that point the interview should cease, the parent or guardian of the student should be contacted, and questioning should not resume until the parent or guardian is present and the student has been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>

The School Police were investigating vandalism of a classroom, which included graffiti on the chalkboards, a smashed VCR, overturned desks, and a discharged fire extinguisher. The School Police determined that the vandal had forcibly broken into thé room. Given his age and the magnitude of the damage to the classroom, at the time the School Police interrogated R.H., it was more likely than not that they were going to pursue legal action rather than limit themselves to in-school discipline. Moreover, the environment in which he was interviewed was coercive. A School Police officer escorted R.H. to the office of the School Police, where three <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>uniformed officers questioned him for approximately twenty-five minutes.</p>

I would also emphasize the substantial interest of school administrators and educators in ensuring discipline and the need to afford them latitude in questioning students respecting activities that may violate school rules. <em>See Vernonia Sch.

Nevertheless, I believe that there is a significant change in dynamics in encounters involving school officials dedicated to security and investigative purposes and, in particular, uniformed school police officers, particularly where they are possessed with the power ,and authority of law enforcement officials, including the power of arrest. <em>Cf.

The dissents posit that there is no difference between school police officers and other school staff for <em>Miranda </em>purposes.

As Miranda's underlying concern is with the compulsion inherent in police custodial questioning, I find highly material the distinction between educators and those operating under color of police authority and possessing general police powers including the power of arrest.</p>
