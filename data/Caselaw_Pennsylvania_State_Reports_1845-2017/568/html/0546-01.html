In this appeal, we are called upon to decide two questions: (1) whether Section 406(a) of the Code, 26 P.S. § l-406(a), required Appellee to raise by preliminary objections the claim that the condemnation landlocked his remaining property and diminished its fair market value to virtually zero; and (2) whether Section 602(a) of the Code, 26 P.S. § l-602(a), allowed the admission of evidence of the Department’s later taking in February of 1997 of a neighboring piece of property, which served to insure that Appellee had legal access to his remaining property, on the issue of damages. We conclude that under the Code, Appellee was not <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>required to file preliminary objections and that evidence of the Department’s subsequent taking was not admissible in determining the just compensation to which Appellee was entitled. Thus, for all of the following reasons, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b822-4" data-blocks='[["BL_822.4",822,[248,600,1162,528]]]'>In April 1938, Appellee’s parents, Joseph and Helen Sluciak, purchased a sixty-acre parcel of land in Cecil Township. Several months later, Rudolph and Mary Dagsher purchased an adjoining parcel. Both pieces of property fronted on Grudevich Road, a township road running roughly northwest/southeast. Even though their property had frontage on Grudevich Road, the Sluciaks accessed that thoroughfare by using a driveway that crossed a sliver of land approximately twelve feet long by twenty feet wide at the corner of the Dagher’s property (the “Driveway”).</p>

In the mid-1980s, Helen Sluciak subdivided the property, deeding one 44.624-acre portion to Appellee, and the other portion to his brother. Appellee’s business, located on the portion he was given, was expanded to include excavation operations, and consisted of a repair shop, storage areas, a barn and trailers. Appellee continued traveling to and from Grudevich Road over the Driveway.</p>

Appellee received notice of the condemnation, and copies of the declaration of taking and property plat. He did not file preliminary objections. Valuing the property at $460,000 prior to the taking and at $315,000 after the taking, the Department paid Appellee $145,314 as estimated just compensation on May 23, 1993.</p>

He also testified that the Driveway, which he did not own, was his only access to Grudevich Road. Appellee argued, therefore, that the taking had “landlocked” his remaining property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> An appraiser called on Appellee’s behalf testified that the value of Appellee’s land prior to the condemnation was $500,000, and that the value after the taking was $15,000.

The Department also offered evidence to prove that the estimated just compensation it had paid to Appellee was sufficient. On the question of damages, the Department was permitted, over Appellee’s objection, to present testimony relating to the efforts it was taking to “cure” the “defect” in Appellee’s access to his property.

The Board also found that Appellee continued to operate his business. In light of the foregoing, the Board rejected application of the assembled economic unit doctrine, accepted the Department’s appraisal of damages at $145,000, and awarded as special damages any future costs and fees “to cure the technical defect.” (Viewers’ Report at ¶ 22.7, R. 48a).</p>

      <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>Before the trial court, both parties submitted proof regarding property boundaries and the Driveway’s location and use. Appellee offered evidence to show that his remaining property did not front Grudevich Road. As to the Driveway, Appellee testified about the several unsuccessful attempts that he or his father had made to purchase the property with the Driveway on it from the Dagshers. He also testified that he removed snow from the Driveway in the winter and added stone and slag to it from time to time. Mrs. Dagsher’s son-in-law testified that although Appellee and his family never acquired the land beneath the Driveway or an easement or a right-of-way, it was his understanding that Appellee had permission to cross the Dagshers’ property. Appellee’s mother testified as to her and family’s continued use of the Driveway over the years.</p>
    <p id="b825-4" data-blocks='[["BL_825.5",825,[173,1146,1153,469]]]'>One of the appraisers the Department had retained testified that he did not appraise the Appellee’s remaining property as landlocked because of Appellee’s continued use of the Driveway to and from Grudevich Road. When the Department attempted to elicit testimony from the Department’s Right-of-Way Administrator about the Department’s February 1997 condemnation of the Dagshers’ sliver of land which included the Driveway, Appellee objected that such evidence was inadmissible. The trial court sustained the objection.</p>
    <p id="b825-5" data-blocks='[["BL_825.6",825,[173,1641,1155,736]]]'>Despite its having sustained Appellee’s objection as to evidence of the Department’s subsequent condemnation of the Dagshers’ land, in an order dated April 18, 1997, the trial court ruled that Appellee’s property “is not landlocked as the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has cured the access issue.” (Trial Court Order, R. 83a). The court went on to state that “from 1938 to the present date the Sluciak family has utilized the subject driveway for ingress and egress. In addition, the Sluciaks have been solely responsible for the maintenance, repair and snow removal from said driveway. Finally [Appellee] has transacted his business from the remaining tract of land uninterrupted.” (Trial Court Order, R. 83a). The court then designated a date for a jury trial on the issue of damages.</p>

      <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>Appellee filed an appeal in the Commonwealth Court. On appeal, the Department once again argued that Appellee had waived his claim that his remaining property is landlocked due to his failure to file preliminary objections pursuant to Section .406(a). Like the trial court, the Commonwealth Court rejected the Department’s argument, ruling that Appellee’s claim was not the sort of issue that falls within the statute’s purview. <em>In re Condemnation of Right of Way for State Route 0079, Section W10, </em><a href="/a2d/727/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="727 A.2d 618" data-case-ids="11628800" data-case-paths="/a2d/727/0618-01">727 A.2d 618</a>, 623-24 (Pa.Cmwlth.1999).</p>

The court then concluded that the issue the condemnee sought to contest, i.e., “the size of Condemnee’s entire property”, related to “information that must be included in the declaration of taking and notice of condemnation,” and was so basic to the case that it had to be decided at the earliest possible stage by the filing of preliminary objections. <em>Id. </em>at 1269.</p>

Indeed, the majority’s analysis does not consider the Code’s definition of fair market value in Section 603 or any of the factors therein, such as those admissible under Article VIL The majority summarily dismisses Condemnor’s reliance on Section 705(2)(v) by stating that “[t]his case, however, involves the proper construction of Section 602(a).” Majority Op. at 18. Despite this assertion, a proper construction of Section 602(a) requires Section 603’s definition of fair market value, which in turn is expressly affected by evidence admissible under Article VII and, specifically, Section 705(2)(v). <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1932 (requiring that statutes <em>in pari materia </em>shall be construed together).</p>
