Officer Hughes informed Sergeant Kilrain that the department’s narcotic-detector dog, while conducting a sniff search of baggage at the Houston airport, indicated the presence of drugs in a piece of luggage that had been placed on a flight bound for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Sergeant Kilrain received a two-page fax from the Houston Police Department that described the luggage, the number and airline of the flight, and the baggage claim number of the suspect item. Specifically, the fax stated that the luggage was a brown bag with a green stripe, and a claim ticket bearing the number 22-11-07. Also, the fax stated that the luggage was on Northwest Airlines Flight 1086 scheduled to arrive in Philadelphia at 11:04 p.m., and that the passenger who was seen with the bag was an African American female. The fax further explained the background and training of Officer Hughes and the narcotic-detector dog.</p>

The flight arrived on time and, at approximately 11:10 p.m., Officer Levins observed a brown bag with a green stripe on the carousel and saw an African American female, later identified as Appellant, pick up the bag.

As we stated in <em>Cleckley, </em>“[t]his court, as well as the United States Supreme Court, has long adhered to the principle that for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, consent must have been given voluntarily.” <em>Cleckley, </em><a href="/a2d/738/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="738 A.2d 427" data-case-ids="11564957,838551" data-case-paths="/a2d/738/0427-01,/pa/558/0517-01">738 A.2d at 429</a>.

In <em>Bumper, </em>the police approached the owner of a home where the suspect lived and informed her that they had a search warrant. After being told by the authorities that they had a warrant, the homeowner allowed them into the house, where the police discovered a rifle believed to be an instrument of crime. When the defendant moved to suppress the rifle, the prosecutor declined <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>to rely on the search warrant<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and instead argued that the homeowner had consented to the search. The lower courts denied the suppression motion. The United States Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>and reversed, holding that “[wjhen a law enforcement officer claims authority to search a home under a warrant, he announces in effect that the occupant has no right to resist the search. The situation is instinct with coercion — albeit colorably lawful coercion. Where there is coercion there cannot be consent.” <em>Bumper, </em><a href="/us/391/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="391 U.S. 543" data-case-ids="1767611" data-case-paths="/us/391/0543-01">391 U.S. at 550</a>, <a href="/us/391/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="391 U.S. 543" data-case-ids="1767611" data-case-paths="/us/391/0543-01">88 S.Ct. 1788</a>.</p>

In <em>Bumper, </em>the police represented that they were already in possession of a warrant and, consequently, the homeowner had no choice but to permit the officers to enter her home. Here, by contrast, the officers did not represent that they had a search warrant, such that Appellant’s consent would be no more than acquiescence to lawful authority. Rather, the officers specifically informed Appellant that they did <em>not </em>possess a warrant and that she was free to decline permission to search her bag. When they simultaneously told her that if she refused to consent they “would have to get a search warrant,” the officers simply advised her, truthfully, of the consequences of denying permission. We do not find Appellant’s decision to allow the police to search her bag to be comparable to the situation of the homeowner in <em>Bumper </em>who, once told that the officers who wished to enter her house had a warrant, could not refuse.</p>

Such a <em>per se </em>rule would make it impossible for the police to ask for consent to search whenever they have probable cause to detain the suspect and accurately advise the suspect of the consequences of refusing permission. <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>The statement by the police that they “would have to get a search warrant” is merely a factor, but not a dispositive one, in the totality of the circumstances that a court must review in determining whether the police coerced the individual into consenting to the search.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Although the police informed Appellant that they “would have to get a warrant” if she refused her consent, this accurate statement informed Appellant of the true nature of her predicament, i.e., that she was not free to leave even if she denied the police permission to search. As such, it is not a coercive tactic by the police. Appellant waited ten minutes prior to signing the consent form, which indicates that her consent was the product of a considered deliberation. Furthermore, the police officers were polite and allowed Appellant time to decide without pressuring her with additional urging while she made her decision. These factors support the conclusion of the suppression court that Appellant voluntarily consented to' the search of her bag.</p>

However, rather than following proper procedures to legally obtain access to Appellant’s bag, the police, in my view, circumvented the law by inducing Appellant’s consent to search her bag.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> The police did not have a warrant, had not applied for one, and in fact, based on their conduct, did not even believe they possessed the probable cause necessary to secure one.
