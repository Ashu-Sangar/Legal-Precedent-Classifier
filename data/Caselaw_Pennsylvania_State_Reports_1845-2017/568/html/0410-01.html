Regester, III, and family members (the “Regesters”), are as follows. Shortly after 7 p.m. on September 8, 1996, Mr. Regester suffered cardiac arrest. While administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation and restoring Mr. Regester’s pulse, his family: telephoned the local emergency services number; requested an ambulance; indicated a <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>correct street address for the Regester family’s home of 4 Raintree Lane, Kennett Township (an unimproved but designated street on the subdivision plan for the Regesters’ neighborhood); and provided accurate driving directions. The emergency services operator radioed both the Longwood Fire Company, Inc. (“Longwood”), which provides volunteer fire protection services as well as ambulance service in the Regester family’s geographical area, and the Southern Chester County Medical Center (“SCCMC”), a hospital that maintains a mobile critical care unit within Chester County’s emergency services system. The' operator also relayed the provided driving directions, which, if followed, should have resulted in the affordance of emergency treatment to Mr. Regester within three to four minutes, since Longwood was located within two miles of the Regester family home. Nevertheless, both sets of emergency medical services (“EMS”) personnel responded to information from Longwood’s station that there was a Rain-tree Lane located near Pennsylvania’s southeastern border; therefore, they were delayed in their arrival. Just before 7:30 p.m., Mr. Regester vomited, blocking his airway, and his condition deteriorated rapidly. Although EMS personnel reached the scene within the next few minutes, they were unable to revive him.</p>

In their complaint, the Regesters alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the emergency services dispatchers and providers negligently failed to familiarize themselves with the geographic area which they served, resulting in the unavailability of prompt and essential medical attention to Mr. Regester. In its answer, Longwood asserted that it was immune from liability pursuant to the provisions of the Judicial Code affording, in favor of local agencies, governmental immunity from claims for damages from injuries to persons and property. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8541-8542.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> SCCMC contended that, pursuant to the im<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>munity provisions reposited in Section ll(j)(2) of the Emergency Medical Services Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> 35 P.S. § 6931(j)(2), it could not be held liable absent proof of gross or willful negligence, which the Regesters failed to either plead or put into factual controversy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> At the conclusion of discovery, Longwood and SCCMC moved for summary judgment based upon their respective claims of immunity. In response, the Regesters contested Longwood’s claim to local agency status and further argued that their own claims against Longwood were not barred by the immunity statute as they fell within an express, statutory exception afforded as to negligent act? connected with vehicle operation. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8542(a)(2), (b)(1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Additionally, the trial court reasoned that, since Longwood’s ambulance was not actually driven in a negligent manner and no causal relationship existed between its physical operation and the harm to Mr. Regester, the vehicle liability exception to the general rule of immunity in favor of local agencies was inapplicable. Concerning SCCMC, the trial court cited <em>D'Amico v. VFW Post 191 Volunteer Ambulance Ass’n, <a href="/pa-d-c4th/8/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Pa.

While acknowledging SCCMC’s argument that the immunity afforded under the EMSA reflects the nature of the services provided and the public interest in maintaining an effective and efficient emergency medical system, the court deemed such policy arguments irrelevant in light of the plain language of the enactment. <em>See <a href="/a2d/751/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="751 A.2d 694" data-case-ids="11511104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0694-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/751/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="751 A.2d 694" data-case-ids="11511104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0694-01">at 698</a>. In reviewing the statutory terms, the court observed that the EMSA affords immunity in favor of a “first responder, emergency medical technician or EMT-paramedic or health professional,” and that such operative terms are defined in the enactment in terms of individuals <em>(i.e., </em>natural persons) with enumerated, specialized <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>training. <em>See <a href="/a2d/751/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="751 A.2d 694" data-case-ids="11511104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0694-01">id.</a> </em>at 698 (citing 35 P.S. § 6931(j)(2)). Further, the Commonwealth Court emphasized that the General Assembly was well aware of the involvement of institutions and organizations in the provision of emergency medical care, particularly as it had included common forms of medical services organizations among defined terms of the EMSA. <em>See <a href="/a2d/751/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="751 A.2d 694" data-case-ids="11511104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0694-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/751/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="751 A.2d 694" data-case-ids="11511104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0694-01">at 698</a>. Thus, the court determined that the immunity provisions unambiguously operated in favor of individual actors but not their institutional, organizational, or corporate principals. <em>See <a href="/a2d/751/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="751 A.2d 694" data-case-ids="11511104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0694-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/751/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="751 A.2d 694" data-case-ids="11511104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0694-01">at 698-99</a>. The Commonwealth Court also questioned the reasoning of <em>D’Amico </em>(which was invoked by the trial court), noting that, although <em>DAmico </em>was affirmed by the Superior Court in an unpublished opinion, such order lacked the binding effect of precedent. <em>See <a href="/a2d/751/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="751 A.2d 694" data-case-ids="11511104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0694-01">id.</a> </em>at 699 n. 2.

For example, in <em>White, </em>the Court concluded that a school bus driver’s action of attempting to supervise a student’s crossing the street after he had alighted, which was expressly within the range of the driver’s official responsibilities, did not constitute operation for purposes of the vehicle exception. <em>See White, </em>553 Pa. at 220-21, 718 A.2d at 781 (“While it may well be that a school district that transports students assumes an obligation to make reasonable efforts to see those students safely to their destinations, it does not necessarily follow that breach of that duty exposes the school district.to liability in tort.”).
