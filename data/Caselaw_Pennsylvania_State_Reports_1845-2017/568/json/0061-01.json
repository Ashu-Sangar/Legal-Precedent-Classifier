C.P. 227(b) (\u201c[a]ll exceptions to charge to jury shall be taken before jury retires.\u201d); compare McNeil v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp., 545 Pa. 209, 680 A.2d 1145, 1148-49 (1996) (issue of whether trial court failed to instruct jury in accordance with proposed points for charge waived where party failed to lodge specific objection to charge). See also Pa. R.A.P. 302(b). Accordingly, the order and judgment of the Superior Court is VACATED and the matter is REMANDED to the Superior Court for consideration of the merits of petitioners\u2019 claim that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the crashworthiness doctrine.",
