Is the judgment of sentence of \u201cguilt without further punishment\u201d within the contemplation of the rule established by this Court in Gaito v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, 488 Pa. 397, 412 A.2d 568 (1980), precluding the application of credit for time served against a parolee\u2019s original sentence where the parolee ' failed to satisfy the conditions of bail related to his later offense?\n2. In Davis v. Cuyler, 38 Pa.Cmwlth. 488, 394 A.2d 647 (1978), the Commonwealth Court held that, \u201cwhere the Board\u2019s detainer is the sole reason the prisoner is being confined, the Board must apply the time in confinement to the prisoner\u2019s original sentence\u201d (emphasis in original). Davis was subsequently relied upon to support a rule divesting the Board of discretion concerning the application of credit for time served against an original sentence in cases in which there are multiple reasons for the custody, for example, the parole detainer and an inability or unwillingness to meet the conditions of bail. See, e.g., Gaito v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, 488 Pa. 397, 412 A.2d 568 (1980); Rodrigues v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, 44 Pa. Cmwlth. 68, 403 A.2d 184 (1979). In circumstances in which credit is not practically available against the new sentence imposed, should the Board be vested with discretionary decision making authority concerning the application of credit for time served, subject to judicial review pursuant to the standards set forth in the Administrative Procedures Act, 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704? Alternatively, should the courts continue to develop and refine specific rules governing the availability of credit for time served in particular circumstances, such as occurred in the present case and in Smarr v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, 748 A.2d 799 (Pa. Cmwlth.2000)?\nThis matter is CONSOLIDATED with Smarr v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, No. 270 MAL 2000, for argument.",
