The charge thus provided for is designated “sewer rental” and is purportedly imposed pursuant to the provisions of the Act of J uly 18, 1935, P. L. 1286, as amended by the Act of May 14, 1937, P.

That the charge imposed by the ordinance is reasonably calculated to yield revenue in excess of operating expenses sufficient to pay the interest and sinking fund charges on both the outstanding and the proposed sewer indebtedness is not questioned. Appellant-taxpayer’s position, broadly stated, is that the charge sought to be imposed by the City is not, in reality, a rent, but rather a tax, levied in violation of our constitutional requirement of uniformity of taxation, and further that the revenue derived thereby will not support an exclusion of the City’s outstanding and proposed sewer indebtedness under Article IX, Sec. 8, of the Constitution. The contention of the City, sustained by the court below, is that the charges in question are not taxes, but rentals, authorized to be imposed by the Sewer Rental Act, and sufficient, both in character and amount, to sustain the exclusion.</p>

So doing, it is manifest that the charge here in question can not be sustained on the theory by which sewer and water rentals have heretofore been upheld by this Court and the Superior Court in cases already referred to; the burden of this charge being imposed <em>in invitum, </em>no implied assent to its payment can possibly be deduced.

In the one case, the value of the peculiar benefits must be measured by the difference between the value of the lot with and without available sewers.

As stated in 1 Dillon, Municipal Corporations, (5th ed.), Sec. 198, page 370, “If the fund from which the obligations are to be paid is to be created by the levy of a tax under the general power of taxation vested in the municipality, although the contract stipulates that no general indebtedness for the stipulated amount shall be created against the city, and that the only obligation undertaken by the city is to levy, anticipate, and pledge the tax agreed to be imposed, indebtedness is created, and the contract is void if the existing indebtedness of the municipality has reached the constitutional limit.” See also <em>Boswell v. State, </em><a href="/okla/181/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="181 Okla. 435" data-case-ids="8896412" data-case-paths="/okla/181/0435-01">181 Okla. 435</a> (1937), <a href="/citations/?q=74%20P.2d%20940" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="74 P.2d 940">74 Pac.

Any speculation as to our law on this point is foreclosed, by plain implication, in the recent decision in <em>Graham v.

We there sustained an undertaking by the City to levy a special tax to be appropriated to the <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>payment of a possible future liability on tbe part of tbe City, to arise by reason of legislation that might be enacted, in the event that it should arise, <em>only because </em>such a liability is so remote and contingent that it does not effect an increase of municipal indebtedness beyond the constitutional limitation, as a careful reading of the opinion in that case will demonstrate.</p>

If the City may do this to build sewers, it may likewise borrow and issue its bonds for similar or greater amounts to finance municipal enterprises almost without limit. Simply to state the proposition is, we think, to refute it. The mischief which it is the purpose of the constitutional limitation to prevent, i. e., unduly burdensome, if not ruinous, taxation, would clearly be present in the same degree were a number of special levies for various municipal enterprises thus permitted to be imposed, the sum total of which when added to the necessary tax for current expenses would exceed what the taxable property of the municipality can support, as where the whole amount is collected under one assessment. As appellant states: “If a public utility should be held to be self-sustaining, within the meaning of the constitutional ‘exclusion’ clause where it is supported by revenue from an exercise of the taxing power, <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>then the constitutional exception has become the constitutional rule.”</p>
