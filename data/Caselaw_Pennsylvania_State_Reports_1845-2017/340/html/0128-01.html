Foster, who had left his farm, a few miles from Connellsville, at about six o’clock that evening, in good health and with a wallet on his person containing at least seven twenty-dollar bills, was found lying insensible on Arch Street, in Connellesville, suffering from a laceration near the base of the skull, on the right side, one and a half inches in length and one-tenth of ,an inch in width. He was immediately taken to the Connellsville State Hospital where he died the following morning without regaining consciousness. Death was ascribed by the attending physician to a multiple basal skull fracture and cerebral hemorrhage, apparently the result of a violent blow inflicted with a small blunt instrument. When Foster’s clothing was searched upon arrival at the hospital, the only money found was one <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>five-dollar bill, four one-dollar bills, and some loose change contained in a small change purse; the wallet and the large bills that he carried with him when he left home were missing. Prior to the discovery of his unconscious form on Arch Street, Poster was last seen by his nephew, with whom he had driven to Connellsville, walking along Arch Street in the direction of Cypher’s Tavern, located on the comer of Arch and Peach Streets, about 40 feet down the street, on the opposite side, from the point where the unconscious Foster was discovered, and thereafter by a waitress in Cypher’s Tavern.</p>
    <p id="b163-3" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[119,1010,1155,809]]]'>During the course of the police investigation into Foster’s death, Eoyston came under suspicion of the authorities and was taken into custody for questioning. On his person the officers found $116.20, including four twenty-dollar bills and in his room a quantity of new clothes and a new traveling bag. The questioning of Eoyston led to the arrest of Turza and White, both of whom, like Eoyston, were on relief. In Turza’s room the officers found a pocketbook containing eight twenty-dollar bills on a cupboard shelf, under some papers, and in White’s apartment four twenty-dollar bills were found concealed in a picture frame. An information was made against the three for Foster’s murder, following which, on December 31, 1938, they voluntarily made and signed separate statements in writing.</p>

Braddock road, where they divided tbe money; and that they then returned to Connellsville and separated. When Royston’s statement was read to Turza and be was asked whether it Avas tbe truth, be grinned and replied, “If tbe tAVO jigs say it’s right, it’s right” and, on being asked again, ansAvered, “You’ll see, you’ll see”; when White’s statement was read to him and be was asked whether it was tbe truth, be grinned but remained silent. In bis own signed statement, Turza said that all be would admit Avas that Royston gave him $200 “that be took from tbe old man” and which be, Turza, “knew at tbe time was money be got when be robbed and killed Mr. Foster”; that be spent $40 of that money knowing it was dead man’s money; that be lied when be told the officers that tbe twenty-dollar bills found in bis room was money earned and saved by him, “as it was in fact part of tbe loot taken in tbe robbery of Mr. Foster”; and that Royston told him and White that if anything happened over tbe Foster robbery and murder be, Royston, “would take tbe rap for it.”</p>

Braddock road for that purpose, pointed out tbe spot where tbe money had been divided on tbe night of tbe robbery. As they approached tbe scene Turza said “Keep going, keep going. I will show you. It’s on <em>the </em>right-hand side” and then “Here it is right here.” When White was asked, “Is that right, Blue?” he replied, “Well, it’s just about right here.” And, later, Turza declared, “The jigs squealed on me in the Connellsville job, I will squeal on them in the Scott-<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>dale job,” whereupon he implicated Royston and White in a robbery and murder committed in Scottdale on one Naum Acheff, on December 13, 1938, ten days after the death of Henry Foster but prior to the arrest of Royston, White and Turza, in which he claimed to have been innocently involved. As a result of this information all three were indicted in Westmoreland County for Acheff’s murder and were tried first on that indictment. Royston was convicted of first degree murder, White was convicted of second degree murder and Turza was acquitted.</p>
    <p id="b165-3" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[113,930,1155,1193]]]'>The principal complaint of appellant relates to the reception, as evidence against him, of the signed statements of Royston and White, as well as his own statement, without which it is contended there is an insufficiency of evidence to sustain the verdict. Appellant argues that the circumstances of Foster’s death were as consistent with his having been struck by a passing truck as with the theory that he was the victim of an assault and concludes that for this reason, as well as for the additional reason that there was no independent proof, as he contends, that he was the responsible party or one of the responsible parties, that the corpus delicti was not sufficiently proved; further that his silence when the White statement was read to him and his responses to the reading of the Royston statement did not make them available, as admissions, against him. The other complaints relate to the trial judge’s permitting Royston and White, called as witnesses for the Commonwealth’s side of the case, to be cross-examined on a plea of surprise, and his refusal to withdraw a juror because of allegedly unwarranted remarks of the district attorney in his suinmation to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[115,2134,1153,266]],["BL_166.1",166,[270,326,1157,1679]]]'>The rule, attempted to be invoked by appellant, that an extrajudicial admission or confession of one accused of crime cannot be received in evidence unless and until the corpus delicti of the crime has first been established by independent proof, and that failure to comply with <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>this prerequisite will exclude the admission or confession, is a familiar one. . But, this does not mean, as appellant contends, that the CommonAvealth must preliminarily and independently establish all the elements of the charge, i. e., (1) the occurrence of an injury or loss — in homicide, a person deceased, (2) somebody’s criminality as the source of the injury or loss — in homicide that the death was caused by a beating, gunshot or other circumstances indicating a felonious act, and (3) the accused’s identity as the responsible party or one of the responsible parties. “By this view, the term ‘corpus delicti’ would be synonymous with the whole of the charge, and the rule Avould require that the Avhole be evidenced in all three elements independently of the confession, which would be absurd.” Wigmore on Evidence (3rd ed.), section 2072. The grounds on which the rule rests are the hasty and unguarded character which is often attached to confessions and admissions and the consequent danger of a conviction where no crime has in fact been committed; consistent therewith, all that the rule requires is that the first two of the above-mentioned three elements be independently established. Thus, whenever, as here, the Commonwealth, in a homicide case, has established that the person for whose death the prosecution was instituted is in fact dead and that the death occurred under circumstances indicating that it was criminally caused <em>by someone, </em>the rule is satisfied and admissions or confessions of the accused may then always be received as proof of the identity of the guilty agent: <em>Com. v.

As the court below pointed out, the nature of his wounds Avas such as to have made it next to a physical impossibility that they could have been received by accident. And, when the nature of the injuries is considered in connection with the other circumstances of the case, particularly <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>the missing wallet and the money contained therein, the circumstances attending the death are hardly consistent with any other rational theory. But, assuming that they are not inconsistent with death by accident, it does not follow, as appellant contends, that the corpus delicti was not sufficiently proved. “It sometimes happens the circumstances attending the act may be consistent with crime, suicide or accident. In such cases, the corpus delicti is proven where the circumstances attending the death are consistent with crime, though they may also be consistent with accident <em>(Commonwealth v.

So, too, his grinning silence when the White statement was read to him and he was asked whether it was the truth, was extraordinary under the circumstances. Evidence of this character is for the jury whenever the occasion and the attendant circumstances call for serious admission or denial, its weight depending upon the force of the circumstances and the motives which must impel one so accused to an explicit denial if the statement be untrue. . . . Money believed to be Foster’s and admitted by Turza in his signed statement to have been the proceeds of Foster’s robbery, had been found in his possession.

The trial judge wisely exercised the discretion vested in him in permitting the cross-examination, and he sufficiently guarded its effect in his charge, the relevant portion of which is as follows: “You will recall that the commonwealth called as its own Avitnesses both Royston and White, and that each of them gave testimony on direct examination that caused the commonwealth to plead surprise, Royston testifying that he did not think he had seen Turza at all on December 3, 1938, and White testifying that he had not seen him after four-thirty o’clock. Thereupon, we permitted them both to be cross-examined by the commonwealth for the sole purpose of affecting their credibility in respect to the testimony they had given on direct examination. Therefore, you are not to consider their testimony on cross-examination, or any prior contradictory statements that are alleged to have been made, as substantive evidence in aid of the commonwealth’s case, but only for the purpose of neutralizing the effect of the testimony given by these witnesses to Avhich the commonwealth pleaded surprise.” <em>Com. v. Deitrick, </em><a href="/pa/221/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="221 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="956167" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0007-01">supra, 16-17</a>; <em>Com. v.

In any event, since the written statements about which the witnesses were cross-examined were later received substantively, and properly so, as we hold, the question becomes immaterial. See <em>Com. v. Reeves, </em><a href="/pa/267/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="267 Pa. 361" data-case-ids="1057680" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0361-01">supra, 363</a>; <em>Com. v.

While it may be that some of the comments complained of were not entirely warranted as fair deductions from the evidence <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>presented, we are satisfied that they were not so flagrant that any tendency they might otherwise have had to prejudice appellant was not effectively cured by instructions immediately given to the jury to “disregard completely the matters complained of” and that their consideration of the case “must be restricted wholly to the testimony that has been heard here in court during the progress of this trial, and such inferences therefrom as may logically be drawn.” Counsel for appellant was apparently also satisfied, for no1 exception was taken either to the refusal of his motion to withdraw a juror or to the sufficiency of the court’s admonition. As stated in <em>Com. v. </em>Touri, <a href="/pa/295/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="295 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1115115" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0050-01">supra,</a> 58: “Complaints, such as are now insisted on, are in the first instance addressed to the trial court, and only where its action discloses an abuse of discretion will a reversal be justified.” We all agree that this is not a case calling for such action.</p>
