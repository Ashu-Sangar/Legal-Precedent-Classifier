The appeal at No. 207 was by testator’s son, Crawford B. Cunningham. After making certain disposition of property, which it is unnecessary now to mention, testator reached the residue of his personalty; this he gave to his wife and a trust company in trust, directing that it be divided into two equal parts to be “designated respectively as the vested half and the unvested half of the residue”; he directed that, on the death or remarriage of his widow, the “unvested” half should be divided into sixths and that one-sixth should be held in trust for each of his four children. No question concerning either the vested half or the four-sixths of the unvested half is presented. The dispute between the parties arises out of the twelfth paragraph of the will relating to the other two-sixths.</p>

As each child arrives at the age of twenty-one years, he or she shall be entitled to receive the proper share of the income, but shall not, before arriving at the age of twenty-six years, have power to anticipate, sell or assign either income or principal. When the first one of the participants arrives at the age of twenty-six years, the said trustees shall make a fair and equitable division in writing of the cash, securities or other property which shall constitute the remainder of said unvested half, into the proper number of parts. I prefer that this shall be done after conference with those of the parties interested who shall then be more than seventeen years of age, and that their consent to the method of division shall be secured if possible. In this as in other instances, at the right times the proper formal transfers of securities, etc., shall be made. In the matter of education and instruction I particularly direct that said trustee, and any guardians who may handle funds coming from my estate, shall comply with my wishes expressed in the 10th section<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> above; and I further authorize them to use, for the purpose of such education and instruction, principal where needed as well as income, both before and after the beneficiary shall arrive at the age of majority.”</p>

During her lifetime, on October 29, 1935, the appellant, Crawford B. Cunningham, then more than 26 years of age, assigned <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>to Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company all his right, title and interest in his father’s estate to the extent of $25,345.00. The consideration specified in the assignment was “as collateral security for my certain existing contingent indebtedness as endorser upon certain obligations to PEOPLES-PITTSBURGH TRUST COMPANY of Barnes Motor Company, a Pennsylvania Corporation, in the amount of Twenty-three Thousand Three Hundred Forty-Five Dollars ($23,345.00) as well as collateral security for a certain contemporaneous loan to Barnes Motor Company in the amount of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00), in connection with which I contemporaneously become contingently liable as endorser.”</p>
    <p id="b300-5" data-blocks='[["BL_300.4",300,[281,1090,1152,697]]]'>The question is, Did appellant then have an assignable interest? The assignment was presented at the audit and distribution to the assignee was decreed. Another claim was presented by appellant’s trustee in bankruptcy. On March 17, 1939, having filed a petition in bankruptcy, appellant was adjudicated bankrupt and has since been discharged. His trustee claimed for the excess of his interest over the amount due on the assignment to the Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company and distribution was decreed accordingly. The appellant now challenges the decrees on the ground that he had no assignable interest; that nothing could pass to the assignee or to the trustee.</p>
