She had never married and her nearest relative was a niece, Mrs. Evelyn B. Maddux, who resided in Cambridge, Mass. On February 23, 1933, she executed a will (hereinafter referred to as the first will), making this niece the principal beneficiary. On January 21, 1939, Miss Schwartz executed another will (hereinafter referred to as the second will), revoking the former will and giving the sum of $5,000 to her niece, Mrs. Maddux, and the remainder to Mrs. Rose Campbell, the appellant, who was also named executrix. The latter as a professional nurse had cared for the testatrix for nearly six years. For the first three years she had been relief nurse and the last three years regular nurse.</p>
    <p id="b203-10" data-blocks='[["BL_203.11",203,[124,1931,1153,319]]]'>On April 1, 1939, the Register of Wills of Allegheny County admitted the first will, but refused to admit the second will, to probate. Mrs. Campbell appealed to the Orphans’ Court and filed a petition asking that the refusal of the Register to probate the second will be set aside and that he be directed to probate that will.</p>

Maddux, as a legatee. Later Mrs, Campbell appealed from <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>the probate of the first will and on November 16, 1939, filed a petition asking that the probate of that will be opened. On March 6, 1940, Judge Trimble, after a hearing, entered an order refusing both petitions and held that the presumption of undue influence raised by the evidence offered by the contestant had not been rebutted. Mrs. Campbell filed exceptions which, after argument before the court in banc, were overruled. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[289,817,1151,798]]]'>Testatrix was entitled to receive during her life, the income of a trust fund of $50,000 created by the will of her father, Jacob Schwartz, and administered by the Fidelity Trust Company, as trustee. Four days before the second will was executed, testatrix was successful in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County in litigation in <em>Griscom's Estate </em>(decree affirmed in the Supreme Court on November 27, 1939; <a href="/pa/336/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="336 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="1195618" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0422-01">336 Pa. 422</a>). This augmented her estate by from $50,000 to $60,000, and with the trust estate made the total estate subject to her testamentary disposition worth over $100,000.00, for the will of her father gave her a general power of appointment over the principal of the trust fund. By her first will, she had exercised this power of appointment in favor of Mrs. Maddux.</p>

She was an invalid, suffering from partial paralysis, which was progressive in character. Her , second will was drawn by an attorney whom she had not known previously and who was secured for her by Mrs. Campbell. This attorney had represented Mrs. Campbell in divorce proceedings and in other legal matters. Miss Schwartz had often been advised in her business affairs by Watson B. Adair, a lawyer, who had drawn wills for her in 1907, 1916, 1921, 1932 and 1933. (The 1933 will is the one referred to in this opinion as the first will. Mr. Adair did not know whether the 1932 will was executed or not.) In all of these wills, Miss Schwartz’s relatives had been made the benefiei<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>aries. Mrs. Campbell testified that Miss Schwartz said she “didn’t want Watson [Adair] this time” or any attorney connected with her family or the Fidelity Trust Company, that she “wanted to live in peace.” Mrs. Campbell then suggested Attorney Gealey, saying: “I had him eighteen or twenty years ago.” She said Miss Schwartz told her to “call him.” He was summoned to the hotel and when he reached Miss Schwartz’s room she told him she wanted to make a will, that “she wanted •to give Mrs, Maddux $5,000 and she wanted to give the rest to Mrs. Campbell.” The attorney said he asked her “why she wanted to do that” and “she said Mrs. Maddux was well taken care of by her parents; that she had all that she and her family would ever need, and she spoke about Mrs. Campbell having been very kind to her and very attentive . . . and that she was going to see that she didn’t need anything.” The attorney said that he then wrote the will as Miss Schwartz directed, that because of her physical disabilities, he wrote, her name with her permission on the will and that she. made her mark. The subscribing witnesses were G. W. Mehaffey, a clerk at the Hotel Kenmawr, and Miss Julia Moriorty, who was also employed at the hotel.</p>

A. Yes, there was quite a childish condition, almost infantile. ...

He characterized her mental condition as “average for a woman of her age” and declared that she was <em>not </em>weak-minded. He said she had the capacity to make a will and when on cross-examination he was asked: “Would she in her circumstances be influenced in favor of the person upon whom she was dependent [physically]?” he replied: “I think so.” Dr. Robert S.

She was childish, hallucinations clouded her conversation and Mrs. Maddux’s kindness and helpfulness were forgotten.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The evidence supports the Orphans’ Court’s findings — and they are therefore binding on this court— that Miss Schwartz was in such a weakened condition mentally and so bedfast physically as to be susceptible to the influence of the nurse who had for six years ministered to her, that this person’s relationship to her became that of a confidential adviser and that the testatrix had been unduly influenced by this adviser to make the will which gave her (after the payment of debts) all of an estate of one hundred thousand dollars except five thousand dollars bequeathed to the testatrix’s niece.</p>
