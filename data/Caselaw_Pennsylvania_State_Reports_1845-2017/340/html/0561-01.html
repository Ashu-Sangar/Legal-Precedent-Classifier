Disputes having arisen in regard to her will, all the parties in interest in her estate entered into an indenture of settlement in 1916. This indenture provided that five-sixths of the residue of the estate, which part was designated as the- “Galli Interest” to distinguish it from the other one-sixth or “deFrenoys Interest,” should be held in trust by Philadelphia Trust Company (now Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company) to pay the net income (after making certain annual payments which are of no present concern) to Mary E. Ware, Lewis S. Ware, Mary E. B. Meigs, Edward Browning, Edward Eoberts, J. E. Evans Eoberts, Agnes P. E. Groome, Edith E. Disston and H. Eadclyffe Eoberts, who were the nephews and nieces of Clara E.

The Trustee then filed its second account, giving actual notice to all parties in interest in accordance with Eule 79 of the Eules of Equity Practice. In its petition for distribution it stated that a question had been raised by the Eadclyffe Eoberts children and Edward Browning, Jr., as to whether they were not entitled, at the death of Edward Eoberts, to a proportionate share of the principal of the fund supporting the income paid to him in his lifetime, and that it was accordingly requesting the court to determine whether such principal should continue in trust for Mary E. B. Meigs and Agnes P. E. Groome, the surviving nieces, or whether one-fourth thereof was then distributable to Edward Browning, Jr., and one-fourth to the Eadclyffe Eoberts children, and only the remaining two-fourths should continue in trust for Mary E. B. Meigs and Agnes P. <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>E. Groome. The petition prayed that the entire principal then in the trust should be awarded to the Trustee for Estate of Clara E. Galli, deceased, “Galli Interest,” for Mary E. B. Meigs and Agnes P. E.

In its petition for distribution the Trustee stated that the only persons in interest were the Meigs children and the Trustee for Estate of Clara E. Galli, deceased, “Galli Interest,” for Agnes P. E. Groome. The court, by decree of June 26, 1933, therefore awarded one-half of the then remaining principal, or three-tenths of the original principal, to the Meigs children, and the other one-half to “Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co., Trustee for Estate of Clara E.

Groome died leaving three children, and in 1939 the Trustee filed its fourth account. This time proper notice was given to Edward Browning, Jr., and the Eadclyffe Eoberts children, but in its petition for distribution the Trustee asked that the balance of principal then remaining, being three-tenths of the original principal, should be divided among the Groome children. This proposed scheme of distribution was contested by the Eadclyffe Eoberts children and Edward Browning, Jr., who contended that they were entitled to share equally with the Meigs children and the Groome children in the portion of the principal from which the income had been paid to Edward Eoberts in his lifetime. The court adopted this view and <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>awarded to the Groome children, not the three-tenths, or twelve-fortieths, of the original principal then before the court for distribution, but only one-fourth, or ten-fortieths, of such principal, and awarded the remaining two-fortieths to the Radclyffe Roberts children and Edward Browning, Jr.</p>

Accordingly the Radclyffe Roberts children and Edward Browning, Jr., brought bills of review and for an accounting against the Trustee wherein they prayed that the court open the decree of June 26, 1933, that the schedule of distribution adopted on the adjudication of the third account be amended so as to include an award to the Radclyffe Roberts children and Edward Browning, Jr., of two-fortieths of the original principal, the result of which would be that all four lines of the nephews and nieces who left children them surviving would have received an equal one-fourth part of the trust estate, and that the Trustee be required to account to plaintiffs for the amount which it should have distributed to them. The court granted the relief prayed for, and from its decree the Trustee now appeals.</p>

Stating it in legalistic phraseology: Under the terms of this indenture of settlement, are the children of a previously deceased life beneficiary entitled to share in the distribution of the principal from which the income was paid to another life beneficiary who subsequently died without issue? This problem is not a novel one in our <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>state. In <em>Fox’s Estate, <a href="/pa/222/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="222 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="959387" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0108-01">222 </a></em><a href="/pa/222/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="222 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="959387" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0108-01">Pa. 108</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20A.%20954" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="70 A. 954">70 A. 954</a>, a testator created a trust for his four daughters, the income to be paid one-fourth to each for life; upon the death of any of the daughters leaving issue the principal of her share was to be conveyed to such issue; in case of the death of any of the daughters without issue her share was to be held for the use and benefit of her surviving sisters in the same manner as their own shares. Two of the daughters died, each leaving issue to which the principal of her share was conveyed; then a third daughter died without issue and the question was whether her share should go exclusively to the fourth and last surviving daughter or be distributed in three equal parts among such surviving daughter and the children, per stirpes, of the two daughters who had first died. The court said (p. 113): “That the issue of a sister dying first should ... be cut off from participation in the share of a sister dying subsequently without issue, would be giving an accidental and irrelevant fact an effect contrary to the manifest general intent. ... As said by the auditing judge below: ‘It is well settled, however, that the word survivor or surviving will be understood as the equivalent of “other,” where in any other sense it would lead to an intestacy or to an inequality among those standing in the same degree of relationship to the testator, or to a distribution not in accordance with the general scheme of the will in its entirety. . . .’ ... He [the testator] did not mean to make shares of any group of his grandchildren dependent on the accident of their mother’s survival of her childless sister. The word ‘other’ very clearly expresses his general intent and that is the sense in which he used the word ‘survivors.’ ” The court pointed out that a contrary view would necessitate the inference that the testator intended to die intestate if the last survivor of his daughters should die without issue, even though all his other daughters had left children them surviving.</p>

Their bills seeking modification of the decree of June 26, 1933, were filed approximately six years after that decree was entered. The Trustee contends that since, by section 48 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1917, P. L. 447, the time in which to present a petition of review of an adjudication of the orphans’ court is limited to five years after the final decree confirming the account, that period should be adopted, by way of analogy, by the common pleas court sitting in equity. In thus attempting to establish an absolute limit of time for instituting <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>these proceedings defendant overlooks the fact that this is not merely the case of an erroneous adjudication which some of the parties are seeking to correct, hut one in which the adjudication is void so far as they are concerned and therefore never affected their rights. Equity Eule 79 provides that notice of the filing of an account of a fiduciary and of an intention to apply for confirmation thereof must not only be advertised but “a copy of said advertisement must be mailed, at least fifteen days prior to the time fixed for the application, to all persons who are or may be interested in the account or distribution (so far as the same can be ascertained upon reasonable inquiry).” Defendant knew that plaintiffs claimed the right to participate in the Edward Eoherts share of the trust estate; it had actually recited their claim in its petition for distribution at the time of the adjudication of the second account and had asked the court to decide the question thus raised, and it also knew that the court had refused to sustain its position and had awarded the principal of the Edward Eoherts share back to the Trustee generally under the indenture of settlement, thus keeping the question open for future determination. Nevertheless, when the third account was filed, defendant ignored plaintiffs’ claim, and, instead of notifying them and leaving the problem to the court for solution, it not only undertook to decide the question on its own responsibility, but unfortunately decided it erroneously; it represented to the court that one-half of the Edward Eoherts share should be awarded to the Meigs children, which, accordingly, the court did, not knowing, of course, that the parties opposed to such’ a distribution had not been notified of the proceedings and that their absence therefore did not imply acquiescence in the making of the award as prayed by defendant.

Superior Ct. 78</a>, 82, where a trustee filed an account without giving a creditor proper notice, and distributed the fund without meeting the claim, the court held that the claimant could not be convicted of laches since the neglect lay with the trustee in failing to give notice of the filing of the account, and “until some notice was given requiring action he [the claimant] was in no default.” And in <em>Shugars’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/312/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="312 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1150635" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0472-01">312 Pa. 472</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.%20567" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="167 A. 567">167 A. 567</a>, already referred to, wrhere administrators of an estate, on filing their account, failed to give the requisite notice to a creditor, and the decree of distribution was therefore void as to him, the court held that he lost no rights by reason of the fact that the administrators had already distributed the assets of the estate, saying that such distribution would have been a good defense had it been based upon a valid decree, but not where the decree was void as to such creditor because of the administrator’s failure to give him notice of the filing of the account.</p>

While they knew of the death of Mary B. B. Meigs, they did not know of the filing, audit and confirmation of the third account and distribution thereunder. Moreover, they had been led to suppose, by reason of the action taken by the court on the adjudication of the second account, that the distribution of the Edward Boberts share would not be made until after the death of the last of the nephews and nieces. It is <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>not contended that they failed to file their hills for review and accounting promptly after they learned of the adjudication of the third account. Neither, as ruled in <em>Shugars’s Estate■, </em>supra, is it any defense that the Trustee had already made distribution under the decree of June 26, 1933. Defendant is not in the position of an innocent distributee. It should have realized that, because of its failure to give notice to plaintiffs, the decree did not affect their rights and that it was therefore making distribution at its peril. To relieve it now from accounting to plaintiffs for the amount due them out of the trust fund, simply because it has made an overpayment to the Meigs children, would be to override the fundamental doctrine of the law that persons having property rights cannot be deprived of them by judicial proceedings of which they were not notified and in which they were not given an opportunity to be heard.</p>

It is not pretended that the distribution under the first account resulted in plaintiffs obtaining more than that to which they were entitled, but only that they received their portions of those shares prematurely. However, the Meigs children also received their augmented shares at the death of their mother, Mary E. B. Meigs, and therefore before the death of the last survivor, Agnes P. E. Groome. Since the life beneficiaries alone were affected by the <em>time </em>of distributions of principal, neither the Trustee nor the children of any of the nephews and nieces have any standing or interest to raise this question. Moreover, the distribution on the adjudication <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>of the first account was made with the acquiescence and consent of all the parties, including the then surviving nephews and nieces, all of whom were participants in the proceedings.</p>

This is announced to be an axiom of natural justice and of universal application, by Marshall, O. J., in the case of the Mary, 3 Peters’ Con. Eep. 312.”</p>
