    <p id="b236-5" data-blocks='[["BL_236.7",236,[281,651,1153,1134]]]'>Oliver Kirk, aged 69, married plaintiff, aged 53, on February 16, 1935, having become engaged to her November 20, 1934. He died October 29, 1937. At the time of the engagement Mrs. Kirk knew of Mr. Kirk’s ownership of the real estate in question; she did not know, until after the marriage, that on February 13, 1935, three days before the marriage, Mr. Kirk conveyed the property to his two sons. One of them drew the deed which stated the consideration to be “natural love and affection.” The court held that a voluntary conveyance by a party to a marriage treaty “is prima facie in fraud of the marital rights of the other party to the treaty,” and as “The only consideration was natural love and affection, and as defendants have failed to meet the burden cast upon them of showing that the conveyance was made with the knowledge of the plaintiff, it must be held to have been in fraud of her marital rights.” The decree is founded on two facts: 1, that the conveyance was voluntary and, 2, that plaintiff did not know of it; that those facts established the fraud for which the conveyance was set aside.</p>

J., in <em>Duncan’s Appeal, </em>supra,, in these words: “We feel very sure that no fraud was intended here, and very probably the arrangement was very discreet and prudent; but it was very improper to make it without the consent of the intended husband. Common candour forbids that so important a change in his intended wife’s circumstances, and in her power over her estate, should be made without his consent, and equity sternly condemns it as a fraud upon his just expectations. . . . ” In that case the transfer set aside was of real and personal property although in the other two, real estate only was conveyed.</p>
    <p id="b237-5" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[138,991,1157,527]]]'>The principle applied was that the fact of conveyance, by one of the parties to a treaty of marriage without the knowledge of the other, was evidence of fraud, sufficient, unless rebutted, to avoid the conveyance. This doctrine was first announced in England where it was applied to transfers by the intended wife which would defeat the husband’s absolute right to her personalty and his vested interest in her real estate at common law as an incident of marriage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It is not the law today as declared in cases to which we shall refer.</p>

It was discussed at length in <em>Beirne v. Continental-Equitable Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/307/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="307 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1138144" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0570-01">307 Pa. 570</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.%20721" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="161 A. 721">161 A. 721</a> (1932). In that case a bill was filed by a widow to set aside a deed of trust of personal property made by her husband in his lifetime. The settlor was advised by his counsel that he “could give away his property, could make any disposition he liked of his personal property and that he was not defrauding his wife of any rights”; the settlor executed the deed of trust with the “declared purpose to eliminate Ms wife” from any interest in the assets conveyed by the deed. The opinion states at p. 575: “There was no other evidence in any way antagonizing the validity of the trust, but the testimony showed also that, from the day the deed was executed, defendant had exclusive control of the assets specified in it.” Simpson, J., also said at p. 577: “In the cases first above cited, and the others in their train, the question of the husband’s or wife’s intent to commit an actual fraud on the other spouse was not considered, perhaps was not attempted to be shown. In the later authorities, now to be reviewed, however, it is treated as the vital factor, and if actual fraud upon the other spouse is shown to have been the real cause of the transfer of the assets, the general rule is applied, as in other cases of actual fraud, and the conveyance is held void. Thus in <em>Hummel’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/161/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="161 Pa. 215" data-case-ids="854161" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0215-01">161 Pa. 215</a>, 217, it is said the husband ‘may give away or squander Ms property and thus reduce himself and wife to poverty, according to the authorities; but no case has gone so far as to sustain a voluntary obligation given and received with intent to defraud the wife’s rights.’ See also <em>Young’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/202/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="202 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="992277" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0431-01">202 Pa. 431</a>; <em>Waterhouse v.

It was an interest which the English courts considered too remote for antenuptial protection; it cannot be asserted against the husband’s creditors and vests only if the wife survives; it is not, in short, such a present and certain interest as, under the English cases,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> would ordinarily constitute the consideration for marital obligations. There is no valid reason, therefore, why the rule of presumed fraud should apply to antenuptial conveyances of real estate any more than it can apply to gifts of personalty as to which it has been rejected.</p>

For example, can it be shown that Mr. Kirk made any representation to plaintiff of his existing property, what the representation was, and whether it was relied on? Did he, in making the conveyance, intend to satisfy an existing obligation to his grantees (compare <em>Sutch’s Estate (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa/201/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="201 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="925699" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0305-01">201 Pa. 305</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.%20943" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="50 A. 943">50 A. 943</a>) in circumstances in which the effect on his intended wife’s future rights in this property would, in a legal sense, be only incidental?
