Prior to his death he inherited an estate from his brother in the amount of $2,410.00 and the Potter Title &amp; Trust Company was appointed guardian of the estate. After his death, at the confirmation of the first and final account of his guardian in the Court of Common Pleas, the Commonwealth presented a claim for money thus contributed, on the theory that the Act of June 1, 1915, P. L. 661, as amended,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> gave that court <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>authority to order payment of such, claim. In confirming the account the learned judge refused to order payment of the claim, on the ground that the Commonwealth must present its claim as a creditor in the Orphans’ Court, and he was sustained hy the court en banc. This appeal followed.</p>

The term “inmate”, as used in section 4 of the Act, refers to a living person, since the order is to be made “upon the trustee, committee, guardian, or other person who has charge of the estate of any such inmate ...” Section 2 of the Act, as amended,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> refers to “inmates” and “deceased inmates” and properly connects trustees, committees and guardians with living inmates and executors and administrators with deceased inmates. This but follows the established law, as for example, in the case of guardians; “It is an elementary rule of law that when an imbecile dies, in fact, his guardian dies, in law; his legal power is at an end. His sole duty then is to render an account of his stewardship up to the date of his ward’s death, giving the full amount of all debits and credits touching his administration, and of all unpaid claims and unfinished business. . . . The guardian is the personal representative of the ward while the ward lives; upon the ward’s death the administrator or executor becomes his personal representative as to any and all <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>things pertaining to debtors and creditors of the estate, whether such debt or credit arose out of transactions with the ward himself or his personal representative in his lifetime, the guardian.”: <em>Simpson v. </em>Holmes, <a href="/ohio-st/106/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="106 Ohio St. 437" data-case-ids="969644" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/106/0437-01">106 Ohio St. 437</a>, 439. In the instant case, therefore, since the ward is dead, section 4 of the Act of 1915 , as amended, is not applicable and the claim of the Commonwealth should be presented, not to the guardian, but rather to the administrator of the estate under the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
