The question presented by this record is whether or not the petitioner was entitled on September 30, 1939, to appear before the Board of Trustees Of the Western Penitentiary and apply for his release on parole, under section 8 of the Act of June 19, 1911, P. L. 1055, 61 PS p. 485, Sec. 303, which section provides that “every prisoner confined [in a state penitentiary] upon an indeterminate sentence, whose minimum term of sentence will expire within three months, shall be given an opportunity to appear [before the Board of Inspectors of the penitentiary] and apply for his or her release on parole, as hereinafter provided.” The relator being denied this opportunity asked for a mandamus.</p>

On June 10, 1932, he was declared a parole delinquent by the supervisor of paroles. On September 25,1933, he pleaded guilty to stealing letters from house letter boxes, and was convicted in the Federal court at Cleveland, Ohio, and was sentenced to serve five years in the United States Northeastern Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa. After serving sentence, he was returned to the Western State Penitentiary on June 1, 1937, as a parole violator, and so adjudged by the Board of Trustees on June 8,1937. He was recommitted on June 16, 1937, by the mandate of the Governor for breach of parole, “for further imprisonment... for the remainder of the period equal to the unexpired maximum term [12 years and four months], as originally sentenced according to law.”</p>

This lumping of five separate sentences was without authority of law, as we decided in <em>Com. ex rel. Lynch v. Ashe, </em><a href="/pa/320/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="320 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1163679" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0341-01">320 Pa. 341</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20229" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="182 A. 229">182 A. 229</a>. In that case we said: “Even a court has no power to lump two sentences into one . . . and the act of the prison authorities in attempting to lump two sentences into one is without statutory or other legal support.” (The Act of June 25, 1937, P. L. 2093, lumping two or more sentences to run consecutively and imposed upon any person convicted of crimes, does not affect the case now before us as the appellant was sentenced 11 years before the passage of the Act.) It follows that when the Governor reduced the “minimum sentence” of the prisoner from nine years to five years and five months, his order applied to a sentence that was legally non<a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>existent. Suck a sentence bad its origin and existence only in prison bookkeeping, as we pointed out in <em>Com. v. Ashe </em>(supra).</p>
    <p id="b533-3" data-blocks='[["BL_533.4",533,[132,509,1150,1184]]]'>Since tbe lumping of sentences was without legal warrant, this case must be treated as though sucb extralegal lumping bad never taken place, and tbe parole secured by tbe prisoner on December 14, 1931, was in legal effect a release from tbe sentence be was then serving, wbicb was bis second sentence (No. 76, April Sessions, 1926). Having later violated bis parole, be was, under section 10 of tbe Act of June 19,1911, supra, as amended by section 1 of tbe Act of June 3,1915, P. L. 788 (61 PS p. 487, Sec. 305), properly compelled “to serve in tbe penitentiary to wbicb he bad been originally committed the remainder of tbe term (without commutation) which such convict would have been compelled to serve but for the commutation authorizing said parole.” In <em>Com. ex rel. Giuffrida v. Ashe, </em><a href="/pa-super/137/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="137 Pa. Super. 528" data-case-ids="1021144" data-case-paths="/pa-super/137/0528-01">137 Pa.

    <p id="b533-4" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[133,1713,1149,316]]]'>It is conceded in tbe appellees’ brief that since tbe decision in <em>Com. ex rel. Lynch v. Ashe </em>(supra) “it has been considered that all sentences [imposed before tbe “lumping” Act of June 25, 1937, supra] are held separate, and tbe inmate should be given a right to apply for bis parole at tbe expiration of each minimum.”</p>

On October 1, 1937, be began serving bis third sentence of two years minimum and <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>four years maximum. On September 30, 1939, when he applied for a parole he had on that day completed serving the minimum of his third sentence (No. 77, April Sessions, 1926), and he was therefore entitled, under section 8 of the Act of June 19, 1911, P. L. 1055, to “an opportunity to appear before such board [i. e., the Board of Inspectors] and apply for Ms release on parole” from the sentence he was then serving. (If he had obtained such a parole, he would upon its effective date have begun serving his fourth sentence, No. 80, April Sessions, 1926.)</p>
    <p id="b534-4" data-blocks='[["BL_534.4",534,[274,948,1148,369]]]'>We cannot agree with the appellees that the appellant “having accepted the benefit [of the lumping of the sentences] should not now be heard to complain,” if by “complain” is meant that the prisoner cannot avail himself of his statutory rights. The legally unauthorized lumping of the five sentences affected no one’s rights.</p>
    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[273,1330,1147,694]]]'>The court below in its opinion declared that “when petitioner violated his parole he was returned to the penitentiary for the remainder of the original term of the original sentences, which we hold to be the unexpired máximums in each sentence <em>(Com. ex rel. Giuffrida v. Ashe, </em>supra).” If by that statement it is meant that the prisoner must serve the unexpired máximums of all his remaining sentences without the right to apply for a parole at the expiration of any one of the minimums of those sentences, that judgment must be overruled. The case of <em>Com. ex rel. Giuffrida v. Ashe </em>(supra) does not support the ruling the court below made. We have already set forth above what that case does decide.</p>
    <p id="b534-6" data-blocks='[["BL_534.6",534,[272,2037,1146,374]],["BL_535.1",535,[129,364,1149,429]]]'>The court below also stated that “when the Board of Trustees refused permission to petitioner to apply for a parole on September 30, 1939, they no doubt had in mind . . . the improbability” of the parole being granted. The Board has the undoubted right to deny for valid reasons a prisoner’s application for a parole but the Board cannot deny him “an opportunity to ap<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>pear before such Board and apply for Ms parole,” for <em>this </em>right is given him by the Act of June 19,1911, P. L. 1055, section 8 (81 PS 303), if he, when he made Ms application, was serving a sentence whose minimum term was expiring at that time or within three months of that time. As already pointed out by us, the minimum term of the prisoner’s third sentence expired on the very day his application was made.</p>
    <p id="b535-3" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[130,803,1148,583]]]'>The decision in <em>Com. ex rel. Meinzer v.

That case decided only this: that when a parole violating convict is returned to the penitentiary, he is to be imprisoned for the remainder of the maximum sentence not served when the parole was granted, <em>without allowance of credit for the time he was out on parole and not delinquent. </em>The convict in that case ivas confined to the penitentiary on only one sentence.
