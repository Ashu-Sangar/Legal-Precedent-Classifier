The chancellor found that there was no understanding, agreement or contract between plaintiff and defendant that he was to take title in his name to the properties and hold them or any part thereof in trust for her and further found that she did not contribute any definite sum from her separate estate toward the purchase of them. In <em>Beringer v. Lutz, </em>supra, we said (p. 10) : “To establish this trust it was incumbent on [plaintiff] to show by evidence that was clear and satisfactory, first, that she did pay a portion of the purchase money for the farm in controversy, as alleged; second, that it was paid upon an agreement that she was to have the title to the land, or such portion of it as she paid for; and third, that the money so paid belonged to her as her separate estate. . . . The rule ... is that the trust must be impressed on the title when it passes to the alleged trustee. It cannot be engrafted upon it afterwards. It must result from facts then existing which in equity turn the taker of a title into a trustee. In other words the agreement to advance the purchase money or a portion of it and take title to the land or to so much of it as the money advanced shall pay for must precede or be contemporaneous with the purchase.”</p>
