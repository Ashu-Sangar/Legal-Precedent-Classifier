        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThe plaintiff, Harley W. Glancy, brought an action in trespass against defendant to recover damages for personal injuries sustained when he was struck by a truck owned by the Meadville Bread Company and operated by A. S. Terry as its agent. Defendant did not set up its agent\u2019s freedom from negligence. It contended that plaintiff was himself contributorily negligent, and this contention the court below upheld and entered judgment for defendant n. o. v., after the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $13,074.90.\nOn December 7, 1937, at about 7 a. m., plaintiff, accompanied by his wife, was driving his automobile in a southerly direction on Highway Route 98 towards Mead-ville, Pa. He was then nearly 56 years of age. Plaintiff had difficulty with the car\u2019s cooling system; it was overheating. He stopped the car about six miles north of Meadville on the west side of the highway and opposite a farm house across the highway. The two left wheels of the car were on the concrete pavement about two and a half feet. The improved portion of the road was about eighteen feet in width. At the time the ground was covered with snow and more was falling.\nPlaintiff testified that at the time mentioned \u201cit was pretty dark and just breaking daylight, that he went to the farm house, borrowed a pail\u201d and got a pail of water from the pump \u201cand came back to the car. ... I poured water in the radiator and filled it up. Then I stopped and looked both ways, to the south and to the north and everything was clear that I could see. I saw no lights or nothing. I started to take the pail back to the house.\u201d He said he started to cross in a diagonal or northeastern direction and that he was \u201cwalking fast to the pump.\u201d When he had taken a \u201cfew steps\u201d he was struck by defendant\u2019s truck which was being operated in a northerly direction upon the eastern and its right side of the highway. The truck was equipped with a governor limiting the speed thereof to 35 miles, not to exceed 38 miles per hour.\nOn cross-examination plaintiff testified that from where he looked while standing by the left side of his car he could see north on the highway for a distance of \u201cthree or four hundred feet\u201d and south for a distance of \u201can eighth of a mile ... or 660 feet,\u201d that his car was 18 feet \u201csouth of the pump,\u201d and that he walked in a northeast direction \u201cin a straight line towards the pump.\u201d He was asked: \u201cYou didn\u2019t look in either direction after you started toward the pump?\u201d He answered: \u201cI looked before I started \u2014 looked both ways; and after I got started, I walked fast to the pump.\u201d He also said that he was struck when he was \u201cpast the center of the highway\u201d after going only \u201ca few steps\u201d and that \u201cfive steps would put a fellow across the road, practically.\u201d Plaintiff suffered a compound fracture of bones in one leg and a comminuted fracture of bones in the other leg.\nPlaintiff\u2019s wife corroborated her husband as to his looking both ways before he started to cross the highway. She testified also that the lights of her husband\u2019s car were \u201con dim\u201d as it stood on the highway, that the truck did not have lights on it when first she saw it but \u201cthere was a flash of a light when the oncoming car was\u201d opposite her husband\u2019s car, that she did not see her husband get hit but saw him lying on the pavement about two or three feet from its eastern edge and about five feet back of the rear of the truck after it stopped, and that the truck stopped about 130 feet north of plaintiff\u2019s parked car. On cross-examination she was asked these questions and gave these answers: \u201cHow far towards the south was this truck from the car in which you were sitting, the first time you saw it? A. I would say the radiator of the car was a few feet from the radiator of our car. . . . Q. The first time you saw this truck it was within a couple of feet from the radiator of your car, is that right? ... A. A few feet, I might say five feet, maybe a little more, but no less.\u201d\nDefendant Terry, the driver of the truck, testified that he saw plaintiff\u2019s car and that when the front bumpers of the two cars were about opposite, he saw a pair of red rubber boots from four to five feet ahead of the truck to his right and that the right end of the front bumper of his truck struck the plaintiff.\nMr. Frank Winters, who was called on behalf of defendants, testified that at the time in question he was in the doorway of the farm house where plaintiff got the pail of water and that when plaintiff started from his car to cross the highway the truck was \u201cnot more than 20 feet away\u201d from plaintiff\u2019s car, and that he had observed the truck before then, that its lights were on and were plainly visible. He testified that when the truck stopped after hitting the plaintiff, the \u201crear of the truck\u201d was \u201cnot more than 35 feet from the front of\u201d plaintiff\u2019s car. He also testified that about ten minutes after the plaintiff was brought into the farm house, his wife said to him: \u201cWhat was the matter, Harley, didn\u2019t you see those lights?\u201d\nIn its opinion entering judgment n. o. v. the court below said: \u201cWhile a pedestrian may cross a road in the open country, as was attempted here, when he does so he must exercise a higher degree of care than at a public or regular crossing. He cannot be oblivious to danger; he cannot walk by faith. People are not entitled to walk across roads with closed eyes and inattentive minds. He must heed what he is doing and where he is going or he cannot complain of the consequences. A pedestrian who crosses the left-hand side of a road without looking to the right might often find his further progress blocked and be in peril between traffic moving in both directions. Weaver v. Pickering, 279 Pa. 214 [123 A. 777]; Virgilio v. Walker, 254 Pa. 241 [98 A. 815]; Arnold v. McKelvey, 253 Pa. 324 [98 A. 559]; Harris v. Commercial Ice Co., 153 Pa. 278 [25 A. 1133]; Anderson v. Wood, 264 Pa. 98 [107 A. 658]. ... It clearly appears from the testimony that the truck must have been a much closer distance \u2014 within not to exceed 30 to 35 feet \u2014 from the point of accident, when plaintiff looked and started across the road, as he took but a few hurried steps \u2014 how many we do not know \u2014 before he was struck by the truck. Plaintiff did not look to the south again after he had started across the highway. Had he done so, undoubtedly he would have seen the truck and could have avoided the accident by remaining in a place of safety until the truck had passed. Under such circumstances, can the plaintiff now credibly say that he looked and failed to see defendant\u2019s truck which must have been within his clear view when he started across the highway? We are of the opinion that he cannot. He was struck almost immediately upon entering the path of defendant\u2019s vehicle.\u201d\nWhat this court has said in railroad crossing cases is pertinent here. \u201c \u2018It is vain for a man to say that he looked and listened, if, in despite of what his eyes and ears must have told him, he walked directly in front of a moving locomotive [or automobile]\u2019: [Bornscheuer v. Traction Co., 198 Pa. 332, 47 A. 872]. . . . Common prudence requires alert watchfulness and celerity in getting out of a zone of danger as well as caution in getting into such a zone. . . . \u2018When human life [or one\u2019s bodily welfare] is at stake, the rule of due care and diligence requires everything that gives reasonable promise of its preservation to be done, regardless of difficulties or expense:\u2019 20 Ruling Case Law, p. 25, sec. 18\u201d: Hawk et ux. v. Pa. R. R., 307 Pa. 214, 160 A. 862. At all times individuals have been required to use their senses, particularly their senses of hearing and seeing, to save themselves from bodily harm. Our mechanical age only increases the necessity for this primitive vigilance. When a person omits to use his senses and walks thoughtlessly into a place of danger, he is guilty of negligence, and this contribution to his own injuries deprives him of any right to demand compensation from others who contributed to it.\nIn view of plaintiff\u2019s own testimony that he looked in both directions, i.e., up and down the highway and \u201ceverything was clear that\u201d he \u201ccould see\u201d and in view of the substantial distance that he could see in each direction, if he had looked carefully, as it was his duty to do, the conclusion is inescapable that plaintiff did not look carefully. Appellant places much emphasis on the testimony of Mrs. Glancy as being sufficient to carry this case to the jury. She testified that defendant\u2019s car did not have lights on \u201cthe first that I saw it.\u201d She was then ashed: \u201cDid it afterwards have lights on?\u201d She then added: \u201cI recall there was a flash of light when . . . the two engines [were] you might say, abreast.\u201d In view of the fact testified to by Mrs. Glancy that \u201cit was just breaking day, just a semi-darkness, and snowing,\u201d even the absence of lights on defendant\u2019s car, if accepted as a fact by the jury in the face of strong countervailing testimony (as, the jury apparently did accept it) would not under these circumstances excuse the plaintiff from seeing or hearing the oncoming car. If the visibility was one of \u201csemi-darkness,\u201d this oncoming truck could nevertheless have been seen coming down this \u201ccomparatively level\u201d and almost straight road. A condition of \u201csemidarkness\u201d should have led the plaintiff to increase his vigilance in crossing this much traveled highway. If he had used the vigilance the situation called for, he would have become aware of the oncoming truck. The civil engineer and surveyor, who testified in this case, described the part of the road with which we are concerned as follows: \u201cBeginning at a point two hundred fifty feet south of the house it is straight for eight hundred feet. The curves are ordinarily called slight curves. The one in front of the house is designated in engineer palaver as a two degree curve which means the deflection or turning in a distance of one hundred feet is a two degree arc.\u201d He characterized the curve in front of the Lybarger home where plaintiff got the water as \u201cslight.\u201d He also said that on December 7, 1937 (the date of the accident), there were no \u201cpermanent obstacles along the sides of the roadway and close to the pavement of the roadway which would obstruct one\u2019s vision using the highway.\u201d\nIn the face of these incontrovertible physical facts as to the place of the accident, the testimony of plaintiff and of his witness did not make out a case free from contributory negligence and therefore he was not entitled to go to the jury.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
