The principal defense was that defendant had been unable to find that its officers had been authorized to execute the bond; it was agreed that minutes for the proper period were missing. The applicable legislation, the Act of May 12, 1925, P. L. 615, 15 PS Sec. 61 reenacted in section 314 of the Building and Loan Code, 1933, P. L. 457, 475, 15 PS Sec. 1074-314, was involved in Bennett v. Rittenhouse Building & Loan Association, 313 Pa. 391, 169 A. 757. It is controlling.\nJudgment affirmed.",
