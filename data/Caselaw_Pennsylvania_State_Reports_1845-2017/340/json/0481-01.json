        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nPlaintiffs brought actions in trespass against the Administrator of the Estate of William K. Shimer, for damages resulting from the deaths of plaintiffs\u2019 husbands, Edward Flick and Robert Flick, respectively, due to the alleged negligent operation of an automobile by defendant\u2019s decedent, who was killed in the same accident.\nOn April 24, 1939, Shimer, the owner of a small Ford truck, offered to drive Edward Flick from his farm near Effort to Nazareth in order to get some furniture which Ralph Saeger had given to Flick. Shimer, Edward Flick, and the latter\u2019s brother, Robert, got into the only seat of the truck, and with Shimer driving set out for Nazareth, 24 miles away. After loading the furniture on the truck, they left Nazareth for the return trip at about 3:30 p. m. All three were found by the overturned truck at about 5 p. m. near Ross Common Manor, halfway between Nazareth and Effort. Edward Flick was to the right of the truck, Robert Flick was under the left side of the car nearest the steering wheel and Shimer was in front of the car. The latter was dead and the brothers were mortally wounded. The negligent operation of the truck is conceded. The vital question is: who was the operator?\nThe court below refused defendant\u2019s motion for a compulsory nonsuit. A jury returned a verdict for the widow of Edward Flick in the amount of $6,000, which was remitted to $5,000, and a verdict of $4,000 to the widow of Robert Flick, which was remitted to $3,000. Motions for judgment n. o. v. were denied and because of the remittiturs the motions for new trials were denied. These appeals followed.\nDefendant assigns as error the refusal of the court below to grant (1) her motions for judgment n. o. v. based on the failure of plaintiffs to prove who operated the car involved in the accident, and (2) her motions for new trials based on excessive verdicts.\nThe evidence is that Mr. Shimer \u201cwas driving when they left\u201d for Nazareth. Mrs. Saeger testified that the trio arrived at her home to pick up the living room suite which her husband had given to Edward Flick, at about \u201cten minutes to three,\u201d and that Robert Flick \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d carry any furniture \u201cbecause he had been hurt just in September.\u201d There is no evidence as to who was driving the truck when it left Nazareth.\nJoseph Kline saw the truck as it was approaching Ross Common Manor and said that at the time it was \u201cdamp, chilly and misty with a fog rising from the ground.\u201d He saw the driver of the truck \u201ccutting right across the road\u201d near a bend in it. The witness \u201cpulled his car off the road\u201d and estimated the speed of the truck to be 60 miles per hour. After the car had passed him he \u201cheard brakes squeaking and a bump\u201d but on account of the curve he did not see the accident. He went to his home in Wind Gap and then returned to the scene of the accident and testified that the \u201cground was all plowed up. . . . Where they shot across the road, they smacked a telephone pole [on the righthand side going in the direction the truck was going] and knocked that off and knocked the big guy wire off, and then they shot up along the bank and plowed the one side of the road up there for I would say about twenty-five feet along this bank,\u201d and that the truck \u201cwas smashed up pretty well\u201d and that the furniture \u201cwas not on the car.\u201d\nPlaintiff, Emma Flick, testified that she had never seen her husband Edward drive an automobile within five years prior to the time of the accident. The other plaintiff, Clara Flick, testified that her husband Robert was injured in September, before the accident, that the injuries consisted of \u201ca chest injury and an injury above the eye,\u201d that he was confined in the hospital for about six weeks and after his release from the hospital he worked as a church janitor for about two months before returning to his brother\u2019s farm in Effort in February, where he remained until the date of the accident. A witness who knew both Edward Flick and Robert Flick testified that he had never seen either of them driving a car. The position the bodies of the car\u2019s occupants were in after the accident gave rise to no inference as to who was driving the truck.\nAppellant maintains that there was not sufficient evidence in this case as to the identity of the driver of the truck to warrant submission of the case to the jury. With this we do not agree.\nThere were sufficient facts in this case to submit to the jury on the main issue which is whether or not William K. Shimer, the decedent, was driving the truck at the time of the accident. It was his truck and he knew how to drive it. There is no evidence that the other occupants had driven trucks or cars within recent years or possessed driver\u2019s licenses. Shimer was slightly younger than the younger of the two men who accompanied him. It was he who volunteered to go and get the furniture. He was at the wheel of the truck when it left on its mission. There is nothing to give rise to an inference that Shimer at any time during the journey relinquished the driving of his own truck to either of his elderly guests. Such things are not customarily done, especially on short journeys (as was this one). For Shimer to have turned hisi truck over to the driving of either of his inexperienced guests on this trip is something which one\u2019s reason does not accept as probable.\nWigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed., Yol. 9, sec. 2530, makes this statement: \u201cIt is often said that when a person, or object, or relation, or state of things is shown to have existed at a given time, its continuance is presumed. In reality, however, a genuine rule of presumption is seldom found; the rulings usually declare merely that certain facts are admissible, or that they are sufficient evidence for the jury\u2019s finding.\u201d In section 437 he says: \u201cWhen the existence of an object, condition, quality, or tendency at a given time is in issue, the prior existence of it is in human experience some indication of its probable persistence or continuance at a later period. ... So far, then, as the interval of time is concerned, no fixed rule can be laid down; the nature of the thing and the circumstances of the particular case must control. . . . The opponent, on the principle of Explanation may always attempt to explain away the effect of the evidence by showing that in the meantime other circumstances have occurred to raise a probability of change instead of continuance.\u201d This court said in Mars v. P. R. T. Co., 303 Pa. 80, 89, 154 A. 290, quoting Wig-more on Evidence, 2nd ed., Yol. 1, sec 27, page 232: \u201cThe conclusions and tests of every day experience, must constantly control the standards of legal logic.\u201d\nDefendant also complains of the excessiveness of the verdicts. We think the court below in reducing the verdicts, as already herein stated, did all that justice required.\nThe judgments are affirmed.",
