        "text": "Opinion by\nMk. Justice Maxey,\nThis is an action in trespass for personal injuries. Plaintiff averred that on March 21, 1938, while crossing Butler Street in Pittsburgh at or near the intersection with 53rd Street, from south to the north side thereof, the defendant\u2019s automobile was proceeding not under proper control along Butler Street in a westerly direction from Fifty-fourth Street and struck and injured him. At the trial plaintiff testified that the car just before it hit him was \u201ccoming very fast.\u201d The only specific testimony as to the car\u2019s speed was that of one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses who said the automobile \u201cwas coming 30 to 35 miles an hour.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial was refused. The reason assigned for a new trial was that part of the court\u2019s charge to the jury, as follows: \u201cThis case must stand or fall on whether or not this accident occurred at or near the intersection of Butler Street and Fifty-third Street, because if it occurred in the middle of the block, then the plaintiff is out of court, because he has definitely said, through his pleadings and his testimony, that he was crossing from the southwest comer of the intersection of Fifty-third Street and Butler Street to the northwest comer, and the jury, therefore, is not permitted to find that the accident occurred in the middle of the block and yet that the defendant could have been guilty of negligence in that he did not exercise the particular degree of care he should have exercised with regard to a pedestrian crossing in the middle of the block. ... If you find that the accident occurred any place other than th\u00e9 northwest corner of the intersection of those two streets, then your verdict must be in favor of the defendant.\u201d\nIn its opinion refusing a new trial the court below said: \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s right to recovery, based on the alleged negligent conduct of the defendant in the operation of his automobile, could be based only on the legal doctrine that, at the intersection of streets, a pedestrian has the superior right-of-way.\u201d The court noted also that at the end of the charge the trial judge asked counsel if they had \u201cany suggestions as to additions, corrections or amplifications.\u201d There were none.\nIt is the contention of appellant that whether plaintiff sustained his injuries at the street intersection or in the middle of the block, he had a right to recover if there was evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant and plaintiff presented a case free of contributory negligence. As a legal proposition that is correct. But if the jury found that plaintiff was injured in the middle of the block, was a prima facie case against the defendant made out on this record? To hold a driver liable for the injury of a pedestrian between crossings, the pedestrian must have been on the highway long enough to be seen by a careful driver in time to avoid hitting him. See Purdy et al., v. Hazeltine, 321 Pa. 459 (184 A. 660), and cases cited on pages 462 of that opinion. In Gallinano v. East Penn Electric Co., 303 Pa. 498, 154 A. 805, we said at page 503: \u201cIt is the duty of the driver of a street car or a motor vehicle at all times to have his car under control, and having one\u2019s car under control means having it under such control that it can be stopped before doing injury to any person in any situation that is reasonably likely to arise under the circumstances.\u201d A driver of an automobile is charged with knowledge that a pedestrian is more likely to cross the street at a street intersection than at the middle of the block and he must accordingly have his car under such control as to meet properly the situation that is there \u201clikely to arise.\u201d A driver is not charged with knowledge that a pedestrian is likely to cross the street near the middle of the block. When a plaintiff is injured while crossing the street away from a street intersection he does not make out a prima facie case merely by showing that he was run down by an automobile and injured. From this record it is obvious that the reason the trial judge charged the jury as he did was that plaintiff\u2019s evidence did not make out a case for the jury unless the jury found as a fact that the accident occurred at the intersection. Defendant\u2019s testimony placed the plaintiff \u201cabout in the middle of the block\u201d when he was struck. This raised an issue of fact and the fact was a vital one, for as the court said later in its charge: \u201cThe speed at which a motorist drives his car depends upon the circumstances, and that there is no evidence in this case that if this accident occurred between blocks this defendant was warned in advance that he should have his car at a rate of speed less than twenty-five miles an hour, unless you find that the weather conditions were such that he should have been going at a lower rate of speed. So, the defendant says, first, that there was no negligence on his part, and that, while it is correct that Mr. Zalee was injured, and severely injured, it was the result either of his selecting a place to cross over Butler Street between intersections, which would make him guilty of negligence, or that this was simply an unavoidable accident \u2014 in other words, that there was an accident, that the plaintiff was hurt, but that it was no one\u2019s fault.\u201d Plaintiff testified that when he was struck he was crossing the street at Fifty-third and Butler \u201cfrom the left side, the drugstore on the corner there.\u201d On cross-examination he was asked: \u201cWhen you were struck weren\u2019t you somewhere between Fifty-third Street and McCandless on Butler?\u201d He answered: \u201cNo; right on the crossing.\u201d He was asked further: \u201cWhen you came to Fifty-third Street, didn\u2019t you walk about half way down to Me-\nCandless, and then you started across Butler?\u201d A. \u201cNo; I started crossing right on the crossing, Fifty-third Street and Butler.\u201d He later repeated that he was \u201cright on the corner\u201d of Fifty-third Street and Butler when he was struck.\nIn Fearn v. City of Philadelphia, 320 Pa. 156, 158, 182 A. 534, in which the court below in an action of trespass entered judgment n. o. v. for defendant on the ground of contributory negligence, we said: \u201cWhen a pedestrian crosses a street at an intersection, motorists must be highly vigilant and maintain sufficient control of their cars to stop at the slightest notice of danger. . . . But when a pedestrian traverses a street between intersections, since he is not crossing at a place where he is expected to be, he must exercise a higher degree of care for his safety; motorists are correspondingly held to a less degree of care: Johnson v. French, 291 Pa. 437, 140 A. 133. . . . This court recently announced in a \u2018between crossing\u2019 case that one \u2018who fails to look before undertaking a street crossing, and who does not continue to look as he proceeds, is chargeable with negligence. Such a duty is particularly incumbent on one who is traversing a street in traffic, as in this case, not an authorized crossing\u2019: Carnevale v. McCrady Rodgers Co., 318 Pa. 369, 371, 178 A. 472. Plaintiff\u2019s conduct when tested by this injunction violated this salutary rule.\u201d\nOn the record this case presents, if plaintiff crossed the street at a point away from the intersection, he not only failed to make out a prima facie case of negligence against the defendant but he also showed that he himself was guilty of negligence. The situs of an accident may sometimes be an important circumstance by which that \u201cwant of care\u201d which is the characteristic element of negligence is to be determined. The assignment of error based upon the cited excerpt from the trial judge\u2019s charge is overruled.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
