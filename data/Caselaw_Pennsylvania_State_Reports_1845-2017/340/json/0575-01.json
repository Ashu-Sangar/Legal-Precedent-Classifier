Such an order is interlocutory only. Cf. Stewart v. Stewart, 65 Pa. Superior Ct. 593. Defendant also assigns error to the dismissal of his preliminary objections to plaintiff\u2019s amended bill and to the sustaining of plaintiff\u2019s preliminary objections to defendant\u2019s answer containing new matter. These orders, also, are interlocutory: Massachusetts Bonding & Insurance Company v. Johnston & Harder, Inc., 330 Pa. 336. The rule is settled beyond doubt that preliminary orders are not appealable in advance of final disposition of the case except when made so by statute: Lewis v. Beatty, 306 Pa. 242. Neither legislative enactment nor the Rules of Equity Practice of this Court authorize an appeal in this situation.\nThe appeal is dismissed.",
