        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Brown,\nThis action, brought on a lease between the appellee and appellant, executed December 7,1896, is for the recovery of income tax paid by the lessor to the United States government. The following is the clause iu the lease under which the court below entered judgment against the lessee: \u201cThe Railway Company shall and will also punctually and faithfully pay all taxes, charges, and assessments which, during the continuance of the term hereby demised, shall be assessed or imposed under any existing or future law on the demised premises or any part thereof, or on the business there carried on, or on the receipts, gross or net, derived therefrom, or upon the said several issues of bonds or the interest thereon, or .upon the capital stock of the Catawissa company or the dividends thereon, or upon the franchises of the said company, for the payment or collection of any of which said taxes the Catawissa Company may otherwise be or become liable or accountable under any lawful authority whatever.\u201d Nothing in the foregoing justifies the judgment from which the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company has appealed. The lease provides specifically what taxes it is to pay, and expressio unius est exclusio alterius. The income tax was not imposed by the government upon \u201cthe demised premises or any part thereof,\u201d nor \u201con the business there carried on,\u201d nor \u201con the receipts, gross or net, derived therefrom,\u201d nor upon the \u201cissues of bonds or the interest thereon,\u201d nor \u201cupon the capital stock of the Catawissa company, or the dividends thereon,\u201d nor \u201cupon the franchises of the said company.\u201d It was imposed upon rental received by the lessor from the ^lessee; but what is to be found in the lease from which it is to be inferred that the intention of the parties to it was that the lessee was to pay any taxes that might be assessed on what it paid as rent? . In North Pennsylvania Railroad Company v. Philadelphia and Reading Ry. Company, 249 Pa. 326, relied upon by learned counsel for appellee in support of the judgment in its favor, the express covenant in the lease was that the lessee was to pay \u201call taxes......upon the yearly payments herein agreed to be made by the party of the second part to the party of the first part.\u201d It is well contended for appellant that the terms of the present lease are radically different. The judgment in favor of the plaintiff below imposed upon the defendant a burden which is not within the clear and specific terms of the lease, and is not, therefore, to be regarded as having been cpntemplat\u00e9d by the parties to it at the time of its execution.\nThe judgment is reversed, the rule to show cause why it should not be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense is discharged and the record is remitted with leave to the defendant to move for judgment under the Act of May 14,1915, P. L. 483. .",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Frazer :\nPlaintiff in 1896 leased its entire road and equipment to defendant for the term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years, the lease containing an agreement on the part of defendant to pay all taxes, charges and assessments imposed on the premises, or business, or the receipts therefrom, or on its bonds, stocks, or dividends, or on the franchises, for which plaintiff might become liable. In 1914 plaintiff paid to the United States government under the Income Tax Daw of October 3, 1913, 38 U. S. Stat, 114, the sum of $1,647.77, levied on its net income arising from all sources, $1,600.00 of which represented one per cent of the net income derived from rental paid under the lease to defendant. Of the latter sum $266.67 is the amount of the Federal excise tax assessed for the months of January and February, 1913, and the balance of $1,333.33 represents the assessment on income for the remainder of the year 1913. Plaintiff notified defendant of the assessment of the tax and requested payment thereof as part of the rental under the lease, which defendant refused, whereupon plaintiff paid the tax and brought this action for recovery of the amount so paid. Defendant\u2019s affidavit of defense admitted the facts set forth in the statement of claim, but denied liability for the assessment under the terms of the lease. Plaintiff took a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient-affidavit of defense and the court below entered judgment for plaintiff for the above amount with interest, from which this appeal is taken, the sole error assigned being the action of the court in entering such judgment.\nThe construction of a lease of another road to this same defendant, somewhat similar in its terms, was.before this court in North Penna. R. R. Co. v. Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co., 249 Pa. 326, where it was held an agreement by the lessee to pay all taxes and assessments of any and every kind assessed or imposed on the premises, franchises, or the business or receipts therefrom, or on the capital stock, or dividends, or the yearly payments to be made under the lease, for which the lessor would otherwise be liable or accountable under any lawful authority, was sufficiently broad in its scope to include liability for the payment of the Federal income tax subsequently levied upon the lessor. It is earnestly contended by defendant, however, that the terms of the present lease are so different from the lease in the North. Pennsylvania Railroad case as to justify a contrary conclusion here. *\nIn the present case, as in the one above referred to, the Federal Income Tax law was not in existence at the time the lease was made, and whether or not such a tax was within the contemplation of the parties must depend upon their intention gathered from the general terms of the lease. It is first provided that, in consideration of the lease of plaintiff\u2019s property and franchises, which are fully described, the defendant \u201cshall-and will well and truly pay, or cause to be paid......as rent for the said demised premises, the following sums of money.\u201d The first requirement is that defendant pay such sum as will be \u201cequal to all interest moneys hereafter to mature\u201d on outstanding bonds of plaintiff company or on renewals or extensions thereof, \u201cfree from any tax thereon,\u201d with a further provision that if defendant pay any part of the principal of the bonds the annual rental shall be reduced accordingly. The lessee also agrees to pay \u201csuch sum as will be equal to fiVe per cent.\u201d on the preferred stock outstanding or which may in the future be issued for improvements, in which case the rental shall be increased by a sum sufficient to pay five per cent, thereon \u201cfree from taxes.\u201d While the above provisions are not of direct application to the precise question involved, they are referred to as bearing on the intent of the parties and therefore to be considered in the construction of the l\u00e9ase: Berridge v. Glassey, 112 Pa. 442; North Penna. R. R. Co. v. Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co., supra. The fourth paragraph of the l\u00e9ase contains the following clause, the proper construction of which is the principal subject of contention: \u201cThe \u00a1railway company (defendant) shall and will also punctually and faithfully pay all taxes, charges and assessments which, during the continuance of the term hereby demised, shall be assessed or imposed under any existing or future law on the demised premises or any part thereof, or on the business there carried on, or on the receipts, gross or net, derived therefrom, or upon the said several issues of bonds or the interest thereon, or-upon the capital stock of the Catawissa company or the dividends thereon, or upon the franchises of the said company, for the payment or collection, of any of which said taxes the Catawissa company may otherwise be or become liable or accountable under any lawful authority whatever.\u201d While these provisions are not identical with the provisions of the lease in the North Penna. Bailroad case, I see no sufficient reason for adopting here a construction different from that placed upon the provisions of the lease in that case. The intention of the parties, as in that case, appears to be to impose upon the lessee the duty of paying to the lessor a sum sufficient to meet its obligations to its stock and bondholders, and to maintain its corporate existence. Its entire property and franchises were turned over to defendant on terms' which gave the latter/ to all practical purposes, absolute control. No business was carried on by plaintiff, subsequent to the lease, from which it could derive income, but in lieu thereof it was dependent on rentals received under the terms, of the lease. Plaintiff had certain obligations to meet at stated intervals, which might vary from time to time, and to meet this contingency, instead of stipulating for a certain rent, a variable sum was provided for, dependent upon the amount of charges or taxes which might in the future be imposed on plaintiff\u2019s corporate franchises, stock, bonds, etc. It was only in this manner that the lessor, with no other source of income, could fully protect its stock and bondholders and enable it to continue indefinitely to pay the former \u201csuch sum as will be equal to five per cent.\u201d and to the latter interest \u201cfree of any taxes.\u201d It is true, income tax is not specifically \u2022 mentioned in the lease; and, while a strict technical construction of the words of the lease would not include income tax, such construction would disregard the general object and purposes indicated by the various provisions governing the amount of rent provided for under the lease.\nIt is strenuously argued by defendant that in the clause which requires defendant to pay all taxes or assessments \u201con the demised premises, or any part thereof, or on the business there carried on or on the receipts, gross or net, derived therefrom,\u201d the word \u201ctherefrom\u201d refers to the business and not the premises, and as no business is being carried on by plaintiff, but on the contrary is transacted entirely by defendant, there can be no basis for construing this clause to require defendant to pay a tax on rents received from the premises. On the other hand plaintiff argues \u201ctherefrom\u201d refers to the premises, which forms the consideration for the rent, and income tax levied thereon is a tax or assessment which defendant agreed to pay. While defendant\u2019s view is more in accord with the strict grammatical construction of the clause, standing alone, yet reading it in connection with the remainder of the paragraph in which .it occurs, inclines me to the opposite view. The general effect of the paragraph is to require defendant to pay all taxes, charges and assessments which may be based on the subjects then enumerated.\nThe business of operating the leased property is carried on solely by defendant. Plaintiff was, therefore, not concerned with a tax on the receipts derived therefrom. It was not doing business, nor was it engaged in business, as has been decided in McCoach v. Minehill & Schuylkill Haven R. R. Co., 228 U. S. 295. No valid reason existed for inserting a clause requiring defendant to pay taxes or assessments on something with which plaintiff was not concerned. The taxes or assessments in the minds of the parties at the time the lease was made were apparently those for which plaintiff might, then or in the future, be held accountable. The enumeration of' the various objects of taxation or assessment is followed by the general clause which limits them to those \u201cfor the payment or collection of any of which said taxes the Catawissa company may otherwise be or become liable or accountable under any lawful authority whatever.\u201d Since the Catawissa company would not be liable for tax on the receipts derived from the business which it did not carry on, the clause in question is meaningless, unless the \u201creceipts therefrom\u201d be construed as meaning receipts from the \u201cdemised premises or any part thereof.\u201d As the rent provided for in the lease would plainly be a receipt from the premises, an income tax based thereon must be held to be a charge or assessment which defendant, under the terms of its agreement, is bound to pay.\nUnder the ruling in McCoach v. Minehill & Schuylkill Haven R. R. Co., 228 U. S. 295, plaintiff was not engaged in business within the meaning of the Federal Corporation Tax Act and was therefore not liable for the excise tax for the months of January and February, 1918. However, as the payment of this tax was made before the decision in that case, upon demand by the lawful authorities, and with notice to defendant, whom, under the lease, I would hold liable for the payment thereof, plaintiff was justified in paying to avoid the risk of incurring the penalties of the act in the event of an adverse ruling by the court. As between plaintiff and defendant the amount thus paid was not, in my opinion, paid voluntarily and an action of assumpsit lies to recover the amount s<5 paid: Millard v. Del., Lack. & Western R. R. Co., 240 Pa. 234. For the foregoing reasons I would affirm the judgment in this case.",

Where a lease specifically designates certain taxes which the lessee is to pay, and subsequently other taxes of a different character are levied upon the property, the principle expressio unius est exclusio alterius applies and the lessee will not be required to pay the additional taxes.\n2. In an action by the lessor of a railroad property to recover from the lessee a tax levied by the Federal government upon the income which plaintiff derived from the property and which plaintiff had paid, it appeared that the lease provided thqt the lessee should \u201cpunctually and faithfully pay all taxes, charges and assessments which, during the continuance of the term hereby demised, shall be assessed or imposed under any existing or future law on the demised premises or any part thereof, or on the business there carried on, or on the receipts, gross or net, derived therefrom, or upon the franchises of said company, for the payment or collection upon the capital stock of the (lessor) or the dividends thereon, or upon the franchises of said compapy for the payment or collection of any of which said taxes the (lessor) may otherwise be or become liable or accountable under any lawful authority whatever.\u201d Held, that such tax on income was not within the clear and specific terms of the lease, and was not contemplated by'the parties at the time of its execution, and that the plaintiff could not, require payment thereof by defendant; and defendant was given leave to move for judgment under the Act of May 14,1915, P.
