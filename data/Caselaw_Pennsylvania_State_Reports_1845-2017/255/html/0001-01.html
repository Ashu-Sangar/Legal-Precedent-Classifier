In an action on the policy for loss occasioned by the destruction of the house and piano by fire, it appeared that plaintiff with her own money had purchased the lot and erected the buildings thereon and had also paid for the piano. Defendant contended that it was relieved of liability by reason of the fact that the lot stood in the name of the husband and wife and that the wife’s interest had not been correctly stated in the policy. The wife testified although' contradicted that she made full disclosure of all the facts to" the agent and that the policy was .issued in her name by his advice.

The building and piano were totally destroyed by fire on January 7, 1908. The evidence is to the effect that plaintiff with her own funds purchased the lot and erected said building thereon, and also bought and paid for the piano. However, the deed for the lot was made jointly to plaintiff and her husband, and so the record stood when said policy was issued and at the time of the fire. The building had formerly been insured in their joint names, but before taking out said policy plaintiff’s husband had fled from the State and it was issued to her alone. Plaintiff testifies that she notified defendant’s agent that the deed was to her and her husband jointly, and that the former policy had been so issued, also as to her husband’s desertion, and that on the agent’s advice the policy was made <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>in her name. This is denied by the agent. Plaintiff gave immediate notice of the fire to defendant’s agent and an adjuster viewed the premises and pronounced it a total loss. But formal proofs of loss were not furnished defendant until three months after the fire.</p>
