In May, 1910, it awarded a subcontract to William M. Bates, the plaintiff, for portions of the work. The contract was verbal, but it was intended that it should be reduced to writing. Before this was done, plaintiff began work, and defendant made payments to him on account, aggregating $31,918.-54. While the work was in progress, defendant sent to plaintiff a form of written contract, and requested him to sign it. He declined to do so, claiming that it did not properly express the agreement, and, after considerable <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>correspondence, in the course of which plaintiff signed and sent to defendant a form of contract which was not accepted, defendant notified plaintiff that no further payments would be made to him until the written contract was executed. In reply plaintiff again refused to sign the paper, claiming it did not correspond with the verbal agreement, and he gave notice that, unless payments were made to him in accordance with the latter, he would be unable to continue the work, and would rescind the contract and bring suit for damages. As the payments were not made, plaintiff did rescind, and brought this suit claiming to recover a balance due for work actually performed, and for profits which he averred he would have made had he been permitted to carry out the-contract.</p>

But it is alleged that this indebtedness was not then payable, for the reason that, under the terms of the contract between Bates and his subcontractors, the latter were to be paid upon monthly estimates of the railroad company’s engineer within three days after payment was made to plaintiff. In the offer of evidence which was rejected, there was a recital of the fact that by proceedings in Foreign Attachment in the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County the firm of Visconti, Soldano &amp; D’Auria had attached the moneys and credits of Bates which were in the hands of defendant company. Debts not yet due are subject to attachment, although the garnishee need not pay until maturity. But in this case the objection that the indebtedness was not then due, was based upon a technicality so bald that it deserves small consideration. Upon monthly estimates, and within three days of the time when defendant company paid Bates, he was bound to pay his subcontractors. The defendant company admitted indebtedness to Bates to the extent of $3,500.00 which was bound by the attachment. It might have held this amount to await the termination of the attachment proceedings. But Bates could not deny the indebtedness, he could only contend that, under a very technical construction of his agreement with his subcontractors, the money which he owed them was not then payable, because he had not been paid by the defendant and a period of three days after such payment had not elapsed. Under the circumstances, payment by the garnishee to his subcontractors should fairly be regarded as payment to Bates, as it went in discharge of his admitted indebtedness. The most that could then be said was that the payment thus made was three days in advance of the limit of time within which it could be withheld. The' service of the attachment prevented defendant from, making payment directly to Bates, and yet he contends that, until payment was actually made to him, his sub<a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>contractors could have no right to collect the amount which admittedly he owed them. This would be an unreasonable construction to place upon the agreement. It clearly appears that monthly estimates and monthly payments were contemplated, and that the time of such payments to the subcontractors was not to be delayed more than three days after each monthly payment had been made by defendant to Bates. It cannot be fairly or reasonably inferred from the terms of the contract that in any event payments were to be made otherwise than monthly. The requirement that they should be made at least that often, is as obvious and is quite as imperative as the stipulation that they are to be made within three days after Bates received his monthly payment. Under the circumstances, to hold that the indebtedness of Bates to his subcontractors could not be collected because, technically, it was not payable until the lapse of three days after Bates had been paid, would be a perversion of justice. The offer to show the payment by defendant company,' to the subcontractors of Bates, in connection with the attachment proceedings, should have been admitted, as being, under the circumstances, a proper set-off in the present suit. The second and third assignments of error are therefore sustained.</p>

These objections are without merit. No recovery was sought by the assignee. The cause of action has not been split. Only one suit has been brought, and that is for the entire amount of the claim.

Defendant contended that the easier and less expensive portion of the contract had been performed before plaintiff stopped work, and that there would have been no profit for him in that which then remained to be done. In support of this contention, defendant offered to prove what it actually cost to complete the Bates contract, and that the work was done in a careful manner, and as economically and cheaply as possible. The purpose of the offer was to show that plaintiff could not have completed the contract at the prices claimed by him, except at a loss. Counsel for .plaintiff objected to the admission of the offer, for the reason, among others, that it appeared in evidence that plaintiff had let and sublet all the concrete' and third class masonry work involved in his contract, and also part of his contract for excavation. The objection was sustained by the trial judge, and his action in so doing, is-made the subject of the seventh assignment of error. It did not appear that plaintiff had sublet the entire work which was yet to be done, nor was the financial ability of the subcontractors to complete the work, for the prices named, shown.</p>

It was not enough for plaintiff to show that he had a previous contract under which it had been agreed that the work would be done for less money. The question was whether such a contract would have been carried out, and the work' actually completed at a profit to plaifitiff.</p>

      <em>As </em>defendant refused to accept plaintiff’s modifications of the contract, one of which, was the change from January 1, 1911, to April 1, and insisted on retaining the former date, it is inconsistent to claim at this time that April 1st, was the date when the contract expired. Plaintiff’s claim was not based on the unaccepted written contract, but on a verbal contract, which did not specify any date for completion of the work. Even if defendant’s contention that a suit brought six days before the expiration of the limit fixed for the completion of the work to be done under the contract should be sustained, it would not apply to the present case, in which there was no stipulation as to date for completion.</p>

But whether or not the change increased the expense of the work for plaintiff was a disputed question of fact. Thq evidence as to this point was conflicting, but the credibility of the witnesses was for the jury, and the trial judge did not err in submitting to them the question whether the change of location imposed additional expense upon plaintiff in the performance of the contract.
