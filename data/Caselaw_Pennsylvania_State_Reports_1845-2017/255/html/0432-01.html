Shupe, for the benefit of his creditors. The court held that the joinder of the wife in the assignment did not affect her right'to dower in real estate which the husband had previously aliened by conveyances in which she did not join. With this conclusion we agree. There had been a severance of the coal from the surface of the tract of land in question, and the husband, by his deed dated January 1, 1880, had conveyed his interest in the coal to William J. Rainey. The deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors was not made until January 22, 1886, at which time the husband had no interest in the coal. The wife joined in the deed of assignment merely for the purpose of releasing her inchoate right of dower in the land which was thereby conveyed. Had she not joined in the deed, her right of dower would not have passed to a purchaser from the assignees: Mills v. Ritter, <a href="/pa/197/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="197 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="918659" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0353-01">197 Pa. 353</a>; McFadden v.

The deed shows no intention, upon the part of the wife, of releasing her dower interest in the coal which had some years before been deeded to another party, and in which the assignees acquired no interest whatever.

Appellants claim that the real estate so contributed became partnership assets and was converted into personalty, and that, therefore, Shupe’s widow can have no dower in it. The court below held that, while the real estate may have been converted as between the partners and those dealing with the firm, it “did not become personal property as to the plaintiff, Rebecca Shupe.” And further that there was, in any event, a re conversion into realty “as is evidenced by the partition proceedings in Hurst v.

There is but one mine, which is operated in á single vein of coal, underlying some 84 acres of land. The vein may not be of uniform thickness, and it may at places be interrupted by faults. Any definite portion of the vein might prove to be more or less valuable than the average. In the partition suit of Hurst v. Brennen (No. 1), <a href="/pa/239/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="239 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="995960" data-case-paths="/pa/239/0216-01">239 Pa. 216</a>, it was judicially determined that this same property could not be divided without .prejudice to, or spoiling the whole. Even if to the widow should be allotted her one-third of one-fourth of the mine, it would not be practicable for her to work that portion by itself. Manifestly, under the circumstances, the fair and reasonable method will be for the owners, as they work the mine, to account to complainant for her share of the value of the coal which is taken out. She is not entitled to share in the profits of the coke business, nor does the decree require an accounting for them. Her interest is in the rents, issues and profits of a coal mine, which is a going concern. As the trial judge says, the value of that interest must be determined by future proceedings, unless the parties can agree upon the amounts. We think, however, that the court below erred in directing that, in accounting to the widow for her share of the rents, issues and profits of the mine, the computation was to be made from July 20, 1914, the date when the bill was filed. The rule in Pennsylvania is that, in assigning dower in lands which have been aliened by the husband and during the coverture, the value shall be ascertained as of the time when the assignment is made: Sharp v. Pettit, <a href="/yeates/3/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="3 Yeates 38" data-case-ids="6771229" data-case-paths="/yeates/3/0037-01">3 Yeates 38</a>; Thompson v.

Where the assignment is by metes and bounds, the widow’s use of the land cannot, of course, begin before it is actually set apart for her.
