In an action by an employee against a contractor to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a fall occasioned by the alleged failure of the defendant to properly fasten scaffold uprights used in the construction of a porch, the case is for the jury and a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff will be sustained where it appears that the scaffold had been placed in position by defendant’s foreman, that plaintiff, who took no part in its erection or use was directed .to tear the scaffold down, and while engaged in so doing, in order to avoid crossing over a stairway between joists, swung outside and around one of the uprights when it pulled out and threw him to the ground, causing the injuries complained of.</p>

    <p id="b551-7" data-blocks='[["BL_551.15",551,[156,1261,1151,535]]]'>The defendant company had a contract for the erection of a dwelling house. The plaintiff was a carpenter employed by the defendant in and about the construction of the building and was injured by falling off the second story porch of the structure. The defendant had placed in charge a man named Miller as foreman who looked after the work of construction and had control of the plaintiff and other workmen. At the time plaintiff was injured he was doing the work that he had been directed to do by the foreman.</p>
    <p id="b551-8" data-blocks='[["BL_551.16",551,[155,1809,1151,594]],["BL_552.1",552,[249,330,1146,483]]]'>The facts leading up to the cause of the accident to the plaintiff are not disputed. Miller, the foreman, and another workman had partially erected and constructed a two story porch to the building, and had also erected the necessary scaffolding required in the porch construction. The plaintiff at this time had done no work on the porch or scaffolding while in course of construction. The foreman then directed the plaintiff and another workman to do certain work on the porch, the placing of moulding, sheeting, etc. The porch work had proceeded to the extent that the roof was ready for slating, the floor joists <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>laid and an opening made through the second floor joists three by nine (3x9') feet for a stairway. The roof of the second story porch was supported on the side and away from the building by four two by four (2x4") inch temporary uprights running from the second floor joists to the porch plate. The uprights at the bottom were toe-nailed into the joists and were not nailed at the top to the porch plate, and were also held in place by the weight of the roof structure resting on the uprights.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[249,824,1147,533]]]'>At this point in the work it appears that no further use of the scaffolding was required, and that plaintiff and his fellow workman were directed by Miller, the foreman, to tear down the scaffold. In doing this work plaintiff began oñ the second story end of the porch and had done the work up to and including the third upright, and to avoid crossing over the stairway opening between the joists, he swung outside and around the upright, when it pulled out from the top, and plaintiff was thrown to the ground and severely injured.</p>
    <p id="b552-5" data-blocks='[["BL_552.6",552,[250,1369,1146,208]]]'>The omission to nail the uprights to the porch plate is the negligence upon which the plaintiff bases his right to recover damages against the defendant company for the injuries he has sustained.</p>

Tbe negligen.ce of this case is not an act of a fellow workman committed in tbe ordinary course or progress of tbe work. Miller, tbe foreman, was acting in a dual capacity, not only doing tbe work himself, but exercising supervision over tbe manner and method of doing tbe work. Tbe defendant company bad adopted an improper way of porch construction in not securing the temporary. upright supports at- tbe top. Miller, as an experienced workman having charge of tbe work, did not follow tbe usual method of construction, but, as shown by tbe evidence, followed tbe method used by bis principal. It was tbe omission to perform a usual and customary act which, if it bad been performed, would have made tbe place reasonably safe in which tbe plaintiff was directed to do bis work.</p>
