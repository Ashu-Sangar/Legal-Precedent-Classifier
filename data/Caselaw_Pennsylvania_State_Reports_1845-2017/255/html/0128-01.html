Neither does it depend upon the defeasibility or indefeasibility of the right of possession ; for many estates are vested without possession, as well as with, which are yet defeasible. If there is a present right to a future possession though that right may be defeated by some future event, contingent or certain, there is nevertheless a vested estate. An unpossessed estate is vested, if it is certain to take effect in possession, by enduring longer than the precedent estate.

In that case the only time appointed for the payment of the legacies to those in remainder is after the death Of the widow, and the clause found in this will, “and to be paid and delivered unto my son at his age of twenty-one years, and to my daughters at their respective ages of twenty-one years or the date of marriage, whichever shall first happen,” is not in the Bartholémew case. And in our case the later words, “at the time aforesaid” are properly construed as referring to the time when the children attain their majority, for that is the time specified in the will for the payment of their respective shares; whereas in the Bartholemew case the words “at the time appointed” can have reference only to the time after the death of the widow, for there the will appoints no other time for division of the estate among the children and <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>contains no gift to those in remainder until that time; and it is there held that the testator did not contemplate under any circumstances an earlier division of his estate; hence it is held that the shares only vested in those living at the widow’s death. In that case a trust is created and the first mention of the children is the direction to divide the money between them after the wife’s death. Here the first mention of the children is a bequest to them of the estate in the event of the wife’s marriage or death; and each will provides in effect that the survivors shall take the shares of such of the children as die before the time fixed for the payment of their respective legacies.</p>
