It is within the lines of what is called Water street, and defendant claims the right to occupy same by virtue of an ordinance adopted by the council of said city in March, 1886. The main question here is whether it was then á public street. The Monongahela river adjoins the right of way of said Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railway Company on the north.</p>
    <p id="b596-6" data-blocks='[["BL_596.12",596,[243,1422,1153,807]]]'>In 1813 a tract of land located on the south side of said river, and embracing that here in controversy, was patented to Oliver Ormsby, and later became vested in John Ormsby, whose estate was partitioned in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County in 1844. The plan of said partition shows inter alia Water street , along the south bank of the river and of the width of one hundred feet more or less. ■ Purparts or tracts “C” and “B” on said plan are bounded on the north by Water street; on the east by Joséph street'(now Nineteenth street); on the south by Clifton street and on the west by Meadow street (now Eighteenth street). All of these streets are shown on the plan. In that partition purpart “B” was alloted to the heirs of Sidney. Gregg, deceased, and purparst “C” to the heirs of Oliver Ormsby, deceased.</p>

The streets are for the use of all the parties to the partition.” Later, by other proceedings in said Orphans’ Court, purparts “C” and “B” by separate proceedings in partition were allotted in severalty. In all there were at least four proceedings in partition respecting said property, between 1844 and 1849, inclusive, in each of which Water street is recognized and appears as the northern boundary thereof; and only in the partition first'above stated is there any mention of the persons for whose use said streets and alleys were dedicated.</p>
    <p id="b597-5" data-blocks='[["BL_597.5",597,[147,890,1155,424]]]'>Between 1844, the date of said first partition, and 1886, when the city granted the railroad company the right to lay its tracks in the alleged street, there are some twelve deeds of conveyance of said lands, or of parts or parcels thereof, wherein Water street is recognized and referred to as the northern boundary of the <em>property; </em>as it also is in certain proceedings in the Orphans’ Court authorizing some of these conveyances.</p>

That proceeding as filed refers to Water street as the northern boundary of the property but was amended so as to extend the northern boundary to the river. However it does not appear that any of the parties to the last named partition had record title to land north of the southern boundary of Water street.</p>

Said borough became a part of the City of <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>Pittsburgh in 1872. So far as appears Water -street, so-called, was never opened or used as a highway, except by the railroad, whose tracks were therein located. It was never expressly established or accepted as a highway by the municipality; but in 1849 R. E. McGowan, then engineer for said borough, at the direction of the council, made a borough map on which Water street is shown as a public highway of the width of 100 feet more or less, to low water line. And there is other evidence that it appeared as a public street on all of the borough maps, although the map made by McGowan was never adopted by the borough council nor recorded, but was found among his papers. The records of the borough show that in 1864 a contract was made for the grading of Clifton street, “the dirt to be placed on Water street between Joseph and Meadow streets.” In 1865 the council of said borough adopted a resolution favoring a change of the location of Water street, and some days later repealed such resolution. And thereafter, in 1865 and 1866, the street is mentioned in the records of council as a street of the borough.</p>
