The board of directors of a school district of the third class whose boundaries coincided with those of a city of the third class, refused to approve the bond of the city treasurer as collector of school taxes and appointed a separate tax collector for the district. The treasurer petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel the directors to approve his bond. The directors averred that as petitioner had been elected by the city councils under the provisions of the Act of June 27, 1913, Article VIII, Sec. 1, P. L. 568, 601, relating to the incorporation of cities of the third class, he had in point of law been appointed, and had not been elected within the meaning of Section 547, of the School Code of May 18, 1911, P. L. 309, 342, providing that the board of directors of a school district of the second, third or fourth class, where the tax collector is not elected, shall appoint tax collectors for said district. <em>Meld, </em>the lower court properly decided that petitioner had been elected within the meaning of the school code and that he was the tax collector of said district and awarded the relief prayed for.</p>

    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[631,594,223,26]]]'>DISCUSSION.</p>
    <p id="b313-5" data-blocks='[["BL_313.6",313,[174,695,1147,482]]]'>We take it for granted that the form of the remedy invoked in this case is not objected to, and that the parties desire a decision on the merits of the controversy regardless of the question as to whether or not the title of an office is involved, and that the proper remedy might be by quo warranto to which action William J. Evans would necessarily be a party. This question is not raised in the pleadings; nor was it adverted to at the argument; nor is it mentioned in the briefs.</p>
    <p id="b313-6" data-blocks='[["BL_313.7",313,[174,1189,1160,690]]]'>The discussion of this case begins naturally with the. Act of June 20, 1901, P. L. 578, which provides that the city treasurer in each city of the third class, by virtue of his office, shall be the collector of city, school and poor taxes assessed and levied in said city, and that he shall take and subscribe his oath of office as collector of city, school and poor taxes, which oath shall be filed with the city clerk of the proper city. It should be observed that the act, in terms, refers to city treasurers hereinafter “elected” in cities of the third class. This Act of 1901 furnishes a complete and comprehensive system regulating the collection of the taxes mentioned in third class' cities.</p>
    <p id="b313-7" data-blocks='[["BL_313.8",313,[174,1900,1149,478]],["BL_314.1",314,[239,308,1144,317]]]'>The next statute to be considered is the Act of June 27,1913, Art. VIII, Section 1, P. L. 568, page 601, which provides that the council of each city of the third class shall “elect” a city treasurer for the term of two years. This provision effects a radical change in the method of choosing city treasurers in third class cities. It changes the method from an election by the voters of the city to an election or an appointment by the council. We are not concerned with the reason which prompted the <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>change. It is probably in line with the desire to bring the government of cities in the state within scientific business principles, because we notice that the treasurer appointed by the council must be a “competent accountant.” However, this is a question of no moment in the present case.</p>
    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[239,638,1143,144]]]'>The-last act of assembly we refer to is the School Code of May 18, 1911, P. L. 309, 342,' Section 547, which provides as follows:</p>
    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.6",314,[234,799,1162,424]]]'>“The board of school directors in each school district-of the second, third,'or fourth class in this Commonwealth, where a tax collector is not elected to collect school taxes, or where there is a vacancy, or where any tax collector elected refuses to qualify or furnish a bond as herein provided, shall annually, on or before the first day of June in each year, appoint one or more suitable persons as tax collectors in said school district.”</p>
    <p id="b314-6" data-blocks='[["BL_314.7",314,[230,1236,1149,740]]]'>It is contended by the defendants that when they appointed Evans collector of school taxes that the city treasurer of (Jarbondale had not been “elected” within the meaning of that word as found in the section of the school code above quoted; that Hughes was only an appointee of the council, and was not an “elected” treasurer ; and, therefore, that the school board had the right to appoint its own tax collector. The whole contention is based upon the proposition that when the school code was enacted, treasurers of cities of the third class were elected by the voters of each city, and that the Act of 1901 and the section of the school code should be construed together, one in the light of the other so as to produce a harmonious result.</p>

L. 578, is entitled to collect school taxes in a school district of the second class, coincident with such city, notwithstanding he was elected after the approval of the Act of May 18, 1911, P. L. 309, providing for the appointment of school tax collectors in certain cases. The fact in some school districts of the second class the school board may appoint the tax collector, while in others they may not, is not sufficient to condemn the Acts of May 18, 1911, P. L. 309, and June 20, 1901, P. L. 578, as unconstitutional.”</p>

An appointment, on the other hand, may be made by a single person, or by a body such as a city council. Although the Act of 1913, supra, states that the council of each city shall “elect” a city treasurer, it ought, to be conceded that such an election is in law an appointment; but this distinction makes no difference in the present case. We take a much broader view of the question. The right to collect school taxes in a city of the third class is a right, or duty, incident to the office of city treasurer-, regardless of the method by which the treasurer was chosen. If elected, as he was prior to 1913, he collected the school <em>taxes; </em>and if elected, or appointed, by the council, after 1913, he still performs the <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>same duties. We are averse to adopt, a construction that will destroy a uniform system of collecting school taxes in cities of the third class because of a critical interpretation of the word “election.”</p>
