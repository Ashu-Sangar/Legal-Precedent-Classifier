Hogarty, while performing his duties as an extra freight conductor of a shifting crew, of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railway Company, was thrown under a car and sustained serious injuries, which resulted in the loss of his right arm. He was thrown under the car by coming in contact with a telegraph pole, which he alleges in the statement of his cause of action had been negligently placed and left by the railway company too close to the track on which the cars in his charge were being shifted. ■ In the performance of his duties at the time he was injured it was necessary for him to lean out beyond the side of a car to uncouple it while it was in motion, and, in so leaning out, his body struck the pole. The case has been twice tried. On the first trial the jury were instructed to find for the defendant, and judgment was subsequently entered in its favor.' Plaintiff’s statement of claim averred a mere common law liability on the part of the defendant, and, it having proved that he had accepted benefits as a member of its relief association, the court below sustained its contention that he could not recover under Reese v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/229/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="229 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="971826" data-case-paths="/pa/229/0340-01">229 Pa. 340</a>, and other cases.

To this the defendant replied that, as the suit had been brought at common law, the Federal statute was without application. The rejoinder of the plaintiff was that, if he should have formally pleaded the Federal statute, he was entitled to amend. On his appeal from the judgment in <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>favor of the defendant, his right to amend was sustained by this court, and the judgment was reversed with a venire facias de novo: Hogarty v.

The questions which counsel were directed to argue are, (1) Were the original pleadings sufficient to sustain judgment for the plaintiff? (2) Did the court below err in allowing the statement of claim to be amended?</p>

This conclusively appears, from the statement of his cause of action, which is as follows: “On February 1,1910, plaintiff was employed by defendant as freight conductor on a train of freight cars in its <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>Philadelphia yards near American street and Lehigh avenue, and was directed by William L. Weyman, then acting for defendant, to place two of said cars (there being several in the train) on a certain track. In the performance of this duty plaintiff was required to lean over between two of the cars to uncouple them while the train was moving, and whilst so doing, through no fault of his own, his body struck a telegraph pole, he was thrown beneath the wheels, had three ribs and a collarbone broken and his right arm was crushed (afterwards amputated). The defendant was negligent in having the pole too close to the track or the track too close to the pole, there not being sufficient room between the two to permit safe performance of the service as directed, and in directing plaintiff to put the cars on the said track, the danger being unknown to plaintiff and no warning given.” Not a word is to be found in plaintiff’s statement indicating anything but a common law liability on the part of the defendant, and, to the charge therein alleged against it, it came into court with a complete common law defense. It was held, however, on plaintiff’s appeal, that, notwithstanding the common law cause of action which he had.set forth in his pleadings, the act of congress was controlling’, in view of the admission of the defendant that, at the time the plaintiff was injured, it and he were engaged in interstate commerce. After argument and reargument of this appeal, ordered of our own motion, we are of opinion that our view expressed on the first appeal is not in harmony with the rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States, and, as they are controlling, what we there held must yield' to them.</p>

In so holding, it was said: “Where any fact is necessary to be proved in order to sustain the plaintiff’s right of recovery the declaration must contain an averment substantially of such fact in order to let in the proof. Every issue must be founded upon some certain point so that the parties may come prepared with their evidence, and not be taken by surprise and the jury may not be misled by the introduction of various matters.......The request is now made that in view of all the circumstances- — especially the former undetermined meaning of the statute, this court remand the cause for a new trial upon the declaration being so amended as to include the essential allegation. But we do not think such action would be proper.

In holding that the amendment introduced a new and different cause of action, which was barred by the statute of limitations, we said,- through Mr. Justice Mestrezat : “The original statement, it is true, averred the injuries of the plaintiff and the alleged negligent act of the defendant by which they were caused, but there was no intimation in the statement that the carrier was engaged in interstate commerce or that the defendant’s cars were equipped with <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>couplers in violation of thé act of congress.

The Supreme Court of the state held that in the absence of such an allegation the petition did not state a cause of action under the original act. We think that ruling was right. The terms of that act were such that its application de-/ pended, first, upon the carrier being engaged in interstate commerce by railroad; and, second, upon the use of the car in moving interstate traffic. It did not embrace all cars used on the line of such a carrier, but only such as were used in interstate commerce.”</p>

It averred that the defendant was operating a line of railroad “in Virginia, North Carolina and elsewhere.” Over the objection of the defendant the trial court allowed the plaintiff to amend by averring that the line of the defendant’s railroad extended between the City of Raleigh, in the State of North Carolina, and the City of Richmond, in the State of Virginia. On a writ of error taken by the defendant company the Supreme Court of the United States, in an opinion filed May 22, 1916, held that the amendment had not been improperly allowed, as no new Gause of action had been introduced. Mr. Justice Van Devanter, speaking for the court, said: “This was an action by an employee of a railroad company to recover from the latter for personal injuries suffered through its negligence.

During the trial the defendant sought some advantage from this and the court, over the defendant’s objection, permitted the complaint to be so amended as to state distinctly the defendant’s engagement and the plaintiff’s employment in such commerce. Both parties conceded that what was alleged in the amendment was true in fact and conformed to the proofs, and that point has since been treated as settled. The defendant’s objection was that the original complaint did not state a cause of action under the act of congress, that with the amendment the complaint would state a new cause of action under that act, and that, as more than two years had elapsed since the right of action accrued, the amendment could not be made the medium of introducing this new cause of action consistently with the provision in section 6 that ‘no action shalLbe maintained under this act unless commenced within two years from the day the cause of action accrued.’ Whether in what was done this restriction was in effect disregarded is a Federal-question and subject to reexamination here, however much the allowance of the amendment otherwise might have rested in discretion or been a matter of local procedure : Atlantic Coast Line Railroad v.

The original complaint set forth that the .defendant was operating a line of railroad in Virginia, North Carolina and elsewhere, that the plaintiff was in its employ, that when he was injured he was in the line of duty and was proceeding to get aboard one of the -defendant’s trains, and that the injury was sustained at Cochran, Virginia, through the defendant’s negligence in permitting a part of its right of way at that place to get and remain in a dangerous condition. Of course, the right of action could not arise under the laws of North Carolina when the causal negligence and the injury occurred in Virginia; and the absence of any mention of the laws of the latter state was at least consistent with their inapplicability. Besides, the allegation that the defendant was operating a railroad in states other than Virginia was superfluous .if the right of action arose under the laws of that state, and was pertinent only if it arose in interstate commerce, and therefore under the act of congress. In these circumstances, while the question is not free from difficulty, we cannot say that the court erred in treating the original complaint as pointing, although only imperfectly, to a cause of action under the law of congress. And this being so, it must be taken that the amendment merely expanded or amplified what was alleged in support of that cause of action and related back to the commencement of the suit, which was before the limitation had expired.” It clearly appears from this last utteranee of the Supreme Court of the United States that if Benn’s original complaint had averred merely.a common law right of action against the railway company, with nothing in it indicating that the employer was operating a line of railroad from one state into another, the amendment would have been improperly allowed, for the reason that it introduced a new cause of action under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, which had been barred by the express terms of that act after two years from the time of the accident.

Weyman, then acting for defendant, to place two of said cars (there being several in the train) on a certain track.” The allowance of this amendment was excepted to by the defendant, on the ground that it introduced a new cause of action under the Act of Congress of April 22,1908, which was barred. Under Seaboard Air Line Railway v. Renn, it was improperly allowed, and proof in support of it, if admitted by the court below, would not have helped the plaintiff. The same is true of the admission by the defendant, that, when he was injured, it was engaged and he was employed by it in interstate commerce. At the time the admission was made, and for nearly three years before, all liability of the defendant under the act of congress had ceased, for none could have been enforced against it except by an action brought within two years from the time the injuries wére sustained. The admission was not that the plaintiff had a cause of action under the act of congress, but merely that, at the time of the accident, and for two years thereafter, the defendant might have been liable under the act, which, however, was no longer availing to the plaintiff.</p>

Hence, we have before us a substantive question of law, arising out of an agreed state of facts; and that question is: When it affirmatively appears, by an unrestricted and unqualified agreement of record, that a plaintiff, employed by an interstate railroad, was injured while engaged in interstate commerce, can the defendant, after making suGh an admission, under any circumstances, subsequently be heard to say that Section 5 of the Federal Employers’ Liability Act of April 22, 1908, does not apply to the case?

In Chicago &amp; Alton R. R. Co. v. Wagner, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20U.S.%20152" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="239 U.S. 152">239 U. S. 152</a>, an action was brought in a state court to recover for personal injuries. The plaintiff was not employed by the defendant company, and, therefore, could not sue under the Federal statute. The defendant proved that the plaintiff was an employee of the Burlington Company, another railroad, and that he had received benefits as a member of the latter’s relief association; further, that this Burlington Company was a joint tortfeasor with it, the defendant. On these facts the defendant claimed that, “since there can be but one satisfaction <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>for an injury,” the plaintiff was not entitled to recover against it because its joint tort-feasor, the Burlington Company, had been released from liability through and by reason of the acceptance of its relief benefits by the plaintiff. The State Supreme Court held that, notwithstanding the fact the action was not brought under the Act of Congress, since it appeared the accident happened in the course of interstate commerce, the validity of the alleged release must be tested by the Federal and not the State law. This view was sustained on appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States saying (pp. 457-8), “It is urged that Section 5 [the part of .the Federal Employers’ Liability Act which prohibits the defense in question] was wholly inapplicable in an action brought against a third person to enforce a liability not created by the Federal act. The argument is, in substance, that in this action against the Alton Company, inasmuch as it is not brought to enforce the liability imposed by the Federal statute, Section 5 cannot be considered for any purpose; that is, that under Section 5 the release can be deemed to be invalid only so far as it is actually used to protect the Burlington Company from liability in a suit against it under the act. This involves, we think, a fundamental misconception. It is, of course, impossible to determine whether a joint tort-feasor is discharged except by asking, what would happen if he were sued? The liability created by the act arose when the injury was received, and it is clear that if it was received while Wagner was engaged in interstate commerce, his acceptance of benefits under the relief contract would not bar an action against his employer......When, therefore, the Alton Company sought to escape from liability, otherwise existing under the State law, by reason of a release to the Burlington Company, it was entirely competent for the plaintiff to show the nature of his employment and that the asserted release was within the Federal statute, and could not operate as a discharge.” It is clear that the above quotation means that, had the Bur<a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>lington Company been sued as the Alton Company was in the then present action, the Federal act would have applied so as to exclude the defense depended upon, and it is particularly to be observed that the court there states the alleged release “could not operate as a discharge.” In fact, as I read it, the whole context of the opinion indicates that the Federal Supreme Court meant to rule that such a release can never operate as a discharge in any case where suit is brought against a railroad by an employee injured in the course of interstate commerce, where the latter fact is properly made to appear, and that this rule applies whether the action to recover for the injuries is formally instituted under the Act of Congress or otherwise. In this connection, when the case just reviewed was in the Supreme Court of Illinois, on appeal (Wagner v. Chicago &amp; Alton R. R. Co., <a href="/ill/265/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="265 Ill. 245" data-case-ids="4780191" data-case-paths="/ill/265/0245-01">265 Ill. 245</a>, 251, 252), that tribunal took the position that, although under the local law the defense of an implied release through the acceptance of relief association benefits might ordinarily be a valid one', yet “the State law in this regard has been modified......by the Federal Employers’ Liability Act as to cases where injuries are received by certain employees of an employer engaged in interstate commerce,” and in such cases the defense in question cannot apply. After first saying that a stipulation filed at the trial of the case left it as though no allegation that the plaintiff had been injured in interstate commerce had been made in the declaration, the court adds: “When plaintiff in error [the defendant below] attempted to prove a satisfaction by the payment of benefits by its joint tort-feasor, the Burlington Company, to the defendant in error, it was proper for defendant in error [the plaintiff below], in rebuttal, to show that no valid release had been given the Burlington Company by him. As between the defendant in error and the Burlington Company, the Federal Employers’ Liability Act clearly applied, and if, as the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held, that law supersedes <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>all state laws on the subject, then the release given by defendant in error to the Burlington Company was not valid and would not have precluded recovery by him from that company. If it was not valid so far as the Burlington Company was concerned, it was .clearly invalid as to the plaintiff in error and constituted no defense to this action.” Although the view just quoted was dissented from by two justices of the Supreme Court of Illinois, yet, as we have seen, on appeal, it was approved by the Supreme Court of the United States, the latter saying, with reference thereto, it simply meant that “the release could not aid the Alton Company for the very plain reason that the alleged joint tort feasor “had not been discharged,” and adding these significant words — “The State law did not recognize the discharge of the defendant by virtue of a release of a joint tort-feas- or which, under the law applicable thereto, was found to be without validity.” We use. the term “significant,” for the Federal Employers’ Liability Act is referred to as “the law applicable” to the alleged release, though the case quoted from was not an action under that statute. It seems to me that Chicago &amp; Alton Railway Co. v. Wagner, just reviewed, is sufficient to sustain the judgment entered in this case; but it is not necessary to rest thereon, for, as I shall now show, many other United States Supreme Court decisions can be mentioned which justify the position that the present case was subject to the provisions of Section 5 of the Federal Employers’ Liability Act.</p>

The case was in the United States Courts by reason of diverse citizenship. The original complaint charged that at the time of the accident the deceased was a fireman on a train bound from a point in the State of Kansas to one in the State of Oklahoma; but it further expressly averred that the suit was instituted “by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas, where the said Fred S. Wulf was killed,” and which by statute provides “a right of action for injuries resulting in death.” The defendant answered that the cause of action was “not governed by the laws of Kansas,” but by the Federal Employers’ Lia<a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>bility Act; whereupon the plaintiff asked leave to amend and apply the Federal statute. To this the defendant objected that the Statute of Limitations had run; but the court allowed the amendment. On appeal from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the Supreme Court of the United States said, “It is contended that the plaintiffs original petition failed to state a cause of action because she sued in her individual capacity and based her right of recovery upon the Kansas statute, whereas her action could legally rest only upon the Federal Employers’ Liability Act of 1908, which requires the action to be brought in the name of the personal representative of the deceased; that the plaintiff’s amended petition......alleged an entirely new and distinct cause of action and that such an amendment could not legally be allowed so as to relate back to the commencement of the action, inasmuch as the plaintiff’s cause of action was barred by the limitation of two years......It is true the original petition asserted a right of action under the laws of Kansas, without making reference to the Act of Congress, but the court was presumed to be cognizant of the enactment of the Employers’ Liability Act, and to know that, with respect to the responsibility of interstate carriers by railroad to their employees injured in such commerce......it had the effect of superseding state laws upon .the subject......; therefore, the pleader was not required to refer to the Federal Act, and the reference actually made to the Kansas statute no more vitiated the pleading than a reference to any repealed statute would have done.” It is true that, in the course of the foregoing opinion, the Federal Supreme Court said that the original petition “sufficiently averred that the deceased came to his death through injuries suffered while he was employed......in interstate commerce”; but an examination of the original pleadings in the court below, as sent up on appeal, shows that the excerpt just quoted from the opinion of the Supreme Court must mean, and could only mean, that a certain allegation in the original <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>complaint to the effect that the deceased, at the time of the accident, was employed in the ^performance of his duties......on a train......bound from Parsons in the State of Kansas to Osage in the State of Oklahoma,” was a sufficient averment to bring the case within the statute; for that is the only possible matter in the entire declaration that in any manner indicated the plaintiff’s case had a Federal aspect. Of course, an amendment of the party plaintiff was necessary in this Wulf case, for the action was instituted by one who, in the capacity in which she was named, had no right to sue under the Federal statute ; which likewise ivas the situation in St. Louis, San Francisco &amp; Texas Ry.

The declaration simply averred that the defendant was operating a line of railroad “in the State of Oklahoma,”' and that “deceased was a brakeman on defendant’s said line in Oklahoma.” The defendant’s answer did not refer to the Federal' act nor to the interstate character of the plaintiff’s employment. The testimony showed, however, that at the time of the accident the deceased was working on a train engaged in interstate commerce; whereupon the defendant requested a peremptory instruction to the effect that a certain item of damage, not permitted by the Federal statute, could not be recovered. The trial court, while treating the defendant’s motion as sufficient to-raise a Federal question under the act of congress, held that the statute did not apply] and the Supreme Court of the state subsequently decided that it was “only supplementary and the judgment [for the plaintiff] .could be upheld under the state laws.” The United States Supreme Court accepted the finding of the court below to the effect that a Federal question was involved, and reversed the case, holding that the act of congress applied.

The company demurred to the replication on the ground that it was a departure from the cause of action under the state law, and an assertion of a new cause of action under the Federal Employers’ Liability Law. This demurrer was overruled.” In affirming judgment for the plaintiff, the Supreme Court said it was sufficient that the State Court of Appeals held the defect in the declaration “cured by the charge in the plea and the admission in the replication that White was employed in interstate commerce.” In Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pac.

The defendant set up “as a special defense” that “at the time the plaintiff’s intestate was killed he was engaged in interstate commerce, and that the liability of the defendant was fixed and regulated by the Federal Employers’ Liability Act.” The state court “assumed that the record sufficiently presented the question of a Federal right,” but decided the point against the party asserting the right, holding that “The action was <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>brought under the statute of North Carolina, that the Federal act had no application, and that the cause was triable under the statutes of the state.” In reversing, the United States Supreme Court ruled that “the Federal act governs to the exclusion of the statutes of the state.” In Koennecke v. Seaboard Air Line, 85 S. E. Repr. 374, 375, the Supreme Court of South Carolina held, “Where,' in an action for the death of a railroad employed, evidence that he was engaged in interstate commerce was elicited without objection on the cross-examination of one of plaintiff’s witnesses, either party might, so long as the evidence remained in the record, claim the benefit of the Federal statute, though the pleading of neither asserted any right or immunity under it,” saying that, where the facts are not changed, the cause of action is essentially the same whether tried under the state or Federal law, and that “it could rarely happen that a shifting from one to another would work prejudice and surprise”; the court observed, however, that “if the parties have not previously been warned by the pleadings that such a shifting might take place, and if it should be made to appear that it would be a surprise and operate to cut off a claim or defense which could otherwise have been made, the trial court would either not allow It or allow it upon such terms as would prevent prejudice.” On appeal the Supreme Court of the United States (Seaboard Air Line Ry. v.

The action was instituted in a state court, by an employee of the defendant railroad, to recover for- personal injuries. Nothing was averred in the declaration which directly indicated the suit was other than a common law action; but the plaintiff secured a verdict under the Employers’ Liability Act. A judgment entered on this verdict was affirmed by the State Supreme Court (86 S. E. Repr. 961), and the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. In affirming, that tribunal said: “The original complaint was exceedingly brief and did not sufficiently allege that at the time of the injury- the defendant was engaged and the plaintiff employed in interstate commerce. During the trial the defendant sought some advantage from this, and the court, over the defendant’s objection, permitted the complaint to be&gt; so amended as to state distinctly the defendant’s engagement and the plaintiff’s employment in such commerce.

And this being so, it must be taken that the amendment merely expanded or amplified what was alleged in support of that cause of action and related back to the commencement of the suit, which was before the limitation had expired.” Surely this decision should be accepted as controlling the present case; for, here, as there, the original declaration, while not- averring the act of congress, or facts bringing the plaintiff’s cause of action directly thereunder, contains nothing inconsistent therewith; hence, in view of the defendant’s admission it was engaged in interstate commerce, and that the plaintiff was so employed when injured, the declaration should be held sufficient, and the amendment as merely “expanding or amplifying” the cause of action originally stated.</p>

S. 156</a>, the action was by the widow and parents.of an employee of the defendant railroad to recover for his death. The plaintiff’s petition contained nothing to indicate that the accident happened in the course of interstate commerce. The defendant excepted to the pleading on the ground that it did not show whether the action was brought under the state or Federal law. If the Federal law applied, and the evidence showed it did, then the suit was by the wrong party, as the United States statute requires the action to be in the name of the personal representative of the deceased. The plaintiffs elected to stand by their petition as originally stated. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, “without prejudice to such rights as the personal representative of the deceased may have,” saying: “The plaintiffs......stood by their petition; it was to the case therein stated that the defendant was called upon to make defense..... .When the evidence was adduced it developed that the real case was not con<a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>trolled by the state statute, but by the Federal statute; in short, the case pleaded was not proved and the case proved was not pleaded. In that situation the defendant interposed the objection grounded on the Federal statute that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover on the case proved.” The above decision simply amounts to this: there could be no recovery in the suit as instituted, for the evidence showed that the case fell within the act of congress, and the parties named as plaintiffs were without authority to sue under the Federal law. In short, the parties plaintiff were entitled to sue under the State law but not under the Federal statute, whereas, under the evidence adduced, the latter was the only law which could be applied; therefore, the Supreme Court properly said that the case pleaded was not proved and the case proved was not pleaded. In connection with this Seale case consider the discussion of Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Ry. v. Wulf, <a href="/us/226/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="226 U.S. 570" data-case-ids="8288845" data-case-paths="/us/226/0570-01">supra;</a> also see Winfree v. Nor. Pac. Ry.

S. 296</a>, 302, a case involving the same act of congress which is now before us, where it was expressly held that “Damages to his [the decedent’s] estate [under the Federal statute] would be a distinct cause of action from damages to his parents [under a state statute],” the principle of which ruling, when kept in mind, makes plain the decision in St. Louis, San Francisco &amp; Texas Ry.

The case at bar differs from the one just reviewed in that here there is nothing whatever in the party plaintiff or in the averments of his declaration inconsistent with an action under the Federal law, and, in addition, we have the element of the admission of record previously discussed.</p>

The Safety Appliance Act is not of the character of the Employers’ Liability Act; the latter ordains broad, general rules of public policy, and, within its field, not only supersedes the common law but all relevant state enactments, while the former is one which ordains a minute, physical regulation, to wit, that a certain kind of mechanical contrivance, or coupler, must be used upon all cars engaged in interstate commerce. Hence, of course, if one d’esires to recover because of a breach of this special regulation, he must bring his declaration strictly within the provisions of the statute which ordains it. The case of Grand Trunk Western Ry. v. Lindsay, <a href="/us/233/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="233 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="3673790" data-case-paths="/us/233/0042-01">233 U. S. 42</a>, shows, however, that, even when the Safety Appliance Act is expressly pleaded, all the provisions of the Employers’ Liability Act apply, though the latter is not referred to in the pleadings. Whether or not the distinction which we have drawn be sound, is not important, however, for, as already pointed out, here the defendant had, in effect, conceded in the court below that the Federal law controlled, before raising the inconsistent contention that the relevant act of congress could not apply because of the plaintiff’s failure to plead it.

Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R., <a href="/us/235/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="235 U.S. 308" data-case-ids="3675178" data-case-paths="/us/235/0308-01">235 U.

Of course, in the case before us for decision there was no surprise, either actual or legal.</p>
    <p id="b299-3" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[135,926,1154,1464]],["BL_300.1",300,[241,317,1160,2057]],["BL_301.1",301,[151,315,1154,866]]]'>As stated at the beginning of this dissent, I do not feel that the present case turns on a question of pleading, but, if it did, I am of opinion the plaintiff’s original declaration was sufficient to sustain the judgment; for, while there is nothing therein to indicate the action occurred in interstate commerce, yet, on the other hand, there is nothing to exclude that idea (Kansas City Western Ry. Co. v. McAdow, <a href="/us/240/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="240 U.S. 51" data-case-ids="3689673" data-case-paths="/us/240/0051-01">240 U. S. 51</a>). In certain instances, where a legislative enactment creates in detail a right or duty new to the law, for instance,.the Federal Safety Appliance Act, or, again, where a plaintiff has a choice between the common law and a statute, it may be necessary to plead the latter in a declaration claiming damages by reason of a breach thereof; but that is not this case. Here the ordinary rule applies, that it is not necessary to plead an act of assembly; for, though the law thus established is to govern, when applicable, yet it is not part of the cause of action; or, to speak inore specifically, while, in the contingency of certain defenses being offered, the nonapplication of the Federal Employers’ Liability Act might, in the end, serve to defeat the plaintiff, yet, since the right to sue in no sense depended upon it, the act could not be said to enter into his cause of action. Ordinarily, it is only essential to plead the facts showing the plaintiff’s right, and the defendant’s violation thereof, and, in so doing, it is never required that a defense shall be anticipated; but even assuming <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>that, generally speaking, it is the duty of a plaintiff, in a case like the present, in some way to indicate in his declaration that the Act of 1908, supra, is depended upon, and to prove facts showing his case to be within the statute, then we come back to my original position concerning the admission by the defendant. In this connection, see Noel v. Kessler et al., <a href="/pa/252/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="252 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="1021648" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0244-01">252 Pa. 244</a>, where we recently held that defendants, “by* their admissions in the pleadings, could waive proper and necessary averments in the statement, and if they do so, they cannot, on appeal, after a trial......on the merits, object to the informalities of the statement.” This was said in a contract case, but it was an instance where the so-called “informality” concerned a vital matter of substance. Since the abandonment of special pleading, much that was formerly developed in that way, prior to trial, is now accomplished by formal admissions of record at the time of trial. With us, in trespass, the general issue is the only plea permitted; hence, in a negligence case, there could be no such admissions as those referred to in the above quotation, i. e., in the pleadings, for, under our practice, in such cases, all admissions by the defendant must be made by written stipulation or orally in court, but,, when so made, ex necessitate, they should have the same force and be given 'the like effect as though contained in a formal pleading. Of course, a fact that is at issue, in the sense that it is controverted, must, as a general rule, have had an averment in the pleadings to support it; but a fact admitted of record, no matter how material it may be, •stands on a different footing. An unrestricted admission of record is'more than merely evidential in effect, for it not only grants the fact in question but also its admissibility, and to this extent, at least, such an- admission tacitly concedes the pleadings in the case to be good and sufficient. Therefore, in this case, after counsel made the before quoted admission, without either qualification or restriction, for the purpose of the trial, it was, in effect, conceded the defendant had knowledge of the fact <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>that the accident under investigation had happened in interstate commerce, and that the plaintiff so claimed, just as much as though the latter had either been put formally on notice thereof by an averment in the declaration or had admitted it by an answer in the nature of a plea; and the defendant could not subsequently avoid the force of this admission by complaining that the plaintiff ’ had failed formally to declare the facts comprehended therein. To my mind, it is losing sight of the realities of the situation, and playing with the administration of the law, to permit one, after making such an admission, to assume the position that, because the statement of claim failed to inform the defendant of what it admittedly already knew, the plaintiff could not take advantage of the real facts in the case and the court could not administer the only law applicable thereto.</p>
    <p id="b301-4" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[152,1192,1158,1186]],["BL_302.1",302,[247,318,1146,195]]]'>I think the Supreme Court of the United- States never intended to rule as a governing general principle that,, if an injured plaintiff incidentally avers the fact that the defendant’s railroad traverses more than one state, then the Federal Employers’ Liability Act will apply to his cause of action (even though, as in the Wulf case, supra, such plaintiff further expressly avers that he depends upon the local law), whereas, if he fails to inform the railroad, by an averment in his declaration, of the terminal points of its line, then the Federal law will not apply (even though, as in the present case, the defendant at all times knew the accident in controversy happened on its road to an employee while engaged in the transaction of interstate business). In this connection, it seems to .me, the majority of our court, in reading the recent decisions of the Federal Supreme Court, lay undue emphasis upon certain passages from the Wulf and Renn opinions, supra. To my mind, the passages in question represent relevant judicial makeweights, proper under the peculiar facts of those particular cases, but were not intended as statements of restrictive general principles to control all future actions <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>for injuries to railroad employees, particularly where, as here, it is unrestrictedly and unqualifiedly admitted at trial that such injuries happened in the course of interstate commerce.</p>
    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[232,534,1159,641]]]'>Moreover, in a case such as the one now before us, where the plaintiff’s employer relies upon a defense which is repudiated by the United States law as against public policy, and which, since the happening of the accident that gave rise to the plaintiff’s injury, has, for a 'like reason, been forbidden by statute in our own State (see Sec. 204 of Article II, Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736), it seems to me that this court should not be astute to find reasons for reversing - the judgment entered below, particularly when we have already held, in reviewing a prior trial (<a href="/pa/245/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="245 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="326095" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0443-01">245 Pa. 443</a>) that, on the pleadings as originally made, the issues involved were for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.6",302,[239,1186,1150,751]]]'>Before concluding, it may not be amiss to note that at the former trial of this case there also was an unrestricted and unqualified admission that the accident to the plaintiff occurred in the course of interstate commerce (see Hogarty v. Philadelphia &amp; Reading Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/245/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="245 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="326095" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0443-01">245 Pa. 443</a>, 446). Hence the amendment of the declaration, subsequently permitted, merely made the pleadings accord with the real facts involved as they had previously been agreed to by counsel-for the defendant; but, however this may be, under Chicago &amp; Alton R. R. Co. v. Wagner, supra, and other authorities herein cited, after the defendant’s admissions of record, the case under review should not be made to turn on a mere question of pleading.</p>
    <p id="b302-6" data-blocks='[["BL_302.7",302,[238,1948,1147,427]]]'>I cannot agree with the majority view, as written by our honored Chief Justice, that the recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States compel a reversal of the present judgment. On the contrary, I strongly feel that, under a proper reading of the relevant authorities, on the admitted facts at bar, the defense depended upon was not available, and the plaintiff should hold his verdict; therefore, I dissent.</p>
