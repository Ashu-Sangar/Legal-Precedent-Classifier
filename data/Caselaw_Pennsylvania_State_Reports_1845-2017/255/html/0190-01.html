She passed out the rear door of the car and down the steps and the conductor was standing there on the platform. Plaintiff testifies that before she had cleared the last step the car started forward causing her injury. In other words that she was hurt by the premature starting of the car. On the instant she spoke angrily to the conductor, and by a signal from Mm the car was stopped when it had moved about four feet. Then she walked <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>away and the car proceeded. Aside from a denial of the injuries, defendant contends that plaintiff had reached the ground and was clear of the car before it started, and also that such starting of the car resulted from the unauthorized act of a passenger in signaling the car to go forward. Both branches of this defense l are sustained by the evidence of the conductor and two passengers, one of whom, a Mr. Foreman, testifies that he gave such signal by two rings of the bell.</p>
    <p id="b227-11" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[178,801,1158,1520]]]'>The car was divided, the front end being for passengers and the rear end for baggage; and in the latter there were seats at the sides. Mr. Foreman testified that while standing erect he could reach to the height of seven feet three inches from the floor, and that he was standing in the baggage compartment about two feet from the door when plaintiff passed him as she left the car^ and that so standing he put his' head and right shoulder out of the rear door and with his left hand pulled the bell rope, which as shown by other evidence was seven feet above the floor and seventeen inches to one side of the door. According to the evidence for defendant Foreman stood practically facing the conductor and only a few feet from him; and Mr. Boyer, defendant’s other witness, and only other passenger in the baggage compartment, was seated where he could look out the door; and all three were watching plaintiff as she passed down the steps to leave the car. Plaintiff denies that anyone was standing in the baggage compartment as she passed out. Between- that compartment and the rear platform there was a window on each side of the door and the evidence was conflicting as to whether the situation was. such that the alleged act of Foreman in pulling the bell rope could and should have been seen by the conductor in time to have prevented it. The court submitted that question to the jury, and also the question as to whether Foreman did give such signal. There was no afirma-' tive evidence that,it was given by the conductor.</p>
    <p id="b227-12" data-blocks='[["BL_227.6",227,[227,2329,1102,47]],["BL_228.1",228,[235,307,1147,412]]]'>On the former appeal of this case, in <a href="/pa/246/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="246 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="1006246" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0473-01">246 Pa. 473</a>, the <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>judgment for plaintiff was reversed inter alia on the ground that the jury’s finding that Foreman did not ring the hell was unfounded and a capricious disregard of undisputed, evidence. However, as we understand the facts, some additional testimony was submitted on the second trial, especially on the question of the ability of Foreman to reach the bell rope while standing as he testifies.</p>

While there are expressions therein which might seem to indicate doubt in the mind of the court as to the accuracy of some of the evidence on part of defendant, however, it was all submitted to the jury.

Standing leaning forward as Foreman testifies he was, it is a matter of some doubt whether he could reach the bell rope, and to the writer it does not seem probable that he would attempt to do so in the presence of the conductor and without any reason whatever therefor. If as the jury found ddfendant’s witnesses were mistaken as to plaintiff having cleared the car when it started, that to some extent goes to their credibility. It is a circumstance that Foreman was a very close intimate friend of the conductor. And Boyer seated inside might ndt be apt to observe whether plaintiff had cleared the car when it started. We make no intimation that the testimony of those witnesses is not entirely reliable, but believe the surround<a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>ings were such as to justify the court in permitting the jury to pass upon its credibility.</p>
