The granddaughter survived the' testator, but died before the termination of the life estate having devised the house and lot by will; the surviving grandchildren claimed that the house and lot remained part of the testator’s residuary estate for the purposes of computation and distribution and was subject to a charge in their favor, being of greater value than their respective shares of the residuary estate. <em>Held, </em>that the provision for the valuation and appraisement of the house and lot, and of the residuary estate was to take effect only in the event that the granddaughter to whom the house and lot were devised should survive the life tenant; that by her death her interest in the residuary estate was divested and that her interest in the house and lot could not be charged in favor of the surviving grandchildren.</p>

Conway, Thomas A. Conway, since deceased, and here represented by Ellen Conway his executrix, and Martha Conway,' wife of W. Spencer Harvey. Another grandchild, Sallie W. Conway, survived the testator but died before the determination of the life estate. She it was to whom the testator by the codicil to his will gave the premises No. 850 on west side of Seventh street, Philadelphia. By her last will Sallie W. Conway devised her entire estate to her sister Martha W. Harvey above named. Mrs Harvey claiming under this devise title to the said premises sold and conveyed the same to Leah M.

Conway also a son who survived the life tenant, but since deceased, claiming that the gift over upon the death of the life tenant, Martha W. Conway, was limited to those of her children surviving this event; that Sallie W. having predeceased her mother the entire estate vested in the three surviving children William W., Thomas and Martha W.; and claiming further that the real estate devised by testator to Sallie W., and which it is agreed is of the value of $5,550.00 remained part of the residuary estate for the purpose of computation and distribution under the will, and that Sallie W., taking no share therein, for the reason that she had not survived, said real estate is chargeable in their favor with two-thirds of the value, the sum of $1,750.00 to each of them, presented their petition to the Orphans’ Court setting forth their several claims as we have stated them, praying that a decree be entered accordingly. The matter wás regularly proceeded with and resulted in a decree <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>charging the real estate devised to Sallie W. in accordance with the prayer of the petition.

By repeated expressions in his will the testator makes it too clear for dispute that the gift over after the determination of the particular estate was to the remaindermen as tenants in common. The error of the court was in subjecting to this scheme of equality other property than that which belonged to the residuary estate. By the codicil above recited testator takes from the residuary estate in which it had been placed by the original will that certain piece of real estate which by the codicil he devises to his granddaughter, Sallie W. This was a direct and immediate gift of so much of his estate to this particular grandchild, dependent on nothing, contingent on nothing, and therefore an indefeasible title to so much of the estate vested immediately upon the death of the testator in Sallie W. There is nothing in the codicil to warrant an inference that the devise to her was an abridgment of her right to participate in the remainder of his estate in the event that she survived her mother'; but the codicil makes it clear that in case she should survive, and be one of the takers, then and in that event, the scheme of equality should operate; and to this end he directs an appraisement of both residuary estate and the property devised to Sallie W., to ascertain the proportion the gift to Sallie W. bore to her full equal share in the whole, making the devise to her subject to a charge in favor of <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>the other takers if in excess, and abating the other share proportionately in favor of Sallie, if below. We cannot read this codicil and derive any other understanding of its provisions. True, it contains no express direction that the appraisement and valuation is to be made only in case Sallie W. should survive the determination of the life estate and become a participant in the residuary, but it is evident from the fact that Sallie W., nominatim, is made one of the appraisers that the possibility or probability of her surviving the. determination of the life estate was in the mind of the testator and that it was to meet such contingency that the appraisement and valuation were ordered. The will no where directs a conversion of the estate, but gives it to the takers as tenants in common, and the codicil makes no change in this regard. To what end then an appraisement and valuation? It must have been solely to provide for the contingency of Sallie W. becoming one of the surviving grandchildren and preserving equality between the takers in such event. Except as Sallie W. should intervene in this way, the valuation and appraisement would be absolutely without purpose.</p>
    <p id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[254,1527,1149,209]]]'>It follows that the real estate devised to Sallie W. was subject to charge only in case of a contingency that never arose, and the decree here entered must be reversed. It is accordingly so ordered.</p>
