Such instructions were here given as to damages for diminution of future earning power, but <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>declined as to pain and suffering because of the impracticability thereof.</p>
    <p id="b423-3" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[155,468,1151,590]]]'>Where the evidence enables the jury to find the loss of earnings or other element of damage, that a plaintiff will thereafter sustain from year to year, the present worth thereof may be ascertained but pain has no market value and cannot be accurately estimated in dollars and cents. And therefore calling upon the jury to fix a separate yearly value upon plaintiff’s future pain and suffering, and reduce each of said annual amounts to its present worth, and then add the sum total, as a step in arriving at the verdict, would be a vain request, and tend to complicate instructions to juries in such cases.</p>
