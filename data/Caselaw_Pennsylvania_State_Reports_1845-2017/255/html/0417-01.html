While William Oliver was the only heir called as a witness, he testified that “the street” [meaning thereby the combination of William and Meadow streets] had been traveled by the public continuously since it was originally graded in 1889; furthermore, that it was then opened for public use and he “drove over it the same as the public did,” that is to say, his use of the roadway was not a private one, but in common with the rest of the public.</p>

We there said: “Where dedication is once established, it becomes simply a question of acceptance by the public; either can be established by proof of user. As against the owner of the soil, who would reassert his right in the way, an adverse user for the statutory period must be shown; but as against a municipality which disclaims all duty in connection with the way, the dedication by the owner not being in dispute, acceptance by the municipality may be shown by proof of public use for a much shorter period.......In the present case the user was continued and uninterrupted for more than thirty years; a conclusive presumption arises that the street was originally dedicated, and the owners of the soil are precluded from asserting any other right therein than what is common to the public. The same evidence which concludes the owners and establishes a dedication is more than sufficient to warrant a presumption of acceptance of the way by the municipality.”</p>

Whether the user by the public is of such a nature as to constitute an acceptance is a question of fact, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case”: 3 Dillon on Municipal Corporations (5th Ed.), Secs. 1079,1081,1086. “Generally an intent to dedicate land for a street or highway may be inferred where the owner suffers it to be used by the public for that purpose for a great length of time.......Acceptance of a dedication......may be implied from long user of the way by the public as of right,” and this “has been held sufficient ......even where the effect is......to hold the municipality......responsible for injuries resulting from failure to repair.......User may always be considered ......in connection with acts of the public authorities which indicate an intention to accept.......The length of time necessary to raise a presumption of dedication from user depends on the circumstances of each particu<a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>lar case.......The general rule seems to be that it is the intention of the proprietor of the land, rather than the time of sufferance, which must determine the fact of dedication, and hence proof of user for a period much shorter than that required to show title by prescription may be sufficient. Such use, however, ought to be for such a length of time that the public accommodation and private rights might be materially affected by an intérruption of the enjoyment”: 13 R. C. L., Secs. 24, 25, 29. “In such cases the owner’s intention to dedicate is manifested either by his affirmative acts whereby the public use is invited and his subsequent acquiescence in such use, or by his express assent to or deliberate allowance of the use, or merely by 'his acquiescence therein; but, generally, the law regards the user as mere evidence, and, accordingly, where it is sought to establish an intention to dedicate from the fact of user, all the circumstances have to be looked at to see whether they disclose such an intention.......The weight of authority is to the effect that acceptance may be predicated on user, and the general current of modern authorities sustains the proposition that dedication may be accepted merely by long continued public user, without any formal act of acceptance, even to the extent of charging the public authorities with liability for failure to keep in repair”: 8 R. C. L. 16, 25. See also Secs. 18-20, 22-24 and 27-29, for useful discussion upon the subject in hand, containing statements of law consistent with the above quoted excerpts. Finally, see Sec. 30, which treats of the distinction between those cases where a prescriptive right in a highway is claimed, requiring proof of twenty-one years’ exclusive and adverse user by the public, and the other class of cases, in which the effort is to establish dedication and acceptance, where the proof of user may be for a less period; in this connection, see opinion by President Judge Rice in Washington Borough v. Steiner, <a href="/pa-super/25/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="25 Pa. Super. 392" data-case-ids="851965" data-case-paths="/pa-super/25/0392-01">25 Pa. Superior Ct. 392</a>, 399.

Moreover, the case last cited must now be read in connection with Ackerman v. Williamsport, supra, and Grant v. Dickson City Borough, <a href="/pa/235/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="235 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="984898" data-case-paths="/pa/235/0536-01">235 Pa. 536</a>, where we again recognize that the acceptance of a dedication may be shown by user of long duration.

Dickson City Borough, supra, both state that proof of repairs made by .a street commissioner upon an apparently open highway, even when accompanied by municipal payment of .expenses thus incurred, is not, per se, sufficient, but that, to prove acceptance of an alleged dedication, there must be also proof that the municipal council had ordered or, at the time, Avas aware it was in fact paying' for the particular repairs in question; but in each of. those cases the plaintiff depended upon implied acceptance through municipal acts and not, as here, upon long continued public use of the street. In the present case, although the evidence concerning the work done upon the roadAvay by the various commissioners may not have been sufficient in itself to show acceptance of the alleged <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>dedication, yet in connection with the proof of user, the continued making of repairs by the successive street commissioners was some evidence for the jury to consider in determining whether or not the public generally looked upon and treated this alleged street as an open, public highway; but, of course, in this class of cases, the evidence depended upon to show the character of the highway, when taken as a whole, must be clear and convincing in order to sustain a verdict against the municipality: Verona Borough v. Allegheny Valley R. R., <a href="/pa/152/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="152 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="838187" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0368-01">152 Pa. 368</a>. If, however, the evidence be sufficient to justify a conclusion that the original owners, when they opened the road, intended to set it apart for public use (as it is in the present case), then the fact that, at the -place in question, there was no municipal corporation then existent, will not defeat the dedication, for, upon such corporation coming into existence, it could take advantage of the situation: 3 Dillon on Municipal Corporations (5th Ed.), Sec. 1086; Klinkener v. McKeesport School Directors, <a href="/pa/11/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="11 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="404609" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0444-01">11 Pa. 444</a>, 449.</p>
    <p id="b460-4" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[250,1416,1150,745]]]'>There is only one assignment of error, and that complains of the action of the court below in entering judgment for the defendant n. o. v.; hence, neither the manner in which the case was conducted at trial nor the form in which it was finally submitted to the jury, is before us for review at the present time. On the record as brought here, the sole, ultimate question upon which we have to pass is merely this: under the law, was there sufficient evidence to support the verdict rendered by the jury? As already indicated, this must be answered in the affirmative, because, on the controlling points discussed in this opinion, i. e., dedication and acceptance, the plaintiff made out a prima facie case and the defendant presented no evidence sufficient to overcome it.</p>
    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.5",460,[252,2179,1148,206]]]'>The assignment of error is sustained, the judgment reversed and the record remitted to the court below, with directions to enter judgment on the verdict in favor Of the plaintiff.</p>
