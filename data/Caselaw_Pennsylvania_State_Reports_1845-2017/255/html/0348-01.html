In an action to recover damages for injuries to plaintiff’s wife, caused by defendant’s negligence, where it appeared that she died from apoplexy, and where it was contended that her death had been accelerated by the effects of the accident, the court erred in submitting to the jury the question as to how long beyond the actual time of her death plaintiff’s wife probably would have lived if she had not been injured, where the only evidence on such question was that of physicians who testified that in their judgment the accident accelerated her death, but who failed to state how much her expectancy of life was probably shortened thereby.</p>

    <p id="b384-4" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[253,605,1155,1665]]]'>In the portion of the charge complained of in the first assignment of error, the trial judge said: “Mrs. Saunders lived a little over three years and three months after the accident and then died......from apoplexy....... It is claimed by the plaintiff......that, while the injury which Mrs. Saunders received was not the cause of the apoplexy......, her death was accelerated and brought about sooner than it otherwise would have been by the pain and suffering which she endured as a result of the injuries which she sustained by this accident. The question of the influence of that pain and suffering upon the condition of this woman, which resulted in her death, is not definite......, but it is a question......to be considered in connection with the husband’s claim for damages.......Whether or not this accident......had anything to do with accelerating her death becomes important...... because, if the accident hastened her death, to the extent of the time which that death was hastened by the accident, the husband would lose her services just that much sooner than he otherwise would.......If Mrs. Saunders’s death was in no way affected by the injury which she received......then there is..!.. .no uncertainty as to the time of her life following this accident ......, that would be fixed by her death on August 31, 1915. But, if the injury which she received hastened her death......, to what extent did her injury hasten her death, and how many years would she have lived more if she had not been injured?......It is a question of fact......and......a matter which you ought to consider in passing upon the question of damages in this case.”</p>

True, the doctors for the plaintiff said, in an indefinite way, that in their judgment the results of the accident accelerated the demise of the injured woman, but they were not asked, and did not attempt to estimate or express an opinion, as to how much her expectancy of life was probably shortened thereby. If the known facts did not justify the medical experts in expressing any definite view upon this aspect of the case, the jury should not have been invited or permitted to hazard a guess thereon; in this respect the assignment under consideration indicates clear error.</p>

If the plaintiff and her son intended to continue this arrangement, it is manifest that whatever the wife’s earning capacity may have been, it would not have benefited her husband in the future, and hence its loss, resulting from the defendant’s negligence, was no detriment to him.” We then ruled that the duration of the condition of affairs brought about by the arrangement between Mrs. Saunders and her son, was a material point in the case, as to which cross-examination should have been allowed, and that the refusal thereof was error which necessitated a new venire.</p>

That is an important question, if you come to the question of what Mr. Saunders’s damages are, in this case.” Here again there was submitted to the jurors an issue as to the probable duration of a certain material state of affairs, without any evidence upon the subject to enable them to reach an intelligent conclusion; this also was error.</p>
