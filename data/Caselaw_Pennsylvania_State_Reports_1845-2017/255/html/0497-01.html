    <p id="b532-9" data-blocks='[["BL_532.16",532,[240,1721,1146,533]]]'>Plaintiff was the holder of $40,000 of bonds of the Pittsburgh &amp; Allegheny Bridge Company. The bridge across the Allegheny river owned by that bridge company was condemned by the County of Allegheny, and the damages awarded were about $40,000 less than the issue of bonds. On the bonds as issued by the Pittsburgh &amp; Allegheny Bridge Company was the following-signed by the president and secretary of the Federal Street and Pleasant Valley Passenger Railway Company:</p>

    <p id="b533-3" data-blocks='[["BL_533.4",533,[139,666,1148,482]]]'>The plaintiff brings this suit to recover the interest which it alleges to be due on the bonds held by it of the Pittsburgh &amp; Allegheny Bridge Company. The contract referred to in the above guarantee is the contract by which the Federal Street and Pleasant Valley Passenger Railway Company acquired permission to cross the bridge of the Pittsburgh &amp; Allegheny Bridge Company with its cars, and binds the Federal Street and Pleasant Valley Passenger Railway Company as follows:</p>
    <p id="b533-4" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[136,1159,1149,642]]]'>“The party of the second part agrees to pay to the party of the first part the sum of three thousand dollars ($3,000) per year as a rental or toll for the right to occupy said bridge with its street railway.

The contract of guarantee was <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>unquestionably an ultra vires act. There was nothing in the charter of the Federal Street and Pleasant Valley Passenger Railway Company authorizing it to guarantee the interest on the bonds of another corporation, and this is particularly the case when there was no consideration passing to the Federal Street and Pleasant Valley Passenger Railway Company for the contract of guarantee.</p>

The contract between'the bridge company and the street railway company provides for the compensation to the bridge company for its grant to the street railway company of the right to occupy the bridge with its railway, and that is the full consideration. It is said in this contract of guarantee that it is made in pursuance of a contract between the bridge company and the street railway company, but there is nothing in that contract by which the street railway company agrees to guarantee the interest on the bridge company’s bonds, and the fact that the bridge company was going to construct a new bridge is no consideration passing to the street railway company that it has not agreed to pay for in its contract with the bridge company.</p>

American Manufacturing, Mining &amp; Milling Co., 62 Fed. Repr. 356. In that case the defendant company guaranteed the contracts of the plaintiff company, which was constructing a mining plant, and it was urged there was a consideration for the guarantee because the manufacturing company secured the sale of the iron to be used in the construction of the mining plant, but the court held there was no consideration for the guarantee.</p>
