Nothing further was done, either by defendant or the landowner, with a view to securing damages until October, 1911, when the railroad company filed a bond and presented a petition for its approval by the court and also a petition for the appointment of viewers to assess damages. In <em>'the </em>meantime Peter Sharpnack having died his heirs on February 15, 1911, conveyed the property to plaintiff by deed containing a general warranty clause and made no reference whatever to the right of way of defendant company over the property. The viewers awarded plaintiff damages to the amount of $1,-750.00. Plaintiff appealed from the award and on the trial in the Common Pleas a verdict was directed for defendant on the ground that, as it appeared plaintiff purchased the land subsequent to the adoption of the'resolution of 1902 by deed which did not purport to convey the right to damages they belonged to the person who owned the property in 1902 when the resolution was adopted, consequently plaintiff was not entitled to recover. The sole question raised by the appeal is the correctness of this conclusion.</p>

Each and every step is a prerequisite to the right of the corporation to deprive the owner of his property. When the route has been surveyed, marked on the ground, and adopted by the appropriate action of the board of directors of the corporation the experimental stage has passed and there is a fixed and definite location of the road. The route, including the termini, must be definitely determined by the board of directors. The land is then taken from the OAvner and appropriated to the use of the corporation. It has acquired a conditional title, good against rival corporations, but not as against the owner until com-' pensation is made or secured to him. Until there is an experimental survey or surveys made on the ground and an adoption of the route, including the termini, by the <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>board of directors, there can be no appropriation of the owner’s land. As said in onr cases, the act of location is at the same time the act of appropriation, and, it may be added, the latter can not take place without or-in the absence of the act of location. A legal appropriation fastens a servitude in favor of the corporation upon the property taken”: Johnston v. Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/245/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="245 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="326296" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0338-01">245 Pa. 338</a> and also 342. The court below based its decision mainly on the statement, as in the above case, which is also found in many other cases, that the act of the company in adopting a definite and permanent location amounts to an act of appropriation and fastens a servitude on the property affected thereby. This language does not imply, however, that the landowner is so far divested of title by the act of. location that his only recourse is a claim for damages. It merely amounts to a notice to him that the company intends to condemn the land and that any act done by him subsequent thereto affecting the property and inconsistent with the use for which condemnation proceedings are contemplated, must be done at his risk: Wayne v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/231/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="231 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="973958" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0512-01">231 Pa. 512</a>. Before title can pass from the owner the company is required to take the third step, to wit, make payment or secure compensation by filing a sufficient bond: Williamsport &amp; North Branch R. R. Co. v. Philadelphia &amp; Erie R. R. Co., supra; Johnston v. Delaware, Lackawanna <em>&amp; </em>Western R. R. Co., supra.

A railroad company may survey and locate several routes before finally adopting one as its permanent location and may abandon all but the one so chosen, subject to the right of the landowner in the meantime to begin proceedings to compel completion of the appropriation by payment of damages or entry of security.

Philadelphia, Harrisburg &amp; Pittsburgh R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/203/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="203 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="994703" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0128-01">203 Pa. 128</a>.</p>
    <p id="b593-3" data-blocks='[["BL_593.4",593,[135,779,1158,1246]]]'>If we hold the right to damages is absolutely fixed at the time of the adoption of the location, and, being a personal right, would not pass with a transfer of the land, we have the anomalous situation of the vendee losing the land taken without notice and without compensation in violation of the constitutional inhibition, and the vendor recovering the price of the portion of the land subsequently taken, which he sold to the vendee and for which he had already received full price from the purchaser. Furthermore, the measure of damage is not the value of the land actually taken, but the amount of the depreciation caused to the whole tract. The vendor would therefore claim to recover not only the value of the land taken but also the damage caused to the tract owned by the vendee as a whole. Apart from the inhibition of the Constitution, such a result demonstrates the fallacy, of the judgment of the court below. We therefore conclude the only consistent rule is to hold that a claim for damages for taking land, in so far as the right thereto between the grantor and grantee of the land is concerned, arises when the damages are secured and therefore accrues to the person who owns the land at the time such security is entered.</p>
    <p id="b593-4" data-blocks='[["BL_593.5",593,[184,2037,1032,46]]]'>The judgment is reversed and a new; trial granted.</p>
