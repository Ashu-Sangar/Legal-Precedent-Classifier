Necessarity, a pavement proved to be in that condition must have been built, laid, several years before. You, as men of skill and experience, must from the general testimony as to the character of this pavement, judge of its age. The testimony is <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>that it was a wooden pavement when it was made, constructed with three stringers lengthwise upon the street or pavement, with four-foot pieces going over, two-by-fours, laid crosswise and spiked, with the stringers sunk in the earth even with its top at the time of laying the pavement — you must judge, we say, how long that pavement must have lain there before it would become in the rotten, decayed, bad condition which the witnesses testify that it was in on the 12th day of April, 1892.</p>

Meyers testified that its condition was plainly observable by daylight — could tell by feeling in the feet in the night-time that it was rough and uneven. Theodore Smith spoke upon that subject. He testified that all passers-by, persons going over the walk in the da}rtime, could see its bad condition. Thomas Moyer testifies as follows: <em>‘Question: </em>You may state whether or not it was plainly observable to all passers-by, whether or not it was plain to be seen. <em>Answer: </em>Yes, sir. P. S. Moyer testified in answer to the same question : Well, I don’t know but what it would be if you looked from the other side of the road. <em>Question: </em>How about persons passing over it, as to its being observable? <em>Answer: </em>Could not help but see it. <em>Question: </em>At what time of day or night? <em>Answer: </em>Could not see much at night, I would not think.’ George B. Kitchen said : ‘You could see it when you got up pretty well to the sehoolhouse, then you could see it.’ You will recollect that George B. Kitchen lived at the foot of the hill, as we understand it, down by Railroad street. He was janitor of the public sehoolhouse on Third street; and, in speaking of how this pavement might be seen by passers-by, he said you could observe this pavement upon the Robinson lot ‘ when you got up pretty well to the sehoolhouse, then you could see it.’ B. F. Taylor said: ‘ A person standing at the corner of my house, on the opposite side of the alley ’ (he lived at that time in the old McReynolds house on the north side of the alley, the house that has since been removed) ‘ could see that pavement if he stood there and made a business to look down that street, down over them board walks; he could have seen that it was in bad condition in the daylight.’ Dr. McReynolds testifies as follows: ‘ <em>Question : </em>From what point could you see that it was in bad condition ? <em>Answer: </em>In passing down the other side of the street, going up or down.’</p>

The condition spoken of, as described by the witnesses particularly, (and nearly all of them agree on that point,) is that it was decayed, rotten; some of the cross boards broken, some of them out, and that there were depressions or holes where they were out, the depth of which holes was described by some of the witnesses as being of the thickness of the next plank or cross board and what additional depth had been worn in the ground by the passers-by. It was in one of these holes that, as the plaintiff testifies, he caught his foot. He testifies that, first, in walking along that pavement, he caught his left foot on a plank or something sticking up — a piece of plank or board or two-by-four or something, he would not undertake to say what, he could not say what; but something loose in the pavement tripped him and pitched him forward, and his,feet caught, or one foot, his left foot then went into a hole; and, as he was pitched forward with his right foot he fell in or was caught in another hole — with his right foot or his left foot; at any rate he fell, and it threw him forwards and a little sidewise, and he fell backwards or a little toward his left side 'and caught his left foot fast in this hole.</p>

What is the testimony upon that subject ? For you must be guided and governed solely by the testimony in coming to your verdict. In ascertaining whether he knew or did not know the bad condition of this walk, you may consider the proximity of his place of residence to the place where he was injured, his habit of moving about, and whether this pavement had been and was so notoriously in a dilapidated state that the fact was patent or plainly observable to all passers-by; because if it was so notoriously in bad condition, then if he had opportunity to know its condition, he was bound to know it. As we have said, this pavement must have been laid at least several years before the accident. There is no evidence that at this particular point it was ever repaired from the time it was laid up to the time of the accident. Indeed, it is admitted by the defense that its condition was so bad and so well known to be bad that the town authorities had constructive notice of its condition; and the plaintiff has not only proved the fact of its notoriously bad condition, such as to constitute constructive notice, but he has also proved actual and express notice to the town council of the town of Bloomsburg, and a resolution to repair. But it <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>is likewise shown that the plaintiff lived for seventeen or eighteen years (except two years and a half or a year and a half that he resided in Milton) within a hundred feet of this point in the pavement.</p>
