If there was no. authority for that, there can be no recovery. Upon the question of the right to lay the lien, the fact, set forth in the points reserved, would seem to be necessarily controlling, that, upon the books of the city treasurer, the taxes sought to be thus enforced, appear marked as having been duly paid, during the years for which they were respectively assessed. The conclusive effect of this entry, so far as the right of lien is concerned, is manifest from a proper reading of the statutory provisions by which the collection of taxes is regulated. These provisions are contained in the act of May 23, 1889, P. L. 277, art. <em>xv, </em>(pages 317 et seq.) Under them, the assessment being completed, and the copies of it by wards having been placed into the hands of the city treasurer on or before June first, the taxes are immediately payable to him, with the addition of certain percentages after September first (sec. 7). On and after November first it is his duty to place into the hands of the tax collectors duplicates of such taxes as then remain unpaid (sec. 8). Within five months thereafter, each tax collector, having paid over monthly sums collected by him, indicating the properties, which thereupon are to be credited by the treasurer upon his books (sec. 9), is required to make out and deliver to the treasurer a schedule of the taxes still unpaid in his duplicate, with descriptions of the properties liable therefor, etc. (sec. 10), and these schedules, or a copy thereof, the treasurer is then to certify to the city solicitor, to be registered by him as liens in the prothonotary’s office (sec. 11). This method but slightly differs from that provided by the act of May 24, 1874, P. L. 230, sec. 36 (pages 249, 250). Thereby the treasurer was .required to <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>receive taxes up to the first day of January succeeding the completion of the assessment, after which date duplicates were to go into the hands of the collectors; and after January first of each year, the treasurer was to place correct and detailed statements of taxes then remaining unpaid into the city solicitor’s hands, who was thereupon to register them as liens.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b48-4" data-blocks='[["BL_48.4",48,[253,690,1165,1727]],["BL_49.1",49,[224,386,1167,750]]]'>“ That, under either enactment, the certification of taxes as unpaid by the treasurer is a condition precedent to the right of the solicitor to register them as liens can admit of no doubt, either upon the express terms of the statute or upon principles of common sense. There is nothing in his powers or duties as defined by sec. 40, act 1874, or art. IX, act 1889, that gives him any right to lay liens in the name of the city except for such claims as come to him from the proper and appointed source. Neither is there any authority in him to overhaul the books or accounts of any other municipal officer with a view of determining himself whether this or that claim has been paid, or whether a lien should be filed for the one or the other. To invest him with a power or an authority such as I have indicated would be to introduce infinite confusion into the municipal affairs, and the existence of either is not, as I understand the position of the city solicitor in this case, asserted by him. As the law officer of the municipality, charged with the ‘superintendence, direction and control’ of the ‘law matters of the city,’ the validity of his action in instituting any legal procedure in its name must depend upon his .right to act either given by specific statutory language or by the proper department of the municipal government under a general statutory direction. His power to lay a lien for alleged unpaid taxes being thus conditioned, there can be no pretense that the requirement of their certification to him by the treasurer is merely directory, and that, if they are brought to his notice in any other way, he may still exercise the power. Where a thing required to be done is a condition precedent to the exercise of a power granted or the performance of a duty imposed, it is necessarily essential to the existence of the power or duty, and being of the essence thereof, cannot be anything but mandatory: Norwegian Str., <a href="/citations/?q=81%20Pa.%20849" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="81 Pa. 849">81 Pa. 849</a>, 854. Of course, the direction as to the time when the certification is to be made, etc., does not stand upon the same plane with the requirement of certification itself. <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>The former may very well be deemed directory only, upon the familiar principle that, where a statute fixes a time for the performance of a duty by public officers and there is no substantial reason apart from the statute itself, from other statutes or from the consequences of delay, why the act might not be as well done at some other than the appointed time, the naming of the latter will ordinarily be so treated: State v. Lean, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wis.%20292" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Wis. 292">9 Wis. 292</a>, and see Pittsburg v.

In the present case, however, the difficulty is not merely as to the time when the city solicitor received the notice of these taxes as unpaid. The trouble is that there was admittedly no certification of them to him by the treasurer for the purpose of registering them as liens, in conformity with either the act of 1874 or that of 1889.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b49-3" data-blocks='[["BL_49.4",49,[224,1155,1172,1272]],["BL_50.1",50,[223,383,1171,1571]]]'>“Neither under the circumstances, could there have been any such certification. It is too manifest to admit of any discussion that the statement or certificate to be placed into the hands of the solicitor by the treasurer, as contemplated by either statute, is not one to be made up by the treasurer upon the basis of his personal knowledge apart from or in disregard of the records required to be kept by him. The subjecting of a citizen’s property to a lien for taxes alleged to be unpaid, is entirely too serious a matter to permit the imputation of any such design to the legislature. Obviously, the statement or certificate of the treasurer, in so far as it can become authority for the imposition oE a lien, must be based upon the facts disclosed by his books, and cannot contradict them. If it were otherwise, no man could buy a property within the limits of the city, without running the risk of having it charged in his hands with taxes assessed years before, though, before purchasing, he had examined the municipal records and found them to declare the fact of payment, and, of course, there could be no defense for him if the city could show that the entries made by the treasurer were false. The hardship of holding the city bound, to the extent of forbidding a lien, by the act of its treasurer, honest or dishonest, cannot be compared with the disastrous consequences of the opposite doctrine to the property holder. The former has its remedy upon the bond given by the treasurer; the latter might have practically no remedy. <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>The community can guard against frauds upon itself by the selection of a faithful official; the individual has ordinarily no alternative but to put up with any one chosen by a majority of the voters. In the present case, the books of the city kept by its treasurer showed payment of the taxes for which this lien was laid. It was, therefore, beyond the power of any succeeding treasurer to certify them as unpaid, and as a necessary consequence, beyond the power of the solicitor to register them as liens. This statement does not involve a denial of the right of the city to recover taxes, marked paid upon its books, but in fact unpaid, from the property holder against whom they are ■assessed. It goes no further than to negative the right to enforce them by a lien against the property itself in the first instance. The verdict of the jury, under the charge of the court as to what constitutes payment of taxes by one who is at the same time city treasurer, establishes the fact that the taxes were not paid. I have no doubt as to the correctness of the instructions and I am not called upon to express any as to the correctness of the finding of the jury upon the single question submitted to it. But I am quite clear, that, notwithstanding that finding, there can be no judgment upon it for the city. Of course, there is- neither in this conclusion, nor in what has been said as leading up to it, anything that can reflect upon the action of the city solicitor in instituting this proceeding. The questions raised by it are important ones, and being, at least in some aspects, fairly debatable and unsettled by any previous adjudication, they are such as, under existing circumstances and in view of pending litigation between the city and the bondsmen of the defaulting treasurer, might properly be brought before the court; and the verdict of the jury, though ineffectual in this case, may not be without value to the city.</p>

The lien is the creature of a statute and if the directions of the statute have not been complied with the right to the lien does not exist.
