    <p class="summary" id="b651-4" data-blocks='[["BL_651.5",651,[197,633,1167,1623]]]'>“ The dispute in this case is over the western boundary of the city of Wilkes-Barre. It grows out of an attempt on the part of the city to tax the land of the defendants lying between low watermark and the middle of the Susquehanna river. Whether the true boundary be at low watermark or at the middle of the river depends upon the construction of two acts of assembly. It appears by the case stated that the city of Wilkes-Barre was incorporated by a special act approved May 4, 1871, P. L. 539, and that it was bounded on the west by low watermark of the Susquehanna river. The opposite township is also bounded by low watermark on the opposite side of the same river. Between the boundary lines of the city and township, lies the laud under the bed of the river, which, prior to the act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 203, belonged to no municipal division, and although valuable for its coal was not subject to taxation. That act, however, provides ‘ that whenever any township, borough or city is bounded by the nearest margin of any navigable stream of this commonwealth and the opposite township, borough or city, as the case may be, is also bounded by the nearest margin of the same stream, the middle of such stream shall be deemed and taken to be the boundary between such townships, boroughs or cities, as the case may be.’ The coal lands of the defendants lie in the bed of the river between the lines of low watermark. These lands, to the middle of the river, have been assessed with taxes by the authorities of the city of Wilkes-Barre as within the limits of the city, as enlarged by the act of 1887. The defendants deny that the act of 1887 applies to the city of Wilkes-Barre, because the act creating the city of Wilkes-Barre and defining its boundaries was a local or special act, while the act of 1887 is a general law, which will not repeal a local or special law in the absence of express words of repeal, and therefore resist the payment of any taxes to the city.</p>

That the act of 1887 is a general law is equally clear. If the act of 1887 repeals the act of 1871 so as to change the boundary from low watermark to the middle of the river, the legislative intent to repeal must be so clear as to be equivalent to express direction. The act of 1887 must be given some effect. As said in Engle v. Richards, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Pa.%20C.%2048" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Pa. C. 48">4 Pa. C. C. 48</a>, ‘ If a law can have no operation or effect except as a repeal of a local law, that constitutes necessary implication of the strongest kind, for it is a cardinal rule of construction that a statute shall be so construed as to have effect and not be a mere nullity or surplusage.’ The townships, boroughs and cities upon which it is contended the act operates were created either by a special act of assembly or bjr the action of the courts in. pursuance of general laws. By either method the result was the creation of a local situation. To hold that the act would only change the boundaries of such municipalities as were created by the courts and not those created by act of assembly would seem to be unreasonable. The object of the law was to brihg the land lying under the bed of navigable rivers within the municipal divisions of the commonwealth so as to subject the territory to their control and the <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>land to taxation. The act' deals entirely with local situations, whether that situation was produced by a special act of the legislature or by a special decree of the court. There is no room for the idea that from the general purview of the act there’was no intention to disturb special localities. On the contrary such was the manifest and only intention, and the act would be a mere nullity if such be not its effect. The act had nothing else to operate upon. The boundary of the city of Wilkes-Barre at low watermark on the Susquehanna river is within the very letter of the act. Its situation is accurately described as one, among others, which the law was intended to affect. The act of 1887 deals with land outside of township, borough or city limits. As to such territory there is no doubt whatever as to what is meant. There is no local law to relieve it from the general provisions of the act. The fact that by the act it is attached to contiguous municipal divisions does not affect the intent, no matter how the contiguous municipal divisions were created.</p>
