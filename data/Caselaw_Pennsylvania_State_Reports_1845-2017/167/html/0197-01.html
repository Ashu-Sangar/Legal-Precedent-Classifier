That Ellena B. White, from her infirmities of mind and body is unfitted for the possession and control of what may be decreed to her out of this estate, and that it is necessary for her protection, to make the distribution of her part of the estate to a trustee for her, to be held for her benefit, until appropriate proceedings can be taken to secure her interest.</p>

Her executors say they have found no account of the trust fund among her papers, and instead of attempting to inform the court as to the amount of money disbursed by the decedent to and for the use of the claimant, since the assignment, have devoted themselves exclusively to ignoring the trust. Both of the marriages of the claimant seem to have been such improvident ones as would be looked for in one of her want of judgment, and it is plain to me that the claimant was a constant charge upon her mother up to the latter’s death. The decedent declared to Mrs. Obenhousen, about a month before her death, that she held $5,000 for her daughter; that she had not paid her all the interest; and that her losses in rents had been so great that she had been unable to supply her with the money she actually needed. This testimony tends to show that the principal, and a part of the interest, was in the decedent’s hands, at her decease, but it does not fix the amount of interest accrued and held by her. In the statement submitted by the attorney of the claimant, she allows credits for boarding, clothing and cash supplied and paid to and for the claimant, amounting to $860. This amount seems to me preposterously small. For three years before her marriage <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>with Mr. White in 1869, the claimant was entirely maintained by her mother; during her marriage with Mr. White she seems to have been largely dependent upon her, and for seven months in 1883 was living with and supported by her; and from Mr. White’s death in 1883 to the death of the decedent, in 1893, was wholly maintained by the latter. The will of the decedent contemplated the expenditure of $20.00 a month bjr the trustee, for the support of the claimant, and it is probable that that sum was fixed by the decedent from her experience as to the cost of her maintenance. Taking everything into account, I have adopted that as a just standard of compensation to the decedent, and have allowed her $20.00 a month from the date of the assignment, March 29, 1867, to March 1, 1893, making a gross credit of $6,200. In a case presented as this one has been, mathematical certainty is out of the question, but considering all the facts before the court, I believe the conclusion come to is the most satisfactory attainable by me. I think I have allowed all that is due, and, it may be, somewhat more than is due; but having found the trust, the duty of accounting was placed by the law upon the executors. They professed inability to present any account upon the trust fund; and nothing was left for me to do (being certain that the credits allowed by the claimant were insufficient), but to determine the balance due, with such light as the evidence cast upon the question. All the declarations of the decedent proved in the case clearly denoted, or strongly implied, that the whole capital remained in her hands, and her statement to Mrs. Obenhausen, made shortly before her death, distinctly admitted that all the interest on the money had not been paid over to the claimant. I was originally inclined to find only the principal, in the hands of the decedent, but this could not be done without ignoring the declarations of the decedent as to the arrearages of interest. The interest from the receipt of the money to the present time amounts to $8,179.01, and the result of my finding is that $1,979.01 of it remains in the estate of the decedent. Not doubting as to the existence of the trust, the process by which I have arrived at the amount due the claimant, while not entirely satisfactory, seems the best possible upon the evidence, and a decree will accordingly be made in favor of the claimant for $6,954.06, in accordance with the ninth finding of fact.

    <p id="b226-9" data-blocks='[["BL_226.16",226,[243,1651,1167,756]]]'>There are two principal questions in this case. The first is over the effect of the assignment made by Mrs. Hermann, now Mrs. White, to her mother, Mrs. Harker, of the policy of insurance on the life of her husband made in 1865. The assignment was prima facie a transfer of the title to the proceeds of the policy to the assignee; and it cast upon the assignor the burden of showing that this was not its object as it was understood at the time by the parties. Considerable testimony was given for this purpose, and we concur with the learned judge in thinking that this testimony justifies the conclusion that the assignment was intended to put the mother in a position to collect and manage the insurance mone}r in such way as should seem best to her, for the comfort and care of her daughter. The next question relates to the proper manner of stating an account between the mother, now deceased, and her daughter.</p>
    <p id="b227-4" data-blocks='[["BL_227.3",227,[217,369,1174,2042]],["BL_228.1",228,[252,373,1161,250]]]'>
      <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>For more than a quarter of a century the parties have shown their own understanding of their relation to each other and to this fund. No account of its investment, or of the items of receipts and expenditures from the income seems ever to have been asked or rendered. It is conceded on all hands that the daughter needed, and it is clear that the mother has given her, the same affectionate supervision and maternal care as in the days of her childhood. Her clothing, her board, her pocket money have all been supplied during most of these twenty-seven or eight years by the mother, and the question has never been considered whether the income from the insurance money was sufficient for this purpose or not. This voluntary and unrewarded stewardship has now been closed by the death of the mother; and the daughter not content to receive the principal, for the very existence of which she is indebted to her mother’s thrift and economy, seeks to charge interest upon it during the whole period and to allow a pittance only for her own support, and nothing for her mother’s labor and care. The orphans’ court is clothed with full equity powers. These parties never interpreted their relations to each other in this way while the mother lived and the daughter enjoyed her care, and we will not so interpret them now. When the incapacity of the daughter for the management of her own affairs is considered; when the smallness of the income that could have been earned by this fund is also taken into account, and the absolute dependence of the daughter during most of this time on her mother for all the necessaries of life, we have no difficulty in concluding that the income was consumed year after year in a manner well understood, and intelligently acquiesced in by the danghter. After a course of dealing extending over twenty-seven years we are fully justified in assuming that no account of receipts and expenditures was kept because none was contemplated or desired by the parties, and that, under all the circumstances of this case, the mother’s judgment was deliberately and wisely trusted for the management of the fund and the expenditure of the income therefrom with no thought of an account in the mind of either. Under such circumstances to charge the mother, as a trustee, with the interest for the whole time at the legal rate without knowing what she actually received; and to credit her with what we may guess she expended with no knowledge of <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>her actual expenditures, is to inflict upon her estate and her memory an injustice. The decree is affirmed so far as it charges the appellants with the principal of the insurance money and interest from the death of the decedent. It is set aside so far as it states an account of income during the decedent’s lifetime.</p>
