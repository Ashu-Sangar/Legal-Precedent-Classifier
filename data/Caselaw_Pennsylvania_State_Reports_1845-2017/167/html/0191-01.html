    <p class="syllabus" id="b213-6" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[213,597,1168,629]]]'>Decedent in his lifetime gave to his wife a mortgage and judgment bond which he held against his brother, directing her to deliver them to his brother. The securities were delivered to the brother, who returned them to decedent’s wife, with a request that she should keep them for him. They were then placed in a box in which decedent kept his securities. Decedent repeatedly declared it to be his intention to forgive the debts for which they were given and, in a paper requesting his brother to make oath to a tax return, stated that the judgment and mortgage against his brother were satisfied. At the appraisement of decedent’s estate, the brother objected to these securities being included in the inventory, but it was finaljy agreed between him and the other parties interested that they should be appraised as part of the estate without prejudice to the brother’s right to prove that they were satisfied. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that these debts had been forgiven by the decedent.</p>

He had no children. According to Mr. Fugleman's testimony he had a strong affection for his brother William, and sympathized keenly with him in his distressing financial embarrassment which harassed him toward the close of decedent’s life. It is quite natural therefore that he should have felt disposed to forgive his indebtedness. The evidence shows that there were other lien creditors of William H. Livingood to a large amount, and that is probably the reason why the mortgage and judgment were not satisfied. The policy of keeping them open, I conjecture, was William H. Livingood’s and not the decedent’s. It is the intention and conduct of the latter that I have to do with, and not that of William H. Livingood, beyond the fact of his willingness to accept the forgiveness of the debt. Of his intention to accept the benefit there can be no doubt; and the purpose of the decedent to confer it is clear beyond fair dispute. The estate of the decedent was his to do with what he pleased, so far as the exceptants are concerned; and if what he did in relation to the indebtedness of William, amounted to a valid gift of it to him, he is entitled to the benefit of it. In Zeigler v. Eckart, <a href="/pa/6/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="954587" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0013-01">6 Pa. 13</a>, the facts were very similar to those of this case, and I think it a clear authority here, requiring me to hold that these debts were in law effectually forgiven to William by the decedent. It was there decided that the law presumes every legacy to be a clear gratuity, but that that presumption, like every other, may be rebutted by parol proof, and that for that reason a legacy to the testator’s debtor is not per se a discharge of the debt; that as the presumption may be removed by extrinsic evidence, so majr it be restored, and that the testator’s declaraations before, at, and after, the making of his will, that he did not intend the debt should be demanded, constitute a defense to an action for it by the executor. I have found as facts, the intention of this testator to forgive these debts, and his actual delivery to the accountant of the securities for them, and that the securities were in the possession of the accountant at the decease of the testator. The accountant is a legatee under the will of the decedent, and has the benefit of the presumption, that the testator intended his legacjr should be a pure gratuity. While that presumption was temporarily overthrown by the fact that the securities were found in the box of the decedent, <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>with his other securities, I think it has been fully restored by the evidence showing the forgiveness of the debts and the delivery of the securities to the accountant. Upon the facts as I have found them, Zeigler v. Eckert requires me to dismiss the exceptions, and they are accordingly dismissed, and the account is confirmed.”</p>
