So also the agreement in evidence, ‘ Witnesseth, that the said party of the first part do hereby promise and agree that in consideration of the said party of the second part signing the rights <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>of way for the building of an electric railway in and upon the highways of Rahn township,’ to give employment to Coll, etc. [My conclusion is that this agreement was not delivered untilj 7 P. M. of May 9.] [8] The copy of the agreement appearing on the record does not show that it was signed by Coll: so that unless there was another paper evidencing his consent, such consent must be inferred from his acceptance of their agreement, or rest upon a parol consent. That he did consent finally on May 9th, there is no dispute. Ought such a contract, or such a consent, to stand? Complainants have proved that the contract of consent was made by the supervisor alone, and without making a record of it upon the township books, and without consulting with the auditors or having their consent. They have not furnished the court with any statute or decision which tends to show that the auditors have any share in the responsibilities of the supervisor for the care or condition of the roads and, as it is conceded that the law as to Rahn township only requires one supervisor, there is no force in the objection that in this respect he was not the ‘ local authority,’ whose consent the act of 1889 requires. ■</p>

Grant v. Erie decided that where an act of assembly empowered a city to build a sufficient number of reservoirs to supply water in case of fire, and the council constructed them but allowed one to get out of repair so that it would not hold water, the owner of a near-by property destroyed by fire could not recover against the city, alleging that the loss occurred by reason of the fact that by this negligence of the city no water could be obtained; that it was discretionary with the city to construct the- reservoirs, and they were not liable; Dechert v. Commonwealth decides that the city controller of Philadelphia has a judicial discretion as to whether he will or will not countersign a warrant; that mandamus may be awarded in such a case to set public officers in motion as to acts and duties necessarily calling for the exercise of their discretion, but will not control or interfere with the exercise of <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>that discretion or dictate what the decision shall be. Raudenbush’s Petition decides that the Supreme Court will not review the manner in v'hich the lower courts have exercised their discretion in granting or refusing retail liquor licenses. I do not regard these cases as precedents to guide the case before the court in which the natural, and as it seems to me the irresistible inference, from undisputed facts, is that the supervisor refused to deliver his contract of consent .to these defendants except at the price of a consideration, payable to himself and not to the public whose rights he was thus selling; a consideration not in good faith solely providing against his discharge for doing his duty, but a consideration providing for himself in case he was not discharged. He was dealing with a discretion vested in him as a public office for the public benefit as if it was his private property which he could sell for his personal profit. No argument is required to show that a consent thus obtained finds no warrant in the act of 1889, in morals or in public policy. “ In general, if any part of the entire consideration for a promise, or any part of an entire promise, be illegal, whether by statute or common law, the whole contract is void. Indeed the courts go far in refusing to found any rights upon wrong doing: ” Parsons on Contracts, 5th ed. (p. 456). “If any part of a consideration is illegal the whole consideration is void, because public policy will not permit a party to enforce a promise which he has obtained by an illegal act or an illegal promise, although he may have connected with this act or promise another which is legal: ” <a href="/pa/120/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="120 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="559860" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0328-01">Id. 457</a>.

He <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>says that he didn’t bother with that, and then Farquhar read out of his book again that he had committed crime enough to go to the penitentiary. Then Spiese told him that he had done enough to go to jail; that he wouldn’t sign for them. Then Kennedy and Zehner consulted in private and Kennedy came to him and told him that if he didn’t sign that paper Zehner would send for a constable to take him to jail. He told them to go to hell; at one time he and Farquhar were alone in the room and he got up to go out, when Farquhar got up and told him that he couldn’t go out until his case was settled. About ten minutes after that he went out, when McLaughlin followed him. He tried to get awajr from him, but could not, and then McLaughlin told him that he couldn’t get away until this thing was settled. Then he and McLaughlin went back to the stairs leading up to the room where they had been before and sat there and McLaughlin was ‘ coaxing,’ and he then said he would sign if Zehner would give him the same agreement that the Inter-County Company had made, and they agreed to it and then he signed. The only time when he was afraid, according to his statement, Avas when McLaughlin threatened to get the constable ; but he did not leave the room when Farquhar threatened him. The interviews further testified to, that is, the visits of the priests and the call with Boner upon Zehner relate to subsequent efforts to get from him the agreement that he had made with the Inter-County Company and to get his assistance in the present suit Avhen the bill Avas to be filed.</p>

Besides this, all the others present, except Mr. Farquhar, were examined; they all deny that any promises or threats were made at any time during the two hours at Tamaqua whilst this negotiation was going on. One or two of the Avitnesses were not in the room all of the time from the beginning of the negotiation to the end; others say that they were in the room all of the time, and that Farquhar was not alone with Coll at any time from the beginning of the negotiation to the end. Zehner and McLaughlin deny distinctly that they made any promises to Coll in consid<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>eration of his signing, and assert that, on the contrary, they distinctly told him that such promises would be illegal, and that they could not do it. Upon this showing it would be unreasonable to say that the testimony of Morris Coll should prevail against the testimony of the other witnesses not impeached, except bjr the conflicting testimony of Morris Coll, and that a fair inference from this record is that this contract was procured by fraud or coercion. It is true that the testimony also shows that he was dealing with men who were high in authority in the company in which he had been in humble service, who had loaned, or advanced, his pay to him, as a supervisor, before it was due, on his promise that he would not grant this particular right of way without letting them know in advance, and who were known to him, probably, as opposed to the building of any railroad there. Who had by threats and persuasion prevented the earlier building of complainants’ road, and were now allied with complainants to secure the privileges because a rival had come upon the field. Still the testimony in reference to what occurred at the time when the contract was executed seems to warrant the conclusion that the representation and threats, combined with the surroundings above alluded to, did not move him until Zehner and McLaughlin agreed to do as well for him as the Inter-County Company. Nor can the fact be lost sight of that the influences of his employers might have led to his yielding to their, persuasion, as complainants’witnesses say that it did. [Where the evidence is directly conflicting, as it is in'this case, we have no other guide to a conclusion than the seeming preponderance, and tested by that the evidence does not seem to warrant the setting aside of the formal contract executed by the supervisor.] [5]</p>

The Inter County-Street Railway Company, ante, p. 75. It is not necessary to repeat what is there said. We have no doubt that the consent obtained from Coll was invalid for the reason stated by the learned judge of the court below, and for the further reason stated in the Penna. Schuylkill Valley Railroad Company v. The Montgomery County Street Railway Company, ante, p. 62, also decided at the present term. It was the action of an individual upon a consideration moving to him as an individual, and not the action of an officer, appearing upon the records of the township where the evidence of official action should appear.</p>

      <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>The fifth assignment is sustained. When a corporation comes into a court of equity claiming rights against the public under an agreement purporting to be executed by township officers the agreement should be conseionable and it should have been obtained by fair and conseionable methods. The learned judge found the evidence relating to the execution of the consent by Coll to the Tamaqua and Lansford Company to be directly conflicting, and he adopted the rule of law saying “ We have no other guide than the seeming preponderance ” of the testimony, and testing the validity of the alleged consent of the local authorities of Rahu township by what seemed to him to be the preponderance of a mass of contradictory testimony, he sustained the validity of the consent. We find no fault with the view of the learned judge as to the existence of a “seeming preponderance,” but we cannot agree that the chancellor was bound by it. On the contrary, we hold that the alleged consent was ineffective for two reasons: First, it was extorted from the individual who held the office of supervisor by methods that a court of equity cannot approve, and it ought not in fairness towards the citizens and taxpayers of the township to be held binding upon them for this reason if for no other. But second, another and a sufficient reason is found in the fact that the giving of the alleged consent was not an official act. The time, the place, the occasion, were of the appointment of the company and for their benefit. The action was not taken at a meeting of the supervisors regular or special. It was -not entered upon the books of the township in the possession of the town clerk. No record of any sort was made, of what was done because no official action was taken. A frightened man executed a paper adding his official title to his name, but this did not make it the official action of the supervisors. This was a subject for deliberation, a subject of importance, not to the man but to the township whose officer he was, and the action should have been taken upon an intelligent consideration of the interests of the township and regularly entered on the proper township book. The evidence of such an official act should not rest upon a piece of paper in the pocket of a private individual who may not be a citizen of the township or within reach of its taxpayers.</p>
