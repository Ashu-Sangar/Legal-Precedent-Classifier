As this is a permanent damage to the property, estimates have been received as to what the value of the property was before this was done, and what its value is now, as well as the damage that has been experienced from the change; that is, all the parties have asked these various questions, what was the value before this was changed, and what is the value after, and what they estimated to be the damage. If any benefit has accrued to the property especially from making this change, of course that has to be taken into consideration, and I might say to you generally, touching upon your experience in such matters, that the proper grading of a street, putting it even, smooth, regular grade, may benefit a property to some degree. If it benefits as much any property as the damage, then there is no damage at all, because the one meets and cancels the other, but where there is an excess of damage over the benefit, then the. difference between the two would be what we might call the real, the actual damage to the property, and that is what you are to arrive at from the evidence here. You are to allow the plaintiff just what damage he has actually experienced.] ” [4]</p>
