A trespasser upon this land who had not acquired title by adverse possession, sold and transferred his possession to his daughter by an instrument in writing. There was evidence that the daughter, a married woman, took possession, and continued to hold the land for over fifty years. About twenty-two years after the daughter went into possession of the land, ejectment was brought by the record owners against her husband, and a verdict rendered in their favor. Judgment was apparently not entered upon the verdict, and the wife remained undisturbed in the possession of the land. Subsequently the land was sold under a judgment against the wife, and was bought in by her daughter, who after her mother’s death took possession. <em>Held, </em>that as the land was in the joint occupancy of husband and wife, it was proper for the court to submitto the jury, upon all the evidence, the question under what right or authority the entry was made and possession taken, and to determine whether or not the presumption that the possession was that of the husband was overcome.</p>

There is a claim that they went into possession by virtue of a title, but not by virtue of any legal title derived from the owners of the land. As to the then owners of the land they were trespassers, but although they entered as trespassers, yet if they maintained actual, exclusive, notorious, peaceable, hostile, uninterrupted possession for twenty-one years, a good title was acquired by either William or Sally .Ann Collins. Assuming that they went into possession at or prior to 1830, and that William Collins died in 1860, as claimed by the plaintiff, or even in 1857, as claimed by the defendant, they were in possession long enough to give possession by adverse possession. By whom was that title acquired? Was it by William Collins or was it by Sail}'- Ann Collins, his wife ? This brings us to the first and a veiy important question of fact, that is, how did they enter? In the right of William Collins or in the right asserted by Sally Ann Collins? How did they go in possession, and in whose right? In the absence of any evidenee on the subject, the legal presumption would be that they entered under and in the right of some claim — whether valid or invalid would be immaterial — of the husband. But this presumption, which might arise in the absence of testimony, would give way to evidence showing how they entered, claimed and held the- possession, and a great deal of testimony has been introduced bearing upon this important question of fact.</p>

The plaintiff claims that William Collins and his wife went into possession pursuant to a claim asserted by him under a contract with Henry W, Drinker. In support of the defendant’s claim she has offered in evidence a paper dated Jan. 10, 1827, which reads as follows: ‘Pittston, January 10, 1827, I John Shepherd for and in consideration of two heifers and six sheep do hereby bargain and sell to Sally Ann Collins my possession of the Jesse Fell tract of land containing 400-acres more orless.

There is, however, a rule that ancient documents, papers more than thirty-years old, which on their face are free from suspicion and come from a proper custody, are admissible in evidence without proof of authenticity. In obedience to this rule of law we admitted this paper in evidence. Its genuineness, of course, is to be decided by the jury under the testimony that has been given here bearing upon that subject. It is not for us to pass upon that question in view of the testimony that has been admitted since the admission of the paper. You will bear in mind, however, that the paper is not put in evidence for the purpose of showing a title; that is, it is not admitted for the purpose of showing that thereby Mrs. Collins obtained a title to the land which would be good against the then owners of it. It is put in evidence to show the character of the claim made by William Collins and his wife at the time they went into possession, it being claimed by the defendant, as we have already stated to you,, that they went into possession under this paper. In addition to this testimony, testimony has been introduced as to the declarations of Sally Ann Collins, during her lifetime, tending to show that she claimed the property in her own right; declarations made apart from her husband and also declarations made, as claimed, in the presence of her husband, and also admissions alleged to have been made by him.</p>

Drinker. Just what right, if any, Henry W. Drinker had to convey the land does not appear in the testimony, nor, so far as this particular question is concerned, is it material. We are now considering the question whether they went into possession under this claim of right of <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>William Collins under the Drinker contract, or under the claim of Mrs. Collins under the paper which has been offered in evidence. I do not purpose to go over the testimony bearing upon these questions. It has been very fully and very ably presented to you by the counsel on the one side and the other, and we shall leave it there for your decision. If you find that William and Sally Ann Collins entered under a transfer from her father, John Shepherd, and continued the possession uninterruptedly for twenty-one years, she claiming the land as her own, then she acquired a good title by adverse possession. But if you find that they entered under and pursuant to a claim by William Collins that he had a contract from Henry Drinker, whether such contract was valid or invalid, and that he continued to work the land as his own during his life, then at the time of his death Sally Ann, his wife, had not acquired any title by adverse possession, nor could she tack her subsequent possession to the prior possession of her husband in order to make out a title as against the plaintiff in this case.] [13] If Sally Ann Collins did not acquire title by adverse possession during the lifetime of W illiam, did she acquire title by adverse possession after his death ? It is claimed on the part of the defendant that she did, and that is a question of fact which we purpose to submit to you, namely, was she, for twenty-one years after the death of her husband, in the actual, adverse, exclusive, uninterrupted, notorious possession of the premises for twenty-one years? That she was in possession from the time of the death of her husband until the time of her own death is undisputed ; but it is claimed, in the first place, — and this we submit to you as a question of fact, — that there was not twenty-one years of time between the death of her husband and her own death ; and it is contended, in the second place, that her possession was not exclusive of the owners of the Wurts title. I will recall the dates. According to the testimony, she died in May, 1879. Sarah A. Lynch, the defendant, testifies that her father, William Collins, died in September, 1857. The will which has been offered in evidence is dated some time in 1860 and is probated in 1860, and if that is the correct date of course he could not have died prior to 1860. John Collins also testifies that he died in 1860.</p>

But if she was there under her mother, recognizing her mother’s claim, then that would not interfere with the exclusiveness of the possession of Sally Ann Collins. But if during this period between the death of William Collins and the death of Sally Ann Collins, Sarah Ann Lynch was in possession claiming under the Wurts title, it would have the effect of breaking the continuity and exclusiveness of the possession of her mother. This will require you to consider the testimony with regard to the nature of the possession of Sarah A. Lynch during that period of time. For it appears that in 1872 she and her three brothers took a deed for the Wurts title which was entered of record. If they took this deed, as alleged by the plaintiff, pursuant to an arrangement with Sally Ann Collins, and Sally Ann Lynch one of the grantees in the deed remained in possession under it, the possession of Sally Ann Collins during the subsequent period would not be a hostile and exclusive possession which is necessary to give title by adverse possession. Of course as to that question of fact there is a dispute, and you must decide it; it being alleged on the one side that this deed was taken with the approbation, if not pursuant to the request, of Sally Ann Collins, and on the other side that fact being denied.</p>

While the bringing of the action of ejectment would not of itself break the continuity of the possession of Sally Ann Collins, it is nevertheless a fact to be considered by the jury in determining what was the nature of the claim which Sarah Ann Lynch was setting up while she was in possession, provided you find that the suit was brought by her authority and knowledge. She denies that she authorized the suit in any way and that her first knowledge of it was when the summons was served. If she authorized the suit to be brought, then it would be a fact bearing upon the question as to whether or not she herself was in the actual possession of the premises, or a portion of it at least, under this Wurts title, and thus adversely to the possession of her mother. But if she did not authorize the use of her name, then you should disregard that item of evidence in disposing of the question before you.] [12]</p>

If when this lease was presented to her she acquiesced in its execution by John M. Armstrong in the manner that it was executed, it would be a circumstance tending to show the nature of‘her possession during that period of time— a circumstance tending to show recognition of the Wurts title which had been bought in 1872. Here is another question of fact, and that is, whether or not that lease was executed as it now appears to be at the time claimed by the plaintiff, and whether that was done with the knowledge and acquiescence of the defendant. It is because of its bearing upon this question of fact that we have admitted the evidence tending to show her relations with John M.
