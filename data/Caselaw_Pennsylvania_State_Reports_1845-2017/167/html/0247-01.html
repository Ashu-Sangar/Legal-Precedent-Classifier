In rejecting the proposition he reasons as follows: ‘ Indeed it is difficult to imagine how precedent request alone can supply the place of subsequent notice, since after request made and proffer of guaranty, the merchant may refuse the credit or advance craved, and without notice the surety cannot know whether he has or has not. So far is this insisted on, that it is said without notice there can be no contract; for like all other contracts, that of <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>guaranty requires both a proposal and acceptance thereof.’ This doctrine was distinctly recognized and reaffirmed in Gardner v.

    <p class="summary" id="b271-4" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[203,777,1162,760]]]'>“ In the case at bar the most that can be said for plaintiffs is that their telegram was a precedent request which was followed by a subsequent offer of guaranty from the defendant. Defendant was entitled to notice before he could be held on bis guaranty. To my mind plaintiffs have not made a better if indeed so good a showing as did Coe in his case against Buehler, reported in <a href="/pa/110/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="110 Pa. 366" data-case-ids="543769" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0366-01">110 Pa. 366</a>. There the guarantor signed the guaranty at the instance of the agent of the guarantee. The contract guaranteed, though executed by the debtor, had not yet been signed by the guarantee. It was executed by him soon after-wards but no notice thereof was given to the guarantor. The Supreme Court held that absence of notice of acceptance was fatal and sustained a judgment of nonsuit. This is in harmony with the unbroken line of decisions preceding it and is conclusive of the question under consideration.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_271.6",271,[203,1546,1164,749]]]'>“ It is urged that there is testimony from which the jury could find that defendant was interested in Mrs. Bierly’s purchase — that the goods were in fact bought for him. We do not think so. Joseph Bensinger, the tenant of the hotel under McCormick and Seener, says he purchased from McCormick a one half interest in these goods, on Dec. 13,1889. This was ten months after the sale to Mrs. Bierly. It was not shown how McCormick came by this one half interest or that he knew where the goods came from. The fair and natural presumption would be that he bought from Mrs. Bierly. There is nothing in plaintiff’s testimony to show that McCormick ever, prior to the bringing of this suit, had knowledge that Evans &amp; Company had sold the goods in question or any other goods to Mrs. Bierly. Plaintiffs could have shown how this was and it was their duty to do so.</p>
