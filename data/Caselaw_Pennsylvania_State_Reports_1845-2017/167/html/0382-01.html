These papers were in use during the whole course of dealing with the defendant, covering’ a period of three or four years. In the absence of any denial that the notice or condition was received and read by the officers or employees of the defendant company, the presumption is that it was received and read. No evidence was offered by the defendant to rebut this presumption. The transactions between the parties were many and frequent, and no effort was made by the defendant to show that the officers and employees of the company did not receive and read the notice, or that they were not aware of the condition upon which the plaintiffs received the goods, and the conclusion is irresistible that they sent the goods in question with knowledge of the condition upon which alone they would be received; and under this state of facts the contract has the same force and effect as if it had been formally signed by the parties.</p>
