Where there is a clear gift, it is immaterial whether the direction to pay at a given age precedes or follows it; the vesting will not be postponed, because the time of payment has nothing to do with the substantive character of the gift: In re Bartholomew, 1 Mac. &amp; G. 354; Shrimpton v.

      <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>“These principles have a direct and easy application to the case in hand. The testatrix directed the trustee, on the death of the life tenant, to pay out of the residuary estate $3,500 to her nephew, William W. Whitney, and $2,000 each to his sons, Thomas and Frank, when the sons should respectively attain the age of nineteen years; and if either should die under that age, then to pay his legacy to the survivor, etc. After other bequests of income, the remaining income of the residuary estate was given to a niece of testatrix for life, with a disposition over the principal at her death. The life tenant died in 1889, and Thomas B. Whitney, one of the legatees, is nineteen. He claims interest on his legacy from the date of death of the life tenant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b487-3" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[195,1064,1164,1106]]]'>“In every view which can be taken of it, this legacy was contingent. There was no express gift, and the direction to pay was descriptive of the legatee, because conditioned on his attaining a given age. The testatrix, moreover, did not stand ■in loco parentis to him, and her bequest to him was not intended for maintenance. There was also a gift over of the entire residuary estate. How could interest run upon a legacy from the death of the life tenant, when the legatee was not yet ascertained, and when all the estate which had not vested was given ■to the residuary legatee. The cases cited in the adjudication disclosed in each instance either a distinct gift to the legatee or what was equivalent thereto. In Laporte v. Bishop, <a href="/pa/23/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="23 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="974095" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0152-01">23 Pa. 152</a>, the testator directed the executors to ‘ take charge ’ of the legacy, and he spoke of it as the ‘sum bequeathed’ to the nephew. In Schwartz’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/119/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="119 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="558114" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0337-01">119 Pa. 337</a>, the executor and trustee was ordered to hold and invest the residue, and to pay certain sums thereout to testator’s children, except John, as they attained certain ages; and the residue was given in equal shares to the same children. The share of John was to be paid when he should satisfy the executor that he had amassed by his own exertions a certain sum. John was of age when the testator died.</p>

Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.%20403" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 W. 403">9 W. 403</a> ; to which may be added Bowman’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/34/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="34 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="418025" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0019-01">34 Pa. 19</a> ; Seibert’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/13/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="13 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="964927" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0501-01">13 Pa. 501</a>. The direction, in the present instance, to the executors to liold the residue was for the benefit of the several life tenants and the ultimate residuary legatees, and it differed from that in Laporte v. Bishop, where the direction was to hold and take charge of the legacy, and from that in Schwartz’s Appeal, where it was to hold and invest. Even, however, if we should hold that the legacy vested at the death of the tenant for life, we should be confronted with the rule, which obtains in legacies as in matters generally of indebtedness, that-interest begins to run only from the date at which they are payable. In Leech’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/44/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="44 Pa. 140" data-case-ids="484264" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0140-01">44 Pa. 140</a>, the legacy to a grandchild was to be paid upon her arrival at the age of twenty-one; and it was held that interest began only when she reached her majority.
