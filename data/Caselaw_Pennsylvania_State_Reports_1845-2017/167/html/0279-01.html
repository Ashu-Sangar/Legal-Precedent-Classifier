The chief point of market for the production of said company is Pittsburg, Alle-ri <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>gheny and territory contiguous thereto. Said plaintiff company in addition to territory for gas purposes held in other counties in the western part of Pennsylvania, has leased and controls in the county of Armstrong a very large acreage, and has now on said territory in said county about sixteen wells producing gas, and a number of wells now drilling and nearing completion and a number of other sites for wells located. In order to further develop said territory and carry the product thereof to market, the plaintiff company is extending and enlarging its lines already laid so as to reach the territory in said county that it has already developed and is developing. The defendant borough lies between where the point of distribution of the plaintiff company and its lines as laid now are, and the plaintiff in laying out a route upon which to extend its lines to the present point of production has passed through said borough along Stewart and Washington streets and has attempted to arrange with the municipal authorities of said borough for the laying of said line. [The council of the borough passed an ordinance granting permission to lay the line along said streets upon certain conditions, and the terms of the ordinance were conditionally accepted by the plaintiff company;] [2] the main condition of acceptance by the company being that the burgess of said borough would approve said ordinance by signing the same. This the burgess did not do, but filed his veto of the same. The plaintiff company then filed the bill in equity, praying for an injunction to restrain the said borough from interfering in any way with the plaintiff laying its lines over and along the route .as it was laid out through said borough. The question arising in this controversy is, Has the plaintiff the right under its charter of incorporation to proceed without the consent of the council of the defendant borough to lay its lines along the streets thereof? It is decided in Carother’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=118%20Pa.%20486" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="118 Pa. 486">118 Pa. 486</a>, that the plaintiff company has not only the right and authority under its charter to engage in producing natural gas, but it also has the right of eminent domain both by the act incorporating it and also by the act of May 29, 1885. Now it having the right of eminent domain, what, if any, restrictions are placed upon it in exercising the same ? The plaintiff company has never accepted or come under the provisions of the act of 1885 entitled, ‘ An act to provide for the incorporation <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>and regulation of natural gas companies,’ but by the provisions of said act it is given the right to enter upon and occupy the streets of a borough whether incorporated under the provisions of the act or not. The 10th section of said natural gas act gave to ‘ All corporations that is or are now, or shall hereafter be engaged in such business,’ the right of eminent domain. This company was engaged in the business of producing, transporting and distributing natural gas for fuel at the time of the passage of this act, and is therefore included as one of a class mentioned therein. The said act does not provide that companies such as the plaintiff is must, before laying their pipes within the limits of a borough, obtain the consent of the authorities therein. [This act enumerates what companies or corporations shall obtain such assent, and the plaintiff company and such as have the same authority by the terms of their charters are excluded from such enumeration. The maxim ‘that the including of one is the excluding of another ’ applies here, and the fact that corporations such as the plaintiff are not mentioned in that portion of the act requiring the consent of council shows that they are to be excluded from this provision of the act, and are not required to obtain such consent. It may appear to some that this would be giving companies such as the plaintiff an undue amount of authority, but be this as it may the legislators have so made the law, as we view it, and we must decide accordingly.] [3]</p>

It was engaged in this business prior to and at the time of the passage of the act “ for the incorporation and regulation of natural gas companies ” approved May 29, 1885, P. L. 29. It has not accepted the provisions of this act, but it has located and partially constructed “ a twenty inch wrought iron gas line ” for the purpose of conveying gas from its wells in Armstrong county to its customers in the cities of Pittsburg and Allegheny. The line so located passes through the borough of Freeport and .along Stewart and Washington streets in said borough, the authorities of which have refused to permit it to lay its pipe on said streets. The result of this refusal was that the company filed a bill in the court of common pleas of Armstrong county against the borough praying, inter alia, for a decree enjoining and restraining “the defendant, its officers, agents and employees from interfering in any way with the construction by plaintiff of its twenty inch pipe line on its adopted location through said borough.” The case was proceeded in by agreement as if upon final hearing and a decree was entered in conformity with the prayer of the bill. The principal question for our consideration on appeal from this decree is whether the assent of the borough is necessary to enable the company to construct its pipe line, as located, on Stewart and Washington streets. In considering this question we observe, first, that the Philadelphia Company is not authorized by its charter to lay a pipe line on a street of a municipality and that whatever right it has in this respect it derived from the act already referred to. The tenth section of the act is comprehensive, and plainly includes corporations then engaged in the business of transporting and distributing natural gas. In Carother’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/118/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="118 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="556773" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0468-01">118 Pa. 468</a>, this court said, in substance, that the act of 1885 conferred upon such corporations the right of eminent domain, and that the system provided by the act for the assessment of damages occasioned by the exercise of the right was applicable to them. In that case the appellee in this case was a party and its rights and liabilities in regard to.these matters were discussed and considered. Its claim of a right-to lay a pipe line on a borough street appears to accord with the con<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>elusion reached in Carother’s Appeal, because the grant of such a right to corporations then or thereafter engaged in the transportation and distribution of natural gas is as clear as the grant to them of the right of eminent domain. But the rights so conferred must be enjoyed, if at all, in the manner and subject to the precedent conditions prescribed by the act in relation to the exercise of them. By the 13th section of the act, companies incorporated under it and not referred to or included in the 14th section thereof, are forbidden to “enter upon or lay down their pipes or conduits on any street or highway of any borough or city of this commonwealth without the assent of councils of such borough or city, by ordinance duly passed and approved.” The companies “referred to or included in” the 14th section were such companies then <em>“ </em>engaged in the business of transporting or dealing in natural gas for any purpose ” as accepted the provisions of the act. The 16th section declares that “this act shall not be so construed as to permit any corporation accepting its provisions under and by virtue of section fourteen hereof, to enter into any city or borough without the assent of councils, except where the corporation so accepting under section fourteen, had to some extent prior to the passage of this act, begun supplying natural gas within such city or borough or had laid pipes for such purpose therein.” It follows that all other companies to which the act relates, whether incorporated under it or engaged in the business of transporting and distributing natural gas at the time of its passage, are within the purview of the thirteenth section, and must secure municipal consent before entering upon or laying down their pipes on any street or highway of any borough or city of the commonwealth. In order to prevent misapprehension of our meaning it is proper to state in this connection that we now refer to such corporations only as look to the act of 1885 for their warrant to lay their pipes on the street of a municipality. It seems to us that a construction of the act which places non-accepting companies in respect to rights conferred by it, upon a higher plane than companies incorporated under it, and companies accepting its provisions, is not reasonable or in accord with the legislative purpose. We conclude therefore that the Philadelphia Company is not authorized to construct its pipe line on Stewart and Washington streets in the borough of <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>Freeport without the consent of the borough authorities, and as it has' not obtained such consent “ by ordinance duly passed and approved,” it is not necessary to consider the effect of municipal consent clogged with unreasonable conditions.</p>
