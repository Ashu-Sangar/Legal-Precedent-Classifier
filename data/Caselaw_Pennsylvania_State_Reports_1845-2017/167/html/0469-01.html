In other words, there is a claim here for a lot of goods that were furnished for twenty-five houses, and we have only to do with one of the twenty-five houses. Therefore we take the total amount of goods furnished and divide the amount by twenty-five, which will give you the claim against one house.</p>

In other words, under the evidence in this case there is really nothing for you to consider except the question as to whether there went into this house the amount stated by the witness in detail here, which would make $6.15 for each house, or his general estimate that about three fourths of that order went into each house, which would make a larger sum of money for each house, namely, $8.35. In other words, the evidence in this case, which is uncontradicted, and, therefore, unless you disbelieve the witnesses totally, and I see no cause for you to do so, you will find there was a contract between the defendant Cassidy and the contractor Grunwald ; and that Grunwald in the first instance ordered a certain bill of goods, which is the entire amount claimed in this case, for the whole twenty-five houses, and before the delivery of the goods, Mr. Brown, acting for the plaintiff, waited upon Mr. Cassidy and asked him whether Grunwald, the contractor, was a responsible person, and Mr. Cassidy told him that he was; that he and his then partner, Ambrose, were responsible, and then Mr Cassidy said if they were not he would be responsible. Mr. Brown testifies that he told Mr. Cassidy that he didn’t know anything about his (Mr. Cassidy’s) responsibility, and that Mr. Cassidy then said, pointing to a row of houses, ‘ They are good for all that goes into them.’ Now it is admitted that the order for these goods in the first instance, by Grunwald, included these houses, but it is for you to say how much of this, material went into these houses. There is no question but that these <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>twenty-five houses were mentioned in the interview between Cassidy and Brown, and that being the case, I charge you, as a matter of law, that the liability for the bill is upon the defendant to the extent of the amount of the material that went into them. There is no evidence that the whole lot went into them.</p>

If we assume that 1250 balusters and 750 handrails, and 50 newels went into the houses, then at the prices charged here the total amount would be $158.75, which divided by 25 makes $6.15 for each house; but, if on the other hand, we assume his general statement that three fourths of the bill went into these houses, then the claim for each house would be $8.85.- Under the evidence in this case it is for you to say whether the verdict should be for $6.15 for each house or $8.35, as he is the only witness upon the subject as to how much of this material went into these houses.”</p>

The light of plaintiff to recover depended on questions of fact which were submitted to the juiy, by the learned trial judge, in a charge quite as favorable to the defendant as he was entitled to. He substantially instructed them that plaintiff’s recovery should be restricted to the value of the materials shown to have been furnished by plaintiff on the credit of the buildings and actually used in their construction. If this was not strictly correct the plaintiff company is the only party that has any reason to complain; but, while the verdict is nearly twenty per cent less than its apportioned claim, it is not here com<a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>plaining.
