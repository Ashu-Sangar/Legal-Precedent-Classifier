The policy further provided that no officer or agent of the company had power to waive any stipulation of the policy, unless such waiver be written upon or attached to said policy. After a loss of the property by fire, the insured agreed to deduct a portion of his loss on personal property by accepting the figures of the adjuster of the company instead of his own; and it was then agreed between the insured and the adjuster, said adjuster having full knowledge of the amount of the incumbrances, to compromise and settle the loss, and appoint appraisers to adjust the loss upon the house, and whatever damage the insured had suffered by the burning of his house as fixed by the appraisers, should be added to the amount of damage agreed upon to the personal property.</p>

[That there was some controversy between Mr. McGonigle and Mr. Cornell, the adjuster, as to the amount, but that they finally agreed that if McGonigle would accept the figures of the adjuster upon the personal property they would go on and appoint appraisers for the real estate, and whatever damage the appraisers found that the plaintiff had suffered by reason of the burning of his house should be added to the amount of the damage to the personal property as fixed by thé adjuster, and that the company would immediately pay the amount.] [5] The defendant claims that no such agreement was made. Mr. Cornell testifies that all he did was to make a statement of the amount of the different items of the loss on the personal property and make the arrangements for the arbitration of the amount of the damage to the house; but that he made no agreement whatever by which there was a compromise or settlement of any conflicting claims.</p>

This mortgage, as it appears by the testimony, was originally a little more than $1,500. In October, 1891, this mortgage was figured up, the interest added, the payments which had been made upon it deducted, and a new mortgage given for the gross amount then due. Taking this testimony that is uncontradicted, there must have been at the time of issuing this policy an incumbrance upon the property of more than the amount allowed in the policy — allowed by its terms, which of itself would defeat a recovery upon this policy, and would be a good defense to a suit brought on it.</p>

If he, having a full knowledge of the stipulations, and having authority to make a settlement of that kind whereby the plaintiff released some portion of his claim, that agreement would be binding upon the company, and a suit could be instituted and maintained upon that agreement and a recovery had thereon.
