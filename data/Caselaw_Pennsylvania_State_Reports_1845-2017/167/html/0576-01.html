It also appeared that the occupancy of the land was important to the defendant for the proper exercise of its corporate and public powers and duties. <em>Held, </em>that the bill should be dismissed without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff to renew its effort under the right of eminent domain, at such time as such effort should be deemed necessary, for the purpose of making a continuous double track railroad upon so much land as might be necessary for the purpose.</p>

Under an injunction then obtained, the plaintiff tore up said branch and proceeded to build its road. In that litigation (No. 841 Eq.

R. R. Co. to acquire access to the property and a northern outlet over it. The circumstance that, during the pendency of an injunction restraining the connection of the branch with the main track, its construction has been suspended for a period of some ten years (for all this litigation is of very ancient birth) is neither here nor there. Of course, the branch would not be built while its use was impossible for want of a connection; and its interdiction having been at the instance of the plaintiff, it does not lie in the latter’s mouth to set up against the P. &amp; R. R. R. Co. a fact which legitimately resulted from obedience to the decree obtained against it. That company, however, is also the lessee of the canal and all its property, and the question, therefore, further arises, what relation does the land sought to be appropriated sustain to it as such?</p>

Co.’s branch road impossible, except by encroaching upon the canal and its works; and that, in the construction of a necessary retaining wall for its track, the plaintiff would itself have to encroach upon the guard gate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[270,870,1164,1366]]]'>“ It is true that in the storage of materials every foot of space afforded by the whole track has never been taken up, and that, by changing the arrangement and disposition of the defendant’s property so as to meet the desires of the plaintiff, the former will be able to get on without the ten feet coveted by the latter. But substantially the same arguments were urged, with greater apparent reason than here, in Pittsb. J. R. R. Co.’s App., supra, and met with no favor at the hands of the lower or Supreme Court. ‘ Every reasonable intendment,’ sajes Paxson, J., quoting L. S., etc., R. Co. v. N. Y., etc., R.

I do not conceive that the use which any property owner may choose to make of his own is to be thus supervised and interfered with by another.</p>

If so, it is ‘necessary.’ It may very well be that those portions of this tract, which the defendants have permitted to be occupied by a gristmill and a glass factory could not be said by them wholly to fall within this description. But that circumstance cannot be controlling, because a right of way over that portion would be useless to plaintiff without a similar and continuous right over the remainder of the tract. The space, however, needful for the construction of the P. &amp; R. R. R. Co.’s branch to the north, and the works that would be encroached upon by moving that branch ten feet to the westward, and by the construction of the plaintiff’s track and retaining wall, certainly are ‘ necessary ’ to the lawful business of the one or the other of the defendants, or of both; and so, in any proper view, is all of the property that can be used for wharfage purposes. Whether, in any of the particulars in which these uses would be interfered with by plaintiff’s proposed appropriation, results equally advantageous to the defendants could be achieved in some other way than that which defendants have laid out for themselves is irrelevant. <em>Prior in tempore, potior in jure. . . .</em>

    <p class="summary" id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[150,1874,1167,554]],["BL_602.1",602,[296,381,1163,1012]]]'>“ The plaintiff constructed the single track of which its road on River street consists between the P. &amp; R. R. R. Co.’s track on the east and the strip of land controlled by the same company on the west. It now desires to add, beside the first, a second track, which the master finds is a physicial impossibility, unless it is permitted to place that track upon defendant’s property. The right to build a double track is implied in the right to build a railroad: R. R. Co. v. Speer, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20Pa.%20325" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="59 Pa. 325">59 Pa. 325</a>, 335, per Agnew, J., and it is perhaps conceivable that the exercise of that right may, in certain circumstances and localities, be so indispensable to the exercise of the franchise itself, that the <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>occupancy, for that purpose, of property already held by another quasi public corporation may be permissible. But unless it is so, it is a mere incident to the right to build and operate a railroad, and the company ‘ cannot pursue the incident to the destruction of the rights of other parties: ’ Sharon Ry. Co.’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=122%20Pa.%20545" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="122 Pa. 545">122 Pa. 545</a>. Hence it must, at all events, be incumbent upon the company claiming the right to double track with such effect to show, not only the existence of a condition making a second track at the point in question indispensable to tire enjoyment of the franchise, but also the fact that the requirement of exempted property for its construction is one that results from circumstances not of the company’s creation, but in the nature of things unavoidable. Otherwise no ‘necessity’ warranting the encroachment has been made out. There is, however, in this case nothing to demonstrate a controlling’ need for a double track in this locality. The plaintiff’s road does not appear to be anything but a single-track road, for a distance of at least thirty miles on either side of Reading. Doubtless it has sidings at proper points along its course; but there is nothing to show the peculiar propriety of a siding at this point.</p>

Co. is about to construct a branch upon the very ground to be occupied by plaintiff’s track. Under Const. 1874, art. XVIII. sec. 1, plaintiff will have the right to connect with the same and to have its passengers, tonnage and cars, loaded and empty, transported over the same without delay or discrimination. Unless some special reason be shown why the stretch which the plaintiff will be thus entitled to use must be under its own control, this provision removes the last vestige of a pretense that there is a necessity for the construction of a double track at this point. To be sure, it is suggested that the same provision will enable the P. &amp; R. R. R. Co. to have the same benefit from plaintiff’s track, if constructed as desired, as from the branch it proposes to build, and that, therefore, there is no occasion for the latter. The trouble about this suggestion is that the intention and right of the P. &amp; R. R. R. Co. to build the branch are res adjudicata; that the property belongs to it; and that it would be somewhat out of the ordinary, in order to insure plaintiff’s right to use it in common with its owner, to take it away from the latter and give it to the former, reserving to the owner a <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>mere right to pass over it. The more obvious thing is to leave it to the owner, reserving a right to pass over it in favor of the plaintiff.</p>

Whence comes the necessity for placing it on defendants’ property? There is no finding in this case, and I have discovered no testimony warranting a finding, that the plaintiff’s location of its' road where it is was the only possible one. If it was not — if there was any practicable mode of locating it so as to allow of double-tracking without encroaching upon defendants’ property, into which the question of convenience and economy to the plaintiff does not enter, then the necessity which it now relies on is one of its own creation — that is to say, no necessity at all that will justify the encroachment. ‘ Whenever the existence of any fact is necessary in order that a party may make out his case or establish a defense, the burden is on such party to show the existence of such fact: ’ Willett v. Rich, <a href="/mass/142/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="142 Mass. 356" data-case-ids="768470" data-case-paths="/mass/142/0356-01">142 Mass. 356</a>, 357, per Morton, C. J. The burden upon the plaintiff, in every case, is eo-extensive with the legal proposition upon which his case rests, and therefore applies to every fact which is essential to or necessarily involved in that proposition: Wilder v. Cowles, <a href="/mass/100/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="100 Mass. 487" data-case-ids="2141774" data-case-paths="/mass/100/0487-01">100 Mass. 487</a>, 490. Nor can he, of course, have the benefit of an unproved fact as if it had been proven : Pease v.

It follows that the plaintiff, not having shown the existence of a necessity such as would alone justify a seizure of defendants’ property under the right of eminent domain, has not made out a case entitling it to the decree prayed for, and that, therefore, its bill must be dismissed.”</p>
