On May 26,1886, a fi. fa. on said judgment was placed in the hands of J. Mackey Stocker, sheriff of said county, under which he levied on certain personal property of the defendant. June 2, 1886, the court granted a rule on the plaintiff, upon the petition of the defendant, to show cause why the judgment should not be opened and execution set aside. June 5, 1886, said Richard Foster and Joseph Dech (the defendant in the present suit) as his surety, gave the sheriff a forthcoming bond, the material points of which are as follows:</p>

January 22, 1889, the case was tried and the jury rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $533.25. December 4, 1889, an alias fi. fa. was issued and placed in the hands of John I. Miller, then sheriff of said county, the term of J. Mackey Stocker having expired. This writ was returned “ nulla bona.” May 12, 1890, J. Mackey Stocker, to the use of Henry Erwin (appellee), brought this action against Joseph Dech (appellant), the surety on said bond.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b235-6" data-blocks='[["BL_235.6",235,[256,1825,690,44]]]'>The court charged in part as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b235-7" data-blocks='[["BL_235.7",235,[210,1877,1171,552]]]'>“ [The defendant contends that this was not an official bond, that it is a bond given to the sheriff to protect him from any personal liability, or liability upon his personal bond, by reason of his releasing those goods from the effect of that levy, and the condition was that they should return to the said J. Mackey Stocker these goods whenever ‘legally’ required by him, and that, as the goods were never demanded by him, but the succeeding execution having passed into the hands of John I. Miller, sheriff, there never was a demand made upon him for a substitution of the goods of ‘ like quantity and quality,’ and, therefore, there was no breach of this condition.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b236-4" data-blocks='[["BL_236.3",236,[265,389,1175,1272]]]'>
      <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>“I say to you, gentlemen, that this is not the law. This bond was given to J. Mackey Stocker, it is true, to protect himself from his action as sheriff in releasing these goods. They were released at the instance of the defendant in the execution, for the reason stated in the bond — ‘in order that he might ship those goods to their destination.’ By releasing them, it is also true as a legal proposition, contended for by the defendant, that the sheriff himself incurred a liability to Henry Erwin, and that Henry Erwin might have proceeded against him upon his official bond for any damage he might have suffered by reason of the releasing of those goods from the effect of the levy. That is true; but still, when this condition in the bond was placed in it, that they ‘would deliver to the said J. Mackey Stocker, sheriff ‘ as aforesaid, paints of like quantity and quality,’ etc., they meant that they would deliver to J. Mackey Stocker, if he should demand it as sheriff, or should they be demanded by anybody else, as sheriff, for the purposes of any execution issued on this judgment. That is to say, by the condition of this' bond, Richard Foster was not to deliver only to J. Mackey Stocker, when demanded by him during his term of office as sheriff, or whenever he should individually make the demand; but whenever the demand should be legally made for those goods, either by J. Mackey Stocker, or anybody else acting under the law on an execution upon this judgment, and that is the only proper interpretation of this bond.] [6]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b236-5" data-blocks='[["BL_236.4",236,[266,1668,1168,708]]]'>“ [The defendant further contends that the words ‘ legally required ’ mean that when required by the regular steps and progress of the law, and that, because after this levy was released and the judgment closed by the verdict of the jury, a writ of venditioni exponas de bonis should have been issued instead of an alias fi. fa., and that, therefore, there was no breach of the condition. I say to you, gentlemen of the jury, that that is not the law. ‘ Legally required ’ does not mean by regular process of law — that is to say, by regular succeeding steps of law, but when a legal demand was made upon the principal and surety in this bond for the return of the goods by any regular legal process, that the condition required was complied with, and it was their duty to see that the goods were forthcoming to answer such writ.] [7]</p>

I say to you, gentlemen, that that is not the law. [When the judgment was opened, the judgment still continued as a subsisting lien. It might affect the rights of the parties, which would call for the interposition of the court to adjust the equities, if the verdict of the jury was for a larger amount than the original judgment, but when the verdict of the jury was rendered, adjudging the amount of damages to be paid to the plaintiff, it was a finding upon the first judgment upon which the execution issued, and when the second execution issued upon that judgment, it was another execution issued upon that judgment within the terms of that bond.] [8]</p>
