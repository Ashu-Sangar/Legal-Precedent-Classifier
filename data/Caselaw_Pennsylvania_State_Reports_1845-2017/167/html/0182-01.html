Crouse, the plaintiff’s father, and was included in a deed of assignment for the benefit of his creditors. It was subsequently conveyed by the assignee to Nancy Crouse, the assignor’s wife. Another property of William M. Crouse in Lancaster county had been sold on execution against him, and, at the instance of the Crouses, bought in for Nancy Crouse, by Levi W. Mentzer, who paid $1,545 for it, and took a mortgage upon it for $1,555, being the full amount of the purchase money together with costs of conveyance, recording, etc. Mentzer claimed that in the spring of 1880, it was agreed between him and the Crouses that, as additional security, a deed should be made to him for the-Berks county property, absolute on its face, but in point of fact defeasible upon the satisfaction of his claim on the Lancaster county land; and in pursuance of this agreement he received a deed therefor dated April 11, 1880. The evidence upon this point consisted of the testimony of William M. Crouse to the effect that the <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>understanding was that the deed for the Berks county land was to be given as collateral security for the Lancaster county debt, which was all then owing to Mentzer, and that, with that understanding, the deed was executed by himself and his wife in blank, and left with the scrivener, who was also his assignee, to be filled out and delivered. Nancy Crouse denied any indebtedness to Mentzer beyond the $1,555, any negotiations looking towards a sale of the Berks county land to him, or any knowledge of a claim on his part to the ownership of it. She admitted signing the deed to Mentzer, but explained that being unable to read, she was led to believe and did believe, she was signing some instrument necessary to close up the settlement of the assigned estate and enable the transfer of the property to herself. A letter, dated March 27, 1880, and written by Mentzer himself, to the assignee, corroborated William M. Crouse’s statement that a deed was signed in blank, and that he had seen Mentzer and agreed, for his wife, to the making of a “ collateral deed of that Berks county land for me, as a bail to the property I bought for them at sheriff’s sale,” but refusing to take anything but a deed absolute upon its face, directing the assignee so to fill it out and send it to him, and adding, “ I don’t want to make a dollar out of them; if they pajr me that $1,545, or if I don’t lose anything, I just deed this Berks county tract back to them.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[202,1601,1165,300]]]'>Mentzer claimed that the deed was an absolute one for consideration, and he sold the land to Lev. K,.

The question in this case is, Is it or is it not true ? and that is the question you will have to decide under the rule I have given you. You must remember that the written instrument shows Mentzer to be the absolute owner; that in order to make him out anything else than the absolute owner, in order to establish the proposition which the plaintiffs contend for, you must be satisfied that they made it out beyond a reasonable doubt by the testimony produced here before you, remembering, also, the contradiction which Mentzer and his witnesses have placed in the way. You will, of course, consider with all the testimony of the plaintiff and his witnesses the written instruments that have been shown here before you, this letter that Mentzer wrote to ‘ Squire Ream, the accounts,his own explanations and denials, and whatever else has been shown in evidence, and from all this you will determine, gentlemen, whether you are satisfied that the stoiy which the plaintiff told you is true, is made out clearly, fully" and satisfactorily, beyond a reasonable doubt. If so, then you will return a verdict for the plaintiff; if not, you will find for the defendant.] [5]</p>
