Various moneys were expended by him for the benefit of his cestui que trust, including the entire income of the estate, and also portions of the principal. The expenditure of the principal was without previous application to the court.

Hain, and the maintenance of the real estate which he owned,’ and asked the court to ratify and approve all the payments which were thus made honestly and in good faith, and also asked that the errors in the account herein stated be corrected, and setting forth that the balance due the estate he was ready and willing to pay to his successor in the trust.</p>

The only witness called was the committee, Adam L. Hain, himself. He made no concealment; he explained everything connected with the estate; the financial affairs of the lunatic were in a very tangled condition; he took the estate incumbered by debts; farming operations, as every one in this section knows, were unprofitable ; the relatives of the lunatic desired him to remain on the farm; he was a married man with a wife and child living with him; he had various interests which required attention, and the committee was kept very busy. The lunacy was of that mild description which simply unfitted him for the management of his business affairs. He was easily persuaded and overreached in any business transactions for which he was wholly unfitted. Good natured and shiftless; nothing else.</p>

From the evidence submitted, the auditor believes that the accountant acted in good faith ; that there was no such gross, supine negligence on the part of the accountant as would warrant the auditor in surcharging him with the amount expended above the ■income or any portion thereof. The auditor would therefore recommend to the court that the principal expended by the committee be allowed to the accountant nunc pro tunc.’</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b80-6" data-blocks='[["BL_80.6",80,[238,1281,1161,1008]]]'>“ From the finding of the auditor there was in the hands of the committee at the end of the first year of the trust $136.08. Certainly this amount could not well be put out at interest, being entirely too small for investment. There ought to be no surcharge, especially as the expenses of the year following exceeded the income. Therefore, at the end of 1888 there was nothing to invest. December 1,1889, the auditor finds that he had in hand $590.69, and that this amount had increased until December 31, 1891, when it amounted to $1,135. In 1892 there was a deficit of $187.73, and in 1893 the income exceeded the expenses by $376.75. Upon this showing the auditor properly disallowed the accountant to take credit of $90.00 for interest on money advanced by him. Further on in his report he says, in disallowance of the claim of $270 compensation, ‘he has not charged himself with interest on the several sums of money received by him. We have already shown that the accountant had in hand some $590.69 on the 31st of December, 1889, of which sum at least $500 might have been invested. That $500 more might have been invested in 1891. Had he done so he might have realized for the estate the sum of at least $180.</p>

The neglect to invest whereby he might have realized for the benefit of the estate the sum of $180 interest, is assigned by the auditor as the most potent reason for the disallowance for the trustee’s compensation of $270, notwithstanding he finds that the trustee’s labors were worth this amount of $270, and that the auditor would cheerfully recommend the payment of this amount as compensation or earnings for the work done.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[206,874,1163,403]]]'>“ It seems to us that it would be a wrong to charge him with this amount of interest and also at the same time refuse him compensation. This would be a punishment which the law certainly does not impose upon an accountant acting in good faith. If the money of the estate could have been made to earn $180, not received through this neglect to invest, it suffered no loss when the accountant is deprived of more than this amount of compensation which he fairly earned.</p>

Error is alleged in charging the estate and not the accountant with the costs of the audit, for the reason that the examination of the account was occasioned by the conduct of the accountant, and the evidence shows mismanagement and extravagant expenditure and impairment of the corpus of the estate. We have already approved the finding of the auditor as to the alleged mismanagement and expenditures upon the ground that he acted in good faith. They were for the benefit of the cestui que trust, wife and child, and were not so unreasonable as to compel us to refuse their allowance.</p>

When the trustee’s account was filed it set forth a small balance of $24.14 due the estate. There was upon it an absolute confirmation. It is admitted that there were errors in this account, and, therefore, he is in the position of having filed, however innocently and mistakenly, an erroneous account. It is creditable to him that he frankly acknowledged the error, explained how it was made, and set forth the necessary corrections to be made. This was done, however, in answer to a petition filed, and the appointment of an auditor was necessary, not simply for the work of necessary distribu<a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>tion alone. In every estate the necessary expenses of the distribution required to be made by law, are chargeable against the estate. Besides, it was necessary for the trustee, having omitted to ask the permission of the court to expend portions of the principal sum of the trust estate, to justify the expenditure of the principal made by him. His previous neglect to apply to the court cast upon him the burden of justifying the expenditures. This portion of the duties of the auditor was rendered necessary by his conduct, and although he has in the judgment of the auditor, as well as in our judgment, proven such facts as to lead us to ratify and approve these expenditures, the fact still remains that the work of the auditor to this extent was rendered necessary by his act.</p>

It was held that ‘where a trustee, who is authorized by an order of court to expend a certain sum in the construction of a building, exceeds the expenditure so authorized, he takes the risk of being surcharged; but where the court subsequently approve such expenditure, he is relieved from liability.’ But the auditing judge reformed and restated the entire account and imposed the costs of the proceeding upon the accountant.
