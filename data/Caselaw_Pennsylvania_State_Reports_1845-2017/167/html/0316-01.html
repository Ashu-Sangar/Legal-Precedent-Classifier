Becoming embarrassed he confessed judgment to his wife’s grandfather, Daniel Frack, the plaintiff, who bought in the property at the sheriff’s sale. In June, 1889, a partnership was entered into between Mahlon A. Gerber and Margaretta C. Houtz. Houtz, acting for his wife, <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>prepared a written statement in which the goods for which suit was brought appeared as a contribution of Mrs. Houtz to the partnership capital, and plaintiff’s account did not appear among the bills payable.

Was he the owner of these goods and were they sold to this firm ? Has he been paid for them ? If he was the bona-fide owner of the goods, if he sold them to this firm and has not been paid for them he would have a right to recover. Of course, if he was a party to a fraud, of which there is no evidence here, I must say to you, the conclusion might be different.

There is some dispute as to what took place at the time that the article was made, but there is no evidence of Mr. Frack’s having been present. The evidence is he was not there; that he is blind and incapable of attending to business or that he knew anything of what took place, and if his claim is an honest claim it could not be affected by anything that took place at the writing of this agreement between Mr. Gerber and Mrs. Houtz. But the difference there goes to the credibility of each party, the credibility of Mr. Houtz upon one side and the credibility of Mr. Gerber upon the other.] [6] The jury judges of the credibility of witnesses and determines whether they are right or wrong in their statements from other facts in the case and surrounding circumstances, whether the one is mistaken or the mistake is on the part of the other. Houtz testifies that this firm of Gerber &amp; Houtz received from Daniel Frack, of Frackville, dry goods and notions which were shipped from Frackville to the firm at Johnstown. He has produced three bills here showing shipments of goods, one lot in July, 1889, another lot 2d of August, 1889, and a third lot of September 2,1889, amounting in the aggregate to $1,418.22, which is the plaintiff’s claim here. These shipments of course you will observe were all after the date of the partnership. This was on the 25th of June, 1889. These goods were received, according to Houtz’s testimony, by the firm and placed upon their shelves and disposed of as partnership property. . .</p>

This, supposing the whole transaction to be an honest one, would put the title of the goods in Daniel Frack. They would be his goods from the time he purchased them from the sheriff and paid for them.] [7] He has given you the substance of what the agreement was when Mr. Gerber, the defendant, and Mrs. Houtz entered into partnership, and the agreement itself has been read to you at length. In answer to an interrogatory where his wife would get money from to go into partnership, he testifies she got it from her father, and at the time she had about $950 in money. Each was to put in a thousand dollars, as you have heard read to you from the agreement. He alleges that Mahlon Gerber and Mrs. Houtz each paid a part of the thousand dollars they were to pay at that time; that they gave the money to him and he took it to Johnstown to enter into this business. He denies he purchased any of the goods for which Daniel Frack claims. [He denies that they were put into this store as Mrs. Houtz’s share of stock against the money put into it by Mr. Gerber. He on the other hand claims that Mr. Gerber ordered these goods to Johnstown. Whilst the store was in Johnstown Mr. Gerber remained in Frackville and it appears by the articles of agreement was the manager of this firm. He states that it was Gerber himself who ordered the goods to Johnstown, the inference of which would be that he was the purchaser instead of Houtz.] [8] [He then comes down to the time that Gerber and Alexander Scott came to Johnstown when an account of stock was taken, and produced a paper here in Mr. Scott’s handwriting in which Mrs. Houtz is credited with $950 and Mr. Gerber with $1,250. It is alleged that the capital represented then was $8,400 and bills payable $1,087, which does not include the $1,422 of the Frack claim. Both sides have been examined at length as to what took place at this time and the statement of Mr. Gerber, the defendant, and the statement of Mr. Houtz, are in many respects in conflict, but I do not think it necessary to dwell on it.] [9] Mr. Frack was not there and was not represented as I understand it, and I repeat that any fraud on the part of Mr. Frack must be traced to him.”</p>

Judgment was entered against M. C. Ploutz, for want of an affidavit of defense, and M. A. Gerber defended on the ground that the goods had not been purchased by the partnership, but contributed by his copartner as a part of her share of the capital. This was the only issue of fact raised. The business had been managed for the firm by A. W. Houtz, the husband of M. C. Houtz, one of the defendants, and the son in law of Daniel Fraek, whose executors were plaintiffs; and their case rested mainly on his testimony. The partnership had been dissolved by the purchase by M. O. Houtz of her partner’s interest, and at the time of the dissolution a statement of the business had been prepared in which the price of the goods claimed to have been sold was charged to capital stock, and did not appear among the bills payable. There was testimony that this statement had been made up from information derived from A. W. Houtz. The statement was offered in evidence and rejected. We are of opinion that it should have been admitted.</p>
