      <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>“ There is but one question for' you to consider — the value of the property. You are not to pay the plaintiffs any more on account of its having been taken by the city under its delegated power of eminent domain than they could have gotten for it if it had been sold in the public market. Nor are the plaintiffs to be paid one cent less than its full and fair value because the city wanted it. Your inquiries are thus reduced to a single point, what was the fair market value of Mr. Warden’s property and Mrs. Bradbury’s property at the time these properties were taken by the city; that is, on the 1st of May, 1892 ? In considering that, you are to consider what the properties would have brought at that time, what they were worth in the public market. You are not to search about for a speculative value, but for a real value, such a value as somebody would have been willing at that time, if the lots had been sold, to give for these properties. In a word, what could have been gotten for them in the public market on the 1st of May, 1892. Of course, you are not to sit down, and by laying out streets and making plans of your own, and cutting up these tracts of land into innumerable small lots, to find a speculative value, which might represent a possible value to be obtained in future years after a large expenditure of money upon improvements, etc. You are to look at the land as it was when taken, and in the light of surrounding circumstances, and you are to ascertain with as perfect impartiality as you can what was the fair selling value of the land at that date. That sum is what you ought to accord to the plaintiffs in these cases. You are to look at these tracts of land as an entirety, as a whole — two large lots of land, one of them containing thirteen acres and the other containing between four and five acres, and you are to say what the lots in that situation, and in view of all the surroundings of those tracts, would have brought at that time.</p>

Obviously you would put a different value upon land which is in the market by the foot from that which you would put upon <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>land which is in the market by the acre. Was this land then selling by the acre, or was it then selling by the foot ? Everything which gives intrinsic value to the land you may properly consider in making up your estimate of the market value. [If, for example, this land was in a neighborhood which was ripe for city improvements, so that the land at that time could and would have been sold at that time by the foot, you would put a different estimate on it from that which you would naturally put upon it if it was farm land. I say, therefore, you are not to ignore the capacity of the land for city improvements in fixing your value of it.] [3] [It is proper for you to consider whether this land was ripe for city improvements at that time or not. You ought to give the facts in regard to that such weight as they are entitled to. It was to enable you to form a correct judgment upon that subject that much of this testimony was .admitted.] [4] That testimony was not admitted with a view of permitting you to sit down and cut up these tracts of land into lots and rendering a verdict for so much per lot, or to permit you by that means to arrive at a speculative verdict founded upon a state of things which might not exist for years to come, but it was admitted, in order that you might thoroughly understand the true value of the land in the market —such as it then was. It is perfectly right for you to consider the capacity of the land to be cut up into city properties. [If this land was then ripe for city improvements — if it could then have been sold and would have been sold as city lots — you have a right to consider that, and should give the plaintiffs the value of that land, whatever it then was. If, on the contrary, you find that this land was not then ripe for city improvements —that the lots were country lots and farm land, and that property was not selling there <em>by </em>the foot or in city lots, but only by the acre — of course you will put a different valuation upon it.] [5]</p>

It was not made until after the trial had progressed for two days; all of plaintiff’s testimony in chief (150 printed pages) had been received, and he had rested. If the motion had been granted and the order made, it would have been very difficult, if not impossible for the parties in interest to know how much of the one hundred and fifty pages of plaintiff’s testimony had been stricken out. During the time that was occupied by plaintiff in the introduction of his testimony, witness after witness was called and examined without objection and elaborately cross-examined in relation to matters — presumably referred to in the motion. Indeed, a very considerable part of the testimony was of that character, and all of it was offered and admitted without objection until the plaintiff closed his testimony in chief, and then the motion was sprung upon him. If defendant’s counsel then for the first time began to realize that what he now calls irrelevant and incompetent testimony had been admitted, the very least that he should have done, in his appeal to the discretion of the court, would have been to specify particularly the por<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>tions of the testimony at which his motion was aimed. In denying the motion, there is nothing that savors of an abuse of discretion on the part of the learned trial judge.</p>
