If the preamble, a consideration of the whole act and the good sense of the thing are to prevail, the act of 1893 must be held to have repealed the earlier act. In other words, the act gives compensation for services rather than for ability to successfully lobby a local bill for increase of unearned fees. <em>3*</em>
