In this connection the pres'ent bill avers that the supervisor cannot read; that the contract was not read to him; he did not understand its force and effect. He testifies, however, that lie refused to sign it until he secured (which is denied) the assurance of Messrs. Zehner and McLaughlin that they would make the same kind of agreement with him as he had obtained from the Inter-County Co. It would seem that he knew at least that it conferred a right of way.

The president of defendant company testified that they had no right of way (or consent) from any ‘ municipality.’ He returned to the stand and said that he meant and understood the word to mean ‘borough/ As this was in a suit in which his company was seeking to uphold the agreement for a right of way obtained from Rahn township, his explanation is sufficient. But the fact remains that defendants have admitted that they have not obtained the consent of the local authorities of Tamaqua or Lansford boroughs. Their charter authorizes them to build a railway ‘ along and over the following route : Beginning at the western extremity of West Broad street in the borough of Tamaqua, etc., thence along and over said street, running in an easterly direction to the point of intersection with the public road leading through Rahn township, etc., thence over and upon said highway, passing through the villages of Seek, or Ge.arytown, No. 10, and Coaldale, in said Rahn township, to where the road joins Ridgp street in the borough of Lansford, Carbon county, Pennsylvania, thence along said Ridge street, to its junction with Spring Garden street, in said borough of Lansford, being in all a continuous line of about 5 miles in length.’ Under this act no charter can be obtained unless the applicants shall state (sec. 1) ‘ the circuit of the route; ’ by see. 2 they are required to pay cash for each mile of the proposed road and to swear that “it is intended in good faith to construct, maintain and operate the road mentioned in the articles of association,’ and sec. 15 says that ‘no street passenger railway shall be constructed by any company incorporated under this act within the limits of any city, borough or township, without the consent of the local authorities thereof, nor shall any street passenger railway be incorporated hereunder, which shall not have a continuous route from the beginning to the end, forming a complete circuit with its own track, excepting the 500 feet to be used under section 14 hereof. ’ ”</p>

When defendants came into court and confessed that they have not obtained anjr right from these two terminal boroughs to construct or operate their railway within their limits, it would seem as if the default was of the very essence of the contract, both with the state and with the local authorities. That it is as to the state was decided in Commonwealth v. The Erie N. E. R. Co., <a href="/pa/27/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="27 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="979639" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0339-01">27 Pa. 339</a>, and under the act of 1889, the terms of the act indicate that it was to be plainly understood that the chartered company should have a continuous route from the beginning to the end and forming a complete circuit,’ etc. No reason suggests itself why the same rule should not govern the contract with the complainant. The charter in the one case, and the agreement with the township in the other, state the termini and route, and failure as to them would be of precisely the same importance in both cases. When a company proposes to connect a township with two boroughs, precisely what it proposes it should be held to do, and not as little of it as it chooses. It would seem to be at least implied that they would build the whole road which their charter required, and which this agreement defined. That they cannot do this at this time is a sufficient reason for restraining them from taking possession of this road under this agreement.</p>

How far this is lawful under their charter it is not necessary here to decide. It is observable that the strict term of the act authorizes the building of street railways only on streets or highways, and that the act provides no machinery for acquiring right of way over private lands but only over streets or highways, turnpikes, and portions of the tracks of other companies.</p>

Schuylkill Valley Railway Company v. Montgomery County Street Railway.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The importance of that holding is made perfectly apparent by the facts of this case. The defendant had not obtained the consent of the borough in which its road began, nor of that in which it ended, nor of all the districts intermediate. The construction of its circuit was absolutely impossible while this state <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>of things lasted; and it had no right as against, a township or borough that had given a valid consent to the building of the railway described in the charter, to enter upon its highways until it was in a position to do that which its charter required. This was the law prior to the act of 1889 under which the defendant was incorporated: Commonwealth v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/27/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="27 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="979639" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0339-01">27 Pa. 339</a>. If that was doubtful it was made the law as to all street railways by the provisions of that act. The learned judge suggests a question of grave importance that does not seem to be raised by the assignments. He says “It does not appear to be denied that the defendants have located their railway only in part upon the street or highway, and the balance over the lands of private persons who have given their consent. Plow far this is lawful under their charter it is not necessary here to decide.” This mode of location shows how determined is the attempt to use our street railway legislation for a purpose never contemplated by the lawmakers. Street railways are railways on and along the streets of. a city or town. They must conform to the grades of the streets they occupy. They may diverge for a.short distance where the conformation of the surface or the position of streams make it necessary in order to avoid discomfort or danger to the traveling public, but that a street railway may, like a steam railway, locate its route not for the accommodation of local travel along the highways, but to reduce time and distance for passengers traveling from city to city or town to town across the country, is a proposition not to be entertained. It involves a perversion of the character and object of street railways. This is obiter dictum, but the subject is so intimately related to the questions under discussion in these cases, and is of such importance both to the railroads and the people of the state, that the writer feels justified in calling the attention of the other departments of the government to it in this manner. Applications for charters should be, as we have no doubt they are, carefully examined ; but attention has not heretofore been called to this subject, and its importance has therefore not been recognized.</p>
