D.-1892, the plaintiff, at the instance of defendants, erected and constructed on defendants’ said land one of ‘ Wheeler’s Patent Improved Boiler Furnaces,’ and one battery of ‘Wheeler’s Water Tube Boilers.’ This structure consists of a stone foundation, commenced below the surface of the ground, on which the furnace is erected, having brick walls, with doors and other openings to the fire, heating chambers and other compartments within; the patent boilers being immediately above said furnace, and said brick walls extending to the top of the boilers and supporting a brick arch which, with the top of the upper tier of boilers, forms the only covering the structure has. There is thus formed a rectangular structure thirteen and two tenths feet by sixteen and nine tenths feet, which is twenty feet high from the top of the stone foundation to the top of the brickwork.

It is true one part of the opinion in Parrish and Hazard’s Appeal concludes that the buildings in question were ‘ additions of material parts.’ But we do not understand what was there said, to mean that those buildings were to be regarded as an addition to any other building, for the fact was clear that no other building was increased, extended, enlarged, augmented, or in any manner changed in outward appearance by them. The expression occurs in pointing out the difference between the buildings in question and ordinary out houses appurtenant to a dwelling house, and the import of the argument in which the expression referred to occurs is, that, if it were true that some out buildings appurtenant to dwellings were too insignificant to support a mechanic’s lien, yet the buildings in question were not of that character, but were material parts, added, not to another building, but to the ironworks as a whole. In other words, that they were sufficiently permanent, substantial and material to support the liens filed against them.

While the exterior structure is an essential part of the boiler plant itself, <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>forming the sides of the fire chambers, inclosing and sustaining the boilers in position, and sustaining also the steam drums at the top, over the boilers, yet it is a substantial and costly structure performing the function of a building as to the boilers, as well as constituting a part of the boiler plant.

The property was an old furnace plant which had been in use for a number of years, just as this, and its owners desiring to increase its power, contracted for a new engine, a new set of boilers, drumheads and fixtures, and for a boiler stack, all of which were constructed but by different contractors. We held that these improvements were substantial additions to the old buildings for permanent purposes, made at a heavy cost, and so connected with the origi<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>nal structure as to be as available and direct as if they had been originally built, and that they were the subjects of mechanics’ liens under the act of June 16, 1836, and that they could also be sustained under the act of April 21, 1856. In considering the subject of the boilers Mr. Justice Woodwakd delivering the opinion said, “ The foundations of the boilers were seven walls, each sixty-seven feet long, from eighteen inches to two feet thick and from two to three and a half feet high. Brick walls were built on the stone -foundations to the height of six feet extending nearly to the tops of the boilers and inclosing them. . . . That such machinery as was furnished here was of a kind for which in the ordinary case of an erection, a lien could be supported, is well established. A lien was sustained for a copper boiler in a brew-house in Gray v. Holdship, 17 S. &amp; R. 413; an engine by which a sawmill was propelled in Morgan v. Arthurs, <a href="/watts/3/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="3 Watts 140" data-case-ids="1841275" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0140-01">3 Watts, 140</a>; and for burr mill-stones in Wademan v.

The engine house and boiler house became parts of the furnace the moment they were completed. They were connected with it by blast pipes and flues, and the connection was as available, essential and direct, as if they had been built beside the furnace walls. In the language of the decisions they were ‘ additions of material parts ’ to the original structure. They served in their actual use all the purposes that actual additions would have served, and their extent and value were significant enough to give ample notice to purchasers and creditors of the change in the character of the propert}*-. The decision of the auditor and the decree of the court below in support of these liens under the provisions of the act of the 16th of June, 1836, were not only in accordance with the general principles deducible from the cases that have been collected but vindicated by the very rules which those cases have established.”</p>

As was held in Parrish and Hazard’s Appeal, the lien could be sustained under the act of 1856 which gave a lien for machinery, and that act did not require any notice. As between the acts of 1856 and 1887, we think it quite clear that the structure in this case must be regarded as provided for by the act of 1856, in contrast with the act of 1887, for the reason that the act of 1856 is directly applicable to machinery as such, whereas the act of 1887 provides that the act of 1836 and its supplements shall be held and taken thereafter to apply to work done and materials furnished, for or about the repairs, alteration or additions to any house or building. We think this must be held to apply to such work or materials as are done or furnished for repairs, alterations, or additions, which were not reached by the acts of 1836 and 1856. If the remedy under those acts obtained, it was without the restraining or qualifying conditions imposed by the act of 1887, and in any given case if the structures were subject to lien under the former acts as original erections, but because of their character, could be embraced by the act of 1887, the remedy would be diminished rather than expanded by the application of that act. This act is an enlarging and enabling one, intended to embrace cases not within the purview of the previous legislation, but if it is extended to cases which were within such purview, the remedy available under the preexisting legislation would be no longer available in its entirety, and as to all such cases the act of 1887 would become a restraining instead of an enlarging act. We think such a result would be inconsistent with the manifest purpose of the act.</p>

Hinkle, <a href="/pa/126/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="126 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="968935" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0478-01">126 Pa. 478</a>, the opinion seems to warrant the contention of the appellants in this regard. But a careful consideration of that decision shows that it is not applicable here. The case arose under the provisions of the act of August 1, 1868, P. L. 1168, which was an act giving a right of lien, in the city of Philadelphia only, in all cases of repairs, alterations and additions, but annexed certain conditions and qualifications as attending the exercise of the right, one of which was a prohibition of lien in the case of a conveyance of the property before the filing of the lien. We held ‘that the act of 1868 was the law in Philadelphia in all <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>cases of repairs, alterations and additions, and as this was a clear case of addition under the act, the right of lien was only enforceable in conformity with the act. The reasoning upon which the decision was based was that, “ if there are two acts, of which one is special and particular, and clearly includes the matter in controversy, whilst the other is general, and would if standing alone, include it also, and if, reading the general provision side by side with the particular one, the inclusion of that matter in the former would produce a conflict between it and the special provision, it must be taken that the latter was designed as an exception to the general provision.” The act of 1868 was special and local and conferred a lien within the limits of the city of Philadelphia, which had no existence in any other part of the commonwealth. Within that city it was the law in all cases of repairs, alterations and additions, but outside of the city it was not the law in any such case. Hence the doctrine invoked as a principle of construction was directly applicable. But in the present case there is no such situation. The law of 1887 is just as general as the law of 1836, or the law of 1856. It and they extend to all parts of the commonwealth. As between them there is no conflict. The act of 1836 extended to all cases of buildings but was held not to include cases which were merely eases of repairs, alterations or additions. The law of 1856 embraced all cases of certain designated kinds of machinery. The law of 1887 simply enlarged the ■ subjects of lien generally by extending them to repairs, alterations and additions, without taking away from the laws of 1836 and 1856 the right of lien in the cases which they embraced. Either of the former laws would embrace the present structure and therefore there was a complete remedy under those acts. The right of lien in this case does not depend in any degree upon the act of 1887, it is complete without it and is therefore not subject to its conditions or qualifications. We are of opinion that the learned court below was correct in the conclusions reached.</p>
