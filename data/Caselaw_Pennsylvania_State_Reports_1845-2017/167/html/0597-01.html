    <p class="summary" id="b621-5" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[175,586,1162,1217]]]'>“ At the time of the audit of the partial account of the committee, in 1890, the note in question had been barred by the statute of limitations for more than two years. It was not in the power of the committee to remove the bar of the statute by a new promise ; hence his mere failure to object to the allowance of the claim, and his payment of the amount allowed upon it by the auditor could not have that effect either upon the ground of an implied reassumption or of estoppel. But it is argued that the confirmation of the report was a conclusive adjudication of the liability of his ward. In Reber’s App., <a href="/pa/125/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="125 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="563958" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0020-01">125 Pa. 20</a>, it was held that the adjudication and allowance of a claim in the distribution of a decedent’s estate by an auditor, followed by a decree of the orphans’ court confirming the audit- or’s report, is as effective to toll the bar of the statute of limitations as would be a judgment at law, and in such case the statute is inoperative. On the other hand it was held in Light’s Est., 13G Pa. 211, that the allowance of a dividend upon a debt by a decree of the court of common pleas, distributing funds of an assigned estate, would not toll the statute. Speaking of Reber’s Appeal, Justice Clark said that in a distribution in the orphans’ court the adjudication is against the administrator or executor, as the legal representative of the decedent, whilst, in the case of a distribution of an assigned estate, the adjudication is against a particular fund only.</p>

But we are unable to conclude that a distribution of a balance in his hands as shown by a triennial statement of his management of the estate is conclusive. These statements, like the triennial statements filed by guardians, are merely for the information of the court, and the inspection of all parties concerned. Upon the determination of the trust the committee is required to settle in the prothonotary’s office a full and complete account of his management of the property under his care, including all the items embraced in every preceding settlement.</p>

The 20th section of the act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 597, makes it the duty of the committee to apply so much of the income of the estate as shall be necessarj to the payment of debts, the support of the lunatic and of his family, and for the education of his minor children. The next section provides that if the incpme of the estate shall not be sufficient for the purposes aforesaid it shall be lawful for the committee, under the direction of the court, to apply so much of the principal of the personal estate as shall be necessary for the purpose. Possibly the jurisdiction of the court to make distribution of the fund in the committee’s hands as shown by his partial account might be sustained under this section, but, even if this be so, it did not extend beyond the particular fund. It may be conceded, for the present purpose, that the confirmation of the auditor’s report was so far conclusive as to protect the committee in the payment of the sums awarded the different claimants, but we do not think it can be treated as having the same effect as a judgment in an action at law upon the claim, upon final settlement of the estate.</p>

On the distribution thereof Lina Guenther claimed her mother’s share, under the will of the testator. The auditor allowed the claim. No exception was filed to the report, and it was confirmed. Payments in pursuance thereof were made to her for several years. On the distribution of the funds subsequently acquired by the executors, the conelusiveness of the former decree of distribution was the direct question. She claimed it was conclusive of her right to share in the proceeds. The court below held otherwise, and excluded her claim. On <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>appeal the Supreme Court affirmed the decree and said, ‘ the prior decree of the orphans’ court was conclusive only as to the fund then distributed.’ This ruling was followed in Kline’s App., <a href="/pa/86/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="86 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1056577" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0363-01">86 Pa. 363</a>; and the principle of the decision was recognized in Townsend’s App., <a href="/pa/106/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="106 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="455740" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0268-01">106 Pa. 268</a>-274, and Grim’s App., <a href="/pa/109/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="109 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="542287" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0391-01">109 Pa. 391</a>-397. Following these decisions, and having regard to the purpose for which these triennial statements are filed, we conclude that while the confirmation of the auditor’s report may have been so far conclusive as to protect the commissioner in the payment of the sums awarded the different claimants, it was not such an adjudication as would preclude inquiry into the validity of the claim in an action at law against the ward after being restored to reason, or in a distribution of the fund in the committee’s hands as shown by his final account.</p>
