For years previous to the creation of this tenancy, and at the time of its creation, when Tracey was placed in possession, and up to the time of the accident complained of, the areaway was in precisely the same condition.

So far as the public is concerned, it is nothing to them who may be ultimately liable for repairs. It is the duty of the tenant or occupier in the first instance to keep the ways in such order as not to endanger others, whatever may be his agreement with the landlord or owner of the premises. In the absence of any contract to the contrary, the tenant is bound to keep the premises in repair. The tenant always is, the landlord may, under peculiar circumstances, be liable for an injury sustained by a third person, arising from negligence. It may be remarked that when the landlord leased the premises the grate was in good repair.’ See remarks of trial judge.</p>

The actual owner in fee had leased the factory to a tenant. The Supreme Court held that by the word ‘ owner ’ they intended such an owner as is in the possession and occupancy of the premises, who has the immediate dominion and control over it, and the manner of whose use of it makes a fire-escape necessary ; that the act was in the disjunctive, the duty being imposed upon the owner or landlord; that a reasonable construction would seem to be that it was intended to reach the person in possession with a power of control; that a factory is something more than a building, and that the duty attached clearly to the occupant in possession, who places the operatives in a position of danger, and enjoys the benefit of their services.</p>

The building with the unguarded opening in the sidewalk was built by her predecessor in title, and was in the actual possession of a tenant at the time the injury happened.
