      <em>Will </em>— Legacy—Evidence.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b631-9" data-blocks='[["BL_631.9",631,[169,1187,1163,369]]]'>A legacy named in a will was by way of compensation for services rendered by the legatee. Shortly after the will was made the legatee said to a witness that testator had remembered her in his will, “ and that she had a notion to get her money now.” A few days afterwards she presented testator’s check at bank for an amount double the amount of the legacy. The legatee did not deny or explain this testimony although she had permission to do so. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that the legacy had been paid and satisfied by testator during his lifetime.</p>

Mr. Creveling’s testimony is that she said to him that she was to have some money under Mr. Turner’s will, and she wanted him to help her get it at that time; she said she thought if she didn’t get the money now she never would get it, giving her reason for thinking so.</p>

She got five thousand dollars very soon after the making of the will and at a time when Mr. Turner’s bank account was very low, and when the bulk of his estate was in litigation. We cannot presume it was a mere gift in addition to the legacy so recently named in the will.</p>
