Young, who testifies as follows : ‘We were at the breakfast table when grandfather came in, and he sat down and said that he had that fixed now where he could let father have that forty acres of land, and that he was going to deed it to him as he had agreed to do, and they talked awhile and finally he said he would have to ask a favor of him to give him a bond for his support, and he proposed to do the business that day; they said they would hitch up and go to Towanda, and they went. My mother said she would rather that he should keep it in his own hands than to give a bond, if he wanted to let them have the use of it to do so, and she did not think it advisable to give a bond.</p>

Why, he said it was all right; that there would be no harm in giving the bond.

In a few days afterwards, from three days to a week, the grandfather of the witness (Reuben Young) came to Isaac Young’s house and there had a conversation with Mrs. Young, Isaac Young being away at the time ; as the reporter has it, ‘ Grandfather came over there and father was not there, and mother and him got to talking about it, and he said that they had made the arrangement just as they had talked, and mother did not really seem to fall in sympathy with it then, and he went on to explain to her that all he took that bond for was in case he should use up all the other prop<a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>erty that he had, and then he would want something to take care of himself with, so as not to be dependent on other people, and he told her she need not worry, that it would be all right just as he had said.’</p>

If it does mean that, then it would mean that the bond had been executed upon the conditions and terms which they had talked the morning before starting to Towanda, at Isaac Young’s.] [9] . . .
