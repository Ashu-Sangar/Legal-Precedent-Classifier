It further appeared that a judgment had been entered against the lunatic prior to the beginning of the two years found by the inquisition. Within the two years execution was issued upon the judgment, and the lunatic gave money to defendant in the ejectment, who was also the grantee in the deed, to pay the judgment, which he promised to do, but instead thereof he allowed the property to be sold at sheriff’s sale, and bid it in himself. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the record of lunacy proceedings was properly admitted in evidence, and (2) that no title passed to the defendant by the sheriff’s sale.</p>
