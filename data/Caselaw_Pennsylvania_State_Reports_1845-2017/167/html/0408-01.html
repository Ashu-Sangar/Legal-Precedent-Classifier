They claim to have the exclusive right of the alley by virtue of a grant to them of the properties on the south of the alley, to which properties they claim the right to use the alley is confined. They claim' that their grantor obtained this exclusive right by virtue of a deed of conveyance from Thomas G. Rockhill and Charles S. Bowker, trustees of Mrs. Wm. D. Lewis, to Charles H. Muirheid. At the time these trustees conveyed to Muirheid, they had received from Mr. Wm. D. Lewis, the husband of their cestui que trust, a conveyance of all the land bordering upon this alley both to the north and to the south. There is no evidence to show that during the time the dominant and servient tenements were thus vested in Mr. Lewis and his wife, there was any continuous and apparent easement over this alley that might in any way affect the right to change the character of the servitude upon a reconveyance of portions of the property, or which <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>would in any way prevent the extinguishment of the right in Mr. Lewis by reason of both properties vesting in him, and counsel for defendants, in his brief, admits that ‘ at this time the whole tract being in ¥m. D. Lewis it was competent for him to extend this easement to the premises to the north.’ Such being the case, in order to discover whether the defendants are right in contending that they have the exclusive right of passage over this alley, it is necessary to examine the terms of the conveyance from the trustees of Mrs. Lewis to Muirheid, through which defendants claim their title.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-3" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[210,878,1167,399]]]'>“ The alley was originally laid out for the use of the premises on the south; and if this indenture conveys the easement in the same form to the grantors of the defendants, their right to the exclusive use would seem to be sustained, as they are now the owners of all the property bordering on the south of the alley. The two references to the alley in the deed from the trustees of Mrs. ¥m. D. Lewis to Muirheid, dated December 21, 1850, are as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.5",433,[214,1288,1168,445]]]'>“ The deed conveys a brick messuage and lot or piece of ground, and described it as ‘ extending in length or depth along the east side of Fifteenth street (then Schuylkill Eighth street), <em>to an alley %feet wide laid out at the distance of </em>73 <em>feet north of Filbert street leading into and from the said /Schuylkill Fighth </em>street, <em>for the accommodation of this and the other lots of ground on the south of the said alley.’ </em>When the conveyance of the right to use this alley is made in the same deed, the language is as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.6",433,[217,1749,1166,139]]]'>“ ‘ Together with the free and common use and privilege of the aforesaid 3-feet wide alley and of a water course therein, at all times hereafter forever.’</p>

The alley was properly described as formerly laid out for the accommodation of those properties on the south, and it is but reasonable to suppose, that if the grantors wished to convey the exclusive use in that alley to those who bordered on the south, they would certainly have said so when they subsequently made the grant of the easement. It might well be <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>■argued that they wished the property on the north of the alley, which they then owned, to have the use of the alley, and purposely avoided an exclusive conveyance of the right when they sold the land on the south of it. This view is supported by the fact that when they subsequently conveyed the land bordering the alley on the north, they conveyed to the grantee the free -and common use, right, liberty and privilege of this allejq and this property, by subsequent conveyance, became seized in the complainant in this action.</p>

It is undoubtedly true that it would be illegal to increase the burden of the servitude upon this alley, but there was no testimony submitted before your master to show that the burden was in any way-increased. It was shown, on the contrary, that the hotel of the complainant had an alley on the back entering into Cuthbert street, which was used for a passage into the hotel, and the testimony only warrants your master in finding that the use that is likely to be made of the alley entering into Ffteenth street is that in case of fire the guests of the hotel would escape through it. There was no' testimony produced to even show that there was a doorway from the hotel into the alley, though a plan which was submitted by the defendants shows that there was a doorwajr near the fire-escape; but this is not enough to sustain the allegation <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>that an additional servitude has been imposed or that the right cannot be defined. But even if it should be granted that an additional servitude was imposed, or that the right of way had been lost, it would not justify the defendants in vindicating their rights by entering on the complainant’s land and erecting-a fence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b435-3" data-blocks='[["BL_435.4",435,[190,681,1174,708]]]'>“ It is important in this connection to determine the character of the fence which the defendants have tried to erect. It is claimed by them to be a partition fence; but when properties are separated by an alley, whether that alley is three feet wide or twelve feet wide, whether it be a private or a public-alley, in the opinion of your master there cannot be, so long as-the alley is in existence, a technical partition fence between the properties so situated. They do not join each other, and the fence on either side of the alley must be erected exclusively on the property of the person upon whose side it is built, and not partly on the land of each owner; the rights of the opposite-owners of an alley are similar to that of owners upon a public street.

Academy of Music, <a href="/pa/120/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="120 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="559863" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0608-01">120 Pa. 608</a>, quotes this language from Chief Justice Gockburn :</p>

If it could be shown that the building which has been erected has confined the ‘ free and common use, right, liberty and privilege ’ of the complainant in the alley • merely to the purposes of light and air, and a possible escape in case of fire, it would be a grave question whether the owners of the soil could have a right to complain.
