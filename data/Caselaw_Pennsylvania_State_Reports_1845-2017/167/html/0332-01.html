Inside the yard the rule was to keep the train under such control that it could be stopped within half the distance that the engineer could see along the track. The evi<a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>deuce tended to show that while the train was moving, near the limit of the yard, an irregular excursion train was backed up on the same track, and the engineer of plaintiff’s train, not seeing it on account of escaping steam from a passing engine, ran into it, by which plaintiff was injured; but the evidence was conflicting as to whether the collision occurred outside or inside of the yard. <em>Held, </em>that the question was for the jury.</p>

An extension of this railroad northerly from Carbondale is owned by the-New York, Lake Erie &amp; Western Railroad Company, and used both by that company and by the defendant. The defendant, also owns and operates a narrow gauge gravity railroad, extending from Carbondale to Honesdale. In the summer season it. carries many excursion parties from Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and other points south of Carbondale to Farview, on the line-of the gravity railroad, transferring the excursionists from the-cars of the broad gauge road to that of the narrow gauge road, and vice versa, at the Carbondale station. On August 24,. 1887, Edward Goodman, the plaintiff, was fireman on defendant’s locomotive engine No. 35, engaged in drawing coal trains between Carbondale and points south. He had been so engaged for six years prior to the date of the accident, and had been on this particular engine for four years prior to the date of the accident. During these four years his engineer was-<a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>Robert Van Storch, and liis conductor Otto Meyers, both of whom were on the train with him at the time of the accident.</p>

They then received orders from the train dispatcher to “ wild cat to Green Ridge,” a point some miles south of Carbondale. This gave it, according to the testimony in the case, the right to run twelve miles an hour after leaving the limit of the Carbondale yard, running cautiously by stations, looking out for and avoiding all trains running on schedule time.</p>

Engine 35 ran into the rear of this train of empty excursion cars when it was about reaching its place in front of the Carbondale depot. The front end of the boiler of No. 35 was broken in, some flues were forced out to the rear, and escaping steam caused injuries to the fireman, Edward Goodman, who at the time of the collision was in the tank of the engine.</p>

    <p id="b359-4" data-blocks='[["BL_359.6",359,[173,1168,1169,402]]]'>To have directed a verdict for the defendant company, as requested in its 11th point, would have been manifest error. The testimony tending to prove that defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury was quite sufficient to not only carry the case to the jury, but to justify them in finding as they did. The case was carefully and ably tried. There appears to be nothing whatever in the record to justify a reversal of the judgment.</p>
