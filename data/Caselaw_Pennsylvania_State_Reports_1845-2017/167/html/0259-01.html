The defendant put it in the power of the Mississippi Valley Bank to do what it pleased with the check, and that which it did please to do, on the eve of insolvency, was to cancel and surrender the check, and to transmit, not money, but a worthless draft in payment.</p>

In this instance had the demand for payment been made by such agent, the amount of the check would have been collected over the counter of the Mississippi Valley Bank.
