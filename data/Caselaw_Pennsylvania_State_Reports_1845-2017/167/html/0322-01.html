If this judgment was entered upon the 29th of August, 1883, if M. J.

If, however, Robinson had conveyed his land to Silas Hartley on the 7th of April, 1883, and Silas Hartley gave notice at the time of the sheriff’s sale to Mr. Hull, the purchaser, then we say to you that Silas Hartley has shown a title to this land which will enable him to recover in this case. It matters not when the note was given. The note, as I have it here upon notes, was given upon the 7th of April, 1883, upon which this judgment was entered, the note for nine hundred and eighty-four dollars, but it makes no difference if the note was given upon the 7th of April, 1883, the judgment only became a lien upon the land from the time of its entry, and unless this conveyance was made prior to the entry of the judgment, then the judgment became a lien upon it, and a sale under that judgment would pass the title to these purchasers.</p>

Now two men might be wicked enough and unscrupulous enough to make a paper and date it back for the purpose of defrauding another of his lien upon land. Now consider this question: if they did do it, what would be the natural circumstance that would surround a transaction of that kind ? What would a man have to contend with if he attempted to make an instrument and date it back five years in relation to a conveyance of land ? What would be the situation that would confront him when he announced to the public the fact that he had acquired the title to this land five years before any title had been made to him ? Then again, if this transaction was made at the time it purports to be, if there had been a conveyance of this land to Silas Hartley on the 7th of April, 1888, what sort of a conveyance would the parties have been apt to have given? Was this land all paid for at the time ? Is it usual for parties, under such circumstances, to take what is called a paid-up contract or a deed? Is it usual to record and acknowledge deeds at the time they are given? Now you are to consider all these circumstances in passing upon the credibility of the witnesses in this case. Do the stories they tell appear to be reasonable ? Is the situation presented here just such a situation as we would have if this contract had been made and dated back five years, or is it the situation that we would expect if the contract had been made at the date it purports to have been made ? The counsel for the defendant insist that it is strange, that if this contract was made at this time, that if this sale took place at this time, that a deed was not made, that it should have been acknowledged and recorded. They insist that it is strange that the grantor, M. J. Robinson, should be in possession of this land five years after the conveyance was made; that he should be leasing it in his own name, insuring it in his own name, offering to sell it.

J. Robinson, and that M. J. Robinson leased the property in his own name and looked after it for Silas Hartley.

    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[263,532,1171,1114]]]'>The subject of complaint, in the first specification, is part of the learned judge’s charge wherein he instructed the jury that plaintiff “ would have a right to recover in this case provided you are satisfied this contract of April 7, 1883, was made at the time it purports to be, and you do not find that it was made for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding creditors of M. J. Robinson.” Both parties recognized Robinson as the common source of the title in controversy. The questions thus referred to by the court were clearly presented by the testimony and rightly submitted to the jury. The next six ■specifications complain of the court’s answers to defendants’ 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, and 8th points for charge. The eighth to the twelfth, inclusive, allege error in the answers to plaintiff’s 1st, 2d, 3d, 7th, and 8bh points; and the last four specifications complain of the admission of the testimony therein referred to. Our examination of the record with special reference to these specifications has not convinced us that any of them should be sustained; nor do we think that either of them requires further comment. We find no error in the record that would justify a reversal of a judgment entered, as this was, ■on a verdict which appears to have been warranted by the evidence and approved by the court below.</p>
