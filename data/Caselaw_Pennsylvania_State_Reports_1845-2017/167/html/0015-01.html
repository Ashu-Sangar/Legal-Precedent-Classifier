On April 19, 1893, Jacob Wisler, one of the firm, went to plaintiffs’ place of business, and requested them to discount two notes upon which the firm were indorsers. Plaintiffs agreed to discount the notes, provided they would purchase some Sumatra tobacco. Jacob Labe described the transaction as follows :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-3" data-blocks='[["BL_38.3",38,[247,381,1169,298]]]'>
      <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>“ A. Jacob Wisler came to our place of business in Philadelphia, at No. 231 and 233 North Third street. Mr. Wisler had two notes which he wanted us to discount; one note was of L. F. Burroughs, Freeport, Illinois, and the other note was that of the J. N. Ricksecker Cigar Manufacturing Company, Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-4" data-blocks='[["BL_38.4",38,[243,689,1173,1419]]]'>“ Q. Give the amount of the notes ? A. The Burroughs note was $1,100 and the Ricksecker $1,210. The Burroughs note had about sixty days to run and the other four months. We looked at the notes; I went and picked up the agency book of R. G. Dun and Bradstreet’s, both of which we have, and I found Mr. Burroughs rated, but did not find the Ricksecker Cigar Company’s name there at all; they were not in, and I told Mr. Wisler. Mr. Wisler saw us go to the books and I told Mr. Wisler that the Ricksecker Cigar Company was not rated. He says, ‘ Well, we are all right; ’ he says ‘ we are not very rich, but all our notes will be met at maturity.’ Then we studied over the matter awhile; we then told Mr. Wisler about a lot of goods that had got damaged in bond by water flowing over them by an overflow of a pipe; we showed Mr. Wisler samples of the sound goods, and Mr. Wisler looked at them ; finally he went down with me personally and examined these goods in bond, saw their condition, examined them and took several numbers of them, took perhaps half a dozen numbers of them, and then came up to the store. We agreed upon the price of it with the proviso that at first we wanted all the duty to be retained out of discount of these two notes, but afterwards it was agreed that $750 was to be retained to pay part of the duty on these goods, which was $1,034, — 517 pounds it weighed. Before the transaction was closed, Mr. Wisler went out several times and went up street and came back again, and finally closed the transaction in that manner; $750 was to be retained out of the discount of these two notes and the balance was to be paid in firm notes at four and five months.”</p>

Did he say that he wanted to buy tobacco ? A. I do not remember of his saying; no, sir. Q. Did your father ask him to buy tobacco ? A. After the conversation about the notes he asked him about buying tobacco; yes, sir. Q. He would not discount the paper unless he bought the tobacco ? A. That is <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>correct.” He further testified: “ Q. Do you not know that he* said, ‘ I must have the money, I do not want the tobacco, and I must hurry to catch the four o’clock train,’ and then finally said, ‘If you will agree to take $750 on account of this purchase out of the proceeds of the notes, we will call the transaction closed?’ A. I remember bim saying that if he would take $750 then the transaction would be closed. Then we would not agree to that, and he went to go out and we called him back and closed the transaction.”</p>

They alleged, and to maintain the issue it was necessary for them to show, that they had been induced to sell the tobacco to Wisler &amp; Whitman in the month of April, 1893, by fraudulent representations; and that upon the discovery of the fraud they had rescinded the contract and reclaimed the goods. The evidence however failed to disclose any trick, artifice, or false representations, made to induce the sale of the tobacco.
