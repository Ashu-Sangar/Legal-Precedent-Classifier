R. Noyes, his surety, was issued. The plaintiff filed a statement, in which, after reciting the bond, declares that the condition of said bond was broken by the constable in this, — that having an execution in his hands in favor of the plaintiff against one David Walters, dated Nov. 12, 1891, he made a levy upon certain articles of personal property, but did not sell said goods at public sale, nor did he summon three disinterested and competent persons to appraise the property levied upon, nor did he, on or before the return day of the execution, produce to the justice the receipt of the plaintiff, or make such other return to said execution as is sufficient and required by law, but on the 30th day of November, A. D. 1891, said constable made the following return to said execution, viz: ‘ Exemption claimed by wife of defendant and A. S. Walters and Girard Walters and C. R. Noyes, and indemnity refused by plaintiff.”</p>

To this the plaintiff’s counsel excepted on the ground that the return of the constable was conclusive, and could not be explained by parol testimony. If this position of plaintiff’s counsel is correct, and the court was in error in admitting said parol testimony, then the plaintiff has no case, and the return of the constable is conclusive that indemnity was refused by the plaintiff.] [8] But in our opinion the parol evidence was admissible to explain the return, and it was shown that the personal property which was levied upon <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>was claimed by A. S. Walters, Girard Walters and C. R. Noyes, and that the constable received written notices of these claims, which were exhibited in evidence on the trial. [After these notices had been served on the constable he demanded indemnity from the plaintiff before he would proceed to sell the property.] [9] This was refused and no bond of indemnity tendered or offered to the constable and the execution was returned without a sale. It was the duty of the plaintiff to have tendered or offered a bond of indemnity to the constable, before he could make him liable on his bond for refusing to make a sale.] [10] Without determining whether this case comes within the purview of the 6th section of the act of March 21, 1772, [we are of the opinion that our instruction to find a verdict for defendants was right and just, as it is an attempt to make an officer liable without any default having been shown.] ” [11]</p>
