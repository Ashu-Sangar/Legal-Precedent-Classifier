Lutz, who was a contractor. Lutz subsequently entered the employ of the Scranton Traction Company, as a conductor. Plaintiff obtained judgment before alderman Wright “for wages for manual labor,” amounting to $64.96. An attachment execution was then issued upon the judgment, summoning the Scranton Traction Company as garnishee. In answer to the interrogatories, the garnishee admitted that they had in their hands $41.91 belonging to Lutz, “ which indebtedness arose by reason of the employment by us ‘of said Oliver E. Lutz as conductor,” etc. Judgment was then entered by the alderman in favor of Frutchey as against the Scranton Traction Company for the amount admitted to be in their hands. Thereupon O. E. Lutz and the Scranton Traction Company sued out a writ of certiorari, directed to said aider-man, and upon argument the judgment against the garnishee was reversed, Edwards, J., filing the opinion of the court. Plaintiff appealed.</p>

There was therefore no error in reversing the proceedings against the garnishee. Neither of the assignments of error is sustained.</p>
