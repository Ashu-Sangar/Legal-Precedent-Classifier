At the point where he got on the caí-, two lines were running, one going out Walnut street arid one going out Northampton street. If a passenger took a Walnut street car, he was transferred without extra charge at Sixth street to a Northampton street car. Plaintiff alleged that when he got on the car, he told the conductor that he wanted to go out Northampton street, and that the conductor did not tell him that he was on the Walnut street car. He also alleged that <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>when the car arrived at the intersection of the lines, the conductor did not announce that passengers going out’Northamp- • ton street should change cars. The car upon which plaintiff was riding was a summer car. Plaintiff took a seat running lengthwise with the car, at the end near the conductor, who stood in an open space between two seats. According to the plaintiff’s testimony, when the car arrived at Sixth and Northampton streets it stopped and several people got off. A fellow workman of plaintiff got off, and plaintiff placed upon his shoulder some bundles and tools which they had with them, and he then picked up his own tools, together with a bag which he had at first put upon the shoulder of his companion and which the latter had declined to take and which the witness then placed among his own tools, put them under his arm and started to leave the car: While he was upon the footboard of the car, and in the act of leaving the car it started, and he said to the conductor, “I am not going out Walnut street.” The conductor then rang the bell to stop the car, and plaintiff by a jolt or jerk was thrown off the car.</p>
