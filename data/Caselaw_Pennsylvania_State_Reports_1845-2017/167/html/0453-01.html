Bond, the proponent and the original contestant, was a druggist. He lived with his mother in a house of which he was the owner, at the southeast corner of Tenth and Locust streets, in this city. He had built this house many }mars before, and one or more of the lower rooms were occupied as his store or place of business. The decedent, whose mother was a sister of Mrs. Bond, was born in England, but came to this country when very young and became a member of the family of his aunt. He was sent to school for some time, and afterwards was taken by Dr. Bond into the drug store and thoroughly instructed in that business. Dr. Bond, who married late in life, died in 18 — , <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>leaving a widow and three children — James, William- A. and Kate Bond, minors, of whom James, the eldest, was then about -years of age.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b477-6" data-blocks='[["BL_477.5",477,[201,889,1168,646]]]'>“ He seemed to have looked upon Dr. Bond as his benefactor, and always attributed his success in business and his prosperity to him. In November, 1870, while Dr. Bond’s children were still in their minority, he executed a will giving his property to them in equal shares. It is under this will that William A. Bond claims the right to contest the will now in controversy. In July, 1883, Dr. Knight executed a second will, by-which he gave his estate to the mother of his former beneficiaries, who, in the meantime, had become the wife of M. J. Mitcheson, Esq. In January, 1887, Mr. Mitcheson being then dead, he executed the present will, the reasons which induced his change of intention being set forth in the testimony of Mr. Mellors., by whom the will was drawn.</p>

Though he became an American citizen, he seems to have retained many of the ideas and peculiarities of an Englishman of the class to which he belonged. He was old fashioned in his notions and in his habits. In his early life he was not allowed to associate with persons of his own age or to mingle with society, and his devotion was- to his business. As a natural consequence, when among strangers, he was very sly, awkward and ill at ease, though in his house where he had spent his whole life, he was playful and unrestrained, especially when surrounded, as he generally was, by persons much younger than himself. lie cared little or nothing for his personal appearance. His dress was adapted more to comfort than to elegance, and was made to fit very loosely because of a physical trouble (hernia) which caused him great suffering. He was not at all particular about keeping either his face or hands clean, and <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>their condition as well as that of his clothing indicated in a striking way the nature of his daily avocation. He was very kind to the poor and to those requiring assistance, and few who applied to him representing that they were distressed went away empty handed, though his gifts of this character were never extravagant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b478-4" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[256,695,1162,696]]]'>“ He was a bachelor, and after Dr. Bond removed from the house, a Mrs. Lowry came with her family to reside with him and remained until her death in 1886, and in the fall of that year Mrs. Atwood, or Mrs. Addy as she then was, took her place, bringing with her her mother and her daughter, Emily Gertrude Addy (on whose behalf the petition to intervene has been filed), then a child of about nine years of age. Mrs. Atwood testified that Mr. Addy, her first husband, was a nephew of Dr. Knight, that he was lost at sea in 1883, and that after she became a widow Dr. Knight showed great interest in and provided for her. She was then boarding with her sister, Mrs. Clara Collins, at whose house Dr. Knight called soon after hearing of the death of Mr. Addy. Mrs. Collins saw him then for the first time.</p>

During the first part of this period, Dr. Knight provided everything required for the family and paid all expenses; afterwards she became the wife of Albert F. Atwood, who also became aninmate of the household. How much lie contributed in the way of support does not appear. It was probably not much, as he was an invalid for two or three years after his marriage.</p>

Addy, or directly interested in having the will set aside; one was a physician who met Dr. Knight on a single occasion several years after the execution of the will; two had been in his employ, one as an errand boy and the other as assistant in the store; another had sold shoes to him ; two others had dealt with him in business, and the others were neighbors, one of whom (Andrew Gillespie) testified strongly in favor of his capacity, and the others said nothing that in the least impugned it.</p>

      <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>“ In view of the fixed and incontrovertible fact that during all the time it is sought to have it believed that Dr. Knight was incapable of taking care of himself and disposing of his property, he was actually carrying on a business requiring the possession of the very qualities of mind which are alleged to have been wanting, it is difficult to treat with seriousness the testimony offered by the contestants. He started life, it would seem, without a dollar, and by his business ability, his industry, his frugality and his sound judgment as to investments, acquired the estate (estimated at $45,000 to $50,000) which has induced this contest. He gave personal attention to his business almost to the day of his death, and during all of the time covered by the testimony he took care not only of himself but of many of those who now assert his imbecility.</p>

Mc-Clennan (page 149-150), a clerk or salesman in a shoe store, whose reason for any opinion he might have upon the subject was based largely upon the fact that in summer Dr. Knight bought wool-lined shoes, several sizes too large, which he never laced up, while in the spring he would ‘ buy light colored shoes with rubber at the side, such as you might term a Romeo, and put them on and wear them and go out in the street and come back again and give us candy, buying maple sugar on the street, two or three cents a piece, and come in and give them to us.’ This witness was also one of those who testified that Dr. Knight ‘ was not able to carry on a sustained connected conversation.’</p>

But it appeared from the testimony of every one of these witnesses, in spite of any opinion so asserted, that Dr. Knight’s memory w'as wholly unimpaired, that he did take care of himself and his property, and that he was of extremely accurate business habits. It is true they said that he kept no books of account, at least, that <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>thej saw none; yet lie always remembered what his securities were, where they were kept, when they fell due, and where to go to collect them. He had his box in the Fidelity Company, and always attended in person to looking after its contents. He sometimes paid small bills in small installments, taking the money as it came into the store; but he always remembered to pay them ; never forgot what part had been paid, and never offered to pay a second time after payment in full.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b481-5" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[184,773,1161,453]]]'>“ This last statement is not quite correct; there was one occasion, only one, when he did offer to pay a second time. A sister of Mrs. Attwood, Mrs. Collins, for a year or more, about three years before his death, did his washing (for it seems he did have washing done, notwithstanding what the witnesses, many of them relations or connections of the laundress, say to the contrary), and once when he had paid her for a week’s wash he afterwards offered payment a second time to her husband. The bill, it is probable, was not a very large one.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b481-6" data-blocks='[["BL_481.5",481,[186,1234,1160,606]]]'>“ One of the reasons stated by Mrs. Collins for her opinion as to the testamentary capacity of Dr. Knight, and his ability to take care of himself was, that when he called at her house, soon after the death of Mrs. Attwood’s first husband, to see her (Mrs. Attwood), he made a second visit in the course of a short time, bringing with him for her ‘ a second-hand picture and soup ladle; ’ but, as Mrs. Attwood, one of the witnesses most relied on by the contestants, makes no reference to this occurrence, it is fair to assume that the incongruity of the gift was less real than apparent. The picture appears to have had some merit, as it is still preserved after a lapse, of ten or twelve years.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b481-7" data-blocks='[["BL_481.6",481,[189,1848,1160,549]],["BL_482.1",482,[272,370,1155,400]]]'>“ There was no evidence whatever of undue influence, and Mrs. Attwood, whose testimony shows that Dr. Knight’s memory was unimpaired almost to the day of his death, shows very strikingly the groundlessness of the assertion that he was easily persuaded to dispose of his property. A month or two before he died, she says (page 40) : ‘ I put the question to him as to how much he was worth, and I never knew until that time; and he said about $45,000.’ She often spoke to him about making a will, and urged the claims of her daughter, Emily Gertrude Addy, and of herself. The daughter appears to have been still more importunate. Her aunt, Mrs. Braker, who tes<a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>tified in her behalf, says: ‘ Gerty used to say, “ Now, uncle, I think you are awful mean, not to have those papers fixed.” There was a life insurance she always understood she was to have — the doctor’s life insurance. He would say, “ Hush, hush! I will have that all right!”’ It is evident that all of this was long after the will now in controversy, and it is evident, also, that no doubt was entertained at that time upon the subject of the testator’s competency to dispose of his property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[271,779,1155,344]]]'>“It is proper to notice that, although Mr. William A. Bond was called to testify in his own favor, he gave no intimation of an opinion adverse to the capacity of Dr. Knight to make a will; nor, though he had known him ever since he was born, did he state, nor was he asked to state, a single instance of irrationality or inability to take care of himself and his property.</p>

Many witnesses of the highest respectability and intelligence bore testimony as to the intellectual ability of Dr. Knight. Man)' of them were his neighbors and lifelong acquaintances, who had shown their confidence in the most practical manner by dealing at his store and having prescriptions for themselves and their families compounded by him in preference to his assistants. Among these witnesses were Major J. Lewis Good, a member of the board of health; Mr. Peter P. Breen, formerly acting treasurer of the mint; Coroner Ashbridge, Mr. John L. P. Wilson, Mr. Thomas S.

The language of the will was substantially that used by the testator himself, the reasons which induced it being then stated by him to Mr. Mellors. It was carefully read by him and deliberately executed in the presence of witnesses; and all of this occurred more than five years before his death, when he was not over sixty-eight years old, and when both his physical and mental condition was entirely unimpaired.</p>

Knight, deceased, and was regularly proceeded in before one of the judges of that court, who, upon consideration of the testimony introduced by the parties, came to the conclusion that there was practically no evidence of undue influence, and that the testimony relied on to prove want of testamentary capacity was quite insufficient to justify an issue. He therefore dismissed the appeals and ordered the record to be remitted to the register of wills. Exceptions to this action of the auditing judge having been filed, and duly considered by the court in banc, the same were dismissed and the decree was affirmed.</p>

All the questions that are worthy of consideration have been sufficiently noticed in the report and opinion above referred to. The learned auditing judge’s rulings on questions of evidence are substantially correct; and as to the effect of the testimony as an entirety, we fully concur in the conclusion, announced by the learned president of the. court below, wherein he says : “ The entire testimony is clear and satisfactory beyond a doubt that the testator, although eccentric, peculiar and slovenly in his conduct, conversation, personal habits and attire, was possessed of full testamentary capacitjq and in the disposition of his estate exercised his free, untrammeled will.” As we said in Pensyl’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/157/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="157 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="846589" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0465-01">157 Pa. 465</a>, viewing the testimony in its most favorable light, there is nothing in it that would warrant any jury in rendering a verdict against the validity of the will. The controlling' questions have been so fully considered by the court below that further comment is unnecessary. ■ '</p>
