In other words, the lease was for a term of one year, but the lessee had the option to terminate it sooner, by simply removing from the premises, and without notice to the landlord, and was only liable for the rent during the time he actually lived upon or used them. In deeds, as in wills, the intention of the parties is to be taken as the cardinal rule of construction, and, if this was the intention of the parties, it must control. But inasmuch as the lease contains all the requisites of a valid lease for years, including a term with a certain beginning and ending granted by the lessor to the lessee, and as the right of the tenant to <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>terminate it at his will is not given in express terms, but depends, at best, on implication, it will be necessary to examine the instrument as a whole before adopting the defendant’s interpretation. ‘ The intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the entire instrument, not from particular words or phrases without reference to the context, and the instrument shall operate according to the intention unless it be contrary to law: ’ Berridge v. Glassey, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20Pa.%20455" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="112 Pa. 455">112 Pa. 455</a>. A deed must be so construed, if possible, that no part shall be rejected: Tyler v. Moore, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Pa.%20387" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="42 Pa. 387">42 Pa. 387</a>; Watters v. Bredin, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20Pa.%20238" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="70 Pa. 238">70 Pa. 238</a>. ‘ The object of all constructions is to ascertain the intent of the parties, and it must have been their intent to have some meaning to every part. It never could be a man’s intent to contradict himself, therefore we should lean to such a construction as reconciles the different parts, and reject a construction which leads to a contradiction.’—Tilghman, C. J., in Wager v. Wager, 1 S. &amp; R. 374. Having these well understood principles in view, we think the covenant as to notice must have an important bearing on the interpretation of the clause under consideration. In Pennsylvania the tenant is not required to give notice of his intention to quit at the end of any quarter, or month, or year, as the term may be: Cook v. Neilson, <a href="/pa/10/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="10 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="962749" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0041-01">10 Pa. 41</a>; Brown v.

Whereas, if the landlord desires to regain the possession summarily at the end of the term he must give three months’ notice. Undoubtedly one purpose of this covenant was to put the landlord and the tenant on equal footing, so that the former should know a reasonable time before the end of the year whether he must seek another tenant, and the tenant should know whether he must seek another habitation. But nothing could be more absurd than a covenant that if either party desired to terminate the lease at the end of the term he must give the other party three months’ notice prior thereto, and that in default of such notice the lease should continue upon the same terms and conditions for another year, if the parties had supposed that they had already provided that the lessee could terminate the lease at any time, without notice of any kind. If he had a right to terminate it at any time during the term, a fortiori he had a right at the end of the term, and hence the covenant, so far as binding the lessee was concerned, was of no effect. This cannot be what the party intended.</p>

      <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>“ The rule of construction which attaches more relative importance to the written than to the printed part of a contract, is often a very useful one, and is recognized in many of our cases: Grandin v. Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/107/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="107 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="8856143" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0026-01">107 Pa. 26</a>; Haws v.

But neither this rule, nor the rule that every man’s grant is to be taken most strongly against himself, relieves the court from the duty of reconciling the different parts of the contract if it can reasonably be done. And, where the interpretation and effect of the written portion are themselves in question, the other portions of the contract, although printed, cannot be disregarded. The lessee’s option to terminate the lease at any time during the term by simply removing from the premises is not expressly given, it is sought to be implied from a written clause, which, even standing by itself, would not necessarily have that meaning, and therefore, in determining what the meaning of the parties was, it is proper to consider the agreement as to notice, and our duty to endeavor to reconcile and harmonize all the provisions of the lease. Furthermore, the agreement as to notice is not wholly printed, and the blanks are filled in writing in such a manner as to indicate that the parties understood its provisions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.4",628,[242,1440,1165,961]],["BL_629.1",629,[181,363,1171,504]]]'>“ But, it is argued, that there is no other possible construction that will give meaning to the words ‘ the same to be paid monthly in advance so long as he shall occupy the said house and lot of ground,’ except that which the defendant puts upon them. We are unable to assent to this. It seems to us that the parties had in view precisely what was provided for in the agreement as to notice, namely, a possible continuance of the lease beyond the term specified in the habendum, and intended to provide that the lessee should pay the same rent, in the same way, so long as he should continue to be the tenant of the premises. Such a provision might be unnecessary, but it was not absurd. The defendant construes the word ‘ occupy ’ to mean actual use of the premises, as a residence or as a place to store his goods. It is by no means clear that, even giving to the word its most restricted meaning, the lessee did not occupy the premises during the whole year, for until the key was surrendered and handed to the landlord he could have returned: Carr v. Pier, <a href="/pa/69/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="69 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="1026480" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0326-01">69 Pa. 326</a>. If he had returned, would he not have been liable for the rent during the period of his absence ? <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>The tenant, though absent, is, speaking generally, the occupier of the premises, but a servant is not: Rex v. Poynder, 1 B. &amp; C. 178. But, without putting the decision on the narrow ground that the defendant did not surrender the key, we remark that the meaning of the word suggested by the defendant is one but not the only meaning in which it is used. ‘ In the primary and most familiar sense of the word “ occupy ” it is. the equivalent of the word “ possess.” It implies the conception of permanent tenure for a period of greater or less duration:’ Lacy v. Green, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20Pa.%20520" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="84 Pa. 520">84 Pa. 520</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[179,875,1171,1577]]]'>“ Lord Denman said: 4 The meaning of the word “ occupies ” may vary according to the occasion or the subject-matter. The meaning, therefore, which it has received in considering what occupation was necessary to constitute a mansion house in which burglary might be committed or to give a right of voting, or to make a party ratable to the relief of the poor, is no test of its meaning in this particular case: ’ Rex v. St. Nicholas, 5 B. &amp; Adol. 227. That the meaning of the word may vary according to the occasion, the subject-matter, or the context is shown in a number of decided cases. Two of these, which have come to our attention, seem to be in point. Where in a conveyance from A to B there was reserved to A the right ‘ to live in, inhabit, dwell in and occupy the said cottage with the appurtenances as he heretofore has done and now does, for and during the term of his natural life,’ it was held that an estate for life was reserved. Kenton, J., said: 4 If this question had depended on the first words of the proviso I should have thought they would have been satisfied by determining that only a liberty to inhabit the cottage was given to A; but the word occupy carries the interest reserved still further and shows that the whole estate was intended to be reserved to him:’ Rex v. Eatington, 4 T. R. 181. B guaranteed the payment of A’s rent 4 so long as said A shall occupy the premises.’ It was held that the word occupy was used not simply in the narrower sense of actual or personal occupancy, 4 but the larger sense of tenancy actually existing under the lease. Such use of the word is not uncommon:’ Morrow v. Brody, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20R.%20181" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="12 R. 181">12 R. 181</a>.
