He was examined on behalf of the defendant, and testified in substance that the resolution of July 16, 1890, was passed, and the 277 shares allotted to the shareholders, in order that they might transfer the entire 5000 shares if Hillam found a purchaser, and this course had been advised by the secretary of the company. The witness was asked to state the circumstances connected with the resolution, and in addition to the testimony just referred to, he set forth the way in which the company had acquired the 277 shares, but nowhere did he aver, as the answer had done, that they did not represent undivided profits. On the contraiy, it might not unfairly be inferred, from his testimony, that the company had <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>made, from time to time, loans of its moneys, the result of its business, to Susan V. Dock; and it was to discharge the indebtedness which thus arose that she transferred to the company the 277 shares. That the moneys for suchHoans were procured from its business, and were from its earnmgs* seems manifest from the testimony of Thomas C. Barr, the secretary of the company, and a member of the Philadelphia bar, also called on behalf of the defendant. He distinctly stated thatthe shares in question were ‘part of assets of the company’ and not ‘ treasury stock; ’ that he understooTtHey had been bought from the surplus fund of the company, and that he considered himself entitled as a shareholder to his proportion of these shares. It is therefore concluded, from the testimony of both the secretary and of the president of the defendant company, that its answer in respect to the assertion that the 277 shares did not represent undivided profits is so qualified that it loses its potency as a responsive pleading, and the resolution of July 16, 1890, averring that the shares represent undivided profits, stands uncontradicted; and it is concluded the company obtained these shares in discharge of a debt to it, which arose from its loan of earnings to Susan Y. Dock. It was urged that the loan of money in this way was ultra vires; this was not shown. The charter did not prohibit it; and, as a business corporation, the power of loaning, though less frequently exercised, may be as needful in the prosecution of its undertaking as that of borrowing. A corporation has the right to acquire stock of its own, where the transaction is not prohibited by statute, is bona fide et sine malo ingenio: State Bank v. Fox, 3 Blat. C. C. Rep. 431; Bank v.

To illustrate, there would be such a right if the company deposited the moneys to pay the dividends with a banker and drew its check to the order of each entitled on the fund so deposited, or, in <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>the case of a stock dividend if the company executed its power of attorney to transfer and these awaited delivery. But no such or similar step was taken in this case and it is concluded the plaintiff did not have the vested right claimed. It is believed that when there has been no such appropriation as that above mentioned, a company by its board of directors in a proper case and for cause may rescind a resolution declaring a dividend; as where owing to destruction of plant by fire immediately following such resolution. If in the business and honest judgment of the board the earnings intended to_be_distributed should be recalled and used for the_restoration of the destroyed property, it would be within its power to so deal with them. .ITqt unless some similar thing appear the declaration of a dividencPot* earnings is the announcement of an obligation due each' shareholder for which proceedings may be had as_.legaOimthod^ .and'the burden of manifesting that the debt or obligation is not due after such a declaration is upon the company: Le Roy v.

But no ground there appears in justification of its purpose; it announced no reason whatever and not any has appeared. The alleged invalidity of the loans to Susan Y. Dock is a matter of evidence; they may or may not have been illegal, — in the absence of proof they will not be presumed to have been so. It is true no necessity was shown for receiving the 277 shares in discharge of the indebtedness due the company, but as it is in the usual course of affairs to accept the best form of property possible in payment of a debt, a fair presumption exists that these shares were of this character, and if they were no other necessity is requisite. It would have been eminently fitting for the board to undo by a later resolution an earlier one of irregularity, and the failure of the company to declare any dividend upon the 277 shares is some indication that it was inactive and treasury stock. But this is thought to be overcome by the testimony of the secretary of the company before referred to; and apart from this indication there is recalled nothing that manifested an irregularity.</p>

From this date to that of April 3,1893, when Susan Y. Dock assigned her shares to her son no demand was made for a certificate for the eighty-nine shares, the subject of her bill. The delay was a long one, and in a court of equity such a delay unexplained generally deters its action. Some excuse may have existed, inasmuch as the defendant made no objection upon this head. The master deems it expedient to do no more than to refer to it; and in like manner no more is done than to allude to the question of jurisdiction, since that was neither raised nor argued. For it may be that the eighty-nine shares are known by each party to be of an uncertain or contingent value, admitting of no just compensation in money; and that the parties deem the resolution of July 16, 1890, so wanting in definiteness as to time that its obligation could not be enforced at law.</p>
