Benjamin Shoemaker died March 23, 1891, and Thomas Beck died on August 22, 1892. The note was not entered of record in the prothonotary’s office during the lifetime of Benjamin Shoemaker, but was found among the papers of Thomas Beck after his death. Upon the back of the note were indorsed two payments, dated April 1, 1887; one of one hundred dollars, and another of ninety-eight dollars, as interest. Thomas Beck and Benjamin Shoemaker were for a number of years the owners of a farm as tenants in common. , Two daughters and two sons-in-law of Benjamin Shoemaker testified that, after his death, Beck called at the house of Mrs. Shoemaker in reference to the note, and that Mrs. Shoemaker then claimed that she had paid various bills for taxes, insurance, and repairs on account of the farm. They testified that Beck claimed that there was still sixty-seven cents due on the note which Mrs. Shoemaker then paid, and that Beck, not having the note with him, agreed to burn or destroy it.</p>

If this testimony is true, then this note was then and there settled and the plaintiffs would not be entitled to recover in this action. If you do not believe this to be true, and you believe there was no such conversation — no such settlement, or that the note that they then and there referred to was not this note, but some other note, and that the settlement that was then and there made was not the settlement of this indebtedness, but was a settlement of some other matter, then your verdict will be for the plaintiff for whatever you consider is due upon the note.</p>

The defendants’ sole contention was that by allowance of said credits, some of which were for payments made by Mrs. Shoemaker after her husband’s death, and by payment of the small balance claimed, the note was fully settled and paid; and, in support of that position, they relied on the testimony referred to. It presented a question of fact which was for the exclusive consideration of the jury, and they doubtless understood it correctly. There was no allegation, nor was there any attempt to prove payment and acceptance, from the maker of the note or his administrator, of any smaller sum than the amount actually due, in satisfaction of the note. Referring to the testimony as to what took place at the interview between Mrs. Shoemaker and defendants’ intestate, the learned judge rightly said to the jury: “If this testimony is true, then this note was then and there settled and plaintiffs would not be entitled to recover in this action. If you do not believe this to be true, and you believe there was no such conversation — no such settlement, or that the note then and there referred to was not this note, but some other note, and that the settlement then and there made was not the settlement of this indebtedness, but a settlement of some other matter, then your verdict will be for the plaintiffs for whatever you find due on the note.” This was substantially the only question submitted to the jury. There was no other question in the case. In view therefore of the testimony on which defendants relied, the charge cannot be regarded as misleading. In saying, by way of illustration, what is complained of in the second specification, the learned judge doubtless had in mind the facts of the case, as indicated by the defendants’ testimony, and meant a settlement, not with the maker of a note, but with a third party — such a settlement as that shown to have taken place between plaintiffs’ intestate <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>and Mrs. Shoemaker after her husband’s death. There is nothing else in the ease to which the language complained of could possibly apply.</p>
