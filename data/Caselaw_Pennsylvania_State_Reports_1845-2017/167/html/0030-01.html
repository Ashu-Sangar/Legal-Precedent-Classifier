The notes were drawn and witnessed by a justice ol the peace. Decedent requested the justice to keep the notes until he called for them, and if he did not call for them, that then the justice “should deliver them to the parties to whom they were given after his, decedent’s, death.” Decedent never called for the notes, and after his death the justice delivered them to the parties to whom they were made payable. One of defendant’s daughters testified that the testator had said to her that “ he had made out papers so that it would cover all his personal property after his death to go to his children.” He did not say, however, what kind of papers he had made. The only witness of the facts relating to the execution of the notes was the justice of the peace. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was insufficient to establish the testamentary character of the notes, and that their probate as codicils to testator’s' will was properly refused.</p>

By it he gave his wife Catharine precisely what she would have received under the intestate law. When he went to Solomon K. Hoffman on July 22, 1891, to have the papers written, he told him ‘to draw judgment notes’ payable one day after date, and to ‘ keep the notes until he called for them, and if he did not call for them,’ he ‘ should deliver them to the parties to whom they were given, after his death.’ It is manifest from his conduct that the decedent knew what he was doing on the 20th of September, 1878, when he made his formally executed will, and on the 22d of July, 1891, when he directed the drawing of, and duly executed, the seven judgment notes. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in either act, but on the contrary each is intelligently done with its appropriate legal formality. There is not a particle of evidence in the case to' show that the decedent intended the notes to be other than what they purport to be, obligations or evidences of indebtedness; and that they were accepted by the payees from Mr. Hoffman, as of that character, is shown by the fact that they presented them for payment at the distribution of the personal estate of the decedent. It is quite probable that the decedent thought it was immaterial to the validity of the notes as obligations, whether they <em>were </em>delivered in his lifetime or after his decease; and there is nothing in his conduct which shows that he intended them to operate in any other way than as judgment notes. While it is undoubtedly true that no particular form is necessary to a testamentary act, yet it is also true that all acts are not testamentary, and that where a decedent has done two acts, one of which is distinctively testamentary in form, and the other and later act is as distinctively non-testamentary in form, and is couched, with strict technical propriety, in the apt language of contract, there is no reason for holding the latter testamentary, without clear proof of fraud, accident, or mistake. In speaking of the cases where writings not in form testamentary have been allowed to have that effect, <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>it is said in 1 Williams on Executors, 141 (ed. 1877), that ‘ No case has gone the length of deciding that because an instrument cannot operate in the form given it, it must operate as a will. The true principle to be deduced from the authorities appears to be, that if there is proof, either in the paper itself or from clear evidence dehors, first, that it was the intention of the writer of the paper to convey the benefits by the instrument which would be conveyed by it, if considered as a will; secondly, that death was the event that was to give effect to it; then, whatever may be the form, it may be admitted to probate as testamentary. And there seems to be this distinction in the consideration, of papers which are in their terms dispositive, and those which are of an equivocal character; that the first will be entitled to probate, unless they are-proved not to have been written animo testanti; whilst, in the latter ’ (where, the writing is equivocal) ‘ the animus must be proved by the party claiming under them.’ And at p. 142, the author says:</p>

The court gave no reason for the ruling, but the reason probably was the rather equivocal character of the writing. The case does not show that the paper was ever established as a will. In Carey v. Dennis, a father executed two bonds in favor of his sons, and delivered them to a third party with directions ‘ to take care of them, and deliver them to the sons, <em>in case Tie died without a </em>will.’ Suit having been brought upon the bonds against the administrator, to enforce payment of them as obligations of the decedent, it was held that, not having been delivered to the sons by the decedent in his lifetime, they were not valid obligations. The court expressed the dictum that they were testamentary, because they were to operate only in case the father ‘died without a will.’ Admitting for the purpose of this case, that the bonds in Carey v. Dennis would, if the question had been before the court, have been held to be testamentary, the difference between the fact there and here is palpable. In that case the proof was ‘clear’ that the bonds were to operate only in case of the father’s death without a will; in other words, as, and in lieu of, a will; whereas here there is no proof that the notes were to be in any way dependent for their efficacy upon the death of the maker, either with or without a will.</p>

Testamentary intent is the very breath of life of a will, and, of course, must be established by two witnesses. In Hock v. Hock, 6 S. &amp; R. 47, Gibson, J., said: ‘Proof of execution must be made by two witnesses, each of whom must separately depose to all facts necessary to complete the chain of evidence, so that no link in it may depend on the credibility of but one. Where the evidence is positive, there can be no <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>difficulty, for the witnesses then attest the simple fact of execution itself; but where the evidence of one, or both, is circumstantial, each must make proof complete in itself; so. that, if the act of assembly were out of the question, the case would be well made out by the evidence of either. Circumstantial proof cannot, therefore, be made by two or more witnesses alternating with each other, as to the different parts of the aggregate of circumstances which are to make up the necessary sum of proof; the evidence of each not going to the whole.’</p>

There is but one witness, Solomon K. Hoffman, who testifies to any declarations of the decedent which certainly relate to the notes; the testimony of Mrs. Koller being so general as not necessarily to apply to them. She testifies that her father did not say that Hoffman had written the papers of which he spoke to her, and. did not say Hoffman had them; that her father did not say what kind of papers Hoffman had made, but said ‘I have made papers; ’ that he did not say that the widow was not to have any of the personal property, but did say that the papers ‘ would cover the personal property,’ and that the widow had plenty of income off the rest; and that he said that what was left of the personal property the children were to divide among themselves, and to see that the widow had plenty to live on. I do not see in the testimony of Solomon K. Hoffman any satisfactory evidence that the decedent intended that the operation of the notes should depend upon the fact of his death; and in this respect Mrs. Roller’s testimony is equally deficient. Besides, the declarations of the decedent to Mrs. Koller were so general that they neither identified nor sufficiently described the papers, to which he referred; and there is nothing in his declarations to her, not consistent with the writings themselves, regarded merely as judgment notes. Catharine Sunday, the widow, had lived with her husband, the decedent, for 25 years. <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>His will, which was proved before her death, gave her precisely what she would have received if he had died intestate. She seems 'to have known nothing of these notes when she died, and appears to have had no motive to refuse to take under the will, and to elect to take under the intestate law. If these' notes are established as codicils to the will of the decedent, her interest in the personal estate will be most materially affected. With such a result flowing from a decision admitting the notes to probate as testamentary, the evidence of their testamentary character should be clear.</p>
