This case is fairly ruled by Commonwealth v. Macferron, 152 Pa. 244; and by Quinn v. Cumberland County, 162 Pa. 55.

John Wunch et al., Commissioners of Berks County, Appellants.\nStatutes \u2014 Tax collectors \u2014 Repeal of statutes \u2014 Acts of March 18,1852, and June 6, 1893.\nThe act of June 6, 1893, P. L. 833, entitled \u201c An act to authorize the election of tax collectors for the term of three years in the several boroughs and townships in this commonwealth,\u201d repeals the local act of March 18, 1852, P. L. 153, relating to the collection of taxes in the townships of Longswamp and Bethel in Berks county.\nArgued March 5, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 95, Jan. T., 1895, by defendants, from order of C. P. Berks Co., Sept. T., 1894, No. 19, awarding a peremptory writ of mandamus.\nBefore Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for mandamus.\nThe facts appear in the following opinion by Endlich, J:\n\u201c The relator was, at the election of February 20,1894, elected tax collector of the township of Longswamp, under the act of June 6, 1893, P. L. 333. On March 12, 1894, he gave bond, with surety, duly approved by the court and filed. Thereupon he applied to the respondents, the commissioners of the county of Berks, for the tax duplicate for the state and county taxes collectible in said township, but was refused, upon the ground that, under the act of March 18, 1852, P. L. 153, a local law applicable to said township, the collection of said taxes is to be intrusted to the lowest bidder. Thereupon the petition was filed, upon which this rule was granted. The respondents, in their answer, aver that the relator\u2019s election was invalid, the act of 1852 not being repealed by the act of 1893. ... In principle that identical question has, since the argument, been decided by the court of C. P. of Dauphin Co., in Com. v. Middleton, 3 Dist. Rep. 639. The conclusion reached by it, to wit, that the act of 1893 repeals the numerous local laws inconsistent with it, is irresistible, perhaps even more obviously so in the case of townships than in that of boroughs. I know of nothing, however, that could be profitably added to what was said in the above case by the learned judge who delivered the opinion in it. I accept it as conclusive of'this case.\n\u201c The rule to show cause is made absolute.\u201d\nJUrror assigned was above order.\nWilliam J. HourJce, W. Oscar Miller, county solicitor, with him, for appellant.\nThe fact that the provisions relative to the appointment and collection of the taxes are different in the two acts does not raise an implication of intention to repeal: Erie v. Bootz, 72 Pa. 196; Bank v. Com., 10 Pa. 442; Brown v. County Com., 21 Pa. 37; Wright v. Vickers, 81 Pa. 122; Seifried v. Com., 101 Pa. 200; Osborne v. Everitt, 103 Pa. 421; Harrisburg v.
