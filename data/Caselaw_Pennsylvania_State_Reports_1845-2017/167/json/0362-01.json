The bridge was not built by defendant company, but by another railroad company. The learned trial judge rightly held that there could be no recovery against the defendant.\nThere is nothing in either of the specifications that calls for discussion. They are all dismissed and the judgment is affirmed.",

Central Railroad Co. of New Jersey.\nRailroads \u2014 Injury caused by construction of road \u2014 Lease\u2014Negligence.\nWhere injury to land is caused by the original construction of a railroad bridge, and not by the operation of the railroad over it, a company which leased the bridge after its completion, and operated the road, is not liable for the injury.\nArgued March 1, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 229, Jan. T., 1895, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Lackawanna Co., Sept. T., 1891,\n'No. 407, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for injuries to land. Before Edwards, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that plaintiff\u2019s land was injured by water thrown upon it from the Lackawanna river by reason of the defective construction of a railroad bridge. It appeared that the bridge in question was built by the Wilkes-Barre & Scranton Railway Company, and that after it had been fully completed and constructed it had been leased to the defendant, the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey. There was no evidence to show that the injury to plaintiff\u2019s land was in any way connected with the operation of defendant\u2019s railroad over the bridge. The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned, among others, was (4) in discharging rule to take off nonsuit.\nAaron A. Chase, for appellant.\nThe question of constructive notice to defendant, the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, to remove the obstructions from the river, should have been submitted to the jury: Jones v.
