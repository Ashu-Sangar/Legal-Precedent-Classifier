B.

That rule was made absolute, and hence this appeal, in which the sole question is whether the sheriff\u2019s return shows a \u2022sufficient service of the writ. The learned judge rightly held that the service was insufficient because it was not made on the \u201c president or other principal officer, or on the cashier, treasurer, secretary or chief clerk \u201d of the corporation defendant, as required by the act of June 13,1836, section 41.

J., Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nRule to strike off judgment.\nJenkins, J., filed the following opinion:\n\u201c This was a rule to set aside the sheriff\u2019s return and strike off the judgment entered against the defendant. The return of the sheriff is: \u2018 Served the Blue Mountain Manufacturing Company, a corporation under the laws of Pennsylvania, by giving, June 22, 1893, a true and attested copy of the within writ to D. B. Fisher, general manager of the said company and making known to him the contents thereof.\u2019 The defendant is a corporation under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania. It did not do any business in this county, nor have any property here. Its principal office, at the time of the issuing of the writ in this case, was at Tamaqua, Pennsylvania. The action was in assumpsit. The service of a writ against the defendant within this county for such an action would, therefore, under the act of June 13, 1836, sec. 41, P. L. 579; Br. Pur. Dig. 427, pl. 122, have to be made upon the \u2018 president or other principal officer, or on the cashier, treasurer, secretary or chief clerk \u2019 of the corporation. The person referred to as the \u2018 president or other principal officer \u2019 we understand to mean the chief executive officer of the corporation, though called president, chairman, or by any other title.\n\u201c Under the act of March 17, 1856, P. L. 388, Br. Pur. Dig, 428, pl. 128, \u2018When any action is commenced by any person against any corporation in any county in which the property of said corporation was wholly or in part situated, it shall be lawful, if the president, treasurer, secretary or chief clerk do not reside or cannot be found in such county, for the sheriff, or other officer to whom any process may be directed, to serve the same on any manager or director in such county.\u2019 The words \u2018 manager \u2019 or \u2018 director \u2019 used in this act and also in the acts of March 21, 1842, P. L. 145, and March 15, 1847, P. L. 361, are synonymous and mean one of the body of persons appointed pursuant to the charter or by-laws of the corporation to manage its affairs, the acts of the individuals not binding the corporation except when acting as a body. The return in the present case shows that the writ was served upon Daniel B. Fisher, \u2018 general manager.\u2019\n\u201c The return does not set out that Daniel B. Fisher is the \u2018 principal officer \u2019 of the corporation, nor does it set out facts which show that a service upon a \u2018 manager \u2019 would be good. Even where the property of a corporation is wholly or in part in the county, the only cases, except in suits by the commonwealth, in which the writs can be served upon the \u2018 manager \u2019 or \u2018 director\u2019 are where the president, treasurer, secretary or chief clerk, do not reside or cannot be found in the county, and the sheriff\u2019s return must so show: Gilbough v. Keller, 3 W. N. C. 78; Hunt v. Association, 17 W. N. C. 423; Insurance Company v. Fuller, 81 Pa. 398. We therefore consider that the sheriff\u2019s return in this case shows no sufficient service. If the return shows a defective service, it should be set aside: Winrow v. Raymond, 4 Pa. 501. There was no appearance for the defendant and judgment was entered against it for want of an affidavit of defense. As defendant was not in court, such judgment is void, and should be stricken off: Insurance Company v. Fuller, supra. The rule is therefore made absolute.\u201d\nJError assigned was above order.\nFrancis Chapman, of Chapman Chapman, for appellant, cited:\nAct of June 13, 1836, P.
