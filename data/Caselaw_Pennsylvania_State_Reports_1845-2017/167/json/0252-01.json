Foran, Appellant.\nEvidence \u2014 Competency of witness\u2014\nIn an action of trespass by an administrator against a sheriff to recover damages for an alleged wrongful sale of goods belonging to the estate of the decedent, a person who has signed the bond to indemnify the sheriff against loss by reason of the sale, has an interest adverse to the decedent, and is incompetent to testify as to matters occurring prior to the decedent\u2019s death.\nArgued March 20, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 387, Jan. T., 1895, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Susquehanna Co., Aug. T., 1888, No. 58, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass against sheriff to recover damages for an alleged wrongful sale of personal property. Before Archbald, P. J.\nAt the trial, it appeared that the defendant on April 2,1888, sold a large quantity of personal property as the property of Joseph R. Kyte. The property in question was on a farm belonging to the estate of Hannah Kyte, deceased, mother of Joseph R. Kyte. After the levy, and prior to the sale, H. D. Kyte, administrator c. t. a. of Hannah Kyte, deceased, claimed the property as belonging to the estate of the decedent. The plaintiff in the execution gave the sheriff an indemnifying bond with T. W. Kyte as surety. The sheriff then sold the goods.\nThe evidence showed that Joseph R. Kyte lived on the farm owned by his mother, but the evidence was conflicting as to whether he carried it on for his own benefit, or for hers.\nWitnesses testified to declarations made by Joseph to the effect that the property belonged to his mother. Opposed to this, witnesses were produced who testified to the declarations of Mrs. Kyte, that the property was not hers and belonged to Joseph.\nWhen T. W. Kyte, a witness for defendant was on the stand, defendant\u2019s counsel made the following offer:\n\u201c We offer to prove by the witness on the stand the conversations of Hannah D. Kyte in which she has admitted that the title to the personal property on the farm was in Joseph R. Kyte.\u201d\nMr. McCollum: We object that the witness is incompetent to testify to anything that occurred during the lifetime of Hannah D. Kyte.\nMr. Ainey: And in which the source of title was described by her and admitted to be in Joseph R Kyte. Objected to, same as before.\nThe Court: It seems to me that the interest of the witness on the bond given to indemnify the sheriff would be adverse to Mrs. Kyte and therefore the case would fall within the exclusions of the statute.\nObjection sustained. Defendant excepts. Bill sealed for defendant. [1]\nThe court under objection and exception admitted evidence of the declarations of Joseph R. Kyte. [4-7]\nThe court submitted the whole case to the jury.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $400. Defendant appealed.\nJErrors assigned among others were (1, 4-7) rulings on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions.\nWm. JD. B. Ainey, Searle McCollum and J. M. Kelly with him, for appellant\nKyte was a competent witness: Act of May 23,1887, sec.V, (e), P. L. 159; Dixon v. McGraw, 151 Pa. 100; Spott\u2019s Est., 156 Pa. 282; Wolf v. Carothers, 3 S. & R. 240; Smith v. Hay, 152 Pa. 383.\nDeclarations against interest are to be taken as true, and construed most strongly against declarant: Gabler\u2019s App., 5 Cent. 314.\nA. H.
