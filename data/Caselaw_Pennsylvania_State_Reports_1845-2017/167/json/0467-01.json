The bar of the statute had therefore closed on the claim before it was presented for participation in the fund for distribution. Aside from the circumstances attending the alleged indebtedness, the fact that for several years the testator stood in loco parentis to appellant, the staleness of the claim, etc., \u2014 all of which were calculated to render its original validity at least doubtful, \u2014 the testimony relied on by appellant was too vague and uncertain to remove the bar of the statute. The court was therefore right in concluding that if appellant ever had a valid unpaid claim against his benefactor it was barred by the statute. For reasons given by the learned auditing judge the claim was rightly excluded from participation in the fund for distribution.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.",

    "head_matter": "David Taggart\u2019s Estate. Samuel Ferguson\u2019s Appeal.\nStatute of limitations \u2014 Decedent's estate \u2014 Claim for services.\nA claim against a decedent\u2019s estate is barred by the statute of limitations where it appears that the services were rendered more than five years prior to the decedent\u2019s death, and more than six years prior to the filing of the executoi-\u2019s account.\nAside from the bar of the statute of limitations, the claim will not be allowed where it appears that the decedent had assumed the position of parent to claimant when the latter was a mere child, had sent him to school, and, finally, had given him a position as bartender; and where it appears that claimant had made no demand upon decedent in his lifetime for wages; and where the witnesses, produced by claimant to prove declarations made by decedent that he owed money to claimant, differed widely as to the amount.\nArgued April 1, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 181, Jan. T., 1895, by Samuel Ferguson, from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., July T., 1894, No. 214, dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nBefore Stereett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nThe auditing judge, Ashman, J., found the facts to be as follows:\n\u201c Samuel Ferguson presented a claim of $4,000 for services to the decedent, as bartender, from 1884 to 1888. To take the demand out of the statute certain declarations of the decedent were given in evidence by which, according to one witness, the decedent said, sometime in 1893, that he intended to set the claimant up in business and to pay for his license, because he owed the claimant about $2,000. Two other witnesses deposed to the same declaration, except that the acknowledgment of the indebtedness was for $3,000 or $4,000. The undisputed testimony was that the decedent had taken care of the claimant when the latter was a mere child; had sent him to school, and had afterwards employed him to do odd chores about the tavern, and had finally placed him behind the bar as bartender. During the five years which intervened between the date at which the claimant left the service of the decedent, and the date of the decedent\u2019s death, the claimant, so far as was shown, made no claim for wages and no demand for payment. The reported declarations of the decedent, varying as they did with the different recollections of the witnesses, will not avail to overcome the presumption which custom has raised, that the claimant received periodical wages \u2014 a presumption which his own conduct unquestionably strengthened. The claim is rejected.\u201d\nExceptions to the adjudication were dismissed by the court without an opinion filed.\nError assigned was in rejecting claim of Samuel Ferguson.\nThomas R. Elcoclc, for appellant, cited,\nSwires v. Parsons, 5 W. & S. 357; Neal v. Gilmore, 79 Pa. 421; Weil\u2019s Est., 36 Leg. Int. 286.\nJohn H. Sloan, John T. Murphy with him, for appellee, cited:\nMueller\u2019s Est., 159 Pa. 592; Coulston\u2019s Est., 161 Pa. 151; Carpenter v. Hays, 153 Pa. 432; Webb v. Lees, 149 Pa. 13.\nApril 22, 1895:"
