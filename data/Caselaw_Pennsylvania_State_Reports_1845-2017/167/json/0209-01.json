    "head_matter": "Paul Smith v. Easton Transit Co., Appellant.\nNegligence\u2014 Contributory negligence \u2014 Street railways \u2014 Passenger alighting from car.\nIn an action by a passenger against a street railway company to recover damages for personal injuries, the question of defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence is for the jury, where the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff, though contradicted, shows that the car in which plaintiff was riding stopped at a point where passengers were transferred to another line which plaintiff wished to take, and that, gathering up some tools which he had with him, he started to leave the car; that he had reached the footboard of the car and was about to step off when the car started; that he said to the conductor, \u201c I am not going out this street,\u201d and that the conductor then rang the bell to stop the car, when the plaintiff by a jolt or jerk was thrown off the car and injured.\nArgued March 11, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 198, July T., 1891, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Northampton Co., Feb. T., 1894, No. 14, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrbtt, C. J.,\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries before Reeder, J.\nAt the trial, it appeared that plaintiff boarded one of defendant\u2019s cars in South Easton, desiring to go out Northampton street in Easton. At the point where he got on the ca\u00ed-, two lines were running, one going out Walnut street arid one going out Northampton street. If a passenger took a Walnut street car, he was transferred without extra charge at Sixth street to a Northampton street car. Plaintiff alleged that when he got on the car, he told the conductor that he wanted to go out Northampton street, and that the conductor did not tell him that he was on the Walnut street car. He also alleged that when the car arrived at the intersection of the lines, the conductor did not announce that passengers going out\u2019Northamp- \u2022 ton street should change cars. The car upon which plaintiff was riding was a summer car. Plaintiff took a seat running lengthwise with the car, at the end near the conductor, who stood in an open space between two seats. According to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, when the car arrived at Sixth and Northampton streets it stopped and several people got off. A fellow workman of plaintiff got off, and plaintiff placed upon his shoulder some bundles and tools which they had with them, and he then picked up his own tools, together with a bag which he had at first put upon the shoulder of his companion and which the latter had declined to take and which the witness then placed among his own tools, put them under his arm and started to leave the car: While he was upon the footboard of the car, and in the act of leaving the car it started, and he said to the conductor, \u201cI am not going out Walnut street.\u201d The conductor then rang the bell to stop the car, and plaintiff by a jolt or jerk was thrown off the car.\nTestimony on behalf of the defendant tended to show that plaintiff stepped off the car while it was in motion.\nDefendant\u2019s point, among others, was as follows:\n\u201c 5. That under the law and the evidence, the verdict must be for the defendant. Answer: That point I cannot affirm but submit the question, gentlemen of the jury, to you for your determination.\u201d\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for 1766. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was above instruction, quoting it.\nE. C. Stewart, H. J. Steele with him, for appellant.\nThe burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to establish the negligence of the defendant, causing the injury, either directly or by circumstances attending the injury, from which it can be fairly and reasonably inferred that it was caused in some way by the means of transportation : Herstine v.

R. 128; Highland Ave. R. R. v. Burt, 13 L. R. A. 95; W. & G. Street R. R. v. Harmon\u2019s Admrs., 147 U. S. 571; Mulhalo v. B. C. R. R., 30 N. Y. 370; Leggett v. R. R., 143 Pa. 39; Penna. R. R. v.
