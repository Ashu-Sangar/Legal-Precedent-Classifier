There was no error in holding that the 30th section of the act of 1851, under which this proceeding was had, was not repealed by the acts of 1879 and 1883. They may well stand together.

Plymouth Township\u2019s Appeal.\nBoroughs \u2014 Annexation of territory \u2014 Grand jury \u2014 Challenge.\nA grand juror is properly excluded from participation in proceedings to annex territory to a borough, where it appears that he has interests in the borough, and where he states to the court under oath that he is opposed to the annexation, and that he had -previously declared that he would do all that he could against it.\nBorough\u2014Annexation of territory\u2014Acts of April 3,, 1851, section 30, June 11, 1879, and May 17, 1883\u2014Statutes\u2014Repeal.\nThe act of April 3, 1851, sec. 30, P. L. 327, relating to the annexation of territory to boroughs, was not repealed by the acts of June 11, 1879, P. L. 150, and May 17, 1883, P. L. 36.\nArgued April 15, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 413, Jan.

J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for annexation of a portion of Plymouth township to Plymouth borough.\nFrom the record it appeared that when the grand jury was prepared to investigate the case, counsel for petitioners challenged the right of R. N. Smith, one of the grand jurors, to sit during the investigation. Mr. Smith was called to the bar and admitted that he lived in the borough, that he was the owner of rented property in the annexed district and was agent for his father, who also owned property in the same place. He also under oath stated, that he was opposed to the annexation and had said to others he would do all he could against it because it \u201c did not take- in enough territory.\u201d\nThe challenge was sustained, and Mr. Smith was not permitted to sit in the case.\nThe proceedings were under the act of April 3,1851, see. 30, P. L. 327.\nThe grand jury reported in favor of the proposed annexation.\nExceptions to the report of the grand jury were dismissed in an opinion by Lynch, J.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing the exceptions to the report of the grand jury.\ntr. L. Halsey, B. B. Jones with him, for appellants.\nSmith was improperly excluded as a juror: Com. v. Bradney, 126 Pa. 199; In re Pottstown Borough, 117 Pa. 538; Scranton v. Gore, 23 W. N. C. 419; Rolland v. Com., 82 Pa. 306; Gearhart v. Jordan, 11 Pa. 326; Kennedy v. Dale, 4 W. & S. 176.\nThe act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 327, sec. 30, under which these proceedings were had, was repealed so far as it applies to the annexation, of territory contiguous to boroughs, by the act of June 11, 1879, P. L. 150: Com v. Weir, 165 Pa. 284; Com. v. Schneipp, 36 W. N. C. 102; act of May 17, 1883, P. L. 36.\nB. L. Oreveling and J. Q.

Com., 23 Pa. 12; Allison v. Com., 99 Pa. 17; act of April 16, 1840, P. L. 411; People v. Damon, 13 Wend. 351; Silsby v. Foote, 14 How. 218.\nThe proceedings were properly under the act of 1851: McFate\u2019s App., 105 Pa. 323; In re Pottstown Borough, 117 Pa. 538; Camp Hill Borough, 142 Pa. 511; In re Pittston Borough, 3 Kulp, 297; Devore\u2019s App., 56 Pa. 163; Tunkhannock Borough Extension, 3 Pa. C. C. 480.\nImplied repeals are not favored, and where both acts can stand together the latter does not abrogate the former: Erie v. Bootz, 72 Pa. 196; Hand v. Fellows, 148 Pa. 456; Hanover Borough\u2019s App., 150 Pa. 202; Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes, 156; Brown v. County Commissioners, 21 Pa. 37; Street v. Com., 6 W. & S. 209; McCool v.
