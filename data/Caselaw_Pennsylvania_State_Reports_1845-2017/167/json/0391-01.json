    "head_matter": "James Talcott v. John B. Brenniser et al., Appellants.\nEvidence \u2014 False representations \u2014 Sale.\nOn the trial of an issue to determine the ownership of goods, where it appears that the goods had been deposited'with defendant by a vendee of the plaintiff as collateral security for an antecedent debt, and plaintiff claims that he made the sale in consequence of false representations made by the vendee, the testimony of a confidential clerk of the vendee as to the true state of his employer\u2019s business is admissible to establish the falsity of the representations upon which the sale was made.\nArgued March 25, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 108, July T., 1894, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 4, Phila. Co., Dec. T., 1891, No. 757, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nReplevin.\nFrom the record it appeared that the ground of the replevin was that the goods in question had been purchased from the plaintiff by the firm of Nowell & Presby, of New York city, and that this purchase had been induced by the fraud and deceit of Nowell & Presbjr, who thereafter consigned the goods to defendants as collateral security for an antecedent indebtedness, owing the defendants from Nowell & Presby.\nThe representations upon which the sale was made were contained in a statement made by Nowell & Presby, to a mercantile agency. To establish their falsity, Lester J. Blauvelt was called on behalf of plaintiffs, and testified that he had been in the employ of Nowell & Presby for about seven years, and was familiar with their business and their books; that he had been employed by the assignee of Nowell & Presby, as air expert, and had made up a statement of the condition of the business of Nowell & Presby. Under objection and exception, the following testimony of Blauvelt was admitted :\n\u201c Q. State what the total nominal assets and actual assets of Nowell & Presby at the time it failed were, as obtained by you from the result of this investigation made. A. Nowell & Pres-by\u2019s liabilities, at the time of their failure, amounted to \u00a7383,415.74. The following is a statement of their nominal and actual assets:\nNominal. Actual.\n\u201c \u2018Merchandise, furniture, real estate, etc. $46,817 99 $29,124 19\nCash and checks .... 4,350 83 4,850 33\nBills receivable..... 1,400 39\nMining stocks, etc..... 718,983 00 600 00\nBook accounts..... 89,678 96 19,042 69 \u2019 \u201d\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for \u00a77,683.60. Defendants appealed.\nError assigned was ruling on evidence as above, quoting the bill of exception.\nJosiah JR. Adams, Samuel JB. JEEuey with him, for appellants, cited:\nOil Co. v. Gilson, 63 Pa. 152; Water Co. v. Stewartson, 96 Pa. 438; Coyle v. Com., 104 Pa. 131.\nFrederic R. Kellogg, John S. Freeman and John F. Keator with him, for appellee.\nApril 8, 1895:"
