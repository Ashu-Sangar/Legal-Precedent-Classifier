    "head_matter": "George M. Frutchey, Appellant, v. O. E. Lutz, Defendant, and Scranton Traction Company, Garnishee.\nAttachment execution\u2014 Wages \u2014 Judgment.\nMoney due by a street railway company to a conductor for wages is not attachable even on a judgment based on a claim for wages.\nArgued Feb. 26, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 25, Jan. T., 1895, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. Lackawanna Co., March T., 1894, No. 350, reversing proceedings of alderman on certiorari.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCertiorari to judgment of alderman, O. B. Wright.\nFrom the record it appeared that plaintiff worked as a carpenter for defendant, O. E. Lutz, who was a contractor. Lutz subsequently entered the employ of the Scranton Traction Company, as a conductor. Plaintiff obtained judgment before alderman Wright \u201cfor wages for manual labor,\u201d amounting to $64.96. An attachment execution was then issued upon the judgment, summoning the Scranton Traction Company as garnishee. In answer to the interrogatories, the garnishee admitted that they had in their hands $41.91 belonging to Lutz, \u201c which indebtedness arose by reason of the employment by us \u2018of said Oliver E. Lutz as conductor,\u201d etc. Judgment was then entered by the alderman in favor of Frutchey as against the Scranton Traction Company for the amount admitted to be in their hands. Thereupon O. E. Lutz and the Scranton Traction Company sued out a writ of certiorari, directed to said aider-man, and upon argument the judgment against the garnishee was reversed, Edwards, J., filing the opinion of the court. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was order reversing the proceedings.\nCharles W. Dawson, for appellant.\nThe act of April 15,1845, P. L. 459, extended the jurisdiction of aldermen'and justices of the peace to attachments, etc., but in the fifth section of the act appears the following proviso: \u201cProvided however, that the wages of any laborers, or the salary of any person in public or private employment, shall not be liable to attachment in the hands of the employer.\u201d The rule which, it seems, governs the interpretation of this proviso is, that \u201c Acts which establish monopolies, or confer exemptions and privileges, eorrelatively trenching on general rights, are subject to the principle of strict construction: Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, 349, 186; Rue v. Alter, 5 Denio (N. Y.), 119; Chapin v. Fersse, etc., Works, 30 Conn. 461; Rheeling\u2019s App., 107 Pa. 161; Womelsdorf v. Heifner, 104 Pa. 1; Roberts v. Yarboro, 41 Tex. 449; Endlich on Int. of Stat. sec. 264, 265; Perry County v. Jefferson County, 94 Ill. 214; Cooley\u2019s Prin. Const. Law, 313.\nIf it should be determined that the proviso exempts all wages from attachment, even when such attachment is founded on a judgment obtained for manual labor, then we contend that the following acts of assembly extend the jurisdiction of aldermen and justices of the peace: Act of May 17, 1888, P. L. 34; act of March 4, 1887, P. L. 4.\nThis appeal will lie: Act of April 15, 1845.\nNo argument was offered or paper-book filed for appellee.\nApril 8, 1895:"
