Only a few of the gallimaufry of errors requiring reconsideration are discussed in my dissenting opinion of November 18, 1978, joined by Mr. Justice Larsen. Petitioner’s Application raises several strong and compelling reasons for reargument:</p>

This Court’s decision in the present case represents the first time in Pennsylvania jurisprudence that an antenuptial agreement was used to defeat the clear <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>intent of the decedent with regard to the disposition of his estate.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.4",661,[209,423,1084,412]]]'>2. This Court’s decision in the present case misapprehends prior controlling decisions of this court requiring that a party to an antenuptial agreement be able to act with ‘intelligence and proper apprehension,’ and this Court’s decision in the present case also misapprehends the record with regard to the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement involved here.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[212,860,1082,143]]]'>3. This Court’s opinion in the present case misapprehends the record with regard to the evidence of a contract to make a will.</blockquote>

This Court’s opinion holding that appellant is barred from testifying under the Dead Man’s Act is inconsistent with this Court’s opinion of October 27, 1978, in <em>In re Estate of McClain, </em>[<a href="/pa/481/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="481 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="1747272" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0435-01">481 Pa. 435</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="481 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="1747272" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0435-01">392 A.2d 1371</a> (1978)] which holds that all parties claiming the property of a decedent, whether by will or by operation of law, are competent to testify under the Dead Man’s Act.</blockquote>
