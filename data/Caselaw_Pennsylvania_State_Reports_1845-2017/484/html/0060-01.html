In <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth Court applied <em>Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority’s </em>discussion of the “political subdivision” exemption and concluded that PGW, “which consists only of a collection of real and personal property,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> is not a “political subdivision.”</p>

Here, too, it must be concluded that, in exempting “political subdivisions” from the Liquid Fuels Tax Act, the Legislature intended to exempt an integral part of a political subdivision. PGW is owned by the City of Philadelphia. As Judge Crumlish <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>observed, “the creation and operation of PGW is outlined in the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter . . . which interweaves PGW within the fabric of city government.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> The Commonwealth stipulates that the City is a political subdivision, and nothing in the Liquid Fuels Tax Act suggests that the tax exemption is not applicable where, as here, the fuels subject to tax are used by City-owned vehicles in a utility operation designed to service its citizens and municipal interests as well as to provide revenue for the City.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[303,765,1151,1082]]]'>The Commonwealth urges that the agreement between the City and United Gas Improvement Company, in effect during the period the Board refused to refund taxes, creates a landlord and tenant relationship, under which United Gas Improvement “as lessee obtained possession and control of all of the Philadelphia Gas Works property with the City as lessor retaining a reversion at the termination of the lease.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> It is true that the writing setting forth the parties’ agreement contains a section headed “Lease Agreement to Operate Gas Works; Delivery of Possession and Control.” But the parties agreed not that United Gas Improvement would pay the City rents, but rather the City would pay United Gas Improvement a fixed managerial fee for its services, with the City receiving net revenues. The agreement of the parties provided for the operation and management of PGW, and the “lease agreement” section merely authorized use of necessary City-owned property. Cf. e. g., <em>Bowman v. Bradley, </em><a href="/pa/151/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="151 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="836662" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0351-01">151 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20A.%201062" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="24 A. 1062">24 A. 1062</a> (1892) (where possession of property is dependent upon performing employment contract, possession is not pursuant to a lease, but part of employment contract).</p>

The <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>alleged technical defect could easily have been corrected in the proceedings before the Board. It would appear, however, that the Commonwealth did not raise this contention. PGW filed its appeal from the Board to the Commonwealth Court on July 1, 1974. Under then-applicable Rules of Commonwealth Court, “[t]he parties shall be stated in the caption as they stood upon the record of the court or administrative agency below at the time the appeal was taken . . ..” Commonwealth Court Rule 20B, abrogated, Pa.R.A.P. 5103 (effective July 1, 1976), replaced, Pa.R.

And our Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a challenge to a party’s capacity to sue is waived unless raised in a timely fashion. <em>Erie Indemnity Co. v.

    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[295,454,1150,932]]]'>Were we to accept the Commonwealth’s view that only “distributors” may petition for refunds of liquid fuels taxes erroneously paid, or that fuels must first be delivered to the United States government, we would impute to the Legislature the principal intent to accord “political subdivisions” an exemption from taxation and, at the same time, restrain these subdivisions in any effort to recover taxes erroneously paid. Moreover, it is possible that in doubtful cases political subdivisions would be reluctant to pay liquid fuels taxes. We must, of course, assume that the “General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.” Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1) (Supp.1978). It must be concluded that the Legislature intended to permit a subdivision directly to petition for a refund of taxes where the subdivision claims the burden of taxation was erroneously imposed.

      <p id="b168-7" data-blocks='[["BL_168.7",168,[322,1663,1119,585]]]'>The promulgated regulations provide for a one year statute of limitations on claims for refunds. The Fiscal Code, § 503(a), 72 P.S. § 503(a), on the other hand, provides that, except in certain circumstances not apposite here, “[a]U such petitions for refund must be filed with the board within two years of the payment of which refund is requested, or within two years of the settlement in the case of taxes or bonus, whichever period last expired . . .” The Commonwealth contends that the one year statute of limitations set forth in the regulation governs. For statutory support, the Commonwealth points to another part of Section 17 of the Liquid Fuels Tax Act, 72 P.S. § 261 lq, which provides that “[e]very such claim shall be made annually for the preceding year.” We agree, however, with PGW that the Commonwealth reads this part of Section 17 out of context. The disputed part of Section 17 establishes a mechanism for “reimbursements” of taxes on liquid fuels used in certain machinery.</p>

    <p id="b169-10" data-blocks='[["BL_169.10",169,[170,1780,1148,564]]]'>The majority justifies a denial of interest payment on the basis that Philadelphia Gas Works voluntarily paid the taxes. This is irrelevant. The fact remains that the government has had the use of the taxpayer’s money since 1970. The result of paying interest is especially required in light of our abolishment of sovereign immunity. <em>Mayle v.

Since we have held that the government enjoys no special immunities from negligence, there is no further reason to hold the government immune from paying interest in this case.</p>
