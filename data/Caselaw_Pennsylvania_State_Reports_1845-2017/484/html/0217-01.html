    <p id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.4",323,[211,686,1148,845]]]'>Viewed in this light, the record reveals the following: On July 22, 1973, Waldman and fellow members of the Breed Motorcycle Club attended a memorial service at the Hillside Cemetery in Abington Township, Montgomery County. At 5:30 p. m., approximately twelve cyclists and three passengers exited the cemetery and proceeded north on Easton Road along with a pick-up truck and an automobile. Subsequently, Waldman and fellow Breed cyclists, along with the pick-up truck, stopped for a red light at the intersection of Easton Road and Moreland Road. A lone cyclist and a female passenger, travelling in a south bound lane of Easton Road, were stopped for the same red light. The operator of the motorcycle in the south bound lane, later identified as Michael Trunk, was a former member of the Breed Motorcycle Club but, at that time, an active member of the rival Pagan Motorcycle Club.</p>
    <p id="b323-6" data-blocks='[["BL_323.5",323,[213,1551,1147,795]],["BL_324.1",324,[246,307,1144,86]]]'>A number of Breed cyclists crossed over into the south bound lanes of Easton Road in an attempt to encircle the lone motorcycle. Trunk and his passenger, Debra Trezona, recognized the approaching cyclists as members of the rival Breed. Trunk then accelerated through the intersection despite the red light and fled south on Easton Road. Some, perhaps all, of the Breed cyclists pursued Trunk and Trezona at speeds reaching sixty-five to seventy miles per hour. In an attempt to elude the pursuing Breed cyclists, Trunk veered to his right and drove through a gasoline station located on the northwest corner of Easton Road and Brook-dale Road. As Trunk’s motorcycle reached Brookdale Road, which is approximately 1.22 miles south of Moreland Road, a single gunshot was fired from the midst of the pursuing cyclists. The bullet grazed Trezona’s helmet and struck <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>Trunk’s head above and behind his left ear. Moments later, Trunk died.</p>
    <p id="b324-4" data-blocks='[["BL_324.4",324,[245,444,1147,669]]]'>Immediately, two Breed cyclists approached Trunk’s downed motorcycle. One of the approaching cyclists, who “sort of look[ed] like [Waldman],”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> was operating a cranberry red motorcycle and was accompanied by a female passenger having light brown shoulder length hair and wearing a light blue sweater. This cyclist, after ordering another Breed cyclist to take Trunk’s “colors,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> demanded Trezona’s “colors.” After a third demand by this individual, Trezona removed her “colors” and threw them on the cranberry red motorcycle. After securing both the victim’s and Trezona’s “colors,” the operator of the cranberry red motorcycle and his female passenger, in the company of two other cyclists, headed north on Easton Road.</p>

They subsequently stopped for a red light at the intersection of Easton Road and York Road. This intersection is approximately 1.4 miles from the scene of the shooting. Moments later, this same group of cyclists traveled north on Mill Road. Mill Road connects York Road with Easton Road.</p>

While three or four of the motorcycles were being serviced, some Breed cyclists dismounted and walked around the premises of the gasoline station. Waldman and a female passenger rode his motorcycle to an area which was about five feet from a metal trash dumpster located at the rear of this gasoline station.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Subsequently, the police searched this metal trash dumpster and recovered a revolver which was ultimately identified as the source of the bullet which fatally wounded Trunk.

This intersection is approximately 1.1 miles from the gasoline station where the Breed cyclists had their motorcycles serviced. When a police vehicle approached Waldman, he executed a sharp U-turn onto one of the southbound lanes of Easton Road. A high-speed chase ensued. Waldman was eventually placed under arrest when he stopped his dark red or maroon motorcycle about one hundred yards south of the intersection of Hatboro Pike and Easton Road. When arrested, Waldman had a darker complexion than at trial; stood five feet nine inches in height; and had long hair and <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>a slight beard.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Waldman was eventually transported to the Abington Township Police Station.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

They were the same cyclists who had their motorcycles serviced at the gasoline station. Among the group detained at the Willow Grove Interchange were Waldman’s girlfriend, Susan Disario, and the President of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the Breed, Walter Carl Rehm, Jr. Disario, whose brown hair extended to the nape of her neck, was wearing a blue sweater over a shirt with a white background. At approximately 6:40 p. m., Trezona was transported to the turnpike interchange. After viewing the Breed cyclists, she indicated the cyclist who demanded and took both her and Trunk’s “colors” was not in the group. However, in a general way, she identified all of the cyclists who were detained at the interchange as having been at the scene of the shooting. The seven cyclists and two female passengers were eventually escorted to the Abington Township Police Station.</p>

At the same time, twelve members of the Breed Motorcycle Club, a rival motorcycle club stopped for a red light travel-ling in a northerly direction on Easton Road. Members of the Breed Motorcyclists crossed over into the south bound lane. Michael Trunk then accelerated through the intersection and continued south. A single shot was fired from the midst of the pursuing cyclists which hit Michael Trunk and resulted in his death. From these facts and from other circumstantial evidence produced at the trial, the majority says “it is convinced” that the “quality and quantity” of the evidence is sufficient to find murder in the first degree.
