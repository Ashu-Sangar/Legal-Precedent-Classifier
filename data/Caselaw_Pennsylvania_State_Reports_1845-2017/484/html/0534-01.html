The record establishes that appellant might have been exculpated by proof that his brother Alphonso was guilty of the crime of which appellant was accused. An attorney effectively representing Alphonso might well be obliged to give Alphonso advice inconsistent with appellant’s best defense. It is thus clear that the interests of the brothers were directly opposed and that representation of both by the same counsel, the Philadelphia Public Defenders, constituted a conflict of interest raising the possibility of prejudice to appellant. Although it is immaterial whether appellant was actually harmed by advice to Alphonso, e. g., <em>United States ex rel. Sullivan v. Cuyler, </em><a href="/f2d/593/0512-02" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="593 F.2d 512" data-case-ids="517580,517651" data-case-paths="/f2d/593/0512-02,/f2d/593/0512-01">593 F.2d 512</a>, 519-520 (3d Cir. 1979),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> the record supports the conclusion stated by the plurality that a Public Defender advised Alphonso not to confess to the crime despite his willingness to do so.</p>

The Commonwealth never claimed that both brothers, rather than only one, were involved in the criminal activity with which appellant was charged. Thus it was clear from the outset that if one brother were found guilty, the other would be exculpated <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>and not brought to trial. That any advice given to Alphonso might have been successful in protecting him does not negate, but ráther emphasizes, the existence of a conflict whose potential effects might have continued throughout appellant’s trial.</p>

The plurality correctly concludes that a Public Defender undertook to give advice to Alphonso. Thereafter, representation of appellant by a Public Defender was ineffective. Appellant’s conviction must be reversed and the case must be remanded for a new trial at which appellant may be represented by effective counsel unburdened by any conflict.</p>

At appellant’s first trial, the circumstances surrounding Alphonso’s purported willingness to confess to the crimes and his subsequent refusal to do so were fully disclosed to the jury. Assuming that Alphonso persists in his refusal to incriminate himself, appellant will be in substantially the same position at his new trial as he was at his first trial, and no doubt appellant will once again introduce the same evidence concerning the above circumstances. The grant of a new trial is, therefore, a futile gesture which wastes precious judicial resources.</p>
