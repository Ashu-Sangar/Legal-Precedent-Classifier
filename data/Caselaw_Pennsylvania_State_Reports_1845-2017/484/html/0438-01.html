(Slip opinion, p. 3). On direct examination of a key prosecution witness the assistant district attorney elicited testimony on the photographic display issue, and therefore the trial judge should have allowed defense counsel to introduce the photographs for the purpose of impeaching the prosecution’s eyewitness. This refusal by the trial judge usurped the jury’s function, which is to resolve issues of credibility.</p>
