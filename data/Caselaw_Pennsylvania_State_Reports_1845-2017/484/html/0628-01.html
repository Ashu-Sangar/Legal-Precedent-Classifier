Hess, Inc., (Hess), against appellee, Hazle Township. Appellant alleged that it had not been paid for over 6,000 tons of gravel delivered to the appellee and used in the construction of township roads during August, September, and October of 1966. The complaint alleged that payment for the gravel in the amount of $23,528.75, plus interest, was due under an agreement existing between appellant and the appellee. Alternatively, the appellant sought recovery on a quasi-contract basis seeking restitution to prevent unjust enrichment of the appellee. The trial court awarded judgment on the contract for $350, but denied any relief on the quasi-contract claim. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed. 9 Pa.Cmwlth. 409, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20404" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="305 A.2d 404">305 A.2d 404</a> (1976).

Appellant was the successful bidder at a unit price of $3.50 per ton. Subsequently, during the summer of 1966 appellee requested and appellant delivered over 6,000 tons of gravel. Upon the advice of the appellee’s solicitor, the appellee refused to pay for the gravel. Essentially, payment on the contract has been refused because of the significant difference between the amount of gravel specified in the advertisement — 100 tons, more or less, and the amount actually requested — over 6,000 tons. Because of this significant discrepancy, the trial court and the Commonwealth Court concluded that the gravel delivered could not come under the contract calling for 100 tons, more or less.</p>

Cases which have denied recovery on a quasi-contract basis have done so, not because such recovery cannot be had against a municipality as it can against an individual, but for other overriding reasons. In some cases, because the municipality or an agency of a municipality had no authority to legally contract in the first place for the benefit received, the court concluded that had there been a contract, it would have been <em>ultra vires, </em>either beyond constitutional or statutory authority. <em>Kreusler v.
