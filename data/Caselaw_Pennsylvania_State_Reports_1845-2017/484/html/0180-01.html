    <p id="b282-6" data-blocks='[["BL_282.5",282,[285,464,1147,1566]]]'>Appellant, Milton James, was convicted of murder in the first degree on October, 1969. Post-verdict motions were denied and the judgment of sentence was affirmed by this Court. <em>Commonwealth v. James, </em><a href="/pa/450/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="450 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1947023" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0052-01">450 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20762" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="296 A.2d 762">296 A.2d 762</a> (1972) (three justices dissented concluding that the appellant had not been adequately informed of his constitutional rights). In October of 1973, appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The petition was denied without an evidentiary hearing and the order was affirmed on appeal in February of 1975. In November of 1975, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act. In that petition he claimed that counsel in his previous appeal to this Court had been ineffective for failing to raise the alleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel. In that PCHA petition appellant also, presented facts concerning the alleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel. Following an evidentiary hearing, the PCHA court concluded that “serious questions” had been raised concerning trial counsel’s effectiveness and that counsel should have presented these issues in appellant’s original appeal. According to the PCHA court, appellate counsel’s failure to do so constituted ineffectiveness of counsel entitling the appellant to a new appeal before this Court. Except for stating that “serious questions” were raised, the PCHA court did not finally determine the issue of trial counsel’s effectiveness, stating that the issue was reviewable in the new appeal being granted to appellant. This appeal from the original judgment of sentence then followed.</p>
    <p id="b282-7" data-blocks='[["BL_282.6",282,[287,2075,1146,261]]]'>Following the PCHA court’s order, the prosecution filed a cross-appeal contending that the order granting appellant a new appeal was improper. We will consider the questions raised by both appeals. Throughout this opinion the word “appellant,” however, refers to Milton James.</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.3",283,[169,300,1147,468]]]'>
      <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>The prosecution first contends that the PCHA court’s order was improper because a trial level court should not decide whether an attorney rendered effective assistance of counsel in an appeal before this Court. We reject this argument as we have previously. Although disagreeing on other issues, five members of this Court agreed in <em>Commonwealth v. Sullivan, </em><a href="/pa/472/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="472 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1727761" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0129-01">472 Pa. 129</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="472 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1727761" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0129-01">371 A.2d 468</a> (1977), that a trial court does have the authority to determine appellant counsel’s effectiveness and grant a new trial if necessary.</p>
    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.4",283,[171,787,1150,1008]]]'>The prosecution also contends that the PCHA court erred when it concluded that appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel in his original appeal to this Court. The prosecution argues that appellate counsel’s decision not to raise the ineffectiveness of trial counsel had a reasonable basis to effectuate the interest of appellant because appellant had a second avenue of appeal via its PCHA petition. The prosecution argues that since our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Dancer, </em><a href="/pa/460/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="460 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="482887" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0095-01">460 Pa. 95</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="460 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="482887" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0095-01">331 A.2d 435</a> (1975) <em>requiring </em>appellate counsel to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness was decided after this , appellant’s first appeal, that appellate counsel cannot be held ineffective for failing to raise a claim which was not then required. This argument ignores the fact that appellate counsel is <em>required </em>to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness, or waive this claim, by the Post Conviction Hearing Act which was effective in 1966, long before appellant’s first appeal or even his trial. Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, § 1 et seq., 19 P.S. § 1180-1 et seq. (Supp.1978-79).</p>

Glover and Lee began to argue and, after Glover refused to leave, Lee grabbed a kitchen knife and pursued Glover out of the apartment and into the street. While Glover was shouting insulting epithets, appellant, who had followed Lee, grabbed the knife from Lee and chased Glover down the street. Glover, who had been brandishing bricks, picked up a bottle and turned toward appellant. Glover swung the bottle at <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>appellant and a fight ensued, with the two rolling about on the ground. Glover’s bottle was broken either immediately before or during the fight. Glover died as a result of knife wounds inflicted by appellant during this fight, and appellant was arrested the next morning. At trial, the prosecution attempted to show that appellant stabbed Glover because he was jealous of Glover’s relationship with Lee. Appellant testified that he was a homosexual but denied any motive of jealousy. He contended that he acted in self-defense.</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[290,830,1162,462]]]'>Appellant raises several issues in support of his claim that trial counsel was ineffective, among them that his trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to certain comments made by the prosecution during the trial. We agree. Because we agree that appellant is entitled to a new trial on this issue, we need not consider the other contentions raised by appellant which include the retroactive application of recent décisions concerning the burden of proof of self-de- , fense and the involuntariness of appellant’s confession.</p>
    <p id="b284-6" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[306,1312,1146,357]]]'>Although appellant has called to our attention various examples of alleged improper prosecutorial comment during the trial, it is necessary now to note only the more blatant improprieties in order to illustrate that irrelevant prejudicial matters were improperly injected into appellant’s trial by the prosecuting attorney.

The claim is meritless. In 1970, this Court, although not for the first time, made it clear “that the prosecuting attorney enjoys an office of unusual responsibility, and that his trial conduct should never be vindictive or attempt in any matter to influence the jury by arousing their prejudice.” <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Toney, <a href="/pa/439/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="439 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1931018" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0173-01">439 Pa. 173</a>, 180, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20732" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="266 A.2d 732">266 A.2d 732</a>, 736 (1970).
