On January 25,1974, at approximately 9:25 a. m., an automobile in which appellant was riding was stopped for a traffic violation. The police officer observed appellant alone in the rear seat of the automobile, attempting to conceal a revolver. The officer then retrieved the weapon, a loaded .32 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson. Appellant was arrested on a weapons charge. He was then transported to the police station at Twentieth and Federal. Shortly thereafter, appellant was moved to the South Detective Division at Twenty-fourth and Wolf Streets. He was again moved to the Homicide Unit at the Police Administration Building, arriving at 11:12 a. m.

Appellant waived his rights and agreed to make a statement. This interrogation, and statement lasted until 3:17 p. m. Appellant disavowed any knowledge of the Middleton homicide and stated that he was at his girlfriend’s home, in bed. He also stated that Carol Chandler, his girlfriend, her mother, and a Mr. Gardner were also present in the house. He went on to discuss his unsuccessful attempt to secure a prescription for a cough syrup. He stated that he did not leave his girlfriend’s house until 8:45 or 9:00 a. m., approximately forty-five minutes to one hour after the Middleton homicide.

The police then conducted a second interrogation, which lasted until 7:20 p. m. Appellant’s statement that was reduced to writing Was in all important aspects completely consistent with his previous denials of complicity. Appellant unequivocally stated that he was not at the scene of the Middleton shooting, and that at the time of the shooting, he was at 1225 Bainbridge Street, his girlfriend’s home, which he did not leave until 8:45 to 9:00 a. m. He did admit that he was a member of a gang known as “Black Brothers, Inc.” (BBI), and that BBI was presently “warring” against the 19th Carpenter Street Gang. The purpose of the “war” was the secession of certain BBI members. Subsequent questioning occurred, but no statements were given to the police.

The only new information which appellant gave was that he was a member of BBI and that BBI was at war with the 19th Street Carpenter Gang.
