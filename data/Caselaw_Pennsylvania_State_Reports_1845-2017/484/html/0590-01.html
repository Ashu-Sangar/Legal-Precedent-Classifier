The police arrived at the address given to them by appellant and found appellant at the scene with the two bodies. Appellant was taken by the police to two hospitals for the treatment of a laceration on his right hand. Following his discharge from the second hospital, appellant was arrested at approximately 7:30 a. m. of the same day (September 30) and taken to homicide headquarters for questioning. The testimony of several doctors who treated appellant at the hospital, and of Detective Winston and Sergeant Gibbons who accompanied appellant to the hospitals, establishes that appellant was emotionally upset, nervous, highly agitated and distraught during this period of time. At 8:30 a. m., appellant was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights which he waived. However, because of his emotional condition appellant was not questioned at that time. His condition was continually observed by Detective Winston who testified that appellant appeared to be calming down at 10 a. m. (when he was given cigarettes) and calmed down even <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>more so at 12:40 p. m. (when he was given lunch, taken to the restroom and given a “nerve” pill which he requested).</p>
    <p id="b695-5" data-blocks='[["BL_695.4",695,[205,443,1146,922]]]'>At 3 p. m., appellant had finally calmed down to a state which would permit the police to question him. Detective Richardson again read appellant his rights which were again waived. In addition to waiving his rights, appellant stated: “When I’m good and ready I’ll tell you. There’s a thing behind it and I’m not ready to tell you, but when I’m ready I’m going to tell you.” At this time, appellant was alert, normal and responsive. He talked for one and one-half hours about his personal background, never mentioning the incident before Detective Richardson ended the interrogation. Appellant was given dinner at 6 p. m. and another “nerve” pill at 6:30 p. m. At 7 p. m., Detective Richardson re-entered the room and asked appellant if he was ready to talk. Appellant proceeded to give the incriminating statement which was recorded by the police and then signed by appellant at approximately 9:45 p. m. Appellant was arraigned at 1:40 a. m.</p>

We agree. The preliminary arraignment required by the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure is a procedure designed to inform the accused of the nature of the charges against him and to protect the accused’s right to counsel, right to bail and his right to a preliminary hearing. <em>See Commonwealth v. Tingle, </em><a href="/pa/451/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="451 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1948602" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0241-01">451 Pa. 241</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20701" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="301 A.2d 701">301 A.2d 701</a> (1973) and Pa.R.Crim.P. Rule 140 (formerly Rule 119). The preliminary arraignment would be reduced to a meaningless ritual if the accused were to be arraigned at a time when his condition would significantly impair his comprehension of the nature of the charges and his understanding of his rights. Therefore, we hold that a period of delay attributable to an accused’s impaired mental or physical condition, which condition renders him <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>incapable of benefiting from the protections the preliminary arraignment was designed to afford, is necessary, and such period is to be excluded when determining whether a statement was obtained as a result of an “unnecessary delay.” We note that, in similar circumstances, the Superior Court has reached this same conclusion. <em>Commonwealth v. Bradwell, </em><a href="/pa-super/231/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="231 Pa.

Appellant informed police at 3 p. m. that he would talk about the incident, but first would prefer to give the police “background” information.

See, e. g., <em>Commonwealth v. Eaddy, </em><a href="/pa/472/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="472 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1727729" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0409-01">472 Pa. 409</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="472 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1727729" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0409-01">372 A.2d 759</a> (1977); <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/455/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="455 Pa. 569" data-case-ids="582023" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0569-01">455 Pa. 569</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20419" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="319 A.2d 419">319 A.2d 419</a> (1974). Nonetheless, the majority today concludes that because appellant was in a very emotional condition and did not respond to the initial police questioning in a coherent fashion, the first seven and one half hours of delay between arrest and arraignment was necessary. The majority prem<a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>ises this condition upon an unwarranted assumption that there is no purpose in providing an accused with a speedy preliminary arraignment when his emotional condition renders him according to the majority “incapable of benefitting from the protections the preliminary arraignment was designed to afford.” At 1260.</p>
    <p id="b698-5" data-blocks='[["BL_698.4",698,[245,658,1145,645]]]'>The very purpose of a preliminary arraignment is to insure that the rights of an accused are protected. At the arraignment the accused is informed by a neutral judicial officer of the nature of the charges lodged against him and also advised of his rights to counsel, bail and a preliminary hearing. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 140. Additionally, where, as here, the accused has not been arrested pursuant to a warrant, the preliminary arraignment serves as the forum where an independent review of the facts alleged to provide probable cause is made by a detached and neutral magistrate. <em>Commonwealth v. Eaddy, </em><a href="/pa/472/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="472 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1727729" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0409-01">supra.</a> See <em>Gerstein v. </em>Pugh, <a href="/us/420/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="420 U.S. 103" data-case-ids="11642843" data-case-paths="/us/420/0103-01">420 U.S. 103</a>, <a href="/us/420/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="420 U.S. 103" data-case-ids="11642843" data-case-paths="/us/420/0103-01">95 S.Ct. 854</a>, <a href="/us/420/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="420 U.S. 103" data-case-ids="11642843" data-case-paths="/us/420/0103-01">43 L.Ed.2d 54</a> (1975).</p>
    <p id="b698-6" data-blocks='[["BL_698.5",698,[245,1342,1145,535]]]'>The record clearly reveals that from 7:30 a. m. until 3:00 p. m., police did not provide for appellant’s arraignment. Appellant’s right to a prompt preliminary arraignment cannot be compromised as it was here merely because police were unable to interrogate him or obtain a confession. Indeed, the more distraught an accused may be, the more a prompt preliminary arraignment is necessary to insure that the accused’s rights are protected. It must therefore be concluded that the first seven and one half hours of delay were unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b698-7" data-blocks='[["BL_698.6",698,[244,1915,1147,424]],["BL_699.1",699,[197,304,1145,260]]]'>The Commonwealth has failed to justify any portion of the entire eleven and one half hour delay between appellant’s arrest and the obtaining of his inculpatory statement. During the interrogation that began at 3:00 p. m., seven and one half hours after his warrantless arrest and after police had determined appellant had “calmed down” and become “more coherent,” appellant told police he would tell them about the alleged homicides when he was ready. This was <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>in no sense a waiver of his right to a prompt arraignment. Nevertheless, police kept appellant in the same interview room for an additional four hours until 7:00 p. m. when, in response to police inquiries, appellant “said he was ready” and began his inculpatory statement.</p>
    <p id="b699-5" data-blocks='[["BL_699.4",699,[198,601,1145,472]]]'>It is obvious that there was no purpose for the entire eleven and one half hour delay other than to obtain a confession. Moreover, it is beyond doubt that the incriminating statement that police eventually obtained resulted from the eleven and one half hour delay. See <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/459/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="459 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="481072" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0171-01">459 Pa. 171</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="459 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="481072" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0171-01">327 A.2d 618</a> (1974). Appellant’s statement was therefore inadmissible into evidence. This ground alone mandates reversal and a remand for a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b699-6" data-blocks='[["BL_699.5",699,[196,1119,1149,1013]]]'>The majority also concludes that appellant knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights under <em>Miranda, </em>even though shortly before police informed appellant of his rights, they had, without medical supervision, administered appellant “nerve pills,” at appellant’s request. “[T]he defendant’s physical and psychological state” is a factor which must be considered in assessing a waiver of rights under <em>Miranda. Commonwealth v. Walker, </em><a href="/pa/470/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="470 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="1723809" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0534-01">470 Pa. 534</a>, 538, <a href="/pa/470/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="470 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="1723809" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0534-01">368 A.2d 1284</a>, 1287 (1977), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starkes, </em><a href="/pa/461/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="461 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="483653" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0178-01">461 Pa. 178</a>, 184-85, <a href="/pa/461/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="461 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="483653" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0178-01">335 A.2d 698</a>, 701 (1975). See generally, Kamisar, <em>Brewer v. Williams, Massiah, and Miranda: What is Interrogation? When Does it Matter?, </em><a href="/citations/?q=67%20Geo.%20L.J.%201" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="67 Geo. L.J. 1">67 Geo.LJ. 1</a>, 70 (1978). On this record, where appellant’s purported waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights followed his ingestion of “nerve pills” in the presence and under the direction of police officers, and the record does not reveal the effect of the pills upon appellant’s ability to intentionally, knowingly, and voluntarily relinquish his rights under <em>Miranda, </em>I would suppress appellant’s statement.</p>
