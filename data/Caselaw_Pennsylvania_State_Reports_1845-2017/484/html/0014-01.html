Appellant did not assert his right to a speedy trial until he moved for dismissal of the indictment for the first time on February 14, 1975, nearly six months after original counsel was replaced, approximately five months after the suppression hearing, and only a little more than two months before trial. Moreover, appellant has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the delay. Impairment of the defense at trial is the most crucial interest protected by the right to a speedy trial. <em>Barker v.
