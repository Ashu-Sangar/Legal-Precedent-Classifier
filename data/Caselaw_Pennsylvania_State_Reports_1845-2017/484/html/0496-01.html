    <p id="b597-13" data-blocks='[["BL_597.13",597,[188,1703,1148,461]]]'>Plaintiff-appellant, William Doner, began an action in trespass for damages resulting from personal injuries allegedly suffered in January of 1969, as a result of a fall on the premises of defendant-appellee, Jowitt and Rodgers Company [hereinafter: Jowitt]. The action was instituted by the filing of a summons in January of 1971. The complaint was filed in February of 1971. On February 1, 1974, Jowitt filed interrogatories addressed to Doner. Doner did not object to or answer the interrogatories.</p>

On <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>April 22, 1976, an interlocutory order was entered by the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia directing Doner to answer the interrogatories within thirty days or suffer a judgment of non pros.</p>

Otherwise, a judgment of non pros may be entered against [Doner].” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

On June 21, 1976, Kops again wrote Jowitt’s counsel confirming a telephone conversation of that date wherein an extension of an additional thirty days to answer the interrogatories was agreed upon.</p>
    <p id="b598-7" data-blocks='[["BL_598.7",598,[235,1509,1148,251]]]'>On August 12, 1976, Jowitt’s counsel filed and served on Kops a supplemental praecipe and certification of service of the interlocutory order.

The tender was refused. On August 30, 1976, a motion to remove the judgment of non pros was filed. Later, in a memorandum of law in support of the motion, counsel’s neglect in failing to answer the interrogatories was acknowledged, but it was urged Doner should not suffer because of counsel’s neglect.</p>

    <p id="b599-8" data-blocks='[["BL_599.8",599,[184,1745,1150,94]]]'>The argument made in connection with this issue was that the court abused its discretion in not granting the motion.</p>

    <blockquote id="AeQ" data-blocks='[["BL_599.11",599,[226,2080,1106,306]]]'>“A. Whether a county court may pass a local rule that is contradictory to rule of civil procedure No. 4019 promulgated by this Court, which delegates to a clerical employee without discretion for mitigating circumstances for the single extreme sanction of non pros for inadvertent failure of compliance of a discovery order.</blockquote>
