During the original jury charge, the court defined, <em>inter alia, </em>the various degrees of homicide. The court, however, did not use the term “malice.” The jury then retired to deliberate.

The court redefined the various degrees, again failing to use the term “malice” in any of its definitions. Following the supplemental instructions, appellant requested that malice be defined for the jury. The court refused and appellant now cites this refusal as reversible error.
