Postverdict motions were denied and .appellant was sentenced to a single prison term of ten to twenty years for the two murder convictions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> with a consecutive ten-to-twenty-year prison term on the burglary conviction.

There, the defendant was charged with numerous offenses arising from the same episode, two of which were murder and conspiracy. At a preliminary hearing on those two charges,- both were dismissed for want of evidence. The defendant, however, was continuously held on the remaining charges, was subsequently rearrested, and was charged again with murder and conspiracy. The defendant’s trial commenced within 180 days of the rearrest date but more than 180 days from the original arrest date. The court held <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>that under these facts, the defendant’s trial was not commenced within the time period prescribed by Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100, and, therefore, the defendant was discharged.

In the instant case, appellant could have avoided paying the costs involved on the second complaint. Dismissal of the charges, however, was not possible on the grounds urged by appellant and counsel was thus not ineffective for failing to file a motion to quash because of a violation of Rule 131(b).</p>

Specifically, appellant claims that all portions of the record dealing with the date of appellant’s arrest were changed from October 14, 1974 (the date on which appellant claims he was arrested) to October 15,1974. Appellant believes this to be significant because if, in fact, the arrest occurred on October 14, he was not afforded a preliminary hearing within ten days, as called for in Pa.R. Crim.P. 140(f)(1). All of the Commonwealth’s witnesses who testified concerning áppellant’s arrest stated that the arrest occurred on October 15. Appellant’s argument is thus without merit.</p>

Appellant’s claim is devoid of any support in the record, his claim is thus without merit.</p>

The facts are as follows. Appellant was arrested on October 15, 1974, with the 180-day time period expiring on April 13, 1975. On April 9, 1975, appellant moved for a continuance because his attorney was tied up with a two-week trial in Chicago. The court then explained to appellant that if the continuance was granted, he would not be tried within the time period called for by Rule 1100. Appellant told the court he understood and was willing to waive the right to be tried within 180 days. The court accepted appellant’s waiver and set the trial date for May 27, 1975. Further, on April 10, the Commonwealth petitioned for an extension of time pursuant to Rule 1100(c), alleging that despite all due diligence on the part of the Commonwealth, trial could not commence on or prior to April 13, 1975. The court granted the Commonwealth’s petition and extended time for trial until May 27, 1975. Under these facts, a motion to quash would have been fruitless and counsel was not ineffective for having failed to file the motion. See <em>Commonwealth v.

The facts are as follows. Following the homicides, police in Upper Merion were unable to come up with any suspects during their initial investigation. They first discovered four empty 7.65 cartridge cases. Sometime after the homicides, <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>they found a 7.65 millimeter Beretta automatic pistol in heavy brush, some three to four hundred yards from the scene of the shootings. An empty clip was found near the pistol. Ballistics tests revealed the gun to be the murder weapon. Further, the outside of the gun’s muzzle had been machined and threaded to accommodate a silencer. Further investigation inside the Maile residence by police turned up $15,000 in cash in a second floor closet. None of the aforementioned information was given to the news media which was covering the shootings.</p>

During a two-hour interview, the informant told Ferlick and O’Brien that an individual, Sigisfredo Ortiz, had admitted to him participation in the robbery. The informant further stated that an individual known only as “Cubano” was also involved. The informant then gave police information about the shootings that was known only by police and the perpetrators of the crime. The informant also told police that Ortiz lived at 1510 North 8th Street and . “Cubano” lived at the second floor apartment at 1513 North 8th Street, both in Philadelphia.
