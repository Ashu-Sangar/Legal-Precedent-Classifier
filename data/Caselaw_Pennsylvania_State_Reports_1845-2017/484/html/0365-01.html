Thus, continues the Commonwealth, as decedent was a volunteer, he was not in an <em>employment </em>situation and hence, was not covered by the Act. This argument fails because the word <em>“employment </em>” as used in the Act refers to the manner of death as opposed to the relationship of the fireman to those he serves or is answerable to. This is so as to preclude a fireman from recovering benefits from a fire that has nothing to do with his area of service (fireman’s house burns down and he dies as a result thereof while sleeping or a fireman dies while fighting a fire in another state or a fireman dies while viewing a movie when the theater burns down).</p>

At this point it is significant to point out that an ambiguity exists insofar as Section 101 of the Act employs the terms, “employment” and “contract of hiring,” (which may be interpreted to require pecuniary compensation), while Section 104 of the Act equates the generic term, “employe,” <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>with the generic term, “servant,” and states that the generic term shall <em>include </em>those who perform services “for valuable consideration . . . ” It is possible to read section 104 as intended by the legislature to mean that the term “employe” includes those who perform services <em>without </em>compensation as well. See Restatement, Second of Agency, § 16 (a master-servant relationship can exist despite the fact that it is not based on consideration).

The statutory language is unclear and ambiguous and creates substantial doubt as to the intent of the legislature.
