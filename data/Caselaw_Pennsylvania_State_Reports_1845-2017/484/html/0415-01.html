Essential to those decisions, however, was evidence that the particular state’s financing system resulted in some school districts having significantly less money than other districts, causing gross disparities in total and per child expenditures throughout the state. No such allegation has been made in this case. Indeed, the School District of Philadelphia ranks fifth in current expenditures per WADM and seventh in total expenditures per WADM among the Commonwealth’s 505 school districts. Well over 75% of the general fund revenues of each of the six districts with greater total expenditures than Philadelphia are derived from local sources. Local source revenues constitute from 87.4% to 92.4% of the total general fund revenues of the five districts with greater current expenditures. Of those five districts, state subsidies constitute only 6% to 10.5% of the total funds expended for school district operation. Federal grants constitute 2.1% to .7% of the entire general funds. In contrast, only 39.6% of Philadelphia’s general fund revenues are derived from local sources.- The greatest portion of Philadelphia school district funding, 44.8%, is obtained from state subsidies. The final 15.6% of the general revenue funds come from federal subsidies. Pennsylvania Department of Education, Our Schools Today: Public School Financial Statistics Report 1976-77 (1978).</p>

The state subsidy payable to each school district is computed by means of a complex formula in which student enrollment, district spending per student, and the district’s relative wealth are taken into account. Like every other school district in the state, Philadelphia receives state funds which pay part of the cost of the public school program. Appellants do not challenge the state <em>subsidy portion </em>of the financing system, nor do they claim that the <em>subsidy formula </em>is insufficient to compensate for imbalances in local tax bases, or that Philadelphia is discriminated against in any way in the <em>implementation </em>of the subsidy program. Indeed, nowhere do appellants allege that the subsidy portion of the system provides less money for education in Philadelphia, either in total or per child, than any other district in the Commonwealth. Rather, appellants’ <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>attack on the Pennsylvania system of financing public school education centers on the distinction which the state’s system makes between the Philadelphia School District and other school districts in the state in the manner in which it raises funds by local taxation.</p>
    <p id="b531-5" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[199,575,1147,819]]]'>Under Pennsylvania’s education financing system, the Philadelphia School District is unique in that it alone among all the school districts in the Commonwealth is denied independent power to levy and collect the local taxes necessary to insure that its children receive a thorough education. Only the Philadelphia School District needs to have specific enabling ordinances passed by the municipal governing body, Philadelphia City Council, before it can levy and collect the local taxes its School District considers necessary to provide a minimum level of education. Unlike other school districts in the state, if the total amount of the state subsidy, plus the local taxation, is not sufficient to provide a full educational program, the Philadelphia School District is without a statutory mechanism for raising the additional needed funds, on its own. It needs the approval of <em>another </em>body. No other school district in the state is thus handicapped.</p>

While not compelling on the state constitutional issue, we find the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez, <a href="/us/411/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="411 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="10186" data-case-paths="/us/411/0001-01">supra,</a> </em>dispositive of the instant case. Because the right to a public education is constitutionally recognized in Pennsylvania, any state action interfering with that right must be closely examined before it can be said to pass constitutional muster. Such state action will not be entitled to the usual presumption of validity, but rather, the Commonwealth must establish that its interference with that right is compelled by some legitimate state interest, and that the interference is the least drastic means of accomplishing that objective. Appellants in this case allege that the Pennsylvania School financing system interferes with the right of the children of Philadelphia to a public education equal to that of other children in the state. At this procedural state of the litigation, that allegation must be accepted as true. It is therefore incumbent upon the Commonwealth to meet its burden. By sustaining appellees’ demurrer, the trial court failed in its duties to put the Commonwealth to that test. Whether discrimination alleged by appellants is such that it violates appellants’ constitutional rights is a question that cannot be answered at this stage of the proceedings. If, after a hearing, appellants can establish that the Philadelphia School District is the only district where those directly charged with administration of the educational program are not those given the authority to raise the necessary funds, and if it can be. established that that distinction prejudices Philadelphia school children’s education in violation of the constitution, some relief may be appropriate. It would be premature at this time to consider what that relief might be.</p>
