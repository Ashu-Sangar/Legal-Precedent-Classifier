Love, </em><a href="/pa-super/248/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="248 Pa. Super. 387" data-case-ids="832300" data-case-paths="/pa-super/248/0387-01">248 Pa.Super. 387</a>, <a href="/pa-super/248/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="248 Pa. Super. 387" data-case-ids="832300" data-case-paths="/pa-super/248/0387-01">375 A.2d 151</a> (1977). In 1973, appellant and her three children took up residence with C. Alton Wade, at his house located in Chester County, Pennsylvania. According to one of the prosecution’s witnesses, Wade was a “high strung” individual with an ulcer, who had a very “short temper.” At least partially because of Wade’s influence upon her, appellant began “disciplining” her children by using a restraining strap and horse crop. Wade also administered physical beatings (“discipline”) to appellant’s children using these instruments. The testimony indicates that both appellant and Wade had used these implements to discipline appellant’s two-year old son Daniel on November 26, 28, and December 1, 1973. During the afternoon of December 1, 1973, appellant discovered Daniel playing on a fence outside their house. This fence was off-limits to appellant’s children and Daniel had been told not to play there. Because of his disobedience, appellant took Daniel by the arm and “dragged” him into the house, through the kitchen, and into the bedroom shared by her and Wade. There, in Wade’s presence, appellant began to “discipline” Daniel. She struck him with the horse crop several times on the buttocks and on the legs, arms, and hands. Wade said that appellant was not striking Daniel hard enough and that he would show her how to do it correctly. Appellant then gave the horse crop to Wade, who struck Daniel with it several additional times. At some point during this beating, Daniel fell to his back on the floor. Wade then raised his foot and “stomped” on Daniel’s stomach. Daniel died the next day.</p>
    <p id="b406-5" data-blocks='[["BL_406.4",406,[299,1899,1145,354]]]'>In order to establish the cause of Daniel’s death, the prosecution presented the testimony of Dr. Halbert Filling-er, a forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy on the victim’s body. Dr. Fillinger testified that, in his opinion, the force needed to cause the injuries which resulted in Daniel’s death, could have been supplied by application of a foot to the stomach in a “stomping” manner as previously described.</p>
    <p id="b406-6" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[299,2273,1145,94]],["BL_407.1",407,[158,330,1149,894]]]'>Appellant does not dispute the prosecution’s contention that her son’s death resulted from criminal agency. The <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>crux of appellant’s argument is that the evidence fails to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant’s conduct caused Daniel’s death. Specifically, appellant argues that the evidence shows only that she administered beatings to Daniel using the horse crop and restraining strap, and that the injuries to Daniel’s buttocks, legs, arms, and hands which resulted from her use of these instruments were not severe enough, in and of themselves, to'cause death. Indeed, on cross-examination, Dr. Fillinger admitted that he could not state the degree to which these external injuries might have contributed to Daniel’s death. Appellant’s argument misses the mark, however, because the evidence establishes that Wade’s action of “stomping” on Daniel’s stomach, was a form of “discipline” that Wade had used on appellant’s children previously, and that on December 1, 1973, appellant and Wade were acting together in administering the “discipline” that ultimately led to Daniel’s death.</p>

We need not reach this issue. As previously noted in this opinion, the trial court instructed the jury that appellant could be found guilty as an accomplice. The court specifically stated that there was no charge of conspiracy involved in the case.</p>
    <p id="b411-6" data-blocks='[["BL_411.5",411,[173,1356,1146,253]]]'>Appellant’s next contention is that her conviction of murder in the second degree may not stand because Wade was convicted of the lesser crime of voluntary manslaughter. This argument, however, overlooks Section 306(g) of the Crimes Code (18 Pa.C.S.A. 306(g)), which states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b411-7" data-blocks='[["BL_411.6",411,[215,1626,1103,359]]]'>“(g) Prosecution of accomplice only. — An accomplice may be convicted on proof of the commission of the offense and of his complicity therein, though the person claimed to have committed the offense has not been prosecuted or convicted or has been convicted of a different offense or degree of offense or has an immunity to prosecution or conviction or has been acquitted.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b411-8" data-blocks='[["BL_411.7",411,[174,2006,1145,146]]]'>The fact that Wade was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, therefore, does not bar appellant’s conviction for murder in the second degree.</p>

These issues include allegations (1) that the trial judge erroneously summarized <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>Dr. Fillinger’s testimony to the jury; (2) that in his closing remarks to the jury, the prosecuting attorney erroneously referred to the so-called felony-murder rule even though it had no application to the case; (3) that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from appellant’s failure to call a potential witness; (4) that the court erred when, over defense objection, it allowed the prosecution to introduce into evidence at appellant’s trial, testimony she had given at Wade’s trial; (5) that the court erred in allowing the prosecution to introduce into evidence certain allegedly gruesome photographs of the deceased’s body; (6) that appellant was prejudiced by certain irrelevant testimony regarding her incarceration, bail, Wade’s previous trial, various other forms of “discipline” allegedly employed by appellant and Wade, and appellant’s psychiatric treatment; and (7) that the trial court erred by failing to charge the jury with the points for charge submitted by appellant in the form submitted. Numbers 1, 2, and 3 above, have not been properly preserved for appellate review because, although raised in post-verdict motions, they were not objected to at trial. Number 4 above has not been properly preserved for appellate review because, although objected to at trial, it was not raised in appellant’s written post-verdict motions. Numbers 5 and 6 above, were neither •objected to at trial, nor raised in post-vérdict motions, and are therefore not properly preserved for appellate review.</p>
    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[324,1636,1145,607]]]'>As to Number 7, above, several points for charge presented by appellant were affirmed and read to the jury as submitted, others were read in modified form. When read in modified form, the modifications were editorial in nature and did not affect the substance of the requested charge. Still other points were affirmed but not read because they had already been covered elsewhere in the court’s charge. Some others were refused and not read because they erroneously stated the applicable law, or because they were not relevant to the issues presented by this case. We have reviewed the trial court’s rulings and detect no reversible error.</p>
