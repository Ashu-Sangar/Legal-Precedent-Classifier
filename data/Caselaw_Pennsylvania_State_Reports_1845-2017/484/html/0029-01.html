On appeal, we reversed the judgment of sentence and awarded a new trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Graves, </em><a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">461 Pa. 118</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">334 A.2d 661</a> (1975). Appellant’s retrial, also before a jury, resulted in verdicts of guilty of murder of the first degree, robbery and burglary. Sentence of life imprisonment was imposed on the murder conviction with concurrent five to ten year sentences for the <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>robbery and burglary convictions. Post-verdict motions were denied by the trial court, and this appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b132-5" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[290,425,1149,746]]]'>Appellant’s first contention is that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that his actions caused the victim’s death. As with all challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict winner, here the Commonwealth. <em>See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/476/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="476 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1736899" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0557-01">476 Pa. 557</a>, 560, <a href="/pa/476/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="476 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1736899" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0557-01">383 A.2d 503</a>, 504 (1978). The salient facts are as follows: On September 28, 1971, appellant and two others burglarized the residence of Sebastiano Patiri, who, at the time, was seventy-five years of age. During the course of the robbery and burglary, Patiri sustained certain injuries for treatment of which he was admitted to a local hospital. While in the recovery room following the surgery that was necessitated by the injuries received in the robbery/burglary, Patiri died.</p>
    <p id="b132-6" data-blocks='[["BL_132.5",132,[286,1191,1150,730]]]'>The prosecution produced two expert witnesses, who testified as to the victim’s physical condition when admitted to the hospital, and gave their opinions as to the cause of his death. The first of these witnesses was Dr. Isadore Mihalakis, the pathologist who performed the autopsy on Mr. Patiri’s body. Dr. Mihalakis testified, in part, that the seventy-five year old victim’s general health condition was poor, and that he was arteriosclerotic, with cardiac and brain arteries functioning at only 30% of their normal capacity. Dr. Mihalakis also testified that “death was due to cardiopulmonary arrest, meaning lung and heart stoppage.” The witness expressed the opinion that the injuries sustained in the assault combined with a general state of health caused his death.</p>
    <p id="b132-7" data-blocks='[["BL_132.6",132,[288,1950,1147,202]],["BL_133.1",133,[199,288,1148,465]]]'>The prosecution’s second expert witness was Dr. Donald Smith, a physician who had examined the victim while he was yet alive. This witness testified that the wounds “were quite likely compatible with survival,” and “that he had <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>every reason to believe the victim would survive after surgery.” Dr. Smith also stated that neither the wounds themselves, the corrective surgery that he performed, nor the anesthesia, individually or collectively, were such as to create a reasonable medical expectation that death would result. He further testified that the wounds, “ . necessitated [the victim’s] admission and evaluation in the emergency room”, and that the resultant surgery did lead to his death.</p>
    <p id="b133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[201,785,1149,796]]]'>The evidence also revealed that the victim had sustained seven knife-stab wounds to the body. Four of these seven stab wounds were of sufficient depth to penetrate internal organs; two wounds, one of which was two and one-half inches deep and the other of which was two and one-quarter inches deep, penetrated the victim’s lung; another three inches deep, perforated the lower lobe of the lung, perforated the diaphragm, and penetrated the liver to a depth of three-fourths of an inch; another, two and one-half inches deep, penetrated the right lobe of the liver to a depth of one inch. The stab wounds caused extensive hemorrhaging in the abdominal cavity. Additionally, the victim had received blows to the face and chest which resulted in multiple bruises, a laceration over the right eye, a fracture to the nasal bone, and two fractured ribs.</p>
    <p id="b133-6" data-blocks='[["BL_133.5",133,[203,1620,1149,526]]]'>The above evidence is clearly sufficient to support a finding that the wounds inflicted by appellant initiated the chain of events which ultimately led to the victim’s death. Furthermore, appellant cannot insulate himself from criminal liability on the theory that the victim’s pre-existing physical infirmities contributed to his demise. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hicks, </em><a href="/pa/483/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="483 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1751231" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0305-01">483 Pa. 305</a>, 313, <a href="/pa/483/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="483 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1751231" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0305-01">396 A.2d 1183</a>, 1187 (1979) <em>quoting Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b134-5" data-blocks='[["BL_134.4",134,[282,459,1151,1224]]]'>The instant appeal is from appellant’s second trial on these charges. The prosecution called one Edward Mathis as a witness at both trials. According to the record, Mathis was an accomplice to the offense for which appellant was being tried and had been convicted on a guilty plea of lesser offenses than those for which appellant was charged. At the time of appellant’s second trial Mathis had served his minimum sentence and was on parole (at the time of appellant’s first trial, Mathis had not yet been sentenced.) At appellant’s first trial Mathis’ testimony implicated appellant. At the second trial Mathis denied recollection of many of the events surrounding the crimes for which appellant was charged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> At that point the prosecution was permitted to attempt to refresh Mathis’ memory by questioning him regarding testimony he gave at appellant’s first trial. The trial court then ordered Mathis to submit to a mental examination by a court-appointed psychiatric specialist. An examination lasting approximately one and one-half hours was conducted by the psychiatrist, following which, the psychiatrist testified, out of the hearing of the jury, regarding Mathis’ competency. Following this testimony, the defense asked for a ruling on the competency of the witness. The Court refused to rule that the witness was incompetent.</p>
    <p id="b134-6" data-blocks='[["BL_134.5",134,[282,1704,1147,202]],["BL_135.1",135,[208,291,1147,1193]]]'>The jury was reconvened, and Mathis was again called to the stand and questioned by the assistant district attorney. He then testified that reading the transcript had refreshed his recollection to some extent; that he knew appellant, who <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>was his cousin; that he was related to Thomas Mathis, another co-defendant; that he had an opportunity to look at the transcript, and that he could remember some parts of the record; that he recalled testifying at appellant’s first trial; that he had an independent recollection of the date of the offense; that he was at the Front Street park with appellant and Thomas Mathis at that time; that he recalled leaving the park, and going to the South Side, where he, appellant, and Thomas Mathis went into a house; that he remembered events other than entering the house; that he remembered looking at a window and seeing the ground, appellant, Thomas Mathis, and an old guy; that they were just standing there outside the window. He also said that he vaguely remembered what the house looked like and remembered running from the house, crossing a bridge, going up the side of a hill to the other side of town; that appellant and Thomas Mathis were with him when he crossed the bridge; that he thought there was money, and that one of them had it; that the three had divided the money; that he did not remember how much money he got; that he does not recall a knife on the day that he entered the house; and that he recalled drinking down at the park before they left to go South Side.</p>
    <p id="b135-5" data-blocks='[["BL_135.4",135,[210,1503,1146,405]]]'>Following this testimony, the trial judge again ordered the jury removed from the court room. Out of the jury’s hearing, Mathis testified in answer to questions by the Court that he could “sit down and read the book and remember from the book . . . ” (referring to the transcript of his testimony at the first trial). Mathis protested to the Court that he simply could not remember all the events of the day in question.</p>
    <p id="b135-7" data-blocks='[["BL_135.5",135,[210,1928,1147,409]]]'>The trial court then ruled that these recollections were so general in nature that the witness was “unavailable” to the prosecution, that such unavailability resulted from his memory loss, and that the prosecution was therefore entitled to have the transcript of the testimony given by Mathis at appellant’s first trial read to the jury. Appellant contends that this ruling was erroneous. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>

    <p id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[270,1330,1148,999]]]'>From this premise, appellant would have us conclude that because none of four enumerated conditions in the Act have been satisfied with respect to the witness Mathis, Mathis’ prior testimony was inadmissible. This conclusion would be correct if the premise was correct.

We will not speculate as to which was the more truthful version. At the time of appellant’s first trial the witness had been convicted but not yet sentenced. It may be that he felt it would be to his advantage to falsely implicate appellant at that time. At appellant’s second trial the witness was no longer in danger of prosecution, and may have been telling the truth. Nevertheless, permitting the prosecution to read his previous testimony allowed the jury to draw the additional inference that this now freed accomplice was limiting his present testimony in order to protect his cousin who was still on trial, and the concomitant inference that he was trying to hide his prior testimony so as not to injure his cousin.
