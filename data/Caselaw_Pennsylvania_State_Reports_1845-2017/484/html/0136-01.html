Koresko IV, was sentenced by the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County to four and one-half to ten years in prison for rape, sodomy and assault. •The sentence began on November 11, 1967. Appellant was paroled and absconded from the jurisdiction. His absence constituted a technical violation of parole. He was delinquent for two years, two months and twenty-three days, after which time he was arrested and returned to prison. He was later reparoled. Appellant’s maximum sentence was originally set to expire on November 11, 1977. The Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, appellee here, extended the expiration date to February 4, 1980, requiring appellant to make up for the time he was delinquent. Appellant sought to be released from parole after the original expiration date, arguing that the extension violated his right to due process of law. He filed a petition for habeas corpus in <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>the Commonwealth Court, which found that habeas corpus did not lie and that the proper form of action was a petition for review in the nature of mandamus. It treated appellant’s petition as such and proceeded to consider and reject his constitutional argument. Appellant now argues on appeal that the Commonwealth Court erred in refusing to consider his action as a petition for habeas corpus. He also continues to press his constitutional claim. At the time of his petition to the Commonwealth Court appellant was not incarcerated, and is not now incarcerated, but remains out of prison on parole in California.</p>

In his brief, appellant states that the action of the Board of Probation and Parole was unilateral and “without benefits of safeguards and guarantees of the type dictated by the Court in <em>Morrissey . . </em>. .” The only way to interpret this argument is to find that appellant is raising the issue of his entitlement to a hearing as required by the procedural due process standards set forth in <em>Morrissey.</em>
