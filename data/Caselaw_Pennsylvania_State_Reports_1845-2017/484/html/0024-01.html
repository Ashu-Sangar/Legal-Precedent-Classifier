    <p id="b126-10" data-blocks='[["BL_126.10",126,[262,1276,1150,793]]]'>Appellee, C. S., filed a Petition for Adoption of G. M., a minor, and requested the termination of parental rights of the natural father, appellant, D. M. Appellant, who is incarcerated at the State Correctional Institution at Rock-view, Pennsylvania, filed a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Ad Testificandum, requesting that he be transported from Rockview to the adoption hearing in Reading. An indigent, appellant further requested that the costs of this transportation, $275.00, be paid by either appellee C. S., or appellee County of Berks. The Common Pleas Court, Orphans’ Court Division, dismissed appellant’s petition. An appeal was then filed in this Court, <em>see </em>the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 233, 17 P.S. § 211.202(3), and we granted leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em>

Appellant had been in prison for approximately thirteen months when the original peti<a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>tion was filed in 1976, and he will not be released prior to June, 1979.</p>
    <p id="b127-4" data-blocks='[["BL_127.4",127,[172,420,1146,525]]]'>This appeal involves the single issue of whether the Court of Common Pleas erred in refusing to issue the Writ of Habeas Corpus Ad Testificandum and order one of appellees to pay the transportation costs. The trial court held that appellant’s constitutional rights were not jeopardized by the denial of his Writ of Habeas Corpus Ad Testificandum because appellant had notice of the proceeding and was represented by competent counsel. We do not consider the merits of those claims since we conclude that this appeal is interlocutory and must be quashed.</p>

In the case before us, although the trial court has denied appellant’s writ and request for the payment of transportation costs, the merits of the controversy have not been decided and there is no way of knowing whether the conclusion of the matter will be favorable or unfavorable to appellant. While the trial court has denied appellant’s Writ of Habeas Corpus Ad Testificandum this does not necessarily preclude appellant from presenting the merits of his claim under the conditions — whether proper or improper — ordered by the trial court. Appellant must litigate the entire case before pursuing further appellate review. At that time, issues now raised will be ripe for review if appellant files an appeal, assuming a final order adverse to him is entered in the trial court.</p>
