While giving chase, the officer observed Jeffries throw a cigarette package under an automobile parked along the street. Shortly thereafter, the officer overtook Jeffries and directed him to stand against a wall. At that moment the other officers arrived on the scene and they were told by the officer, who apprehended Jeffries, to ‘hold him one minute’. The officer then recovered the cigarette package from underneath the parked vehicle, and it was found to contain several foil-wrapped packages of a substance later determined to be heroin.” <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20914" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="311 A.2d 914">Id.,</a> <a href="/pa/454/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="454 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="579911" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0320-01">454 Pa. at 322</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20914" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="311 A.2d 914">311 A.2d at 916</a>.</blockquote>
