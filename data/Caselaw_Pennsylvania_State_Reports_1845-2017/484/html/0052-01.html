Volkhardt an incompetent under • section 5511 of the Decedents, Estate. and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S. § 5511, and appointing Provident National Bank as guardian of her estate.</p>
    <p id="b153-9" data-blocks='[["BL_153.8",153,[215,1096,1144,465]]]'>After three separate hearings, which extended over a ten-month period, the Orphans’ Court ordered the appointment of an impartial medical expert to examine the alleged incompetent, to submit a written report, and to testify in person regarding his examination and his opinion of Hazel Volkhardt’s mental competency. No further hearing was held, and the final adjudication of incompetency was ordered the day after the expert’s written report was filed with the court.</p>
