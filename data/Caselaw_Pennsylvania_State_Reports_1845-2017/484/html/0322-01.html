Anthony” was in reality Peter Pallitto, a man nearly forty years younger than decedent. At all relevant times Pallitto was married to another woman and resided in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Since at least 1964 decedent had been filing federal income tax returns as “Rebecca R. Anthony” jointly with her spurious husband (hereinafter called “tax spouse”).

Anthony” (Peter Pallitto) was part of a criminal tax evasion scheme. Peter Pallitto died in 1973. The record shows no claim by Pallitto during his lifetime as a beneficiary of decedent’s estate, and no claim on behalf of his heirs or estate. Wé are therefore not concerned with the enforceability of a testamentary gift to him. Even if the gift to him were assumed to be unenforceable, section 2514(10) of the Decedents, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> provides that a gift which is contrary to law fails and passes instead to the residuary beneficiary under decedent’s will.

On September 17, 1969, Mr. Washburn was informed by Decedent over the telephone that she had signed the Will on or about September 12th. He urged her to forward the original to his office for safekeeping. She said she would, but never did. Mr. Washburn had never seen her 1965 Will and he never again saw the 1969 document in her lifetime. When duplicate originals of the 1969 instrument were presented to the Register of Wills for probate, both had been signed ‘Rebecca R. Anthony’ by Decedent. These counterparts, which were identical in all respects, revealed that changes had been made in the document, portions had been re-typed and they had been put back together with mixed ribbon and carbon copy pages.”</blockquote>
