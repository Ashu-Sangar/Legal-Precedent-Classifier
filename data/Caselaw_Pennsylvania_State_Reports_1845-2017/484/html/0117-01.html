The Commonwealth must be able to point to actual frustration of litigation before we can conclude that unavailability of counsel or a defendant caused the delay. In fact, Fayette County scheduled no criminal proceedings during the period in question. Thus, appellants’ failure to retain counsel could not have caused delay in the proceedings, (emphasis in original) <em><a href="/citations/?q=352%20A.2d%2097" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="352 A.2d 97">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa-super/247/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="247 Pa.

While the “delay” may occur “at any stage in the proceedings” it is only a “delay” cognizable under section (d) where it causes (either directly or indirectly) the commencement of trial to be postponed for some period of time beyond the time it would have been scheduled absent the “delay.” The thrust of Rule 1100 was to crystallize and clarify the Commonwealth’s obligation to afford the defendant a speedy trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Hamilton, </em><a href="/pa/449/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="449 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1945648" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0297-01">449 Pa. 297</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20127" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="297 A.2d 127">297 A.2d 127</a> (1972). The concern of the Rule is the delay in the commencement of trial and section (d) seeks to prevent the Commonwealth from being accountable for those delays in the commencement of trial where they result from actions properly attributable to the defense. Thus, any occurrences between the filing of the complaint and the commencement of the trial which did not affect the time in which the trial was com<a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>menced, is beyond the purview of the Rule and therefore not properly considered as a “delay in the proceedings” within the terms of section (d) of the Rule. “Delay in the proceedings” as used in the Rule requires an actual frustration in the commencement of trial. A postponement of an arraignment which does not in any way prolong the time for the commencement of trial is irrelevant to the question of a speedy trial and is therefore not in fact to be considered in determining the application of Rule 1100 in a given case.</p>

Appellant did not appear for trial on that date but did, through her assigned public defender, notify a member of the district attorney’s staff of her alleged unavailability due to her required appearance in federal court in Philadelphia on that date. Thereafter, by a letter dated February 6, 1976, appellant was advised by the district attorney’s office that her trial was rescheduled for March 17, 1976. The Commonwealth stresses that only a few days remained between January 29th and the expiration of the period on February 2nd, and that it had no knowledge as to the length of the federal proceedings in which appellant was involved or how long her presence would be required. “[W]e do not know if she was a defendant, prosecutrix or witness thereat.” It is asserted that the matter could not be relisted during the January 1976 trial term as each day’s list had been finalized. Based upon these considerations, the Commonwealth contends that we should conclude that appellant’s unavailability on January 29th prevented the commencement of trial within the prescribed period despite due diligence by the Commonwealth and that the period which <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>elapsed between the 29th of January and the actual trial date, March 17, 1976; was excludable under section (d)(1).</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth’s claim for excusing the commencement of trial on the days following January. 29, 1976 rests upon a claim in the nature of “judicial delay” rather than the unavailability of the appellant.
