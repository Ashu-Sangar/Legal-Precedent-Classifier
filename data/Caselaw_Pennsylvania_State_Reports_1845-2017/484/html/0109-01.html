Appellant, Graves, and Edward Mathis left Johnson. The three discussed going to Patiri’s home and robbing him. Upon arriving at Patiri’s home, the three devised a plan. Edward Mathis was to enter the house through the roof while appellant and Graves were to engage Patiri in conversation outside his house. Edward Mathis went to the roof, entered Patiri’s home, and searched the upper floor. He then went downstairs. While Edward Mathis was searching downstairs, Patiri entered the house. Edward Mathis hid <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>behind some bags in the corner of a room. He saw Graves and appellant enter the house. Patiri turned around, and Graves struck Patiri with his fist. Graves and appellant then both beat Patiri “for a while,” and appellant kicked him. Edward Mathis then ran back upstairs and jumped off the roof. He met Graves and appellant, who had also left the house, and the three fled together. Later Graves pulled out money, which the three divided.</p>

According to appellant, he and Graves stood on the side porch of Patiri’s house and drank from a bottle of wine while Edward Mathis went to the roof. Appellant stated that when he and Graves first went to the porch, Patiri was not there, but after about five minutes, Patiri came to the door. Appellant claimed Graves said they were just drinking and Patiri said he did not mind. Graves then asked Patiri for a glass of water, Patiri agreed, and Graves followed Patiri into the house. Appellant claimed that about one and one-half minutes later, he heard a loud thump, thought Edward Mathis had fallen, went into the house, and found Graves stabbing Patiri. Appellant claimed he was momentarily stunned but then tried to take a knife away from Graves. Appellant claimed that as he pulled Graves away, Graves kept kicking Patiri. Appellant testified that he called Edward Mathis to assist Patiri so Patiri would not die. Appellánt testified that, before the episode, the group had been drinking, but appellant did not attempt to defend on the ground of intoxication.</p>

Thomas Mathis testified that three quarts of wine were bought, and it is his testimony that they drank about a quart of the wine.

I do not understand the testimony of Thomas Mathis being that he claimed he was intoxicated, he stated he drank wine, but nonetheless, because that testimony is before you I want to make sure that you understand that the felony murder rule definition of law in Pennsylvania does not make intoxication a defense. If one or more persons join to commit the felonies of robbery and burglary, and if a killing occurs in connection with the commission of those crimes of robbery and burglary, it is felony murder and it is first degree murder and if intoxication exists, that is of no significance. It is up to you as to the significance of Thomas Mathis’ testimony as to what drink there was.
