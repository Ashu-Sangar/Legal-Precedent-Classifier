Postverdict motions were filed. The court denied an arrest of judgment but granted a new trial.

At that time, the victim, a young woman of slight build, left her apartment on South 47th Street in Philadelphia and began walking to a grocery store at 49th Street and Chester Avenue about two blocks away. When she reached 48th Street and Chester Avenue, she asked a man, standing on the corner,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> if the store was open, and he responded. She continued toward the store. When she determined the store was closed, she began to return to her home. She noticed the man who had been standing at the corner had crossed the street and begun to walk toward her. They met in the middle of the block between 48th and 49th Streets on Chester Avenue, and the man began a conversation. The victim continued walking, and the man began to walk parallel to her and in her direction. Although some twelve to fifteen feet from her, he continued to converse<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> with her. Finally, the man grabbed her by the mouth with his left <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>hand and held an ice pick to her throat. He said: “ . don’t scream,” and asked how much money she had. She responded: “five dollars,” and he then walked her through an alley and into a garage. There, the man raped her, choked her until she blacked out, stole the five dollars from her, and tied her hands before leaving the garage.</p>

The plurality is correct that admissibility of the testimony concerning the subsequent rape depends upon a “logical connection” with the alleged rape. But the plurality incorrectly concludes that no such connection exists here. Both offenses occurred within five days, near the intersection of 47th Street and Chester Avenue, Philadelphia, and at the same early morning hour. Each assailant trailed his victim, confronted the victim with a dangerous weapon, and, once the attack began, sought to take the victim to a nearby alley. Despite the suggestion of the plurality, it is wholly irrelevant to this crime of violence that “ ‘the victims were of totally different ages and sexual attractiveness.’ ” 484 Pa. at 380, 399 A.2d at 127, quoting opinion of the trial court. Proof of the subsequent rape in this case “ ‘will naturally tend to show that the accused is the person who committed the other,’ ” <em>Commonwealth v.
