The words “Riverside Food Market,” identify a building in the shopping center on a revised plan dated “8/31/72.” Appellee testified that it began work on January 2, 1973. Thus, the building was added to the plan some four months <em>prior </em>to commencement of work by the appellee, and <em>not </em>some eight months after, as stated by the majority below. Moreover, the original architect’s plan, dated “3/4/71” included a notation “future building” indicated by dotted lines. The revised “8/31/72” plan fleshed out this “future building”, indicating, in the same place on the plan, “Riverside Food Market” and “Small Stores.” Therefore, although the building appellee worked on was not labelled “food market” on the original plan, that plan indicated there was to be some building there, as well as its general size and its location.</p>
