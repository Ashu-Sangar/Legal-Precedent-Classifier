In other words, the statement that no lawyer can be provided at the moment and can only be obtained if and when the accused reaches court substantially restricts the absolute right to counsel previously stated; it conveys the contradictory alternative message that an indigent is first entitled to counsel upon an appearance in court at some <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>unknown, future time.

I suggest that this apparent misunderstanding of his constitutional rights very likely resulted directly from the misleading warnings here at issue. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v.

The record also shows that he was represented by counsel at his preliminary hearing and, of course, at the trial. The ruling of the trial court that his verbal statements to the police might be admitted in evidence was correct, the Commonwealth having proved that appellant received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and there being no showing that he misunderstood the warnings given to him.</p>
