As soon as property is taken from the residue to meet the estate tax obligation, the residuary is diminished in value and a marital trust correspondingly has a larger fractional share in the aggregate of the estate properties.

Similarly, any gains on advanced and withdrawn portions of the beneficiary’s interest are not shared by all with interests in the fund, but are his alone. Adoption of the fixed fraction rule of convenience for estates with prolonged periods of administration would permit those receiving discretionary advances of their distributive shares to speculate at the expense of those whose full interests, as Mrs. Petri’s, remain in the common fund. If there were a gain in the common fund, those who had obtained advanced withdrawals would lose less if they suffered a loss on their withdrawn share and would gain twice if there were a gain on their withdrawn share. But the intent underlying the creation of a fractional share is that risks of appreciation and depreciation be shared equally by the parties based on their interests in the fund which produces the gain or loss. Only the changing fraction rule preserves that fair and equitable result.</p>

      <blockquote id="b245-19" data-blocks='[["BL_245.9",245,[234,1183,1082,622]]]'>“Let us assume that the net probate estate of a decedent is $300,000 and the widow’s statutory elective share is one-third. Thus, upon her election she becomes entitled to $100,000. If federal taxes and legacies are paid out of the non-elective share (as they must be) in the amount of $100,000, there remains in the estate $200,000 in principal. The elective and non-elective shares then are $100,000 each. However, if this principal increases by $150,000 and becomes $350,000, under the fixed fraction method, the widow receives one-third of the increase and her distributive share is $150,000. The non-elective share would get two-thirds of the increase, and its distributive share would be $200,000. Thus, the value of the non-elective share increased by 100% and the value of the elective share increased 50% although both shares had exactly the same amount of money attributable to their respective shares in the estate. We can envision the problem had this been a $150,000 loss rather than gain.</blockquote>
