One Gray employee, Vincent Cardillo, was injured and another Gray employee, Candido Gonzalez, was killed in an accident on the job site. Cardillo and the administratrix of the estate of Gonzalez filed separate complaints against U.S. Steel in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. Cardillo alleged U.S. Steel’s negligence caused his injury, and the administratrix claimed U.S. Steel’s negligence caused Gonzalez’s death. U.S. Steel denied each plaintiff’s allegations of negligence and joined Gray as an additional defendant in each case. The court of common pleas consolidated the cases and the parties presented their evidence to a jury. The jury returned verdicts in favor of plaintiffs, and against both U.S. Steel and Gray. The court of common pleas denied U.S. Steel’s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts and for a new trial. (Gray did not challenge the jury’s verdicts.) U.S. Steel appealed to the Superior Court. The Superior Court unanimously upheld the denial of U.S. Steel’s motions for judgment n. o. v., and a majority granted U.S. Steel a new trial. Both U.S. Steel and plaintiffs petitioned for allowance of appeal, and this Court granted both petitions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

U.S. Steel and Gray signed a contract supplied by U.S. Steel which contains a printed provision that “[t]he safety of all persons employed by contractor . shall be the sole responsibility of contractor” and a provision that “[cjontractor shall take all reasonable measures and precautions at all times to prevent injuries to or the death of any of his employees . . . .” The contract incorporates several sets of “owner’s specifications.” One set includes a typed clause stating that “[tjhe contractor shall provide and maintain all required barricades, planks, handrails, lanterns, warning signs and everything necessary for the safe and proper conduct of the work and for the protection of all equipment, property, Contractor’s employees, Purchaser’s employees and all other equipment.” Another set contains a typed clause stating that “[cjontractor shall equip work covered by this contract with all proper safety devices for the protection of workmen. . . . ”</p>

Gray removed approximately ten feet of bricks from the top of the checker chamber of the Number 3 stove. It then shifted its efforts to the skimwall at the bottom of the well. Before removing any skimwall, Gray installed scaffolding to support skimwall that would not be removed. Gray then removed about twenty feet of skimwall.</p>

The jury could decide that U.S. Steel knew, or should have known, that implementation of its order to remove additional checker bricks would require Gray to depart from standard tear out procedure.

Society of the Faculty, </em><a href="/pa/473/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="473 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1730315" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0576-01">473 Pa. 576</a>, 592, <a href="/pa/473/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="473 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1730315" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0576-01">375 A.2d 1267</a>, 1275 (1977).

The writing of the parties is silent on whether the progress of the work might require use of a chute. Some extrinsic evidence of the scope of typical tear out work, see Restatement (Second) of Contracts, supra at § 228(3)(b), indicated that use of a chute is unusual. On the other hand, the writing also provided that Gray would remove “approximately ten feet” of checker brick. Use of an “approximate” term may suggest that Gray would not necessarily finish checker work before beginning skimwall removal. Additional extrinsic evidence bearing on this particular job established that U.S. Steel retained control over rodding of checker bricks and supervising removal of additional bricks, if necessary. See, id., at § 228(1). This, too, could be viewed to affect the sequence of the jobs to be performed. On this record, whether Gray and U.S. Steel, at the time of contract formation, anticipated possible use of a chute was for the jury. See e. g., <em>Schwartz v.

The contract between U.S. Steel and Gray contains several provisions in which Gray assumes responsibility for safety of workmen. The parties’ contract provides that “[t]he safety of all persons employed by contractor . shall be the sole responsibility of contractor,” “contractor shall take all reasonable measures and precautions at all times to prevent injuries to or the death of any of his employes . . .,” “contractor shall provide and maintain all required barricades, planks, handrails, lanterns, warning signs and everything necessary for the safe and proper conduct of the work . . .,” and “[contractor shall equip the work . . . with all proper safety devices for the protection of workmen. . . . ” This language would serve to shift then-anticipated risks.

Relying upon this standard of review, the testimony established that the terms of the contract required Gray to remove bricks from the <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>checker chamber, starting at the top, and continue to do so until inspection revealed that the good checker bricks had been reached. A rodding test performed by another independent contractor, Pittsburgh Pipe, was utilized to determine when the good bricks had been reached and further tear out in the chamber was unnecessary. Without waiting for the results of the rodding test, Gray made a <em>unilateral </em>decision to begin work in the combustion chamber. The results of the test made it apparent that additional bricks had to be torn out in the checker chamber to comply with the terms of the contract and to properly perform the job that had been undertaken. The evidence thus established that USS did no more than expect performance of the original terms of the contract and that the change in the sequence of the work resulted from Gray’s unilateral decision to begin work in the combustion chamber prior to receiving the results from the rodding test which would have indicated whether the tear-out work in the combustion chamber had been completed.</p>

Although USS did rig the chute into place, USS was contractually obligated to furnish a crane to perform rigging operations at Gray’s behest. No negligence is alleged with respect to the installation of that equipment and it cannot be contended that the fulfillment of a contractual obligation at Gray’s request evidences USS’s control over the mode and manner through which Gray sought to achieve the bargained for results of. its work. Pennsylvania decisions have generally refused to impose liability upon the employer of an independent contractor for injuries sustained by the independent contractor’s employes when the injury neither resulted from lack of safety in the premises under the control of the employer-landowner nor from concealed defects in these premises. <em>See, Crane v.

Gonzalez and Cardillo have, therefore, failed to establish an essential predicate for the imposition of Section 410 liability on USS, that is, adducing evidence that the employer gave “orders and directions” as to the mode and manner of performance which caused the injuries.</p>
    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[225,774,1147,950]]]'>The other prong of section 410 liability is based on a showing that the employer ordered or directed work to be done which is dangerous in itself. Under this theory, an employer who insists on the performance of a contractual duty can be held liable under certain circumstances. But before the risk of liability can pass to the employer from the independent contractor, the employer must be on notice of the increased danger. In the instant case, Gonzalez and Cardillo who bear the burden of proof on the issue of the employer’s knowledge of the dangerousness of continued performance, did not show that Gray informed USS that the job had become more hazardous than it was prior to the rodding test. Under both Pennsylvania law and the Restatement Second of Torts, USS would not be liable unless it affirmatively knew that the work had become too dangerous for Gray to complete. <em>See, e. g., Weldon v.

Such analysis conflicts with the meaning of section 410, which has to do with the circumstances under which the employer, by his conduct, shifts the risk of liability from the independent contractor to itself, with that of subsequent sections of the Restatement which have to do with nondelegable, nonshiftable risks imposed on the employer of an independent contractor. The reading given section 410 by the majority gives Gonzalez and Cardillo the benefit of theories of duty and liability embodied in section 416 and section 427 of the Restatement; theories which were not submitted to the jury at the trial phase of this case and which are, accordingly, not relevant on this appeal.

In considering the proper scope of liability, we take into account the caveat that liability should not be lightly extended to penalize the use of the independent contractor so that anyone “having important work of construction or destruction to do would hesitate about entrusting it to anybody.” <em>Silveus v. Grossman, supra. </em>The Restatement requires an employer to select an independent contractor who is competent to fulfill the requirements of the task. In the instant case, the parties agreed that Gray was a competent independent contractor. When a competent independent contractor has been engaged, the employer’s liability is as follows: “Defendants not personally interfering or giving directions respecting the progress of a work, but contracting with a third person to do it, are not responsible for a wrongful act done, or negligence in the performance of the contract, if the act agreed to be done is legal.” <em>Heindenway v.

Comment C to Section 416 of the Restatement clearly defines the ambit of Section 413 as follows: “Section 413 states the liability of one who employs an independent <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>contractor to do such work [work dangerous in absence of special precautions] and <em>does not provide in the contract that the contractor shall take the precautions necessary to make its progress safe.” Accord, Morris v.

There is no question that the exculpatory provision adequately provided for the precautions necessary to make the work safe as it was envisioned at the time the contract was entered into. Section 413 is inapplicable unless, <em>at the time the contract was entered into, </em>the employer should have recognized that the work was likely to create, during its progress, a peculiar unreasonable risk of physical harm to others. See Restatement (Second) of Torts Comment D to Section 427. Under the testimony and the theory of Gonzalez and Cardillo, it is clear that the unreasonable risk was not present at the time the contract was entered into between USS and Gray; but rather arose during the course of the work pursuant to the agreement. Section 413 has no application where, as here, the new risk was created by the negligence of the contractor.</p>
