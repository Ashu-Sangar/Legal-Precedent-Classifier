    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[240,794,1162,1545]]]'>Applying these standards to the instant case, we conclude that the denial of appellant’s suppression motion was proper. The circumstances surrounding the arrest are as follows. On December 9, 1975, shortly before 8 p. m., Policeman Martin Dietz was summoned to the 3100 block of Berks Street in Philadelphia where he found Harold Berry, the deceased, bleeding on the sidewalk. Several people present at the scene informed Dietz that there had been a stabbing and they gave the assailants’ descriptions to Dietz. At approximately 7:57 p. m., Dietz issued a “flash” police radio broadcast regarding the suspects. This broadcast stated that four or five negro males were involved, including one in a green army fatigue jacket with the hood pulled up, one in a white tee-shirt, and one six foot four inches tall in a brown overcoat and red knit cap. Other officer's recalled that radio flashes had described more than one assailant as wearing green army jackets. A subsequent flash stated the suspects were from the “24th and Berks Street” gang. Upon receiving this latter information, Officer Joel Goodwin and Policeman Robert Dunsmore drove directly to the area of the intersection of 24th and Berks Streets. There, some time between 8 p. m. and 8:09 p. m., they discovered three young black men walking on Judson Street 0’ust east of 24th) onto Berks. Two of the men, appellant and co-defendant Howard Kemp, were wearing green army jackets, one with the hood up. The third, co-defendant Otis Walker, was wearing a white tee-shirt with an open blue jacket. The officers. testified that, while there were other black men in the area, none of them were similarly attired.</p>
    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.3",303,[248,300,1143,308]]]'>
      <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>The policemen then took the suspects in their unmarked car to the scene of the stabbing where the men were immediately identified by eyewitnesses as being Berry’s attackers. Thereupon the suspects were driven to police headquarters where they eventually gave statements inculpating themselves in the stabbing.</p>
    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.4",303,[249,631,1146,885]]]'>While it may be true, as appellant argues, that many young black men in the 24th and Berks Streets area wear green army jackets and white tee-shirts, nevertheless the discovery of the three youths, together on the street, in the neighborhood to which the suspects had fled, ten to fifteen minutes after the crime had occurred, where the three youths fit descriptions of the suspects and where there were no other persons matching those descriptions in the area, presented a combination of circumstances which was surely sufficient to justify a reasonable belief that they could well be the guilty parties. Thus probable cause existed to arrest appellant. <em>Compare Commonwealth v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/457/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="457 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="477854" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0423-01">457 Pa. 423</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="322 A.2d 119">322 A.2d 119</a> (1974), <em>with Commonwealth v.

Since the arrest was legal, appellant’s argument that his confession should have been suppressed because it was the fruit of an illegal arrest is without merit.</p>

    <p id="b303-7" data-blocks='[["BL_303.6",303,[252,1872,1144,469]],["BL_304.1",304,[257,294,1144,205]]]'>Appellant testified that he and his companions went to the area of the intersection of 32nd and Berks Streets (the area where the stabbing occurred) looking for some girls he had recently met, and that while they were asking a young man if he knew the girls, a gang suddenly emerged from a store wielding knives and began chasing them. While appellant testified he was afraid, the only physical contact which he said took place was that someone hit and pushed a ‘dude’ who was in front of them on 31st Street, and that a ‘dude’ <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>came off a porch and tried to grab Howard Kemp (co-defendant) but that ‘dude’ fell back.

The only physical contact admitted by appellant has hitting and pushing one person who was in the way of he and his friends and, inferentially, perhaps jostling another who had come off a porch. Certainly, the testimony did not establish that either of these ‘dudes’ were provoking the difficulty or were acting in a manner sufficient to instill a reasonable belief that it was necessary to use deadly force against them. In similar cases, we have held that where , a defendant steadfastly denies that he or his companions used deadly force against the victim and where the issue of self-defense was not otherwise injected into the trial by either the prosecution or the defense, the failure to charge upon the subject was not error. <em>Commonwealth v.
