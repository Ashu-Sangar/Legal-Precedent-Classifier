Trial by jury commenced on December 8, 1975 in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Judge Domenic Jerome presiding. Following jury selection, opening arguments and the presentation of six Commonwealth witnesses, appellant changed his plea to guilty on the above charges. On December 9, 1975, a guilty plea colloquy was held before Judge Jerome who accepted appellant’s plea. On August 9, 1976 appellant was adjudicated guilty of murder of the second degree and sentenced to life imprisonment on that conviction, which sentence was to run concurrently with the prison sentences on the other convictions.</p>
    <p id="b438-11" data-blocks='[["BL_438.10",438,[225,1871,1150,363]]]'>Following sentencing, appellant retained new counsel who filed a Petition for Withdrawal of Guilty Plea. A hearing was held on this motion and, by order dated October 5, 1976, Judge Jerome denied appellant’s petition to withdraw his plea of guilty. Direct appeal of the murder conviction was taken to this Court; the other convictions were certified to this Court from the Superior Court.</p>

In addition to the facts outlined in the colloquy, Judge Jerome heard six Commonwealth witnesses prior to appellant’s changing his plea to guilty. These witnesses included Officer Quinn whose testi<a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>mony established that appellant and one Floyd Wilson approached him (Quinn) and Chief Sparks, the victim, on March 25,1975. The two officers were off-duty and dressed in civilian clothes. As they were getting into their unmarked ca appellant placed a gun in Quinn’s stomach, pulled him cut of the car by his jacket and said “get out, okay, get out.” Appellant saw Quinn’s service revolver in Quinn’s waist holster at that time, turned and fled the scene. Quinn fired several shots at appellant, then heard a loud noise behind him. When he turned back, Chief Sparks was clutching his bloody chest, victim of a gunshot wound inflicted by Floyd Wilson. Clearly, therefore, there was sufficient factual basis for Judge Jerome to be satisfied of appellant’s guilt. <em>See Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[259,710,1151,1372]]]'>The most glaring inadequacy in the colloquy in this case is the failure of the trial court to explain the mens rea elements of the crimes to which appellant pleaded guilty. The Opinion in Support of Affirmance asserts that the failure of the trial court to include an explanation of intent and malice was not erroneous because “[w]hile demonstration of specific intent to kill and of malice are prerequisites to sustain a conviction of murder of the first degree, proof of these elements is not needed to support a finding of felony murder.” 484 Pa. at 345, 399 A.2d at 109. The Opinion, however, has overlooked a basic legal principle. When appellant pleaded guilty to murder generally, he subjected himself to conviction of murder of the first, second or third degree. See <em>Commonwealth v. Chumley, </em><a href="/pa/482/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="482 Pa. 626" data-case-ids="1749604" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0626-01">482 Pa. 626</a>, 634—635, <a href="/pa/482/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="394 A.2d 497" data-case-ids="1749591,1749604" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0625-01,/pa/482/0626-01">394 A.2d 497</a>, 501 (1978). The fact that the Commonwealth agreed during the plea colloquy that their proof did not establish murder of the first degree did not erase the possibility that appellant could be properly convicted of murder of the third degree. Malice, of course, is an essential element of murder of the third degree. Moreover, the Opinion in Support of Affirmance ignores the fact that although no intent to cause death or serious bodily injury need be shown to establish guilt of felony murder, proof of the underlying felony is necessary. Attempted robbery, the underlying felony in this case, includes the element of intent to commit a theft.</p>

Section 2.1(a)(ii)(2) of the ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty (Approved Draft 1968) provides that manifest injustice exists where “the plea was involuntary, or was entered without knowledge of the charge.” In the absence of an on-the-record explanation of the nature of the charges against appellant, it cannot be concluded that the plea was entered voluntarily, intelligently, knowingly and understandingly. <em>Commonwealth v.
