Reichel, who died on January 11, 1975. The estate’s assets consisted of a $128,000 marital trust over which decedent had a general power of appointment under the will of her husband, John Reichel, who died in 1957; stock in the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, worth $64,-800; and a residuary estate of $48,400. The contested will provides that all of the trust assets, the stock and one-half of the residuary estate are to go to proponent-appellee, <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>Marian Honsaker, decedent’s daughter, and that the other one-half of the residuary estate is to be received by decedent’s son, contestant-appellant, John Reichel, Jr. The will was executed on March 8, 1974. By giving the greater part of the estate to appellee, this will differed from three earlier wills executed by decedent. Her first will, executed in 1957, would have placed one-half of her estate in trust for appellee and given one-half to appellant outright. A 1966 will provided that each would receive one-half of the estate outright. A 1973 will provided that appellee would receive personal and household items and otherwise left the disposition of the estate as provided in the 1966 will.</p>

The court held a hearing at which appellee offered evidence to establish that it was decedent’s signature on the will, and appellant produced evidence by which he attempted to show that decedent lacked testamentary capacity, or was at least of weakened intellect; that appellee had a confidential relationship with decedent; .and that the will preferred appellee over appellant. Both sides moved for compulsory nonsuit. The court denied appellant’s motion and granted appellee’s, acting under the authority of the Probate Code, § 779(b), 20 P.S. § 779(b), added December 10,1974, P.L.-, No. 293, § 2, immediately effective, which states:</p>

Has the contestant produced sufficient evidence, of a clear and convincing nature, to result in the shifting of the burden of proof to the proponent, to show an absence of undue influence? There have been a number of cases in Pennsylvania on this subject in the course of which many rules and standards have developed. Very recently the Supreme Court has rendered decisions which bring the law in this area up to date, and state it concisely and comprehensively. We have had recent occasion to consider the effect of this current reconsideration of the law, in <em>Dunlap Will, </em>25 Fiduc. Rep. 529, and there quoted at length from the opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Jones in <em>Clark Est., </em><a href="/pa/461/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="461 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="483682" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0052-01">461 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="461 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="483682" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0052-01">334 A.2d 628</a>. In <em>Clark, </em>the Supreme Court considered the development of what was termed two rules of law relating to this issue, one, the so-called old rule, having six separate requirements before the burden of proof would shift, and the more recent rule, having only three. The old rule required proof of (1) bodily infirmity, (2) a weakened mind, (3) a confidential relationship and also that a (4) stranger to the blood of the testator (5) received substantial benefits from a will (6) in the preparation of which he had some part. Cf. <em>Heffner Est., </em>92 Montg.L.R. 44. The more recent rule is that the requirements of bodily infirmity, stranger to the blood and personal preparation of the Will are to be eliminated, and that where a person (1) in a confidential relationship (2) receives substantial benefits under a will, from (3) a testator of weakened intellect, this is sufficient to shift upon him the burden to show the absence of undue influence on his part.</p>

Her mother’s weakened intellect was not her fault; having a confidential relationship with another does not prove abuse of that relationship; nor is the receipt of the bulk of the estate, especially where the testatrix states affirmatively a valid reason for this, an indication of improper conduct. Only some affirmative evidence of undue influence should put upon the recipient (proponent here) of the testator’s bounty a burden of proof as onerous as showing the lack of undue influence. As we said at the hearing, and still believe, ‘There has to be some overreaching, because a person who is the natural object of a person’s bounty, a daughter, gets more than a son, doesn’t prima facie say she exerted undue influence.’ The analogy between fraud and undue influence, embodied in the language of the Supreme Court noted previously, guides us here. Since fraud requires deliberate and affirmative misconduct, we think that no presumption of undue influence can attach to the receipt of a testamentary gift from a testator of some weakened mind (but not shown to lack testamentary capacity) by one who bears a confidential relationship, especially where the gift is a natural and likely exhibition of the testator’s bounty.</p>

For example, whether or not a person received a substantial benefit under the will would be totally disconnected logically from whether or not there was undue influence, unless implicit in this characteristic is that the recipient had done something improper to obtain his benefits. In <em>Clark, </em>as a matter of fact, the proponent wrote the will, had it typed and was the only person present when it was executed. Our Supreme Court has said, ‘ . . . that proponent is the scrivener indeed weighs heavily against him.’ Likewise, in the majority of cases dealing with this problem in the past, the proponents have in fact been of the same blood as testator; hence the practical uselessness of this standard. <em>Aggas </em>v. <em>Munnell, </em><a href="/pa/302/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="302 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1129062" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0078-01">302 Pa. 78</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.%20840" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="152 A. 840">152 A. 840</a>],</p>
