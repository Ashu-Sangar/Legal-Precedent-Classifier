As such, Hams is subject to the Gross Receipts Tax, 72 P.S. §§ 2183-2191 (1949 &amp; Supp.1978-79), the rate of which is levied upon that portion of Ham’s gross receipts as is represented by the ratio that the mileage on routes operated by the company within the Commonwealth bears to the total mileage on all routes, during the relevant period. <em><a href="/citations/?q=363%20A.2d%201340" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="363 A.2d 1340">Id.</a> </em>§ 2185 (Supp.1978-79).

During each taxable period, appellant sub-leased motor vehicles from a company which in turn had leased the same vehicles from a corporate lessor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Although a different corporate lessor was a party to the lease agreements in effect for each of the two taxable periods in question, the relevant lease terms are essentially identical. Therefore, for purposes of brevity, we will set forth the pertinent terms of the lease agreements in effect during the taxable period ending December 31, 1971. On May 8, 1968, Berman Leasing Co. (Berman) leased twenty-seven motor vehicles to Blue Bird Food Products Co. (Blue Bird). On April 24,1971, Blue Bird sub-leased the same vehicles to appellant Hams.

    <p id="b271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[239,760,1146,652]]]'>In essence, the Commonwealth argues that the statute requires companies seeking the benefit of the tax credit to pay <em>directly </em>to the Commonwealth the motor vehicle registration fees. From this proposition, the Commonwealth concludes that because the corporate lessors, Berman and Luby (see note 6 <em>supra), </em>not Hams, actually remitted the fees to the Commonwealth for the periods in question, Hams was not entitled to the credit and, therefore, is not now entitled to a refund for overpayment of taxes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The Commonwealth Court accepted this analysis. <em>See Hams Express, Inc. v. Commonwealth Bd. of Finance and Revenue, <a href="/citations/?q=363%20A.2d%201340" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="363 A.2d 1340">supra</a> </em>26 Pa.Cmwlth. at 450, <a href="/citations/?q=363%20A.2d%201340" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="363 A.2d 1340">363 A.2d at 1341</a>.</p>
    <p id="b271-6" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[241,1452,1144,374]]]'>In response, appellant argues that under the lease and sublease agreements it is clear that the cost of vehicle registration is passed along to and ultimately borne by appellant. Primarily for that reason, appellant concludes that it should be deemed to have “paid” the registration fees within the meaning of the statute and, accordingly, should be given the benefit of the tax credit. We agree.</p>
    <p id="b271-7" data-blocks='[["BL_271.6",271,[242,1893,1144,153]],["BL_272.1",272,[265,301,1146,934]]]'>We note initially that under the leasing arrangements in the instant case, there is no doubt that appellant does pay indirectly the cost of registration fees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The lease <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>provisions governing increases or decreases in the fees subsequent to the execution dates of the agreements indicate that the prevailing registration fees represented a portion of the rental charge paid by appellant. <em>See </em>text accompanying note 5 supra. In pressing its argument that the statute requires actual direct payment of the fees by the taxpayer who seeks the tax credit, the Commonwealth asserts that because in this case the grant of the credit will negate appellant’s tax liability, the tax credit is in the nature of an exemption and that therefore the statutory language creating the credit must be strictly construed. Although it is true that statutes exempting persons and property from taxation are to be strictly construed, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1928(b)(5) (Supp.1978-79), a section of a tax statute providing for a tax credit is not transformed into an exemption provision simply because in a given case the effect of the tax credit is to negate tax liability.</p>
    <p id="b272-4" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[263,1275,1146,762]]]'>Such an argument inverts the normal analytical process, whereby a rule of construction is applied to the tax statute in question in order to determine the extent of tax liability, if any. As often as this Court has had occasion to state that taxing statutes are to be strictly construed, <em>see, e. g., Alan Wood Steel Co. v. Phila. Sch. Dist., </em><a href="/pa/425/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="425 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1906713" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0455-01">425 Pa. 455</a>, 463, <a href="/citations/?q=229%20A.2d%20881" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="229 A.2d 881">229 A.2d 881</a>, 885 (1967), it has just as often noted that reasonable doubts as to a taxing statute’s interpretation should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. <em>See, e. g., id.; Dan Allen Chevrolet Co. v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/414/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="414 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1890414" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0429-01">414 Pa. 429</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.2d%20388" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="200 A.2d 388">200 A.2d 388</a> (1964). It would be particularly inappropriate to strain to justify a rule of strict construction where its application would result in a wooden interpretation of the language that completely ignores the statutory scheme sought to be advanced.</p>

Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/400/0648-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="400 Pa. 648" data-case-ids="1292492" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0648-01">400 Pa. 648</a>, 653, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20351" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="162 A.2d 351">162 A.2d 351</a>, 354 (1960).

In so viewing the instant case, we note that neither of the corporate lessors who actually remitted the fees engage in the business of carrying passengers or property for hire. Therefore, neither lessor is subject to the Gross Receipts Tax, nor is either one entitled to the tax credit for the amount of the remittances. <em>See </em>72 P.S. §§ 2183, 2185 (Supp.1978-79). Thus, the dispute is not over which of two or more taxpayers can claim the tax credit. The dispute is whether a tax credit should be allowed at all for fees which unquestionably were paid to the Commonwealth. As appellant correctly notes, to deny it the tax credit results in a total loss of the credit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Similarly, the revenue created by the vehicle registration fees indirectly paid by the appellant must be deposited in the same fund. 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1904 (1977). The purpose of these fees and the Motor License Fund is to provide for the construction, maintenance, repair and safety of the Commonwealth’s highways. Pa.Const, art. 8, § 11; 71 P.S. § 511.2 (Supp.1978-79); 72 P.S. § 3562(a) (1968) (Repealed 1970). Since the vehicle registration fees and the Gross Receipts Tax are ultimately used for the same purpose, it is logical to infer that the legislature viewed payment of registration fees as being in the nature of a partial pre-payment of Gross Receipts Tax and, for that reason, allowed a tax credit for those fees. Under this analysis, the rationale for the Section 2185 tax <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>credit was the prevention of double or over-taxation. Because appellant clearly bore the burden of the registration fees, to deny appellant the credit would frustrate the purpose for which the tax credit was established.
