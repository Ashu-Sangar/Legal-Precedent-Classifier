It contained no statutory provision comparable to Section 316 of the present Inheritance Tax Act of 1961. Several orphans’ courts in Pennsylvania, however, rendered decisions as to whether amounts in the possession of an employer at the death of an employee and paid to a beneficiary designated by the decedent were subject to the tax imposed by the Act of 1919.</p>

The argument to the contrary was that the decedent, in designating a beneficiary to.receive the unconsumed employment benefits in the hands of the employer, had merely exercised a power of appointment over property which the decedent had never during his life possessed or enjoyed. The cases therefore turned on the extent to which the decedent had the power to possess and enjoy the funds in question during his life.

The text of the section makes no distinction as to the source of the fund, but speaks only in terms of the employee’s right to possess, enjoy, assign or anticipate the payments for his benefit to be made therefrom as the factors which may defeat exemption. As stated above, the degree of dominion which the deceased employee during his lifetime could exercise over the fund has always been the touchstone of decision as to taxability. <em>See </em>text at note 4, <em>supra, </em>and cases cited therein.

The fund was not in his possession, and he could not assign it or anticipate payments under it; even severance of the partnership would not accelerate any payment to Dr. Ravdin from the fund. The fact that the employee’s interest in the fund was vested and non-forfeitable and that eventually the employee could if he wished take the payments due him in a lump sum, is not significant in light of all the circumstances of this case.

Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, an employer contribution to a qualified pension or profit-sharing plan does not result in taxable income to the employee at the time it is made. The employee is taxed only upon receipt of payment from the retirement plan and then at the presumably lower tax rates which will apply when he has retired and is past the peak of his earning potential. The use of a qualified pension plan, therefore, enables the employer to offer his employees an effective deferred compensation benefit.
