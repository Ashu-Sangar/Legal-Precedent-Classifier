Lowe. In the first bill, she was charged <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>with five specific counts: murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, murder in the third degree, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter. The second bill of indictment charged appellee with burglary and conspiracy. A jury trial followed, and verdicts of not guilty were returned on the charges of murder in the first degree, murder in the third degree, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter. The jury found appellee guilty of burglary and conspiracy. Following several reports from the foreman that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked, a mistrial was granted at appellee’s request as to the charge of murder in the second degree. When moving for a mistrial, appellant’s trial counsel specifically reserved the right to subsequently argue that the not guilty verdicts operated to bar reprosecution on the charge of murder in the second degree. After notification that appellant intended to retry appellee on the charge of murder in the second degree, appellee petitioned the trial court to dismiss the charge. The court granted appellee’s petition and quashed the indictment. Pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31,1970, P.L. 673, No. 223 Art. II, § 202,17 P.S. § 211.202 (Supp.1978-79), the prosecution now appeals to us.</p>

They broke into the home of Ray E. Lowe, tied him to his bed, burglarized the house, and then fled in Lowe’s car. In an attempt to free himself, Lowe fell from the bed and was strangled to death by a rope entangled around his neck. A jury found Roberts guilty of burglary and criminal conspiracy, acquitted her of murder in the first degree, murder in the third degree, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter, and became hopelessly deadlocked on the court regarding murder in the second degree — felony murder. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial as to the felony murder count which was granted.
