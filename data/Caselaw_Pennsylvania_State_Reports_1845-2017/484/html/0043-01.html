That trial ended in a hung jury and a mistrial was declared. In August 1976, after a non-jury trial, appellant was convicted of all charges. Post-trial motions were denied. Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and concurrent terms of five to ten years for robbery and burglary. Appellant appealed directly to this Court from the judgment of sentence on the murder conviction. Thereafter his appeals to the Superior Court from the judgments of sentence for robbery and burglary were consolidated in this appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>The Commonwealth urges that the offer by police to allow appellant’s mother to ride with him and the police to the Police Administration Building satisfied the requirement of affording him the opportunity “to consult with an adult.” The Commonwealth argues additionally that the mother’s refusal to accept the police offer combined with her delay in appearing at the police station constituted a waiver of the minor’s rights.

They assumed that the parent’s disinterest can be translated into a waiver by a minor. This assumption completely misconstrues both the Fifth and Sixth Amendment privileges and the objectives sought to be achieved by our case law. These rights are personal to the accused and therefore may only be waived by him, not the adult.

The juvenile and his mother then had ten minutes to confer privately with one another in the living room of their home. The circumstances in <em>McFadden </em>bear no resemblance to the facts of this case. Appellant’s right to an opportunity to consult with an interested adult arose at the time of his arrest and interrogation on September 15, 1975. It is at that point that appellant needed the protection afforded by the advice of an interested adult in order to overcome the “impediment of immaturity.” <em>Smith, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/472/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="472 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1727763" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0492-01">472 Pa. at 498-99</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="472 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1727763" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0492-01">372 A.2d at 800</a>. That appellant had been interrogated six weeks prior to his arrest does nothing to offset the “inequality of the position of the accused [juvenile] and the police . . .’’in the aftermath of the arrest. <em>Commonwealth v.
