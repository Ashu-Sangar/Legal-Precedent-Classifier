This is a classic illustration of a distinction without a difference. Petitioner has no right to seek the office if there has been a valid filing <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>of the declaration of retention. Section 2937 is not limited to formal defects, substantive objections may also be considered.

Shapp, supra, </em>is inapposite to the present inquiry. In <em>Barbieri v. Shapp, supra, </em>we were faced with the relatively unique situation where an incumbent judge was unable to ascertain when his declaration of candidacy for retention pursuant to Article V, Section 15(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution should be filed. Because of the transition between the terms of office under the Constitution prior to the 1968 Amendment and after, there was an apparent conflict between the 10-year term limit and the provision for election of judges only during municipal elections to be held in odd-numbered years. Clearly in that case, there was no adequate procedure under the Election Code to resolve this controversy and declaratory judgment was properly entertained. In contrast, under the present facts the respondent Judges have filed their declarations of retention pursuant to the authority of § 3131. If an aspirant for the offices wishes to assert the invalidity of those declarations for either formal or substantive reasons, § 2937 provides the procedure for raising those complaints. Frequently, disputes under § 2937 are between rival candidates for the office in question. The fact that petitioner’s right to become a candidate for the office is conditioned upon the success of her challenge is for this purpose of no legal significance. The crucial difference between this ac<a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>tion and the situation presented in <em>Barbieri v. Shapp, supra, </em>is that in the latter appeal there was a legitimate uncertainty as to when the controversy would be justiciable. No such uncertainty exists here. Thus, I cannot conclude that the reasons which moved this Court to provide declaratory relief in <em>Barbieri v. Shapp, supra, </em>justify our consideration of the merits of the instant appeal.</p>

In the election procedure, time is of the essence in the resolving of disputes. <em>See, e. g., In re Moore Nomination Petition, </em><a href="/pa/447/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="447 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="1942999" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0526-01">447 Pa. 526</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=291%20A.2d%20531" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="291 A.2d 531">291 A.2d 531</a> (1972); <em>Socialist Labor Case, </em><a href="/pa/332/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="332 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1186558" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0078-01">332 Pa. 78</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20A.2d%20831" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="1 A.2d 831">1 A.2d 831</a> (1938).</p>

As I understand the argument advanced by respondents, they do not suggest that art. 5 § 15(b) authorizes a retention election in this instance, but rather it is asserted that art. 5 does not preclude the legislature from providing for a retention election to fill the offices in question. If the legislature does have the right as urged by respondents, it is problematical <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>whether it must meet the time schedule provided in section 15.

    <p id="b686-8" data-blocks='[["BL_686.8",686,[263,1613,1147,521]]]'>The majority correctly notes that the presumption is in favor of the constitutionality of a legislative act and that this Court may not strike down a statute unless it “ ‘clearly, palpably and plainly violates the Constitution.’ ” Yet the majority voids respondents’ declaration for candidacy for retention election. This ruling is incorrect because petitioner has not sustained the burden of establishing that the statute is invalid. <em>Tranter v. Allegheny Co. Authority, </em><a href="/pa/316/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="316 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1158989" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0065-01">316 Pa. 65</a>, 75, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20289" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="173 A. 289">173 A. 289</a>, 294 (1934), <em>Sharpless v.

In <em>McCormick v. Reeder, </em><a href="/pa/171/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="171 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="985582" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0505-01">171 Pa. 505</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20A.%2067" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="33 A. 67">33 A. 67</a> (1895) a procedure for electing judges to the Superior Court <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>was challenged and this Court upheld as constitutional the procedure which permitted each voter to cast a ballot for only <em>six </em>candidates when <em>seven </em>judges were to be elected. In <em>Winston v. Moore, </em><a href="/pa/244/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="244 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="1003531" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0447-01">244 Pa. 447</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=91%20A.%20520" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="91 A. 520">91 A. 520</a> (1914), this Court upheld as constitutional a legislative act which provided that a judicial primary candidate who received a number of votes greater than half of the number of ballots cast in that primary election would be the <em>sole nominee </em>on the November ballot. Likewise, in <em>Wasson v. Woods, </em><a href="/pa/265/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="265 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="1051904" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0496-01">265 Pa. 496</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.%20214" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="109 A. 214">109 A. 214</a> (1919) this Court again upheld the <em>sole nominee </em>provision as constitutional. In <em>Wasson, supra, </em>the five candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the primary for the five vacant judgeships on the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County were placed as the <em>sole nominees </em>in the November ballot.</p>
    <p id="b687-4" data-blocks='[["BL_687.4",687,[193,1105,1145,345]]]'>Finally, in <em>Thiemann v. Allen </em>(J-123 and J-124, filed April-, 1979) this same Court <em>upheld </em>the constitutionality of 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 3133 (1918) which provides for each party to nominate only <em>two </em>candidates in the primary election and each voter to cast a ballot for only <em>two </em>candidates in the general election even though a total of <em>three </em>judges are to be elected to the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b687-7" data-blocks='[["BL_687.5",687,[193,1477,1146,718]]]'>The legislative enactment which we review today does not “clearly, plainly and palpably” violate the Constitution any more than the statute in the aforementioned cases. The majority opinion concludes without justification that “[Ejection refers to the process by which electors determine which person out of the number properly seeking the judicial position shall occupy it.” (At p. 1250 n. 1). Yet, in all of the aforementioned cases this Court has held that the legislature could validly provide for various types of elections in some of which there was no process by which electors chose some persons out of a greater number of persons appearing on the ballot. Likewise, Act No. 1978-257, § 1(b)(3) amending 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 3131 merely provides another type of election in which the electors have the final say.</p>
    <p id="b687-8" data-blocks='[["BL_687.6",687,[194,2214,1144,136]]]'>Act No. 1978-257, § 1(b)(3) authorizes the filing for retention <em>election </em>by a person appointed to the Commonwealth Court who:</p>

    <p id="b688-6" data-blocks='[["BL_688.5",688,[274,1075,1149,297]]]'>The majority states that this clearly, <em>palpably, </em>and <em>plainly </em>conflicts with the Constitution because it permits a person never elected to a statewide judicial position to be “elected” through a retention process. I agree that this is exactly what Act. No. 1978-257 accomplishes; however, I can find no constitutional violation.</p>
    <p id="b688-7" data-blocks='[["BL_688.6",688,[274,1399,1145,139]]]'>The majority rewrites art. 5, § 15(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution and reads into it requirements that are clearly not there.</p>
    <blockquote id="b688-8" data-blocks='[["BL_688.7",688,[314,1562,1105,359]]]'>“A justice or judge elected under section thirteen (a) . or retained under this section fifteen (b) may file a declaration of candidacy for retention election with the officer of the Commonwealth who under law shall have supervision over elections on or before the first Monday of January of the year preceding the year in which his term of office expires.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b688-9" data-blocks='[["BL_688.8",688,[274,1940,1145,414]]]'>The majority’s reading is not required, necessary or, indeed, desirable. First, the majority refuses to recognize the retention process itself as an election process. That ignores the language of the Constitution which refers to a retention <em>election. </em>Obviously, the voter does express a definite choice when he or she casts a “yes” or “no” ballot. The voter, when he or she casts such a ballot does, in a very real sense, determines “who shall fill a public office.” (At p. 1253).</p>
    <p id="b689-4" data-blocks='[["BL_689.3",689,[212,320,1147,949]]]'>
      <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>Secondly, the language of Section 15(b) is unambiguous and there is no need to resort to a strained interpretation. Nonetheless, the majority relies upon “implications” and finds that, despite the language of the constitution, being elected to a judicial office under Section 13(a) is not enough, rather one must have been elected in a contested election <em>to the judicial position which he or she now seeks. </em>The majority reasons that since Section 15(b) uses a possessive phrase— “his term of office” then one must possess the office before he or she can be retained in the office. (P. 1252). The majority takes the point one step further and holds that one can possess an office <em>only </em>if elected to that same office. Now, I must disagree. One appointed to office possesses that office as fully and completely for the term of his or her appointment as does one who is elected. One who is appointed to judicial office possesses a “term of office” in the specific language of the Constitution as much as one who is elected. Section 13(b) states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b689-5" data-blocks='[["BL_689.4",689,[258,1286,1102,202]]]'>
      <em>“The person so appointed shall serve for an initial term </em>ending on the first Monday of January following the next municipal election more than ten months after the vacancy occurs.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b689-6" data-blocks='[["BL_689.5",689,[214,1507,1147,362]]]'>The powers of an appointed judge are the same as an elected judge. The appointed judge does possess that office and I fail to see any rationale for distinguishing that possession from that of an elected judge. The majority’s rationale in this area is not only confusing but it fails woefully short of the type of proof necessary before striking down the presumption of constitutionality.</p>
    <p id="b689-7" data-blocks='[["BL_689.6",689,[217,1887,1147,473]],["BL_690.1",690,[244,320,1148,902]]]'>Thirdly, respondents have already been elected in one contested judicial election under section 13(a) and therefore, respondents do qualify under the Constitutional definition of who may file a declaration of candidacy for retention. Art. 5 § 15(b). Respondent, DiSalle, was elected under Section 13(a) to the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County and was serving this term when appointed to the Commonwealth Court. Although respondent, MacPhail was a retired judge when he received his appointment to the Common<a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>wealth Court, he too had previously been elected under Section 13(a) to the Court of Common Pleas of Adams County. The reasonable interpretation of the retention election section is that one contested election is all that is required in the career of a judge. There is no reference to the fact that one must be elected to a <em>statewide </em>judicial position in order to be so retained. This Court cannot impose such a requirement of its own accord and then find that Act No. 1978-257 “clearly, palpably and plainly” violates such a judicially created requirement. Voters, statewide, do have recourse in the “yes”-“no” retention election, and have a very real, meaningful basis for their vote since the retention candidate is not an unknown quantity <em>as a judge, </em>regardless of whether the judgeship was statewide or not. Respondents fit all the criteria constitutionally required for a retention election and this Court should not invalidate their candidacy for such.</p>
    <p id="b690-5" data-blocks='[["BL_690.4",690,[247,1243,1144,151]]]'>Finally, the legislative enactment before us today is entirely consistent with the prior enactments by the General Assembly concerning the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b690-6" data-blocks='[["BL_690.5",690,[247,1414,1144,96]]]'>Act No. 1978-257 is therefore constitutional and respondents should be permitted to file for retention election.</p>
