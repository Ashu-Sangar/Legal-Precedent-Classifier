At trial, appellant took the stand and denied the charges. At closing argument, the prosecuting attorney argued that appellant inflicted the fatal blows, summarized appellant’s testimony, and then remarked:</p>

The Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County denied appellant’s motion, and the jury found appellant guilty of murder of the <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>third degree, aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another. Again, on appellant’s motion for a new trial, the court of common pleas rejected her contention that the prosecuting attorney’s remark was prejudicial, denied the motion, and imposed sentence.</p>
    <p id="b461-5" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[220,607,1145,195]]]'>On appeal, appellant renews her claim that the prosecuting attorney’s remark was improper and prejudicial.

An officer found Fitzgerald intoxicated, on the floor of his apartment, near the door. The officer observed that, although Fitzgerald was intoxicated, there was no evidence of physical trauma and Fitzgerald was conscious. The officer assisted Fitzgerald to a couch in the living room.</p>

The police took appellant to <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>the police station and, about forty-five minutes later, brought her home. An officer accompanying appellant to her apartment observed Fitzgerald lying on the floor, about seven feet from the couch. According to the officer’s testimony, Fitzgerald was in approximately the same condition as before, except that his eyes were shut and he was moaning. Later that evening, police were again called to the apartment. They found Fitzgerald dead. He was in a sitting position, on the floor, in the hallway of his apartment. A medical examination determined Fitzgerald died of multiple injuries to the trunk of his body.</p>
    <p id="b462-5" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[292,916,1148,839]]]'>One Commonwealth witness, a neighbor, testified that when Fitzgerald attempted to enter his apartment earlier the same evening, appellant slapped him in the face. An investigating officer testified that appellant told him she tried to clean and sober up Fitzgerald. (Fitzgerald had defecated on himself.) According to the officer, appellant claimed that Fitzgerald fell while in the bathroom, hit his head on a radiator, fell again, and hit his head on a bathtub. She tried to assist Fitzgerald to his bedroom. Fitzgerald again hit his head on the wall and fell to the floor; About one-half hour later, Fitzgerald began to froth at the mouth, and appellant shortly thereafter called a neighbor for help. According to the investigating officer, appellant, on further questioning, admitted to slapping Fitzgerald out of anger for his defacating. Appellant’s statements were not transcribed.</p>
    <p id="b462-6" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[292,1784,1147,256]]]'>Appellant concurred in the investigating officer’s account that Fitzgerald hit his head in her presence, added that Fitzgerald fell several times, and claimed she attempted merely to clean and otherwise help him.

Our cases leave no doubt that prosecuting attorneys of this Commonwealth may not inject “highly prejudicial personal opinion of [an] appellant’s credibility into evidence, thereby clearly and improperly intruding upon the jury’s exclusive function of evaluating the credibility of witnesses.” <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b464-7" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[292,819,1148,1225]]]'>This Court has held it reversible error where the prosecuting attorney on cross-examination characterizes a defendant’s testimony a “malicious lie.” <em>Commonwealth v. Potter, </em>supra. A prosecutor’s remark that “ ‘apparently counsel does not believe his own defendant’,” too, has been held prejudicial. <em>Commonwealth v. Joyner, </em><a href="/pa/469/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="469 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1722085" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0333-01">469 Pa. 333</a>, 339-40, <a href="/pa/469/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="469 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1722085" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0333-01">365 A.2d 1233</a>, 1236 (1976). Here, the prosecuting attorney sought to intrude upon the jury’s exclusive province of judging credibility by branding “everything that [appellant] said from that stand, and in every major respect concerning this case” a “big lie.” Such misconduct violates the ABA Standards, attacks the credibility of “everything” appellant stated on the witness stand, and unequivocally communicates the prosecuting attorney’s personal view of appellant’s testimony. “If the state has a strong case it is not necessary, and if it has a close case, such misconduct is gross injustice to the defendant.” <em>State </em>v. <em>Cyty, </em><a href="/nev/50/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="50 Nev. 256" data-case-ids="535725" data-case-paths="/nev/50/0256-01">50 Nev. 256</a>, 259, <a href="/nev/50/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="50 Nev. 256" data-case-ids="535725" data-case-paths="/nev/50/0256-01">256 P. 793</a>, 794 (1927), quoted in ABA Standards § 5.8 Commentary.
