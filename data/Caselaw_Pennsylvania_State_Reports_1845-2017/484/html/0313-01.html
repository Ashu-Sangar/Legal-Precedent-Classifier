Further, we conclude that salaried part-time employees were “State employes.” Section 102(6)(a) of the Code of 1959, 71 P.S. § 1725-102(6)(a), defines a “State employe” as “[a]ny person holding a State office or position under the Commonwealth, employed on a yearly or monthly basis by the State government of the Commonwealth, in any capacity whatsoever except any officer or employe employed on a per diem or hourly basis for less than one hundred (100) days or seven hundred fifty (750) hours . . . .” This sweeping language demonstrates the Legislature’s intent to make benefits available to all Commonwealth personnel except a narrow group of “per diem” and “hourly” employes who work <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>“less than one hundred (100) days or seven hundred fifty (750) hours.” Salaried part-time employees are employed on neither a “per diem or hourly basis” and thus, under Section 102(6)(a), are “State employes.”</p>

The “furlough” and “leave of absence without pay” exceptions address circumstances where there is an interruption of the employment relationship. There is no interruption of employment in the case of a salaried part-time employee, who provides regular and continuous service over a twelve month period. We hold that these salaried part-time contributors are entitled to a full “year of service” credit under Section 204(1) for each twelve month period of employment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The majority leaves unstated the fact that an ambiguity can be latent as well as patent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> When it is considered that the <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>State did not have a category of part-time <em>salaried </em>employees at the time of enactment of the 1959 Code, the weakness of the majority’s primarily textual analysis of the Code becomes apparent.</p>
    <p id="b421-4" data-blocks='[["BL_421.5",421,[215,496,1149,1371]]]'>The majority places considerable emphasis on the Code’s definition of “State employee,” contained in section 102(6)(a). 71 P.S. § 1825-102(6)(a) (1962) (repealed 1974). Based on this section’s exclusion of per diem and hourly employees only, the majority concludes that the legislature intended to make retirement benefits available on equal terms to full-time as well as part-time salaried employees. As noted by appellants, the utilization of part-time salaried employees was a circumstance which arose <em>after </em>the enactment of the Code in 1959. In fact, the record indicates that none of the named appellees was a part-time <em>salaried </em>State employee prior to 1959. Far from evidencing the legislature’s sweeping magnanimity, the absence of explicit statutory provisions governing retirement benefits for part-time salaried employees merely reflects the “historical milieu” in which the 1959 Legislature was acting. <em>See </em>2A Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 49.01, at 288 (4th ed. 1973) (historical context should be considered in construing a statute). When this contemporaneous historical context is weighed along with the Code’s <em>total </em>exclusion of part-time employees who work less than a specified number of days or hours, 71 P.S. § 1725-102(6)(a) (1962) (repealed 1974), it is impossible to accept the majority’s conclusion that the legislature intended to award credited service to part-time salaried employees at the same rate at which such credit is awarded to full-time salaried employees.</p>

In so interpreting the Code, the Board was merely exercising its administrative discretion to meet an exigency not explicitly <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>addressed by the Code. It seems fairly clear that an administrative agency may modify or even reverse its own interpretation of a statute, especially where, as here, the new interpretation is based upon the opinion of the Attorney General. <em>See </em>Sutherland, <em>supra </em>§ 49.05, at 240. In such a situation, the new administrative interpretation should be applied prospectively only. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, in the present appeal, I would not permit the Board to apply its 1969 reinterpretation retrospectively so as to recalculate credited service based upon appellees’ pre-1969 salaried part-time employment. I would, however, allow the Board to apply its 1969 interpretation to appellee’s part-time salaried employment occurring after the date of this interpretation and until the effective date of the 1974 Retirement Code. 71 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 5101 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp.1978-79).</p>

United States, </em><a href="/f-supp/317/1198-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="317 F. Supp. 1198" data-case-ids="3157227" data-case-paths="/f-supp/317/1198-01">317 F.Supp. 1198</a> (S.D.Tex.1970). There is some justification in attempting to restrain judicial attempts to construe statutes as a judge may deem most advisable by imposing the “clear and unambiguous” language limitation. But where extrinsic evidence <em>is critical to a true understanding </em>of the “clear and unambigu<a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>ous” language of the statute, it should not be ignored. This is so, bee' ,ict; no matter how apparently clear the language may appear, words do not have intrinsic meanings and cannot be separated from the historical context in which they were written. <em>See </em>2A Sutherland, <em>supra </em>§ 45.02, at 4.</p>
