The first incident took place in the afternoon while appellant was piloting a pleasure boat. Appellant was towing his sister-in-law on water skis when another boat crossed the tow line causing his sister-in-law to fall. Appellant drew out a .38 caliber automatic pistol and aimed it at the operator of the passing craft. Appellant’s brother took the gun away from him and returned it later in the day.</p>

Appellant's girlfriend, Anita Green, testified that appellant told her that on his way to her home another car “tried to cut him out in the traffic” and that the driver shouted at him. She testified further that appellant said he pulled out his gun. Ms. Green also stated that appellant told her that the other driver was “lucky the safety mechanism was on because he felt like blowing [his] head off.”</p>
    <p id="b105-6" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[186,1228,1147,467]]]'>The Commonwealth’s other evidence reveals that at 9:00 p. m. appellant and Anita Green were at the home of appellant’s brother Richard. Appellant and his brother argued about appellant’s drinking, his “bad nerves,” and about the gun he was carrying. Richard would not permit the weapon to remain in the house and so Anita put the gun in a paper bag and placed it under the front seat of appellant’s car. When she returned to the house appellant asked her where she put the gun and she informed him.</p>

Anita, who did not wish to go to the bar, was observed by a policeman leaving appellant’s car at a stop light on Frankford Avenue at about 1:50 a. m. Appellant and the hitchhiker proceeded to the bar. After a few drinks, appellant, the hitchhiker, and another, Louis McCloud, left together. Testimony at trial indicates that the hitchhiker was the victim Timothy Shinn.</p>

The passenger soon discarded the papers into the gutter. He and appellant then drove on. Realizing that the car fit the description of one used in a robbery, the policeman pursued and stopped appellant. Appellant told the officer that his wife was in labor and that he was in a hurry to reach the hospital. The policeman verified the ownership of the vehicle and let appellant continue on his way.</p>

The victim had been shot five times with .38 caliber bullets. Pages 1-14 and 23-36 of the Philadelphia Daily News were found near his body. The officer who had stopped appellant went back to the place where he observed appellant’s passenger discard sheets of newspaper. The papers which he found were pages 15-22 of the same edition of the Daily News and were stained with blood matching the victim’s blood type.</p>

When they neared the front gate, appellant asked his mother to hurry and let him out the back way. Within ten to fifteen minutes police arrived at appellant’s mother’s door.</p>

While we agree that the evidence of possession was relevant and admissible, evidence that appellant twice reached for, aimed, and once almost fired the gun was obviously unnecessary to establish that appellant possessed the weapon. The Commonwealth could easily have shown possession and access in the hours prior to the killing without eliciting detailed descriptions of appellant’s prior conduct. Nevertheless, such descriptions were admitted over appellant’s objections as part of the Commonwealth’s case in chief. As this Court stated in <em>Commonwealth v.
