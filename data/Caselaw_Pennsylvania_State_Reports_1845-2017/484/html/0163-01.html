He was <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>sentenced to eight to twenty years in prison. He appeals the judgment of sentence on the basis that the guilty plea was invalid.</p>
    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[212,512,1147,1004]]]'>Appellant contends that he pleaded guilty without being adequately informed of his rights in the colloquy. He did not petition the trial court for withdrawal of his plea, which was not in accordance with proper procedure. If the validity of a guiity plea is at issue, a written motion for withdrawal must be filed in the trial court. The matter may not be raised for the first time before us. We noted the requirement in <em>Commonwealth v. Lee, </em><a href="/pa/460/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="460 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="482725" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0324-01">460 Pa. 324</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="460 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="482725" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0324-01">333 A.2d 749</a> (1975). In <em>Lee, </em>we considered a challenge to a guilty plea that was not raised in the trial court because we found that the law had not been clear. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em><a href="/pa/482/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="482 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="1749678" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0608-01">482 Pa. 608</a>, <a href="/pa/482/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="482 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="1749678" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0608-01">394 A.2d 488</a> (1978), we held that the law was clear after <em>Lee. Dowling </em>involved a guilty plea entered five months after <em>Lee </em>was decided. We held that a challenge to a guilty plea was waived for failure to raise it in the trial court. <em>Lee </em>was decided on March 18, 1975, approximately eight months before the plea in the instant case. <em>Lee </em>and <em>Dowling </em>are controlling and require a finding of waiver.</p>

Appellant alleges five instances of alleged neglect which mandate a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. Appellant claims:</p>
    <p id="b265-7" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[215,1931,1144,97]]]'>1. Counsel was ineffective because he consulted with appellant only on the morning of the guilty plea.</p>

If, following the hearing, and the making of findings of fact and conclusions of law, it is determined that appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel, and that such ineffectiveness affords a basis for relief, an order shall be entered granting appropriate relief. If it is determined that appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel, then the record should be returned to this court for further consideration of the appeal. <em>Commonwealth v.
