        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nOn July 21, 1986, Appellant, Craig Murphy, was convicted by a jury of murder of the first degree and possession of an instrument of crime. After the verdict was announced, a sentencing hearing was held pursuant to the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711, and the jury unanimously sentenced Appellant to death. Appellant filed post trial motions which were denied by the trial court. This direct appeal followed.\nThe record reveals that on May 11, 1981, Appellant approached Mary Magee, regarding the whereabouts of Ma-gee\u2019s boyfriend, Steven Brown. Brown was an eyewitness to the murder of one Raymond Gambrel, and had given a detailed statement to the police identifying Appellant as the gunman. Brown had recently returned to Philadelphia from Maine where he sought refuge at the home of his brother due to threats leveled against him and his family by Appellant.\nAfter having been in Philadelphia for one week, Brown was shot on May 13, 1981, in front of a residence at 3112 North 15th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The police arrived at the scene at 10:02 a.m. and discovered the victim bleeding profusely from the chest and groin. Brown was transported to the hospital and was pronounced dead that same day at 3:00 p.m. The cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds to the trunk, right thigh and groin.\nAppellant was not charged with the murder of Brown until 1985 when the police re-interviewed two children, Maurice Graves and Wanda Wilson, who in May of 1981 gave vague descriptions of the gunman but did not reveal his identity. Upon being re-interviewed, Graves told the police that he heard gunshots and saw Appellant running away from the scene of the crime. Wilson told the police that she saw Appellant shoot Brown as she sat in her living room in a house across the street from the scene of the crime. Graves and Wilson testified at Appellant\u2019s trial on July 16, 1986, and identified Appellant as the gunman. Graves, who was eight years old at the time of the murder and Wilson, then nine, testified that fear of injury or death prevented them from identifying Appellant when they were first interviewed in May of 1981. Wilson was on juvenile probation at the time of trial. Graves had just completed a term of juvenile probation prior to trial.\nIn this appeal Appellant argues inter alia, that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to impeach the credibility of Graves and Wilson through cross-examination for bias based upon their juvenile probationary status. The standard for reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is whether the underlying claim is of arguable merit, whether defense counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable and whether the defendant was prejudiced. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987).\nIn Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause requires that a defendant in a criminal case be allowed to impeach the credibility of a prosecution witness by cross-examination directed at possible bias deriving from the witness\u2019 probationary status as a juvenile delinquent\u201d. Id. at 309, 94 S.Ct. at 1107, 39 L.Ed.2d at 349. Relying on Davis, this Court in Commonwealth v. Simmons, 521 Pa. 218, 555 A.2d 860 (1989), held that \u201cthe juvenile record of a prosecution witness must be made available to the defense for the purpose of allowing the defense to determine whether there was anything in the witness\u2019s [sic] juvenile record which would indicate that the witness might be biased against the defendant and in favor of the prosecution.\u201d Id., 521 Pa. at 222, 555 A.2d at 862. See also Commonwealth v. Slaughter, 482 Pa. 538, 394 A.2d 453 (1978).\nIn this case, defense counsel was abysmally ignorant of the law regarding the proper method of cross-examining a child witness who is on juvenile probation. At a conference in chambers the trial judge and both counsel discussed the scope of allowable cross-examination of the two juvenile witnesses:\nTHE COURT: Getting into Davis versus Alaska.\n[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, upon reading Davis versus Alaska, I put this before the Court that the witness, Maurice Graves, has just completed a term of probation involving the theft of some coins from a laundromat. This matter\u2014\nTHE COURT: How old is he?\n[PROSECUTOR]: He is 12 or 13.\nThis matter in no way has any relationship to the Commonwealth\u2019s handling of this prosecution. We made no concessions. To be frank about it, my first information concerning a juvenile record was yesterday.\nIt is our position, reading Davis versus Alaska, that counsel has the ability to cross-examine this witness absent going into a juvenile record that is remote or had no bearing whatsoever on this witness coming forth. There is nothing that the Commonwealth can do for a juvenile being handled in Juvenile Court.\nTHE COURT: The one probation has expired, anyhow?\n[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, that\u2019s Maurice Graves.\nTHE COURT: How about the other?\n[PROSECUTOR]: Wanda Wilson is currently on probation.\nTHE COURT: Her age?\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: 15, Your Honor.\n[PROSECUTOR]: And I had no knowledge of that until yesterday, for that had no bearing.\nTHE COURT: What was her adjudication?\n[PROSECUTOR]: Receiving stolen property. It has to do with her returning a purse from a purse snatch.\nTHE COURT: All right.\n[PROSECUTOR]: And I had no discussion with that witness, nor was any favorable treatment given to that witness by the Commonwealth. The overriding concern of these witnesses, notwithstanding whatever problems they had with the Juvenile Court, is a latent fear of the defendant and defendant\u2019s reputation in this case.\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would submit that\u2019s very latent, it\u2019s like five years but Your Honor, the only reason I wanted to include this is because the trouble the kids were involved in was, had to do with, theft which I think is crimen falsi.\nT.T., July 16, 1986 at pp. 2.7-2.9.\nIn Commonwealth v. Katchmer, 453 Pa. 461, 309 A.2d 591 (1973) this Court held that juvenile adjudications cannot be used for crimen falsi impeachment. Defense counsel erroneously sought to impeach the credibility of the witnesses on impermissible grounds while at the same time, due to ignorance, failed to impeach their credibility on legitimate grounds \u2014 to show bias of the witness based upon his or her juvenile probationary status. Although Appellant\u2019s present Davis argument as to Graves is without merit because Graves\u2019 juvenile probation had expired before trial, defense counsel was ineffective in failing to cross-examine Wilson on the basis of her juvenile probationary status.\nWe can perceive of no reasonable basis for counsel\u2019s failure to cross-examine Wilson on the basis of her then existing juvenile probation. In this case defense counsel attacked Wilson\u2019s credibility under the theory of mistaken identity by questioning her ability to view the scene of the crime, her age at the time of the crime, and her failure to identify Appellant immediately after the crime occurred. The Commonwealth concedes that it was also possible to cross-examine Wilson on the basis of bias but argues that both methods of impeachment are inconsistent with each other because the latter theory suggests conscious deception and conflicts with the idea that the witness is in error. These two methods of cross-examination are not inconsistent. In fact, it is likely that the bias theory could have bolstered the theory that Wilson mistakenly identified Appellant as the gunman.\nAppellant was clearly prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance. Wilson was the only eyewitness to the crime and her testimony was crucial to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Although the murder of Brown occurred in 1981, it was only after Wilson was re-interviewed and gave additional information to the police in 1985 that the Commonwealth was able to bring charges against the Appellant. It was incumbent upon defense counsel to bring to the jury\u2019s attention the possibility that Wilson had a motive for testifying against the defendant, whether based upon a formal agreement with the prosecution or a subjective belief that she would receive favorable treatment with regard to her j.uvenile probation. If defense counsel was able to show that Wilson was biased, it would have, in all probability, affected the outcome of the proceeding.\nAccordingly, the judgment of sentence of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.\nMcDERMOTT, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. The record in this case shows that Graves \"had just completed a term of probation.\u201d T.T. July 16, 1986 at p. 2.7. It is not clear whether Graves was on probation the second time he was interviewed by the police when he identified Appellant as the man he saw running away from the scene of the crime. If it develops that Graves was on probation at that time, he would be subject to a Davis cross-examination.\n. This court has consistently stated that it will not consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in a vacuum. Commonwealth v. Pettus, 492 Pa. 558, 424 A.2d 1332 (1981). Thus, in Commonwealth v. Durst, 522 Pa. 2, 559 A.2d 504 (1989) we held that where defense counsel fails to call a particular witness, the defendant must show that the testimony of the absent witness would have been beneficial in proving the asserted defense in order to establish ineffectiveness. Regarding the present claim, however, Appellant need not show that a deal was struck between the Commonwealth and Wilson in order to establish ineffectiveness. As the United States Supreme Court in Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974) stated,\n\"[c]ross-examination is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested____ We have recognized that the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross examination.\u201d\nId. at 316, 94 S.Ct. at 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d at 353, 354. In the within case the Appellant was entitled to have the defense theory of bias presented to the jury via cross-examination of the critical witness.",
