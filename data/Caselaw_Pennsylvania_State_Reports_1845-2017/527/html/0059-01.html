The Association endorsed the Casualty program each year from April 1, 1968 to March 31, 1984. During that time, Casualty provided workers’ compensation insurance to those members of the Association who purchased such coverage. The Association also purchased compensation insurance for its own employees through the Casualty program.

In fact, the Association was an insured, and was a party to one of the insurance policies issued by the insurer. Even if that were not the case, the Superior Court has misconstrued the statute, which nowhere requires that a prohibited contract must exist between the insurer and the insured. Instead, the statute prohibits any agreements, between the insurer and anyone else, which promise rebates, direct or indirect, to insured parties, if the rebates are not set forth in the policy.</p>

This is a correct statement of the law, but it condemns the alleged contract in this case rather than excusing it.</p>
    <p id="b218-8" data-blocks='[["BL_218.9",218,[234,2102,1151,256]],["BL_219.1",219,[182,316,1151,700]]]'>In <em>McDowell, </em>a car dealer was licensed to sell vehicles on an installment basis, and was also licensed as an agent to sell insurance for the vehicles. The dealer arranged financing for the sales so that the buyer was obligated to pay the finance company. The dealer obtained insurance, at stan<a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>dard rates, for some of the vehicles, naming the finance company and the buyer as insureds. As an insurance agent, the dealer received the usual commissions paid by the insurance company to its agents. The plaintiffs, competing insurance agents, charged that because the dealer received a commission on the sale of the insurance, and because it arguably retained a financial interest in the vehicles, the dealer had obtained insurance at a cost below that paid by other purchasers of insurance, in violation of the statute. This court rejected the plaintiffs’ theory, holding that the dealer did not retain any insurable interest in any vehicles, did not pay for any insurance, and did not receive any insurance.</p>
    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[181,1048,1153,1016]]]'>The relationship among the insurance company, the car dealer, and the insured buyers in <em>McDowell </em>differs greatly from the relationship among Casualty, the Association, and the Association’s insured members in this case. In <em>McDowell, </em>the car dealer received commissions solely for itself and its own benefit; the payments were not passed on to the buyers. Thus, neither the dealer nor the insured buyers received insurance at a reduced rate. In this case, by contrast, the Association received payments only on behalf of its insured members. The Association passed on the payments to the insured members and only to the insured members. If the alleged oral contract is enforced, the insured members of the Association will receive insurance protection at a cost below that available to nonmember businesses which seek workers’ compensation insurance. It is this result, not present in <em>McDowell, </em>which is prohibited by the statute. It is immaterial that the payments are indirect, to be made through the Association serving as a conduit.</p>

      <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>There are two reasons why we reject the Association’s assertion that the issue has been waived. First, although the issue was raised clearly for the first time in post-trial motions, both the trial court and the Superior Court considered the issue on the merits. As set forth following Rule 227.1 in the Explanatory Comment-1983, the purpose of the rule is to give the trial court the opportunity to correct its own error. The fact that the defense was presented to, and ruled upon, by the trial court removes the procedure from the realm condemned in <em>Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/457/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="457 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="477868" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0255-01">457 Pa. 255</a>, 257, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20114" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="322 A.2d 114">322 A.2d 114</a>, 116 (1974), where the trial is reduced to a “dress rehearsal” in which the “ill-prepared advocate” hopes that “an appellate court will come to his aid after the fact and afford him relief despite his failure at trial to object,” thus denying the trial court any “chance to hear argument on the issue and an opportunity to correct error.”</p>
    <p id="b221-4" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[189,1286,1153,1068]]]'>What we consider controlling, however, on the question of waiver, is that the alleged contract is illegal under a statute enacted in aid of significant public policies identified by the Pennsylvania legislature. The Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act is humanitarian and remedial in its purpose, which is to provide workmen and their families a quick and sure means of payment for work-related injuries without resort to litigation. <em>See Wagner v. National Indemnity Co., </em><a href="/pa/492/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="492 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1767201" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0154-01">492 Pa. 154</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="492 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1767201" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0154-01">422 A.2d 1061</a> (1980). The Insurance Department Act of 1921 empowers the Insurance Commissioner to administer and enforce the insurance laws in large part to insure the solvency of insurance companies, which, in the workers’ compensation field, is essential to protect the rights of injured workers. Unauthorized favorable insurance rates, such as those allegedly offered by Casualty in this case, undermine the ability of the Insurance Commissioner to protect the sources of compensation benefits which are indispensable to the welfare of injured workers. In <em>Dippel v. Brunozzi, </em><a href="/pa/365/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="365 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1225600" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0264-01">365 Pa. 264</a>, 267-68, <a href="/citations/?q=74%20A.2d%20112" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="74 A.2d 112">74 A.2d 112</a>, 114-15 (1950), this court applied</p>

      <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>the general rule that an agreement which violates a provision of a statute, or which cannot be performed without violation of such a provision, is illegal and void. Where a contract is found to be against public policy “it cannot, under any circumstances, be made the basis of a cause of action. The law when appealed to will have nothing to do with it, but will leave the parties just in the condition in which it finds them.” ... [Wjhenever it appears that the enforcement of a contract would violate public policy the court should refuse to proceed in an action based solely upon it, and should dismiss the proceedings of its own motion.</blockquote>
    <p id="b222-4" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[247,953,1153,472]]]'>(Citations omitted). The illegality of a contract is therefore a question not entirely controlled by the rules of pleading; <em>whenever </em>it appears that the enforcement of a contract would violate public policy, the court should dismiss the proceedings of its own motion. Although the <em>Dippel </em>case predates Rule 227.1, the principle remains viable: the courts of this Commonwealth will not be used to enforce contracts which violate public policy; such contracts are void and the law will have nothing to do with them.</p>
    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.6",222,[246,1443,1152,518]]]'>The final argument of the Association is that 40 P.S. § 275 applies only to policies which insure against “any risk in this Commonwealth.” The membership of the Association is nationwide; most of its members who purchased insurance under the Casualty program are employers located in states other than Pennsylvania. The workers’ compensation insurance at issue in this case, the Association therefore argues, insured against the risk of injuries to workers in foreign jurisdictions, not against any risk in this Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b222-6" data-blocks='[["BL_222.7",222,[247,1987,1152,364]],["BL_223.1",223,[185,303,1151,688]]]'>We must reject this argument. The Association itself is a Pennsylvania employer and purchased workers’ compensation insurance under the Casualty program. Other Association members who participated in the Casualty program were identified as being Pennsylvania employers. That some, or even most, of the participants are businesses located outside Pennsylvania is immaterial. The alleged <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>contract in this case covered risks in this Commonwealth. The interpretation argued by the Association — that the statute applies only if <em>all </em>the risks insured against are in this Commonwealth — would totally emasculate the insurance law and the power of the Insurance Commissioner to enforce that law. Every standard automobile insurance policy issued in Pennsylvania insures against risks <em>outside </em>the Commonwealth, as coverage does not cease when the automobile crosses the border into a contiguous state, yet such automobile policies indisputably must comply with Pennsylvania insurance laws and regulations. The Association’s theory would exempt all of these policies from the statute because <em>some </em>of the risks are not “in the Commonwealth.”</p>
    <p id="b223-4" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[185,1022,1151,423]]]'>This is absurd. Like an automobile policy, a workers’ compensation insurance policy covers risks both within and outside the state where the employer is located. <em>See </em>77 P.S. §§ 1, 411.2. If <em>every </em>risk covered by a policy had to be in Pennsylvania, then no insurance policy would be governed by the prohibition in the statute, and the statute would be rendered a nullity. The legislature did not intend such a result. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) and (2).</p>

Such an agreement is void <em>ab initio </em>and unenforceable. The cause of action stated by the Association does not, therefore, entitle it to relief, and the judgment of the Superior Court must be reversed.</p>
