At the time of the accident, the taxicab company maintained its automobile insurance with appellant, Pennsylvania National Insurance Companies. The policy provided uninsured motorist coverage, as required by statute. The claimant made a demand for uninsured motorists benefits from the policy, which was refused by appellant. As part of that demand, Ms. Johnson requested a copy of the policy, which request was also refused.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Appellant filed preliminary objections, in which they claimed that the language of the policy required that Ms. Johnson pursue her claim for damages through arbitration. The trial court denied the preliminary objections, but certified to the Superior Court the question of whether the parties should be required to settle their claim via arbitration. A divided panel of the Superior Court (Judge Del Sole dissenting) upheld the decision of the trial court, <a href="/pa-super/384/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="384 Pa.

Appellant argues that Ms. Johnson is a third party beneficiary, whose rights are limited by the provisions of the contract. Ms. Johnson argues that her rights are created by statute and that her right of trial cannot be abrogated by a contract she did not sign. The arguments made by each side are compelling.</p>

      <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>The right to uninsured motorist benefits is created by statute. The Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act (“the Act”), 75 Pa.C.S. § 1701 <em>et seq., </em>mandates that motor vehicle insurance policies which are issued or delivered in the Commonwealth for any vehicle registered or principally garaged within the Commonwealth are required to have uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist coverage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The minimum amount of such coverage is also governed by statute. 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1734 and 1715. The Act does not state whether arbitration is required for claims made under the uninsured motorist or underinsured motorist provisions of insurance policies.</p>
    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.4",661,[208,920,1152,734]]]'>Although the legislature has required that insurers provide uninsured motorist benefits in each of their policies, the right of an injured person to recover such benefits is dependent on the existence of an insurance policy. The statute addressing uninsured motorists coverage, 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1731-1736, speaks only to the requirement that insurance policies in the Commonwealth include uninsured motorist benefit provisions. It does not provide that an injured person has a right to uninsured motorists benefits in the absence of a policy. In fact, when there is no available insurance policy benefits for a person injured in an automobile accident, the Legislature has provided for an Assigned Claims Plan under which the injured party may make a claim. <em>See, </em>75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1751-1757.</p>
    <p id="b661-6" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[209,1677,1150,258]],["BL_662.1",662,[267,272,1148,470]]]'>It is axiomatic that when an injured party files a claim for uninsured motorist benefits under an insurance policy, there must be an existing, available policy from which to make that claim. It is furthermore evident that the injured party is bound by the contractual maximum <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>available funds in such policy and cannot request damages from the insurance company in excess of the policy limits (assuming that the insurance policy meets the minimum financial limits required by statute). Thus, when an insurance policy is available, the right to the uninsured motorists benefits is provided by statute, but the maximum amount of the benefits is governed by the insurance policy. We believe this same analysis is appropriate in addressing the instant controversy concerning the requirement to arbitrate.</p>

Historically, this Court has held that third party beneficiaries are bound by the same limitations in the contract as the signatories of that contract. The third party beneficiary cannot recover except under the terms and conditions of the contract from which he makes a claim. <em>Grim v.

Unfortunately, the cases cited by appellee do not fully support the rather sweeping scope of that claim. Rather, these cases all reflect the courts’ policy that insurers are statutorily required to provide a minimum amount of uninsured motorists coverage in each policy they write. Thus, the right to the uninsured motorist benefits is provided by statute, but the method of obtaining those benefits is governed by the <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>insurance policy.

However, that is simply not the case in this situation. No one challenges the right of the signatories to the insurance policy to agree to an arbitration clause, nor is there any claim that the arbitration provision contained in the policy is contrary to any public policy. In fact, this Court has decided prior cases in which there was an agreement between the parties to arbitrate a claim for uninsured motorist benefits. <em>See, State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance v.
