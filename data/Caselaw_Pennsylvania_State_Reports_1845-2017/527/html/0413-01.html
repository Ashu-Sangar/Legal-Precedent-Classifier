In May 1982, two individuals, Mr. Schall and Mr. Curry, formed Shanna Industries of which Mr. Schall was President. From September 1982 to September 1983, Shanna Industries provided cleaning services and supplies to Southeastern University in Washington, D.C., at allegedly overinflated prices. During this time Mr. Curry was the business manager of Southeastern University. As part of the scheme to defraud the University, the two principals conspired to enter into “sweetheart contracts” between the two organizations which involved “kick-backs” to Mr. Curry. As part of this arrangement Mr. Curry signed two checks issued by South<a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>eastern University, one in the amount of $13,291, payable to Shanna Industries, and the other in the amount of $11,-147.17, payable to another company owned by Schall.</p>
    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[257,491,1150,735]]]'>On June 1, 1983, Sarah Miller, Schall’s secretary, went to Curry’s office and obtained the checks from him. Curry insisted that Miller endorse the checks over to him. Miller then contacted Schall, who directed her to endorse the checks and give them to Curry,, which she did. The proceeds of the two checks constituted “kick-backs” from Schall to Curry for Curry’s having induced Southeastern University to enter into the fraudulent “sweetheart contracts” with Shanna Industries. Curry’s wife, Annette, then deposited the checks into the Currys’ saving account. The proceeds of the checks constituted property obtained in furtherance of a scheme and artifice to defraud and as the checks were transported in interstate commerce, the felony in question was thereby committed.</p>
    <p id="b572-5" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[254,1245,1152,738]]]'>Specifically, Respondent’s involvement resulted from being asked by Schall, a former client, to be present when Schall was to be questioned by Federal authorities. As a result of this participation it was alleged that Respondent was requested by Schall to tell a false story concerning the delivery of the two checks. Petitioner claims that Respondent proceeded to tell four different versions regarding the delivery of the checks in question. First he allegedly told one version to the FBI on March 7, 1984; he told a second version to the FBI, the IRS, an Assistant United States Attorney and the Federal Grand Jury on February 20, 1985; he told a third version to the same Assistant United States Attorney; and he told a fourth version at the November 17, 1987, disciplinary hearing.</p>

These versions represented conflicting attempts by Respondent to conceal and legitimize an otherwise fraudulent scheme. The somewhat convoluted history of Respondent’s representations is <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>as follows: in late 1983, Southeastern University auditors discovered that two of their checks drawn in the amount of $13,921 and $11,147.17, respectively, were deposited in the checking account of Mr. and Mrs. Curry. Mr. Curry stated that he was unaware of the delivery of the checks to his wife and that she had deposited them, on her own, into their account. Respondent, knowing this was untrue, confirmed the story to University officials and in an attempt to give an air of legitimacy to the transaction, claimed that he himself delivered the checks to Mrs. Curry. Subsequently, on March 7, 1984, in the presence of two FBI agents, Respondent once again repeated the story of how he personally delivered the checks to Mrs. Curry in June 1983. Mr. Schall, on that occasion, stated that he provided the checks in repayment of a loan that Mr. Curry had in fact, made to him in December 1982. Respondent, when asked whether this version was true and again for the purpose of lending it credibility, indicated that it was true and repeated that he personally delivered the checks to Mrs. Curry.</p>
    <p id="b573-4" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[196,1339,1152,1013]],["BL_574.1",574,[243,307,1147,143]]]'>On February 20, 1985, Respondent was subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury. Prior to his appearance, Respondent told the Assistant United States Attorney, the same two FBI agents, and two IRS agents that in 1983 he delivered an envelope, whose contents he claimed were unknown to him, to Mr. Curry personally and not Mrs. Curry as he stated in prior conversations. Later that same day he repeated this same story before the grand jury. Respondent then, on May 8, 1986, at his arraignment hearing, proceeded to give a third version of the events when he conceded to the judge that he never delivered any checks or envelopes to either Mr. or Mrs. Curry. Finally, at the Disciplinary Hearing held in this matter, Respondent retracted the admission he made to the judge during his arraignment that there had never been any delivery of checks. Instead, he claimed that he never told the authorities on March 7, 1984, that he delivered the checks to Mrs. Curry and further, with regard to his statements to authorities on February 20, 1985, Respondent claimed he merely <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>made a mistake as to the delivery date, that the envelope he brought to Mr. Curry was delivered in May 1982 not June 1983.</p>

In addition, we also find unpersuasive Respondent’s argument that he merely pled guilty to Misprision of Felony as an expedient solution to the possibility of facing numerous additional federal charges. While we appreciate the role of plea bargaining under proper circumstances, Respondent remained free to plead not guilty and chose not to do so. In <em>Commonwealth v.

The record unquestionably shows that Respondent, after consultation with his attorney, voluntarily pled guilty in return for a reduction of sentence pursuant to a plea bargain agreement. The record also demonstrates that the trial judge took great lengths in questioning Respondent to elicit to his satisfaction that Respondent was aware of the nature and consequence of his actions and that the plea was made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. Respondent cannot now come forward to attack his plea and claim his innocence especially since there is no evidence that he ever challenged his plea or attempted to withdraw that plea in the past. In <em>Anthony, </em>we went on to state that “a guilty plea is an acknowledgement by a defendant that he participated in the commission of certain acts with a criminal intent. He acknowledges the existence of the facts and the intent.” <em><a href="/pa/504/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="504 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1787679" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0551-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/504/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="504 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1787679" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0551-01">504 Pa. at 558</a>, <a href="/pa/504/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="504 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1787679" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0551-01">475 A.2d at 1307</a>. As stated in the Report of the Hearing Committee, despite his protestations, “[T]he fact remains that the Respondent did plead guilty to Misprision of Felony.” <em>Hearing Committee Report </em>at p. 5. Finally, we completely dismiss Respondent’s suggestions that because Misprision of Felony is not recognized as a crime in this Commonwealth either by statute or by the common law that somehow he is immune from disciplinary action in this jurisdiction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Not only is such a suggestion absurd and untenable, it is also irrelevant since what really is at issue in a disciplinary matter are the violations of any rules or codes of Professional Responsibility.
