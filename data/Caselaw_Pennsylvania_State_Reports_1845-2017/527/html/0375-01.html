Rather, with respect to the remaining misdemeanor charges, jeopardy does not come into play because the trial court denied appellant’s demurrer to these charges and found as a matter of law that the Commonwealth’s evidence was sufficient to establish appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Commonwealth v.

This “possibility of prejudice” is not sufficient to support appellant’s position that her due process rights would be violated should her trial resume. It is significant to note that following oral argument on appellant’s motion to dismiss the outstanding charges, and upon review of the record, the trial court ordered that the trial should continue. Implicit in this determination is its ability to further hear the case. The trial court, and not this Court, sits at the appropriate vantage point to make this decision and absent an abuse of discretion, it should not be disturbed.
