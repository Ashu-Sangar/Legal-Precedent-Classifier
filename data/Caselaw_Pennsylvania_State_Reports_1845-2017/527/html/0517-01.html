While Isles was in custody Wiehagen attempted to remove Isles’ belt and Isles attempted to strike Wiehagen. Wiehagen responded by striking Isles, which knocked him to the floor. Isles filed a federal civil rights action against Wiehagen and the Borough pursuant to <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 1983">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a>. The Borough was granted summary judgment on the basis that Wiehagen’s actions did not constitute approved or official state or local action. However, as against Wiehagen, a jury awarded Isles $7,500 in compensatory damages upon a finding that while acting in the scope of his duties,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> he acted “instinctively” and used more force on Isles than was necessary.

Thus, since Wiehagen’s conduct in striking <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>Isles does not fall within one of those exceptions, the Borough argues that it is not liable to indemnify. Ironically, the Borough concedes that this argument is inapplicable to the federal civil rights action that is the basis of the case <em>sub judice </em>because a state may not immunize its actors from violations of federal constitutional or statutory rights. <em>Truhe v. Rupell, </em><a href="/f-supp/641/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="641 F. Supp. 57" data-case-ids="3887535" data-case-paths="/f-supp/641/0057-01">641 F.Supp. 57</a> (M.D.Pa.1985); and <em>Buskirk v.

Nevertheless, the Borough argues that despite its lack of immunity from federal causes of action, the Legislature has limited the applicability of the indemnification provided by Section 8548(a) to conduct falling within the eight exceptions to governmental immunity set forth in Section 8542(b). The Borough reaches this conclusion through a strained application of the principles of statutory construction together with reliance upon legislative history. We find nothing in the language of Section 8548 that persuades us that it is limited to conduct falling within the eight exceptions set forth in Section 8542(b).</p>
    <p id="b676-4" data-blocks='[["BL_676.4",676,[248,1331,1152,847]]]'>Section 8548 clearly and unambiguously provides that “the local agency shall indemnify the employee for the payment of <em>any judgment” </em>in an action for injury to person or property brought against an employee where the employee was acting within the scope of his duties. (Emphasis added). Clearly, this section was intended to provide for indemnification for <em>any </em>judgment that may be rendered against an employee while acting within the scope of his employment. There is no reasonable basis to conclude that the Legislature intended to provide for indemnification on the state level but not on the federal level. This interpretation is in accordance with the purpose of the statute, which is to permit local agency employees to perform their official duties without fear of personal liability, whether pursuant to state or federal law, so long as the conduct is performed during the course of their employment.</p>
    <p id="b676-5" data-blocks='[["BL_676.5",676,[248,2201,1151,150]],["BL_677.1",677,[193,316,1147,203]]]'>Accordingly, because there is a judgment against Wiehagen arising from conduct within the scope of his employment, the Borough is liable to indemnify Wiehagen. <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>We must now determine whether such indemnification includes reasonable attorney fees, costs, and expenses, which were incurred by Isles in advancing his Section 1983 claim, and reduced to judgment against Wiehagen.</p>
    <p id="b677-4" data-blocks='[["BL_677.4",677,[190,539,1151,955]]]'>We first note that Section 8548 does not limit the amount of indemnification in any manner, but rather provides that the “local agency shall indemnify the employee for the payment of <em>any judgment </em>on the suit.” (Emphasis added). In fact, through Section 8548(b) the Legislature has actually gone as far as to provide that the employee shall not even be liable for any expenses or legal fees incurred by the local agency during the employee’s defense. These factors alone should be sufficient to compel the conclusion that the Borough is liable to indemnify Wiehagen for the entire judgment, which obviously fulfills the Legislature’s purpose of providing a job environment free from the risk of personal liability. However, the Borough argues that 42 Pa.C.S. § 8553(c), which limits the type of damages recoverable under the Act, does not provide for the recovery of attorney fees, costs, and expenses, and that Wiehagen was therefore not entitled to indemnification for this portion of the judgment against him. We disagree.</p>

The original action for damages that serves as the basis for the within indemnification action was brought pursuant to <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 1983">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a>, not the Act.</p>

Section 8547 actually obligates local agencies in these circumstances to defend the action on behalf of the employee or reimburse the employee for reasonable expenses incurred in defending the action, and as noted above, the employee is not liable for any expenses or attorney fees thereby incurred by the local agency pursuant to Section 8548(b). We are equally convinced that the legal assistance provided for in Section 8547 extends to federal actions in the same manner as the indemnification provided by Section 8548.</p>
