(Richard is the decedent). The couple’s stormy relationship, marked by numerous separations and continuous quarrels, had reached another impass that morning. Early in the day, Yaffa asked Richard, who had a history of drug and alcohol problems, to move out of the apartment until he “straightened up.” Sometime during the day, while Yaffa was at work, Richard removed his clothing from the apartment. Yaffa then requested that her brother, the appellant, move into the apartment, for the dual purpose of assisting her financially and discouraging, by his presence, Richard’s return.</p>

The gun was carried in a pouch, described as a twelve inch long cosmetic travel case with a zipper. Appellant always kept the gun at his place of business during the day, a family-owned automobile repair shop, and carried it home with him each evening. Shortly thereafter, Richard arrived unexpectedly at the apartment.</p>

Richard indicated that he would not comply with the request that he leave, at which point appellant directed Yaffa to call the police.

Richard ignored the request to leave, walked past the appellant and towards the bedrooms while cursing at the appellant. Appellant then went into the kitchen/dining area and sat down, placing the gun back in its pouch, and set it upon the table. Yaffa completed her call to the police and went to see what Richard was doing. Richard came towards her in the hallway between the bedrooms and the living room carrying a sawed-off shotgun. As she screamed, “he’s got the gun, he’s got the gun,” Richard pumped the cocking device, which loads a shell into the chamber. Appellant quickly entered the living room, holding his gun at his side. Richard pointed the shotgun at appellant and appellant fired three shots, two of which struck Richard in the chest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In order to establish that an actor was the aggressor or provoker and, hence, was not entitled to claim a defense of self-defense or defense of others, there must be some evidence to support the inference that the defendant’s acts constituted “an intent to cause death or serious bodily injury.” The facts here simply do not meet that requirement.</p>

The appellant then returned to the dining area and put the gun down on the table. There was no suggestion that the appellant had pointed the gun at the victim, that he had physically assaulted the victim, that he had threatened the victim, or that he had any physical contact with the victim. As such, up to that point, there was no “provocation” as defined by the statute to divest an actor of self-defense rights.</p>

In this case, the appellant introduced the loaded weapon into the conflict long before the victim retrieved his shotgun. Appellant admitted in his amended statement that when the victim refused to leave his own home, appellant left the kitchen and approached him, holding the gun under his shirt. Appellant stated that the victim had seen the weapon and it was at that point that the victim went to the bedroom and got the shotgun. N.T. 12/10/86 at 146-148.</p>
    <p id="b461-7" data-blocks='[["BL_461.9",461,[211,1145,1151,531]]]'>The majority finds a lack of provocation on the part of the appellant from a cold record while the trier of fact, who heard all of the evidence and clearly understood the law, found that appellant was not free from fault in this instance. The record of this case clearly shows that there was sufficient evidence for the trier of fact to find every element of the crimes charged were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Griffin, </em><a href="/pa/511/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="511 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1798761" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0553-01">511 Pa. 553</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="511 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1798761" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0553-01">515 A.2d 865</a> (1986).

    <p id="b461-8" data-blocks='[["BL_461.10",461,[210,1699,1152,368]]]'>Until today, it was well settled that a valid claim of self defense fails when the actor introduces a weapon into an encounter without provocation. <em>See, </em>e.g. <em>Commonwealth v.
