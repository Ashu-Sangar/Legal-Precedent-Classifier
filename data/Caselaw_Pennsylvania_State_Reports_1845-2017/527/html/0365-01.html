However, the majority opinion leaves unanswered the points raised in the dissent in <em>Hackenberg. </em>I continue to believe that the majority’s conclusion in <em>Hackenberg </em>was based upon a misconstruction of the rules of statutory construction, and is inconsistent with <em>Wagner v. National Indemnification Co., </em><a href="/pa/492/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="492 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1767201" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0154-01">492 Pa. 154</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="492 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1767201" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0154-01">422 A.2d 1061</a> (1980).

    <p id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.7",521,[193,918,1151,963]]]'>The question at issue is whether an employee of a self-insured entity injured in a motor vehicle accident in the course and scope of employment by an uninsured motorist is precluded from receiving uninsured motorist benefits from his employer by virtue of the exclusivity provisions of § 303(a) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 Pa.S. § 481(a). The majority finds that the employee is not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits when his employer is self-insured because § 1787 of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act (“MVFRL”), 75 Pa.C.S., dealing with self-insurers does not specifically state that employees of self-insurers may receive benefits under the MVFRL and the Workmen’s Compensation Act. Once again the majority ignores § 1735 of the MVFRL which provides “[t]he coverages required by this subchapter shall not be subject to an exclusion or reduction in amount because of any worker’s compensation benefits payable as a result of the same injury.”</p>

Appellants DeWitt and Lemon are Philadelphia police officers, who were on duty in their patrol car when their vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured motorist. Appellant DeWitt was able to receive uninsured motorist benefits through his personal insurer. However, Appellant Lemon who does not own a car and consequently does not personally have uninsured motorist coverage, was unable to obtain uninsured motorist benefits. Thus, two individuals equally situated except for their ability or desire to own a private automobile find themselves in markedly different positions as to their ability to obtain an adequate remedy despite the fact that their injuries arose as a result of the exact same occurrence.</p>

As explained above, the majority’s construction of the MVFRL, in light of § 303 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, serves to disadvantage a small minority of the citizens of this Commonwealth. Given the broad remedial nature of both Acts, that being to compensate individuals for their injuries, it is not reasonable to construe § 303(a) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act to deny an employee benefits that would be available to him in the absence of his employer’s self-insured status.</p>

Section 1731 contains a general requirement that such benefits be provided whereas § 1787 specifically requires self-insurers to provide uninsured motorist benefits. Normally, an injured party may seek recovery first from the insurer of the vehicle which directly caused the injury and second, from the insurer of the injured party’s personal vehicle. 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1733. Where the injured party is not named on an insurance policy, he may collect benefits through the assigned claims plan pursuant to §§ 1753 and 1754. Coverage under these sections is not barred by the collection of Workmen’s Compensation Act benefits. 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1755. It is thus clear that with the few exceptions provided under § 1752, uninsured motorist benefits are widely to be available.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>
