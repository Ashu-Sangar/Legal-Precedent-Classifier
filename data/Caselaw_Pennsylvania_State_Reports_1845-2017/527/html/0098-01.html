    <p id="b258-5" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[252,1114,1153,311]]]'>On Friday, December 20, 1985, James Yeager, a friend of the victim, Drayton Sphar, telephoned Sphar and asked Sphar to pick him up at the Old Trails Inn.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Sphar arrived at the Old Trails Inn at approximately 10:00 p.m. that evening. Also present that evening at the Old Trails Inn was the appellant, Thomas Gorby.</p>
    <p id="b258-6" data-blocks='[["BL_258.5",258,[249,1442,1152,463]]]'>When he arrived, Sphar was wearing a leather jacket and a chain belt with a buckle which bore his name on the back. He was also carrying a wallet which was embossed with a Harley Davidson emblem. While there, he bought several drinks for Yeager and appellant. He also bought at least one round of drinks for the entire bar that evening. Each time he bought drinks, the victim displayed a large roll of bills which was particularly visible to Yeager and Gorby who were seated next to him.</p>
    <p id="b258-7" data-blocks='[["BL_258.6",258,[248,1932,1149,260]],["BL_259.1",259,[194,311,1149,203]]]'>After a couple hours passed, appellant asked the victim to give him a ride to the Somerset Inn so that appellant could retrieve his car which was supposedly parked in the Somerset Inn’s parking lot. The Somerset Inn is located approximately six miles from the Old Trails Inn. Gorby and the <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>victim left the Old Trails Inn somewhere between midnight and 12:30 a.m. on December 21, 1985, in Sphar’s 1976 dark green, Mercury Marquis. Upon leaving, the victim assured Yeager that he would return to drive Yeager home.</p>
    <p id="b259-5" data-blocks='[["BL_259.4",259,[193,533,1149,361]]]'>At approximately 1:00 a.m. that morning, appellant arrived at the Somerset Inn bar alone. Shortly after arriving, appellant bought a round of drinks for everyone in the bar. He then went into the rest room and after returning, bought another round of drinks for everyone and wanted to again buy everyone a drink about ten minutes later. Each time he bought drinks, he displayed a roll of bills.</p>
    <p id="b259-6" data-blocks='[["BL_259.5",259,[192,913,1152,514]]]'>While at the Somerset Inn, appellant pulled a belt out of his pants similar to the one the victim was wearing earlier that evening. He placed the belt on the bar and it was passed among several of the patrons. Next, appellant gave the bartender, Harold Cain, a wallet which matched the description of the victim’s wallet. Very soon thereafter, he displayed a knife stating that he wanted to show Cain how sharp it was and began shaving Cain’s arm. Cain testified that while appellant was shaving the hair on his arm, he noticed blood stains on the knife.</p>
    <p id="b259-7" data-blocks='[["BL_259.6",259,[192,1454,1150,308]]]'>Appellant remained at the Somerset Inn until closing, whereupon he asked Cain if Cain could drive him to the Old Trails Inn. Cain dropped appellant at the Old Trails Inn between 2:30 and 3:00 a.m. on December 21, 1985. Before leaving the Somerset Inn, Cain noticed Drayton Sphar’s vehicle parked in the lot.</p>
    <p id="AGo" data-blocks='[["BL_259.7",259,[191,1782,1151,575]]]'>When appellant returned to the Old Trails Inn, he again purchased drinks for all the patrons. At that time, appellant was wearing the belt, which was later identified as belonging to the victim, wrapped around his hand. While there, appellant played pool with Nanette Leeper. Leeper noticed dried blood stains on appellant’s pants and when she questioned him as to those stains, he told her that he had been gutting deer earlier that day. Appellant and Leeper left the Old Trails Inn around 4:00 a.m. Leeper last saw appellant when she dropped him off at the Eighty-Four Truck Stop shortly after 4:00 a.m. on December 21, 1985.</p>

      <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>Appellant’s girlfriend, Susan Loveland, testified that appellant called her on Friday, December 20, 1985 and asked her if she had any money. That same day, at approximately 3:00 p.m., she drove appellant to the Old Trails Inn and gave him $20.00. She did not see appellant again until 4:30 p.m., Saturday, December 21, 1985 when she met him and his mother at the corner of LeMoyne and Lockhart Streets, in Washington, Pennsylvania. Appellant’s mother drove Loveland and appellant to the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge where a room was registered in Susan Loveland’s name. It was in this room that appellant confessed to Loveland to killing Drayton Sphar. Appellant told Love-land that he had stabbed Sphar and then slit his throat with a knife. He told her that the killing occurred in the Somerset Inn parking lot in Sphar’s car. He also told Loveland that he had taken money from Sphar. In addition, Loveland testified that appellant had Sphar’s leather jacket and his belt in the room. Later in the evening, appellant placed the victim’s wallet, belt and leather jacket as well as a wash cloth and one glove in a pillow case and disposed of the pillow case in a trash can located on the premises of the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge.</p>
    <p id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[239,1496,1152,473]]]'>On Monday, December 23,1985, John Logar, an employee of the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge, found, while emptying the trash, a pillow case containing a leather jacket, a wallet, a lighter, a belt, a pair of gloves and a wash cloth. Logar testified that after finding the belt, he tried it on and noticed that the name Drayton Sphar was embossed on the back of the buckle. Because Logar had just read in the newspaper about the murder of Drayton Sphar prior to finding the pillow case, he called the County Coroner.</p>

On December 23, 1985, the police filed a Criminal Complaint against appellant and attempted to serve him with an arrest warrant at his mother’s home. When they arrived, Mrs. Stevens informed them that appellant had left her home <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>shortly after being questioned on December 22, and that she had not seen him since.</p>

In reviewing the trial court’s decision, our inquiry must focus upon whether any juror formed a fixed opinion of the defendant’s guilt or innocence as a result of the pre-trial publicity. <em>Commonwealth v.

Pretrial publicity will be deemed inherently prejudicial where the publicity is sensational, inflammatory, slanted towards conviction rather than factual and objective; revealed that the accused had a criminal record; referred to confessions, admissions or re-enactments of the crime by the accused; or derived from reports from the police and prosecuting officers. <em>Commonwealth v.

After reviewing these articles, however, we must disagree. Two of the articles were published within a week of the incident, both of which centered on factual accounts only and contained no references to a prior record or any confessions of the appellant. In March, 1986, an article appeared in the Pittsburgh Press which profiled the area’s ten “most wanted” men. The article mentioned appellant’s name, discussed briefly the facts surrounding the murder, and described appellant’s appearance when last seen. There were two additional articles published four months later when appellant was finally apprehended and extradited to Washington County which, again, contained only minimal <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>facts concerning the murder. Finally, there was an article published in a local newspaper on the day before the trial commenced, the focus of which was the fact that there were, at that time, more suspected murderers being held in the Washington County jail than ever before. With regard to appellant, the article mentioned only that he was arrested in Texas and was awaiting trial for the murder of Drayton Sphar. We cannot conclude that any of the publicity surrounding this incident was either sensational or prejudicial.</p>

The thirty-four potential jurors were asked whether what they had heard would influence their decision during the trial. Only four of those jurors indicated that they may have been influenced, however, none of the four were ultimately chosen as members of the jury.
