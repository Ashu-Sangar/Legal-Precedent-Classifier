The net result is that a successful seller may receive a paper victory only, as the buyer will be unable to comply with the decree of specific performance.

Prior to the closing date, the buyer informed the seller that it was cancelling the purchase agreement because of its inability to obtain the necessary permits. Each of the sellers then filed a complaint in equity requesting specific performance. Some of the sellers additionally sought various monetary damages. The buyer filed preliminary objections asserting that the complaint for specific performance should be dismissed because the sellers had an adequate remedy at law (i.e., money damages).</p>

Even without the court order of November 5, 1987, the sellers’ argument is consistent with the <em>Trachtenburg </em>rationale. The remedial provisions of the sales agreement provide for two options beyond default, applying the deposit towards the purchase price and pursuing the balance in a contract action, or keeping the deposit as liquidated damages. Under the latter option, the sellers would have determined that it was in their best interest to retain the property and be compensated only for the consequential damages suffered, measured by the contractual liquidated damages, while under the former option, the sellers would be able to proceed under general contract principles.</p>
