That Law provides that “[n]o adjudication of a local agency shall be valid as to any party unless he shall have been afforded reasonable notice of a hearing and an opportunity to be heard.” 2 Pa.C.S. § 553.

The Urban Redevelopment Law recognizes “[t]hat certain blighted areas, or portions thereof, may require total acquisition, clearance and disposition ... and that other blighted areas, or portions thereof, ... may be susceptible to rehabilitation or conservation or a combination of clearance and disposition and rehabilitation or conservation____” 35 P.S. § 1702(c.l). Among the specific powers given to redevelopment authorities is the power “to initiate preliminary studies of possible redevelopment areas to make and assist in implementing (1) plans for carrying out a program of voluntary repair, rehabilitation and conservation of real property, buildings and improvements, [and] (2) plans for the enforcement of laws, codes and regulations relating to the use of land and the use and occupancy of buildings and improvements____” 35 P.S. § 1709(b). Indeed, the Law has recently been amended to explicitly give redevelopment authorities the power “[t]o make, directly or indirectly, secured or unsecured loans” and “[t]o make loans to or deposits with, ... without requiring collateral security therefor, any financial institution” to finance, among other things, rehabilitation of a redevelopment program. 35 P.S. §§ 1709(aa), (bb), as amended March 30, 1988, P.L. 304, No. 39.

The testimony was to the effect that real estate, as well as equipment, machinery and fixtures situated are no longer readily saleable on the open market; it is difficult for property owners to obtain mortgages or other loans secured by real estate within the area certified as blighted; business and residential tenants alike have a tendency to move from the area as soon as possible, often before the end of their lease terms, resulting in vacant and boarded-up buildings; and maintenance and repair of the structures within the area are usually neglected by the property owners, further affecting the real estate in a negative way.</p>

It does not establish that legal <em>rights are </em>affected by the certification itself. Indeed, the experience of the parties to this action belies the claim they advance, for they asserted that following the initial certification of blight in 1964, and again following the 1971 certification, buildings were demolished, there was new construction, properties were bought and sold, and buildings were rehabilitated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Although the appellants attempt to negate this fact by arguing that the expert’s assessment applies only where a certification of <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>blight is <em>generally known, </em>this reinforces the conclusion that the deleterious effects flow not from the certification itself but from speculative subjective reactions to it.</p>

As detailed above, we view the decision of the commission to designate an area for redevelopment as one that does not itself affect property rights. It is an internal decision made by a government body presumed to perform its duties in good faith and according to law. Planning commissions, like other government agencies, are not required to conduct their decision-making process according to an adversarial model, bearing a burden of “proving” that their proposed actions conforms to the power delegated to them by their enabling legislation.</p>

The petitioners alleged that the consent of the natural father was not necessary because he had failed to contribute to the support of the child for more than two years. The previous husband was not notified, and did not have the ‘slightest inkling,’ of the pending adoption proceedings. After the adoption had been approved, the natural father learned of the action and promptly filed a motion to set aside the adoption decree. The Texas courts recognized that the natural father was entitled to due process, but held that the failure to give him notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the adoption had been cured by the hearing he received upon his motion to set aside the adoption. The Supreme Court reversed, reasoning that if the natural father had been given the timely notice to which he was entitled, the step-father and his wife (the child’s mother), as the moving parties, would have had the burden of proof at any contested proceeding. After a decree of adoption had been entered, the natural father was faced with the affirmative burden of overcoming that adverse decree by one judge based upon a finding of nonsupport made by another judge.</p>

The Authority discovered that the Mellon-Stuart organization, a company involved in real estate development and construction, had an interest in the redevelopment area.

Interestingly, buildings nearby and similar to the building of the condemnee E-V Company, one as close as fifty feet away, were not taken by the Authority. These neighboring buildings, comparable to condemnee’s building, were privately rehabilitated by their owners. (See Findings of Fact No. 33, Adjudication, Louik, J., February 21, 1986) Apparently, the buildings in which private rehabilitation by the owners was permitted were not the objects of the redeveloper’s desires and plans.

It was encumbered to the extent that it was exposed to the risk that, regardless of how well it was maintained or how it was improved, it could be condemned and taken under the power of eminent domain and turned over to a redeveloper for that redeveloper’s private use.</p>

There was testimony by condemnees’ real estate expert that real estate, as well as equipment, machinery and fixtures situated in a certified blighted area, are no longer readily saleable on the open market; and it is difficult for property owners to obtain mortgages or other loans secured by real estate within the area certified as blighted. Further, business tenants and residential tenants alike have a tendency to move from the certified blighted area as soon as possible, often before the end of their lease terms resulting in vacant and boarded-up buildings. Maintenance and repair of the structures within the area are usually neglected by the property owners, further affecting the real estate in a negative way. (R.Rec. 1034a-1035a). These are some of the effects on the property rights, privileges and immunities of property and business owners in an area certified as a blighted area.</p>

The majority concludes that even though a certification of blight may: (a) depress the marketability of the real estate and the equipment, machinery and fixtures located therein; (b) render it difficult to obtain financing of any kind that is secured by real estate in the certified area; (c) motivates tenants to flee the area, often before leases have expired, resulting in vacant and boarded-up buildings; and (d) result in property owners neglecting maintenance and repair of their buildings further depressing property values, these injurious conditions, nonetheless, do not establish that legal rights are affected by the certification itself.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a>
      <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>The majority ignores the obvious. Prior to the certification of blight in 1964 (“Federal Anderson Area”) and recertification of blight in 1971 (“North Shore Project Area”), the property within the respective project areas could not be condemned and taken by local government and then transferred to a private redeveloper for that redeveloper’s private use. After the certification of blight in 1964 and the recertification in 1971, the property within the area certified as blighted was now lawfully exposed to condemnation and taking for redevelopment and use by a private redeveloper. As the majority points out, among the powers given to redevelopment authorities is the power to make and implement plans for a program of voluntary repair and rehabilitation of the real estate and buildings within the certified area. This results in allowing the private redeveloper to pick and choose the locations within the certified area the redeveloper wishes to redevelop and/or use for the redeveloper’s own private purposes. In this case the private redeveloper, Mellon-Stuart, chose to relocate its own business offices to the property owned by appellant E-V Company and occupied by appellant Keller Office Equipment Company. There is no question that a certification of blight is a decision, determination or ruling affecting property rights, privileges and immunities and thus is an adjudication within the meaning of the Local Agency Law.</p>
