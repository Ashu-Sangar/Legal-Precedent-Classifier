The alleged victim of these crimes was appellant’s five year old daughter. At the preliminary hearing, the victim testified that she did not remember what happened with appellant. The victim was unresponsive to further questioning, and the Commonwealth requested a continuance so that it could prepare a petition to the court seeking to use videotaped testimony at the preliminary <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>hearing. The petition was filed by the Commonwealth, and a hearing held. At the hearing, the Commonwealth presented testimony of a psychologist to the effect that the victim had undergone “emotional freezing” at the preliminary hearing and that the condition could occur again. The psychologist also testified that the victim had become withdrawn following the incident, but was now making psychological progress. The psychologist was concerned that the progress might be impaired if the child was forced to testify in court in the physical presence of her father.</p>

    <p id="b630-9" data-blocks='[["BL_630.8",630,[258,1723,1151,474]]]'>Writing for the majority, Justice O’Connor held that in <em>Coy v.

Since there had been no finding that the particular child witness needed special protection, no reason existed for disallowing face to face confrontation. However, the Court specifically reserved the issue of whether the confrontation clause guarantees an <em>absolute </em>right to a face to face meeting.</p>

Thus, federal case law reflects a <em>preference </em>for face to face confrontation, not an absolute guarantee. However, a face to face confrontation may only be dispensed of where denial is necessary to further an important public policy and where the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured. The Court concluded that a state’s interest in the physical and psychological well being of child abuse victims may be sufficiently important to outweigh face to face confrontation.</p>
    <p id="b631-5" data-blocks='[["BL_631.4",631,[214,905,1151,693]]]'>In a stinging dissent, Justice Scalia, joined in by Justices Brennan, Marshall and Stevens, chastised the majority for applying an interest balancing analysis when the text of the Constitution does not permit it. The Defendant was not requesting an expansive interpretation of the scope of the Sixth Amendment but rather a strict adherence to its words. When a Constitutional guarantee is clear and explicit, as in this instance, an interest balancing analysis is the wrong approach. The confrontation clause does not guarantee reliable evidence but rather it guarantees specific trial procedures that were thought to assure reliable evidence. In effect, the majority subordinated an explicit constitutional protection to “current favored public policy.”</p>

The subjective fears of the witness, without more, are insufficient to restrict this important constitutional right. Since the trial court relied exclusively upon these fears, its actions cannot be affirmed. The appellant is entitled to face his accusers and the failure to protect that right was error. The appellant is therefore entitled to a new trial during which time the victim must testify in the courtroom before the judge, jury and appellant.</p>

Such exceptions demonstrate that a defendant’s right to an in-court, face-to-face confrontation with his accusers is <em>not </em>absolute despite the Pennsylvania Constitution’s use of the words “face to face.” The societal need for using closed-circuit television during some trials is evident, and has been recognized by the legislature as the public policy of this Commonwealth. I fear that the decision of the majority is a virtual license for any miscreant to abuse very young children who, predictably, will be unable to accuse the criminal to his face.

In fact, this Court has recognized the admissibility of dying declarations, excited utterances, and statements of co-conspirators as exceptions to the rule against hearsay even when there has been no prior opportunity for cross-examination and where the prior statements were not made under oath. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Without elaborating, we refer to the facts recounted by the federal Supreme Court in <em>Coy v. Iowa, <a href="/us/487/1012-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="487 U.S. 1012" data-case-ids="1774862" data-case-paths="/us/487/1012-01">supra.</a> </em>The now well-documented, widespread incidence of perverted adults preying upon defenseless children has caused a need to provide realistic protection for the children in our society. Between 1976 and 1985 there was a threefold increase in reported child abuse, so that in 1985, nationwide, almost two million cases were reported. “The prosecution of these child sex-abuse cases poses substantial difficulties because of the emotional trauma frequently suffered by child witnesses who must testify about the sexual assaults they suffered.” <em><a href="/us/487/1012-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="487 U.S. 1012" data-case-ids="1774862" data-case-paths="/us/487/1012-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/us/487/1012-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="487 U.S. 1012" data-case-ids="1774862" data-case-paths="/us/487/1012-01">487 U.S. at 1031</a>, <a href="/us/487/1012-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="487 U.S. 1012" data-case-ids="1774862" data-case-paths="/us/487/1012-01">108 S.Ct. at 2808</a>, <a href="/us/487/1012-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="487 U.S. 1012" data-case-ids="1774862" data-case-paths="/us/487/1012-01">101 L.Ed.2d at 873-74</a> (Blackmun, J., dissenting). This situation has led to a statement of public policy by our general assembly that children who are material witnesses to or victims of crimes need “additional consideration and different treatment from that of adults” and “additional rights and protections during their involvement with the criminal justice system.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 5981. I wholeheartedly agree with the legislature that it is a matter of important public policy for the state, as <em>parens patriae, </em>to protect such children who, due to their youth, labor under a disability when called upon to testify regarding sexual abuse. I regard this policy to be sufficiently imperative to justify the procedure used during appellant’s trial, despite the Constitution’s guarantee of face-to-face confrontation with his accusers. As I observed earlier, the opposite interpretation leads to de facto license of sexual abuse of the very youngest children, who are obviously most in need of protection.</p>
