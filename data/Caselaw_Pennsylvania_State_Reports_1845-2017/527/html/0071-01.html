Summerson, the hearing examiner, conducted a hearing and recommended a decision in favor of Morris, concluding that she had made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination and the Authority failed to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason why Ms. Morris was not hired. The Commission adopted the findings of fact, conclusions of law and opinion of the hearing examiner. On October 28,1987, the Commission entered a final order which directed the Authority to cease racial discrimination and awarded Ms. Morris $22,-265.98 in back pay plus interest.</p>

For if that was all that was necessary to prove, any minority not selected to be interviewed who met the qualifications listed in the newspaper would be able to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. Taken to its logical extreme, that would mean that if 100 persons applied for the job, 50 were minorities, and all 100 met the minimum requirements listed in the job description, any minority not selected would be able to prove a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination — even if the person selected was also a minority. That would be an absurd result. Rather, our case law requires that the unsuccessful candidate establish that she was as well qualified as the candidates selected to be interviewed. For that reason, we believe that the Commonwealth Court was correct in its decision that Ms. Morris failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

First, as Judge Craig aptly notes in his Dissenting Opinion, the Authority should not be permitted to restrict the hiring process by blinding itself to independent facts of which committee members are aware. The Authority’s position that it was unaware of Ms. Morris’ prior work <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>experience because that information was not listed on the application is incredible in light of the fact that two committee members possessed personal knowledge of Ms. Morris’ prior employment with the Authority. Moreover, the qualifications of that previous employment coincided precisely with those of the position the committee sought to fill in the instant case. The Authority also cannot conceivably deny having knowledge of Ms. Morris’ race simply because that fact was not stated on the application; the committee members who were personally acquainted with Ms. Morris most certainly were aware of her race. To paraphrase Judge Craig, the authority should not be permitted to don “vision-narrowing blinders” at its own choosing.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[203,1014,1152,917]]]'>It should also be emphasized that the Court, in determining that the commission’s decision is not supported by substantial evidence, has substituted its own factfindings for those of the hearing examiner.
