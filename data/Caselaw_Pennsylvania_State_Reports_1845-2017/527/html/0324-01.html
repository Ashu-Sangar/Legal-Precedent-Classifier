We reverse the Commonwealth Court and reiterate this Court’s consistent view that the statutory steps for enactment of ordinances are mandatory and nonwaivable.</p>

The township board of supervisors <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>directed the township solicitor to prepare an ordinance authorizing the condemnation of the land for use as a conservation area. The ordinance was prepared, a summary of its provisions was published in a newspaper, and the ordinance was adopted by the board of supervisors on December 22, 1987. No full text of the ordinance was published nor was a copy provided to the newspaper which published the summary, nor was a copy filed in the county law library or other designated county office.

    <p id="b481-4" data-blocks='[["BL_481.5",481,[196,577,1151,566]]]'>In <em>West Conshohocken Borough Appeal </em>we reviewed an ordinance adopted under the Borough Code, and held that due to relatively minor deviations from the statutory recording procedures, the ordinance was not recorded “in the legislative sense” and was therefore invalid. <em>Id,., </em><a href="/pa/405/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="405 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="1303601" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0150-01">405 Pa. at 159</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.2d%20461" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="173 A.2d 461">173 A.2d at 466</a>. The court discussed the legislative purposes underlying the details of recording an ordinance, which were designed essentially to protect public interests, not private ones. The court therefore refused to impose on a challenger any duty to show prejudice in order to invalidate the ordinance.</p>

Notice of public hearings on the ordinance had been published in two, rather than three, newspapers prior to adoption of the ordinance. Again, the purpose was to protect the interests of the public in the legislative process.</p>

It was sufficient for the notice to refer to the place in the township where the maps, plans, or drawings could be examined. The notice in question did not state where they could be examined, although the documents were on file with the township secretary.

We are not dealing with a valid ordinance, but with an invalid one. Knowledge of the existence of an invalid ordinance cannot cure the defect. Failure to follow the express provisions of the law as to publication made the ordinance of no effect. There are numerous cases which hold that the publication of municipal ordinances is mandatory and until complied with as the law directs, such ordinances are ineffective. Until there was a valid ordinance forbidding it, defendants could use their land for cemetery purposes. That they know such a measure was pending can make no difference so far as their rights are concerned unless it ripened into a lawful enactment.</blockquote>
