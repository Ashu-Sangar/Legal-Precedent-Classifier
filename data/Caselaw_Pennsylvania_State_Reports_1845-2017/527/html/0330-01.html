At approximately 7 a.m. on March 16, 1978, Appellee, Linda A. Thompson, was involved in an automobile accident with a school bus. Mrs. Thompson was transported by ambulance from the accident scene to Nason Hospital’s emergency room where she was admitted with head and leg injuries. The hospital’s emergency room personnel were advised by Appellee, Donald A. Thompson, that his wife was taking the drug Coumadin, that she had a permanent pacemaker, and that she took other heart medications.</p>

Schultz, a general practitioner who enjoyed staff privileges at Nason Hospital, entered the hospital via the emergency room to make his rounds. Although Dr. Schultz was not assigned duty in the emergency room, an on-duty hospital nurse asked him to attend Mrs. Thompson due to a prior physician-patient relationship. Dr. Schultz examined Mrs. Thompson and diagnosed her as <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>suffering from multiple injuries including extensive lacerations over her left eye and the back of her scalp, constricted pupils, enlarged heart with a Grade III micro-systolic murmur, a brain concussion and amnesia.

It was during that time that Dr. Schultz consulted with Dr. Rao concerning orthopedic repairs. Dr. Rao advised conservative therapy until her critical medical condition improved.</p>
    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[257,953,1148,424]]]'>Dr. Schultz knew Mrs. Thompson was suffering from rheumatic heart and mitral valve disease and was on anticoagulant therapy. Because he had no specific training in establishing dosages for such therapy, Dr. Schultz called Dr. Marvin H. Meisner, a cardiologist who was treating Mrs. Thompson with an anticoagulant therapy. Although Dr. Meisner was unavailable, Dr. Schultz did speak with Dr. Meisner’s associate Dr. Steven P. Draskoczy.</p>
    <p id="b488-6" data-blocks='[["BL_488.6",488,[256,1409,1148,314]]]'>Mrs. Thompson had remained in the emergency room during this time. Her condition, however, showed no sign of improvement. Due to both the multiple trauma received in the accident and her pre-existing heart disease, Dr. Schultz, as attending physician, admitted her to Nason Hospital’s intensive care unit at 11:20 a.m.</p>

He found that she was unable to move her left foot and toes. It was also noted by Dr. Paris that the patient had a positive Babinski — a neurological sign of an intracerebral problem. Twelve hours later, Dr. Schultz examined Mrs. Thompson and found more bleeding in her eye. ' He also indicated in the progress notes that the problem with her left leg was that it was neurological.</p>

He indicated in the progress notes an “increased hematuria secondary to anticoagulation. Right eye now involved”. Dr. Schultz also examined Mrs. Thompson that day and noted the decreased movement of her left leg was neurologic.

In response to a rule filed by The Nason Hospital, Appellees filed a complaint on July 3, 1979. The complaint alleged <em>inter alia </em>that Mrs. Thompson’s injuries were the direct and proximate result of the negligence of Nason Hospital acting through its agents, servants and employees in failing to adequately examine and treat her, in failing to follow its rules relative to consultations and in failing to monitor her conditions during treatment. Similar allegations were contained in a separate count of the complaint as to Dr. E.D. Schultz’s negligence.

    <p id="b497-8" data-blocks='[["BL_497.10",497,[211,1466,1151,370]]]'>I dissent. The opinion of the majority adopts an entirely new concept of liability, i.e., “corporate liability,” to be applied to hospitals in order to hold them liable as guarantors of the quality of care afforded by independent staff members. “Corporate liability” is totally distinct from the theory of respondeat superior. It is also to be distinguished from liability based upon ostensible agency.</p>
    <p id="b497-9" data-blocks='[["BL_497.11",497,[212,1862,1151,473]],["BL_498.1",498,[257,292,1144,97]]]'>In adopting this new theory of liability, the majority is making a monumental and ill-advised change in the law of this Commonwealth. The change reflects a deep pocket theory of liability, placing financial burdens upon hospitals for the actions of persons who are not even their own employees. At a time when hospital costs are spiraling upwards to a staggering degree, this will serve only to boost the health care costs that already too heavily burden the public. Traditional theories of liability, such as respon<a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>deat superior, have long proven to be perfectly adequate for establishing corporate responsibility for torts.</p>
    <p id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[253,413,1151,358]]]'>Further, in recognizing “corporate liability,” there is no logical basis upon which to limit this extension of liability to hospitals alone. Rather, all corporations, regardless of their lines of business, will be assertedly responsible for the torts of their independent contractors. Fearfully, such extensions of liability could well follow from the present decision.</p>
    <p id="b498-5" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[248,804,1154,312]]]'>In short, I would reverse the order of the Superior Court and thereby reject the theory of corporate liability. The order of the Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment in favor of Nason Hospital was proper, since the alleged tortfeasors were not shown to be agents or employees of the hospital.</p>
