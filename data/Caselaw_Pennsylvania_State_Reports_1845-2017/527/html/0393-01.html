Rubinson. <a href="/pa-super/382/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="382 Pa.

The Superior Court also affirmed in part the order of the trial court which held that a five thousand dollar ($5,000) payment from the decedent to Ms. Rubinson was a gift and not a loan. The issue presented by this appeal is whether the appellant presented sufficient evidence of her putative grantor’s donative intent to establish the existence of a gift.</p>
    <p id="b549-12" data-blocks='[["BL_549.12",549,[197,1948,1151,419]]]'>The facts of this case center upon a long and loving relationship between brother and sister, and that brother’s desire to provide for his sister. Throughout their lifetime, William Lessner and his sister Birdie L. Rubinson were very close. Following the death of his wife in April of 1978, Mr. Lessner developed serious health problems. On several occasions, Ms. Rubinson was called upon to care for her ailing brother.</p>

      <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>On July 18, 1978, William Lessner brought his sister to his bank<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in order to have a fifty thousand dollar certificate of deposit (“1978 C.D.”) issued in both their names. The 1978 C.D. was issued as a replacement for, and purchased with the proceeds of, a certificate of deposit purchased jointly by Mr. Lessner and his late wife in 1975. When the 1978 C.D. matured on April 1, 1979, Mr. Lessner returned to his bank with his sister in order to “roll-over” the proceeds into a third C.D. (“1979 C.D.”) with a four-year term. At no time during the period involved did Ms. Rubinson contribute any money towards the purchase of the certificates in question, nor did she receive any of the interest. Because of Mr. Lessner’s poor health, Ms. Rubinson was given custody of the certificates. However, Mr. Lessner’s health improved and he requested possession of the certificate for the 1979 C.D. The instant litigation followed Ms. Rubin-son’s refusal to surrender the certificate to Mr. Lessner.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Ms. Rubinson claimed Mr. Lessner made an irrevocable gift to her in the amount of fifty thousand dollars when the certificates were issued in joint account form and entrusted to her custody.</p>

Mr. Lessner testified that he issued a check in the amount of five thousand dollars to appellant on July 1, 1982, as a loan. Appellant maintained it was not a loan, but a gift.</p>
    <p id="b550-5" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[233,1770,1150,313]],["BL_551.1",551,[194,310,1151,423]]]'>Following a bench trial, the trial court found, in addition to the preceding facts, that the 1978 and 1979 C.D.’s were issued in an effort to facilitate an inheritance tax-free transfer of money from Mr. Lessner to Ms. Rubinson in the event of his death. However, the trial court found that a gift inter vivos was made by the deceased of both the fifty <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>thousand dollar certificate<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and the five thousand dollar payment in 1982. The Superior Court concluded that the trial court erred in finding the certificate was a gift inter vivos because <em>inter alia, </em>Ms. Rubinson failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Lessner intended to make an immediate gift. The Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s ruling in regard to the five thousand dollar payment, agreeing that donative intent was established.</p>
    <p id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[193,764,1151,577]]]'>Addressing first the issue of the five thousand dollar payment, appellee contends that Mr. Lessner’s claim that the money was a loan was established by corroborative testimony of a witness who had knowledge of Ms. Rubin-son’s intent to approach her brother with a request for money. Ms. Rubinson, on the other hand, asserts that the payment was just one of many monetary gifts made by her brother during his lifetime. Ms. Rubinson also testified that she routinely cashed checks written by, and at the behest of, Mr. Lessner while she was nursing him back to health.</p>
    <p id="b551-5" data-blocks='[["BL_551.6",551,[192,1372,1151,629]]]'>We do not find as persuasive appellee’s argument that testimony corroborating Ms. Rubinson’s request for money equates to a request for a loan. The trial court in this matter noted a course of dealing between the parties in which the appellant routinely cashed checks in amounts close to that at issue herein. There was no evidence of a history of loans between the parties. The trial court also noted that Mr. Lessner’s testimony “vacillate[d] back and forth as to whether he intended to make a gift or if the money involved was a loan.” Slip op. at page 5. As a result, the trial and Superior courts found in Ms. Rubinson’s favor. We find no error.</p>

Mr. Lessner’s executor argues that under 20 Pa.C.S. § 6303, the fact that the account was opened in joint form indicates Mr. Lessner’s <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>desire to retain control of the fifty thousand dollar C.D. during his lifetime. The crux of appellee’s position is that Ms. Rubinson was not to receive any beneficial interest in the certificates until Mr. Lessner’s death. Therefore, appellee asserts that since Mr. Lessner had attempted to revoke this arrangement during his lifetime, Ms. Rubinson has no entitlement.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.4",552,[256,697,1149,525]]]'>Ms. Rubinson’s position is that her brother intended to make an immediate gift to her. She asserts that her brother’s testimony relating to his desire to provide for her demonstrates the requisite level of donative intent under Pennsylvania law to support the finding of a gift. Ms. Rubinson contends further that Mr. Lessner demonstrated his intent to make the gift an immediate one when he delivered to her possession of the certificates in question. Ms. Rubinson contends that her evidence is clear and convincing and therefore that she is entitled to the funds.</p>

It is in regard to this threshold requirement that Ms. Rubinson’s appeal ultimately fails. Our review of the record indicates that the parties had a long and amicable relationship. Mr. Lessner testified about his desire to “leave everything to Birdie.” N.T. 2/25/86 at 25-26. It is apparent from Mr. Lessner’s testimony that his financial decisions during the latter stages of his life were influenced by his poor health and his desire to provide his sister with financial security in the event of his death. Ms. Rubinson relies heavily upon the fact that she retained possession of the certificate to indicate that an immediate gift was intended.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> However, we are not persuaded. The record facts refute the inference of an immediate gift. When the 1978 C.D. matured, Mr. Lessner retained sole possession of the interest that had accrued to that point. The fact that he took sole possession of the interest that accumulated is in direct conflict with the assertion that he had intended to relinquish all rights in that certificate at the time of its issuance in 1978. It is fundamental that the interest follows the principal in ownership. Additionally, the certificate of deposit purchased in 1979 was also placed in joint names as the previous certificate had been, which would strongly suggest that no such change in ownership of the principal occurred as asserted by appellant. These undisputed actions weigh heavily against any inference that an immediate gift of the principle was intended in 1978 or 1979. Viewing all of the circumstances together in this case as we are required to do, <em>In re Sipe’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/492/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="492 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1767183" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0125-01">492 Pa. </a><a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a><a href="/pa/492/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="492 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1767183" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0125-01">125</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="492 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1767183" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0125-01">422 A.2d 826</a> (1980), we agree with the Superior Court that Ms. Rubinson did not present clear and convincing evidence of her brother’s donative intent.</p>
