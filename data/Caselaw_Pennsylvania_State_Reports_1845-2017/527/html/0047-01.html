Superior Court determined that the restrictions were not invalid, however, on public policy grounds: “were we to find the rule against perpetuities applicable to this particular option contract, we would be creating a climate in which grantors would not freely give their properties for public use.” At <a href="/citations/?q=386%20Pa.%20Super.%20434" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="386 Pa.

A fee simple subject to a condition subsequent arises where the provision is that upon the happening of a certain event, the grantor has the right and power to terminate the conveyed estate. See <em>Emrick v.

We concur with Superior Court’s analysis. While it is true that the deeds may be read to create a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent (the condition subsequent would be abandonment of public use followed by the payment of certain sums of money), the deeds can also be read to create a repurchase option conditioned upon the termination of public use. Like Superior Court, to resolve this ambiguity, we turn to the Restatement of Property for guidance:</p>
    <blockquote id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[279,848,1110,747]]]'>If the language and circumstances of a conveyance of an estate in fee simple are otherwise reasonably susceptible of two constructions, under one of which it creates either a possibility of reverter or power of termination, ... and under the other of which it creates an option to repurchase, ... the latter of the two constructions is preferred. The fact that the exercise of the reserved privilege requires the parting with money or other consideration, by the reserving conveyor is sufficiently indicative of the intent of the conveyor to create an option____ The finding of the option, under these facts, furthers the protective policy which underlies the rule against perpetuities, and is in accord with the general constructional preference for covenants rather than conditions.</blockquote>
