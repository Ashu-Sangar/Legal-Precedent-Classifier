Kriston, Jr., was charged with his second offense of driving under the influence of alcohol. A guilty plea was entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, and a sentence of imprisonment of thirty days to twenty-three months was imposed. Appellant commenced serving his sentence at a prison facility on June 15, 1987. On June 24, 1987, he was transferred by the prison warden into an electronic home monitoring program. Transfer to the program occurred without the knowledge or consent of the sentencing court. Under the program, appellant left the prison and returned to his home where he wore an electronic device that would sound an alarm if he ventured more than one hundred feet from his telephone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> He was also subject to the possibilities of unannounced visits from prison officials and random <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>drug and alcohol testing. Appellant spent a total of twenty-six days in the home monitoring program.</p>

The sentencing court denied the petition on the basis that only ten days of the mandatory thirty day minimum sentence had been served in prison. The court directed appellant to serve the remaining twenty days of his thirty day minimum sentence in prison. An appeal was taken to the Superior Court. The Superior Court affirmed, holding that the statutory penalty for driving under the influence of alcohol, i.e., a minimum term of imprisonment, was not satisfied by time spent in a home monitoring program. We agree, but, inasmuch as appellant’s transfer by prison authorities into the home monitoring program was erroneous, the error should not work to appellant’s detriment. Considerations of fundamental fairness require that appellant be given credit for time he served in the program.</p>

The term “imprison<a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>ment” was not defined by the legislature, so it must be construed in accordance with its common and ordinary meaning. See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a) (Statutory Construction Act of 1972); <em>Commonwealth v. Sojourner, </em><a href="/pa/513/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="513 Pa. 36" data-case-ids="1802589" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0036-01">513 Pa. 36</a>, 41, <a href="/pa/513/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="518 A.2d 1145" data-case-ids="1802553,1802589" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0035-01,/pa/513/0036-01">518 A.2d 1145</a>, 1147 (1986) (statutory language is to be construed in accordance with its plain meaning). We believe it would grossly distort the language used by the legislature if we were to conclude that the term “imprisonment” means merely “staying at home.” The plain and ordinary meaning of imprisonment is confinement in a correctional or similar rehabilitative <em>institution, </em>not staying at home. The qualitative differences in treatment experienced by one who is confined in an institution, as opposed to one who merely stays at home, are too numerous and obvious to require elaboration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The legislature would not have intended that its use of the term “imprisonment” would be so diluted in effect as to encompass home monitoring programs.</p>

For example, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9755(a) provides that a court shall, when imposing a sentence of partial confinement, specify “whether the confinement shall commence in a correctional or other appropriate institution.” In connection with a sentence of partial confinement, the court may “grant the defendant the privilege of leaving the institution during necessary and reasonable hours for [certain enumerated purposes including employment and education].” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9755(c). In addition, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9756(a) provides that a court shall, when imposing a sentence of total confinement, specify “whether the sentence shall commence in a correctional or other appropriate institution.” See also 42 <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>Pa.C.S. § 9725 (total confinement involves “commitment to an institution”).</p>

The very existence of such a provision implicitly recognizes that there will be an actual institution from which the prisoner can be <em>released.</em>

Driving under the influence of alcohol is not an offense for which sentencing alternatives are available as a substitute for the mandatory minimum sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

The legislature has expressly removed from consideration sentencing alternatives such as probation and partial confinement in cases, such as the present one, where a mandatory minimum sentence is provided by law. We believe this demonstrates an intent that a mandatory sentence of imprisonment is to be carried out through actual imprisonment in an institutional setting rather than through lesser means.</p>

If the legislature had intended that it would be sufficient for an offender to stay at home, it would not have used the term “imprisonment,” which, by its plain and ordinary meaning and by legislative references to confinement found in the Sentencing Code, must be taken to mean confinement in an institution.</p>

A cure for the problem of prison overcrowding, however, is properly within the legislative realm.

      <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>Appellant argues that even if, as we have held, electronic home monitoring does not constitute imprisonment, he should nevertheless be granted credit for the time he served in the electronic home monitoring program. Appellant’s argument is based upon the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Jacobs v. Robinson, </em>49 Pa.Cmwlth. 194, <a href="/citations/?q=410%20A.2d%20959" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="410 A.2d 959">410 A.2d 959</a> (1980). In <em>Jacobs, </em>a convict was inadvertently released from prison because of a clerical error in recording his sentence. Upon his release, he came under the supervision of probation authorities. When the error was discovered, the convict was taken back into custody. He was denied credit by prison authorities for the time that he was at large in the community under supervision of probation authorities. The Commonwealth Court held, however, that credit towards his sentence must be afforded for the time that he was away from prison. It reasoned that a prisoner has a right to serve his sentence continuously rather than in installments, and that, inasmuch as the erroneous release was attributable to prison authorities rather than to any wrongdoing by the prisoner, the prisoner was entitled to credit for the time in question. We find this reasoning to be persuasive and, in the context of the present case, the considerations that favor granting credit are even stronger than in <em>Jacobs.</em>
