    <p id="b612-8" data-blocks='[["BL_612.8",612,[244,728,1150,526]]]'>This petition arises in the context of the most recent in a series of efforts to reform the courts of Philadelphia. Due to serious and ongoing fiscal and administrative problems in the Philadelphia courts, and the apparent inability or unwillingness of that system to correct the growing deficiencies, this court designated two of its own members to oversee the Philadelphia court system. By order dated December 19, 1990, we unanimously appointed Mr. Justice Papadakos to oversee the budgetary restructuring and Mr. Justice Cappy to oversee the administrative reformation.</p>
    <p id="b612-9" data-blocks='[["BL_612.9",612,[244,1272,1150,529]]]'>On April 17, 1991, pursuant to the order granting him “full authority to approve, implement and monitor all changes deemed necessary and proper to their budgets and to insure that such changes bring about fiscal responsibility,” Mr. Justice Papadakos directed President Judge Blake to terminate the positions of fifty-nine of the sixty-five staff employees attached to his office. Mr. Justice Papadakos took this action after attempts to have President Judge Blake cooperate with him in the restructuring of his office proved to be unsuccessful.</p>
    <p id="b612-10" data-blocks='[["BL_612.10",612,[244,1819,1150,415]]]'>President Judge Blake, together with most of the judges of the court of common pleas of Philadelphia, has petitioned this court to set aside the December 19, 1990 order appointing Messrs. Justice Papadakos and Cappy to oversee the budgetary and administrative structure of the system, and to repudiate the April 17, 1991 directive of Mr. Justice Papadakos which requires the discharge of fifty-nine members of the court staff.</p>

It alleges that the appointment exceeds the supervisory authority granted the Supreme Court in Article V, section 10(a), which provides: “The Supreme Court shall exercise general supervisory and administrative authority over all the courts____” It is petitioners’ position that our appointment of Mr. Justice Papadakos to oversee the budget of the Philadelphia court system is a <em>de facto </em>appointment of the Justice as a president judge, violating both Article V, section 5(a), which requires that a president judge be a member of the court over which he presides, and Article V, section 17(d), which prohibits any court from exercising “any power of appointment except as provided in this Constitution.” The petition refers to Article V, section 10(d), which provides that the president judge of a court with more than seven judges shall be selected for a five-year term by the members of the court, pursuant to which Judge Blake was duly elected in December 1990, and claims that the judges of the common pleas court have been unconstitutionally disenfranchised by the Supreme Court’s action.</p>

V, § 10(a). In furtherance of that responsibility, this court has for some time monitored the administration of the courts of Philadelphia with increasing unease. It was only after lengthy respite to allow the court to reform itself, with no appreciable improvement, that this court ordered Messrs. Justice Papadakos and Cappy to exercise a more direct supervisory role.</p>

The December 19, 1990 order assigning to Messrs. Justice Papadakos and Cappy the task of supervising the budgetary and administrative structure of the Philadelphia court system is effective only “until further order of this Court.” The court is informed of the actions taken by Messrs. Justice Papadakos and Cappy in furtherance of the December 19 order; if such actions fail to satisfy a majority of this court, a “further order” will issue and any inappropriate action will be countermanded. The challenged action by Mr. Justice Papadakos is emphatically not an inappropriate one.</p>
    <p id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[231,1056,1153,1015]]]'>Second, pursuant to the Constitution and the Judicial Code, it is fully within this Court’s authority to prescribe the powers and duties of the president judges and any limitations thereon. The Constitution does no more than establish the office of president judge and the manner in which it shall be filled; it sets out no powers or duties of the office. Although Section 16(f) of the Schedule to Article V adopted in 1967 provided that the president judge “shall be the administrative head of the court and shall supervise the court’s judicial business,” and Section 16(g) specified that the administrative judges of the court’s divisions “shall assist the president judge in supervising the judicial business of the court and shall be responsible to him,” those sections were only effective “[ujntil otherwise provided by law.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In 1976, the General Assembly provided otherwise by law when it enacted the Judicial Code, Title 42 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes.

As the emphasized language makes abundantly clear, the Supreme Court as the governing authority, 42 Pa.C.S. § 102, has the power to alter the duties of president judges described elsewhere in the statute. To the extent that they affected the powers of President Judge Blake, the Order of December 19, 1990 and the April 17, 1991 directive of Mr. Justice Papadakos are consistent with this authority as well as the Court’s general supervisory and administrative authority over the unified judicial system, Pa.

Administrative judges have, since 1980, been appointed by the Supreme Court, and are charged with the administration of their respective divisions. To dispel any vagueness in this distinction, this court entered a directive on April 11, 1986, at No. 55 Judicial Administration Docket No. 1, Eastern District, which specifically defined the duties of administrative judges. The essential portion <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>of that directive requires administrative judges to “appoint and assign all personnel of the division,” paragraph 1(A), 509 Pa. XLI, 506 A.2d LI (1986), as well as a host of other supervisory duties to facilitate the speedy and proper administration of justice. That directive was promulgated pursuant to the Pennsylvania Constitution, Article V, section 10(c) and 42 Pa.C.S. § 325(e). The sixty-five member staff under President Judge Blake duplicates the functions performed by the administrative judges and their staffs, and is thus in large part expendable.</p>

Judge Blake asserts a denial of due process in that he was not given benefit of notice or a hearing prior to the promulgation of the Court’s Order.

President Judge Blake has thus been deprived of no right or interest. Neither is there authority for the proposition that notice and hearing are required before this Court may act in its administrative and supervisory capacity.</p>

Article V, section 10 invests in this Court a “general supervisory and administrative authority over all the courts and justices of the peace____” <em>See </em>Article V, § 10(a). The Schedule to the judicial article, section 16(f), provides for the selection of president judges of the inferior courts and states that that officer “shall be the administrative head of the court and shall supervise the court’s judicial business.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> It is to be noted that the Schedule further provides “[t]he exercise of all supervisory and administrative powers detailed in Section 16 shall be subject to the supervisory and administrative control of the Supreme Court.” Article V, § 16(j).</p>

Thus there must be a legitimate basis articulated for this Court to intrude upon an area which is generally recognized as being within the administrative and supervisory authority of the president judge of the inferior court. The intent of the framers of our constitution to confer qualitatively different powers of control over the administrative and supervisory powers is further evidenced by the description of the power conferred in this Court as being a “general” one. This, in my judgment, was intended to limit the power vested in this Court to systemic concerns. In my view, the petitioners persuasively assert that this Court’s order of December 19, 1990 and the acts taken thereunder exceeded and violated the general supervisory and administrative authority vested in this Court.</p>
