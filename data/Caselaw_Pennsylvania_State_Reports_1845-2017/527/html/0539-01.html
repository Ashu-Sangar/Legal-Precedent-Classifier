    <p id="b694-11" data-blocks='[["BL_694.11",694,[244,1674,1152,357]]]'>The facts underlying this appeal are undisputed. As a member of the Board of Directors of the Borough of Ambridge Water Authority, the Appellant participated in voting to hire high school students as summer employees during the years 1982 through 1985. The Ambridge Water Authority customarily had hired students during the summer months.</p>

One of the individuals hired was the Appellant’s minor son. All of the five directors were present at the meeting, only one of <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>whom voted in opposition to the motion to hire the summer help at a rate of $4.25 per hour.</p>
    <p id="b695-4" data-blocks='[["BL_695.4",695,[220,404,1147,369]]]'>In June, 1983, four members of the Board of Directors were present at the meeting during which a vote was taken to hire a group of nine individuals as summer help at the rate of $4.00 per hour. Of the four members, three voted in favor of hiring the group of nine individuals. The Appellant was present and represented one of the votes to hire the group, which included his son.</p>

    <p id="b695-6" data-blocks='[["BL_695.6",695,[216,1077,1151,637]]]'>By preliminary order dated July 28, 1987, the Commission concluded that the Appellant had violated Section 3(a) of the Ethics Act when he participated in the voting to appoint his minor son to a position of employment in 1982, 1983 and 1984. After a hearing, the Commission issued a final order on December 28, 1987, confirming that conclusion and ordering the Appellant to make restitution to the Ambridge Water Authority in the amount of $4,890.00. This figure represented the total wages earned by the minor son during the three years of summer employment. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the order of the Commission. 124 Pa.Cmwlth. 163, <a href="/pa-commw/124/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="556 A.2d 8" data-case-ids="1385218" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/124/0163-01">556 A.2d 8</a>.</p>

Applying this standard, the most compelling argument made by the Appellant is that the Commission’s interpretation of Section 3(a) of the Ethics Act as having been violated by the hiring of his minor son is manifestly unreasonable.</p>

    </p>
    <p id="b697-4" data-blocks='[["BL_697.4",697,[202,595,1148,206]]]'>Nevertheless, the very same facts distinguishing the <em>Yocabet </em>and <em>McCutcheon </em>decisions warrant close attention, for it is in the application of the Ethics Act to those facts that the legislative intent is realized.</p>
    <p id="b697-5" data-blocks='[["BL_697.5",697,[201,823,1151,746]]]'>In <em>Yocabet, </em>a township supervisor was found to have violated Section 3(a) of the Ethics Act because he had voted for his own appointment as secretary/treasurer while serving as a supervisor and the financial compensation to be paid for the appointment had not been established by the township auditor as required by law. He was required to return the compensation he had received as secretary/treasurer to the township. Under the Second Class Township Code, 53 P.S. §§ 65101-66981, a township supervisor was permitted to appoint himself to the township offices of roadmaster, secretary and treasurer, but the Code required the township’s auditors to set the compensation in that situation. It was undisputed that the compensation had not been established in compliance with the law.</p>
    <p id="b697-6" data-blocks='[["BL_697.6",697,[202,1592,1150,421]]]'>Similarly, in <em>McCutcheon, </em>township supervisors had voted to purchase life annuity policies for their pension fund paid from township funds. Upon resignation from their positions as supervisors, they surrendered the policies and received more than $11,000.00 each. During the years in which they served as supervisors, they also held positions as superintendent of roads and roadmaster. As such they held dual roles as supervisors and employees.</p>
    <p id="b697-7" data-blocks='[["BL_697.7",697,[202,2035,1151,96]],["BL_698.1",698,[242,317,1149,307]]]'>The compensation of supervisors when acting as superintendents or roadmasters was required to be set by the <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>township auditors pursuant to the Second Class Township Code. Compensation was construed by the Commonwealth Court to include pension benefits. Since the township auditors had not provided for the annuities as part of the pension plan for superintendents or roadmasters, it was held that the annuities were accepted in violation of the law.</p>
    <p id="b698-4" data-blocks='[["BL_698.4",698,[239,643,1151,414]]]'>In both of those cases, the Commonwealth Court held that the public officials had violated the Ethics Act by receiving compensation in violation of a statute that required compensation to be established by an auditor. Their conduct was held to be a breach of the public trust. The receipt of compensation other than that provided by law was found to be the type of conflict with the public trust that the Ethics Act was intended to encompass.</p>
    <p id="b698-5" data-blocks='[["BL_698.5",698,[237,1077,1151,565]]]'>In <em>Koslow v. Commonwealth, State Ethics Commission, </em>116 Pa.Cmwlth. 19, <a href="/pa-commw/116/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="540 A.2d 1374" data-case-ids="1372562" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/116/0019-01">540 A.2d 1374</a> (1988), the Commonwealth Court held that Section 403(a) of the Ethics Act had been violated by a township commissioner’s participation in a vote by a board of commissioners to appoint himself as a member of the township municipal authority. The board had voted 3-2 to appoint the township commissioner. By voting for himself, the township commissioner had cast the deciding ballot. The Court held that by casting the controlling vote in favor of his appointment, the vote was illegal and void.</p>
    <p id="b698-6" data-blocks='[["BL_698.6",698,[236,1669,1150,361]]]'>This case stands in stark contrast to those decisions. The receipt of compensation by the Appellant’s minor son was clearly not in derogation of any statutory provision. The Appellant’s participation in the vote was not necessary to establish a quorum.

In interpreting the statute, we are guided by the principle of statutory construction that the Legislature does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>unreasonable. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922. The Commission’s conception of a violation of the public trust has made a mockery of the Legislature’s grave concerns for conduct of public officials that undermines the public’s faith and confidence in their government. We must reject an interpretation of Section 403(a) of the Ethics Act which would encompass the conduct complained of herein because it would produce an absurd and unreasonable result. We hold that the wages paid to the Appellant’s minor son for the temporary work actually performed was not “financial gain other than compensation provided by law” prohibited under Section 403(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
