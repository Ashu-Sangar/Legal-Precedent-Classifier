Appellant Sidney E. Marks instituted this action in trespass against appellees Dr. William Tasman and Dr. William E. Benson, individually and trading as Springfield Realty Associates and against the Montgomery County Industrial Development Authority to recover for injuries sustained when he fell on the sidewalk outside of appellee doctors’ offices.</p>

On September 2, 1983, appellant visited the medical offices of appellees Tasman and Benson, who are ophthalmologists, to have his eyes examined. Because appellant was 89 years old and legally blind at the time, he was accompanied to the offices by a friend, Winfield Codell. After the examination, and as he <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>was leaving, appellant tripped on something and fell on appellees’ sidewalk, fracturing his hip.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At the time of the fall, Mr. Codell was walking in front of appellant and, therefore, did not actually see appellant fall.</p>
    <p id="b288-4" data-blocks='[["BL_288.5",288,[249,528,1152,1228]]]'>On March 6, 1984, appellant filed the instant trespass action containing allegations of disrepair and negligence on the part of appellees. Appellant sought to recover for injuries sustained when he tripped on a large hole or depression in a defective, concrete block of appellees’ sidewalk. Appellees Tasman and Benson filed an answer and a motion to join additional defendants Anthony &amp; Allen Construction Inc., Diseroad and Wolf Architects Inc. and Win-field Codell,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which motion the trial court granted. Appellees Tasman and Benson then moved for summary judgment on December 3, 1986, claiming that appellant failed to establish the necessary element of causation. Appellant responded by submitting briefs, depositions and photographs supporting his position. The trial court, however, concluded that appellant “has failed to prove that [appellees] caused the [appellant’s] accident” and that, therefore, there was no genuine issue of material fact. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment by order of court dated May 16, 1988, and later amended said order of court to extend and apply summary judgment to the additional defendants. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed. Subsequently, appellant filed a petition for allowance of appeal to this Court, which we granted on March 23, 1990.</p>

Having reviewed the depositions presented by appellant in response to appellees’ summary judgment motion, we find that appellant has indeed raised a genuine issue for trial regarding causation, and therefore, summary judgment should not have been granted.</p>
