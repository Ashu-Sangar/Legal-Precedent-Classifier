Appellants argue that it is incongruous to talk about the plan as a harmonious whole when it entails hosting a 250 acre landfill designed to hold more than 33,000,000 cubic yards of waste materials piled to a depth of 200 feet, which will be filled at the rate of 5,000 tons per day over a twenty year period, and which will be delivered by 370 round trips per day — all of this next to a national tourist attraction.

Building Disneyland next to a municipal waste dump strikes one as odd.</p>
      <p id="b390-15" data-blocks='[["BL_390.16",390,[272,2061,1118,306]]]'>Nonetheless, cognitive dissonance is not the deciding factor in determining whether an area is a harmonious whole. Here, the proposed land uses require a coordinated effort of government to allow them to work together. The adjoining rural residential townships have quite different problems than the usages proposed in this application, which will be high in volume of traffic and in the amount and quality of services required, and which will, therefore, require a unified governmental approach.</p>

The first additional claim is that two members of the Borough Advisory Committee were biased and the committee’s recommendation should be either declared void and the minority report should govern, or a new committee should be appointed and de novo hearings conducted. The two members in question resided in the proposed borough and rented property from Morgantown, the sole landowner in the area. One of these members worked for Morgantown and both allegedly indicated to a private citizen prior to the conclusion of deliberations that they favored incorporation.</p>
      <p id="b392-9" data-blocks='[["BL_392.9",392,[286,1566,1116,581]]]'>Appellants objected at the committee hearing that these two committee members were biased and requested that they recuse themselves. They declined. Although the trial court made no findings of fact on the issue of bias, it did not overturn the committee’s deliberations. We also decline to overturn the committee’s deliberations. First, committee members are not judicial officers, who are expected to be aware of the impropriety of commenting on a case in progress. Second, where the statutory committee selection process requires the selection of two persons living within the proposed borough, and where the committee members have done no more than voice the preference for incorporation which might be expected from those who live in the area, we are reluctant to invalidate a deliberative process which has consumed more than 100 hours of testimony, 18 volumes of transcript, and 67 exhibits, and which the trial court declined to overturn.</p>
      <p id="b392-10" data-blocks='[["BL_392.10",392,[286,2159,1118,193]],["BL_393.1",393,[235,600,1118,154]]]'>The Borough Code contemplates that the various members of the committee may have biases for and against the application, and, thus, the membership of the committee is formed by selecting members from different geographical areas. It is not surprising, therefore, that the minority report, opposing incorporation, <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>was written by the two members of the committee who were members of the Board of Supervisors of Robeson and Caernarvon Townships, respectively. On the facts of this case, we perceive no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court.</p>
      <p id="Avu" data-blocks='[["BL_393.2",393,[234,760,1115,234]]]'>The next issue is whether it was error to permit the creation of a borough out of portions of two municipalities where there were no freeholders residing in one of the municipalities. This claim is without merit because Morgantown is the sole freeholder of the entire tract and is a resident of the tract. The fact that its offices are located in one township and not the other is of no consequence.</p>
      <p id="AeG" data-blocks='[["BL_393.3",393,[233,998,1116,196]]]'>Appellants also assert that a limited partnership is not a freeholder residing within the limits of the proposed borough as required by 53 P.S. 45202(a), and is therefore not authorized to petition for the creation of a borough. The applicant in this case, Morgantown Properties, is a Pennsylvania limited partnership.</p>
      <p id="Acn" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[232,1198,1117,353]]]'>The trial court found that Morgantown’s principal place of business and residence is within the boundaries of the proposed borough. Commonwealth Court has held in <em>Canterbury Village Appeal, </em>75 Pa. Cmwlth. 334, <a href="/citations/?q=462%20A.2d%20865" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="462 A.2d 865">462 A.2d 865</a> (1983) that a corporate freeholder may petition for incorporation of a borough. Since Morgantown is a resident of the proposed borough and since corporate freeholders may petition for incorporation of a borough, we agree with the lower courts that there should be no impediment for Morgantown, a limited partnership, to apply for incorporation of a borough.</p>
      <p id="AMpe" data-blocks='[["BL_393.5",393,[231,1555,1118,231]]]'>Next, it is claimed that the Borough Code is unconstitutional in that it requires property ownership in order to apply for incorporation. This argument, too, must fail, for the constitutionally critical consideration is who may vote, not who may apply, and although only freeholders are permitted to apply for incorporation, any resident of the area affected may vote on the issue.</p>
      <p id="A96" data-blocks='[["BL_393.6",393,[231,1791,1118,233]]]'>Appellants also assert that the Borough Code is unconstitutional because it undercuts the right of self-determination of the residents of existing communities. We disagree. The glass is half full, not half empty. The code permits the residents of the proposed borough to voice their views and to determine the form of government under which they will live.</p>
      <p id="AUk" data-blocks='[["BL_393.7",393,[230,2029,1120,313]]]'>Finally, appellants claim that the Borough Code violates Article IX, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. This claim also is without merit. Commonwealth Court properly addressed this issue in <em>Bear Creek Twp. v. Penn Lake Park Borough, </em>20 Pa.Cmwlth. 77, <a href="/citations/?q=340%20A.2d%20642" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="340 A.2d 642">340 A.2d 642</a> (1975), where it held that Article IX, Section 8, relating to the procedures for consolidation, merger or change of the boundaries of a municipality, has no application to the incorporation of a borough. We see no reason to disturb this holding.</p>

It holds that it is an improper motive, but does even suggest that it is the only one conceivable. The applicants here are the sole owners of 3,700 acres with only six occupied homes. They have grandiose plans for what they hope will be a tourist attraction on a landfill capped by a trash to steam plant. The majority would find no possibility of improper motive even if the sole purpose were to avoid local zoning regulations. If applicants are dissatisfied with local zoning laws, they ought not lightly be allowed to start their own <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>municipality to evade those laws. The surrounding municipalities ought not be required to surrender their sovereignty or their land for what amounts to commercial fiefs or zoning raiders. Certainly to gerrymander a new governmental unit between two existing communities to evade zoning regulations is destructive of the “harmonious whole” and the legitimate expectations of settled, self-supporting communities, and to my mind improper motive.</p>
