After the verdict was announced, a sentencing hearing was held pursuant to the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711, and the jury unanimously sentenced Appellant to death. Appellant filed post trial motions which were denied by the trial court. This direct appeal followed.</p>

Brown had recently returned to Philadelphia from Maine where he sought refuge at the home of his brother due to threats leveled against him and his family by Appellant.</p>

Brown was transported to the hospital and was pronounced dead that <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>same day at 3:00 p.m. The cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds to the trunk, right thigh and groin.</p>

Upon being re-interviewed, Graves told the police that he heard gunshots and saw Appellant running away from the scene of the crime. Wilson told the police that she saw Appellant shoot Brown as she sat in her living room in a house across the street from the scene of the crime. Graves and Wilson testified at Appellant’s trial on July 16, 1986, and identified Appellant as the gunman. Graves, who was eight years old at the time of the murder and Wilson, then nine, testified that fear of injury or death prevented them from identifying Appellant when they were first interviewed in May of 1981.

Defense counsel erroneously sought to impeach the credibility of the witnesses on impermissible grounds while at the same time, due to ignorance, failed to impeach their credibility on legitimate grounds — to show bias of the witness based upon his or her juvenile probationary status. Although Appellant’s present <em>Davis </em>argument as to Graves is without merit because Graves’ juvenile probation had expired before trial,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> defense counsel was ineffective in failing to cross-examine Wilson on the basis of her juvenile probationary status.</p>

In this case defense counsel attacked Wilson’s credibility under the theory of mistaken identity by questioning her ability to view the scene of the crime, her age at the time of the crime, and her failure to identify Appellant immediately after the crime occurred. The Commonwealth concedes that it was also possible to cross-examine Wilson on the basis of bias but argues that both methods of impeachment are inconsistent with each other because the latter theory suggests conscious deception and conflicts with the idea that the witness is in error. These two methods of cross-examination are not inconsistent. In fact, it is likely that the bias theory could have bolstered the theory that Wilson mistakenly identified Appellant as the gunman.</p>

Wilson was the only eyewitness to the crime and her testimony was crucial to the Commonwealth’s case. Although the murder of Brown occurred in 1981, it was only after Wilson was re-interviewed and gave additional information to the police in 1985 that the Commonwealth was able to bring charges against the Appellant. It was incumbent upon defense counsel to bring to the jury’s attention the possibility that Wilson had a motive for testifying against the defendant, whether based upon a formal agreement with the prosecution or a subjective belief that she would receive favorable treatment with regard to her j.uvenile probation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> If defense counsel was able to show that <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>Wilson was biased, it would have, in all probability, affected the outcome of the proceeding.</p>
