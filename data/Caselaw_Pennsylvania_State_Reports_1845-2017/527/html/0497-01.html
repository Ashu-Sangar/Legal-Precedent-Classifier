Hence, our juvenile justice system is primarily rehabilitative in nature. <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>Section 6322(a) of the Act provides that “if it appears to the court in a criminal proceeding that the defendant is a child, this chapter [the Juvenile Act] shall immediately become applicable ...” A child, as defined by the statute, is “an individual who is under the age of 18 years.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6302(1). Unfortunately, the statute is silent with respect to the method of computing the age of an individual. Accordingly, it is instructive to refer to the Statutory Construction Act of 1972<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> for guidance.</p>
    <p id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.4",655,[216,776,1153,1392]],["BL_656.1",656,[268,283,1148,313]]]'>Here, we find that specific provisions of the Statutory Construction Act are relevant. Initially, we note that “[t]he object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). In ascertaining legislative intent, “[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage; ...” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a). It is manifestly clear to us that in common usage a person “is under” a certain age until the anniversary date of the person’s birth-date. In enacting the Juvenile Act, we can fairly assume that the General Assembly was fully cognizant of this common conception. Moreover, since the Juvenile Act is rehabilitative in nature, an extension rather than a restriction of the protective period of the Act is consistent with the directive that all but certain classes of statutes “shall be liberally construed to effect their objects and to promote justice.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(c). Conversely, since the Crimes Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> is obviously penal in nature, its application should be strictly construed against the party seeking enforcement and in favor of the defendant. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1). Therefore, we are convinced that the General Assembly did not intend the common law rule, which provides that a person reaches his next year in age the day prior to the anniversary of his birthdate, to apply to the Juvenile Act.

Rather than acknowledge the obvious, that the legislature is fully cognizant of the common law method of computing the age of an individual and is content to leave the statute silent in deference to the common law, the majority embarks on an expedition of statutory construction to ascertain the intent of the legislature. ‘Me thinks’ the majority is tired of the common law and seeks to abrogate it by whim.</p>

For various reasons, the majority presumes the intent of the legislature to abrogate the common law as a remedial step to safeguarding criminally inclined children from the wrath of the law as applied to adults.</p>
