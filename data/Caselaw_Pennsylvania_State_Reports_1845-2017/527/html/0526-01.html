DER also presented evidence that Marra and Fallos, in defiance of a DER order issued October 24, 1989 prohibiting the removal of the waste from the property without prior DER approval, removed the waste and deposited it at an unknown location. Further, DER established that the improper disposal of this waste could implicate the public health and safety.</p>

In the present case, the Commonwealth asserts that the lower court has not had an opportunity to address the Fifth <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>Amendment claim and that, in any event, this appeal is premature because the Commonwealth has not sought to enforce its order.</p>

Petitioners asserted their Fifth Amendment claim in answers to petitions filed by the Attorney General before the Subversive Activities Control Board and in the review proceedings in the Court of Appeals, and in each instance the Attorney General rejected their claims. In failing to register, petitioners risked penalties of a fine up to $10,000 per day for each day of failure to register and/or imprisonment of up to five years. The Court determined that petitioners’ Fifth Amendment claim <em>was </em>ripe because it had been asserted and rejected at every stage below and because requiring petitioners to wait until enforcement proceedings were commenced would be to require them to risk enormous fines and imprisonment.</p>
