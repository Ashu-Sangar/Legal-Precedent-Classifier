Fuisz, </em><a href="/pa-super/386/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="386 Pa.

The decree granted specific performance for a conveyance of real property. The appellant, Margaret Fuisz, is the mother of the appellee, Richard C. Fuisz. Appellee commenced this action against appellant in 1987 seeking specific performance of an alleged oral agreement to convey land. The facts from which this case arose are as follows.</p>
    <p id="b504-15" data-blocks='[["BL_504.14",504,[244,2023,1151,315]],["BL_505.1",505,[203,311,1150,734]]]'>Appellant and her husband, Anton Fuisz, purchased fifty acres of land in Lower Nazareth Township during the 1930’s. The land contained a farm house that became their family dwelling. Years later, during the 1960’s, appellant and her husband gave various parcels of this land to their two sons, Richard and Robert Fuisz. These gifts were <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>accomplished by means of fully executed deeds of conveyance. In 1972, appellee built a separate house on the land. The house cost between $40,000.00 and $70,000.00, and was built on acreage not previously deeded to him, i.e., on land still owned by his parents. Construction was accomplished with the full knowledge and approval of his parents. Appellant assisted appellee in his dealings with various contractors and suppliers during the course Of construction. The land affected consisted of a parcel of approximately two and one-half acres. When the house was completed, appellee used it as his personal residence for approximately seven years. In 1979, appellee became divorced from his wife, and, since that time, he has not lived in the house. His ex-wife and children continue, however, to reside there.</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.5",505,[203,1066,1150,354]]]'>Appellee was eventually offered a deed for the parcel. This occurred in 1982, but appellee did not accept the deed because it did not include a right-of-way to his parents’ driveway or the use of their barn. He preferred not to have to build his own driveway and storage facilities. Due to family disharmony, no further offers to convey were made after 1982.</p>
    <p id="b505-5" data-blocks='[["BL_505.6",505,[203,1446,1152,568]]]'>Property taxes on the parcel have always been paid by appellee’s parents, rather than by appellee, and they have retained exclusive possession and control over a portion of the two and one-half acre parcel which contains a rental cottage. No rent has ever been charged to appellee for use of the land. Appellee paid for his own utilities and for certain other expenses directly associated with the house. Maintenance on the house and lawn was performed mostly by a company that appellee owned, though a maintenance man employed by appellant may have mowed the lawn on certain occasions.</p>
    <p id="b505-6" data-blocks='[["BL_505.7",505,[204,2041,1152,204]]]'>Appellee’s father died in 1982, leaving appellant solely in control of the legal title. Because appellee did not have title, he commenced the present action seeking to obtain it through a decree of specific performance.</p>

He claimed, therefore, that the consideration for the contract consisted of love and affection. In the Court of Common Pleas, the chancellor found that the evidence was insufficient to prove such a contract, but, nevertheless, awarded specific performance on the basis that a parol gift of the property had been established.</p>
    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[242,805,1148,260]]]'>Appellee had not alleged the existence of a gift in his complaint. In her answer to the complaint, appellant alleged that, before becoming alienated from her relationship with appellee, she had offered on various occasions to make a gift of the property but that appellee declined the offers.</p>

Also, appellant is apparently not opposed to simply leaving the house in its present location and allowing appellee’s ex-wife to continue living there. The parties have stipulated that it would indeed be possible to move the house. They have also stipulated that the value of the house exclusive of the land is $81,000.00, and that the land and rental cottage together are valued at $47,200.</p>

Underlying this requirement is a view that delivery of a deed, as is generally necessary under the Statute of Frauds, 33 P.S. § 1, is the normal and proper means for conveying title to real property. Only where it is abundantly clear, leaving nothing to speculation, that a parol gift has occurred does <em>Yarnall </em>permit recognition of the gift. The stringent requirements of <em>Yarnall </em>exist to encourage persons to transfer properties in the proper manner, by means of deeds, and to foreclose the claims of those who might otherwise assert questionable claims of ownership in others’ properties.</p>

The chancellor’s finding of a gift was based largely on inferences. No one, not even appellee, testified that a gift had actually been completed. Rather, the testimony was that the parties expected through the years that the land would eventually be given to appellee. Essentially, a gift was inferred from the fact that appellee constructed a house, on his parents’ property with the expectation that the property would someday be his own.</p>
    <p id="b508-7" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[254,974,1149,468]]]'>Obviously, when one builds a house on property that is not his own, a substantial risk is taken that title to the property will never be obtained. This is so even where, as in this case, the owner consented to the construction. The making of improvements on lands owned by others is a risky undertaking, and certainly does not in itself establish ownership. As stated in <em>Yarnall, </em>supra, the making of improvements is only one of the elements necessary to establish a parol gift of land.</p>
    <p id="b508-8" data-blocks='[["BL_508.6",508,[252,1461,1150,779]]]'>Appellant testified that, before becoming alienated from appellee in 1982, she had been willing to give him the land at any time he might have requested it. She further testified that, in 1972, when the house was built, she told appellee that “he could take the land whenever he wished,” but that appellee did not accept ownership at that time because he thought he might be getting a divorce or because he wished to keep the land in one piece “like a Kennedy compound.” Appellee denies that his refusal to accept a conveyance in 1972 was attributable to the foregoing reasons, asserting instead that he did not wish to complete a conveyance at that time for reasons related to his father’s ill health. He nevertheless admits that he “deferred taking a conveyance” until his father’s death in 1982.</p>

As noted earlier, he was dissatisfied because the deed, as prepared, did not grant him the use of his parents’ driveway and barn. While the statements made by appellant in both 1972 and 1982 would certainly have provided a basis for appellee’s expectation that he would eventually receive the land, they nevertheless fell short of an express declaration of an immediately effective gift.</p>

The chancellor viewed this as lending support to an inference that a gift of the land had been made at some time prior to 1982. We do not agree. When one offers to convey land by deed, it cannot be presumed that the proposed recipient already owns the land through a prior gift. Nothing in the record indicates that the parties viewed delivery of the deed to be a superfluous act, i.e., a mere affirmation of a previous parol gift. All of appellant’s previous gifts of land to appellee had been effected through the delivery of deeds. Appellant clearly viewed delivery of a deed as the act by which she would someday make a gift of the present parcel. Significantly, appellee’s complaint did not even allege that a parol gift had been made. In fact, appellee admitted that until 1982 he deferred taking a conveyance of the property.</p>

Appellee testified that he did not want a deed to the property in the 1970’s because he felt that such graphic evidence of the conveyance of the property would endanger the well-being of his father who was suffering from a terminal illness and had not been told the seriousness of his condition. Appellant testified that her son did not want a deed to the property at that time because he was having marital difficulties and did not want the property to be subject to a property settlement with his wife. Regardless of which evidence is more credible, it is clear that a gift was made and accepted. It was simply a matter of convenience for the parties not to formalize the transaction in writing.</p>
