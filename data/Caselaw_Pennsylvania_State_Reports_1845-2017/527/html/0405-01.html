The issue raised by this appeal is whether the Superior Court exceeded its scope of appellate review by substituting its discretion for the discretion properly exercised by the trial court in imposing a lawful sentence. The majority, by finding that the petition for allowance of appeal in this case was improvidently granted, is once again erring in finding that this Court does not have even the power of limited (or narrow) certiorari to review decisions <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>of the Superior Court which involve challenges to the discretionary aspects of sentencing under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9781(f).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Appellee provided the two men with the woman’s address and led them to her apartment which was located in a shelter for battered women. The three men broke into the apartment from the fire escape, and appellee decided to withdraw from the enterprise only when he discovered that one of the men had a gun and planned to shoot someone. Before leaving the scene, however, appellee spotted the intended victim returning to her apartment, and admitted that he warned his cohorts of her arrival. Appellee then deliberately left the unsuspecting woman to the two armed men who had explicitly sought her out for the purpose of robbing her. The woman and her 16 year old, pregnant roommate were subsequently robbed and raped during the incident.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

He was tried before a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of York County and was convicted of burglary. He was acquitted of the other charges. At appellee’s sentencing hearing, the sentencing judge specifically stated that, in imposing sentence, he would not consider the offenses of which appellee had been acquitted or the derogatory comments made about appellee by police officers in the presentencing report. <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>Appellee was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eight to twenty years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> The sentencing judge explained his reasons for imposing a lengthy prison sentence, as follows:</p>

I’d calculate it to be slightly younger than that. It’s this type of conduct that he was sentenced to Vision Quest for a year and a half and then participated in the teenage wagon train program and was later discharged from the Vision Quest Program, the residential unit in Erie, but it’s important to consider that the assaultive behavior as a youth, the fact that he would take advantage of a five-year-old boy, and the fact that he would be a willing participant in a burglary for purposes of stealing money from a young lady indicates that the Defendant has a propensity towards violence and is, in fact, a danger to society.</blockquote>
