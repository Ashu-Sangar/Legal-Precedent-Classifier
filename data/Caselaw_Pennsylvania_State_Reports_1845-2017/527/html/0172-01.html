Briefly, the history of this case leading to the original appeal in this court is as follows:</p>

The appellees Blackwell, Cohen &amp; Rafferty responded by filing a Petition for Review in the Commonwealth Court seeking to enjoin the Commission from proceeding with its announced investigation. The Commission replied by filing preliminary objections to the said petition for an injunction. Blackwell, Cohen &amp; Rafferty then petitioned the Commission for a stay of the investigation and all further proceedings pending disposition of their Petition for Review by the Commonwealth Court. The Commission denied the request for a stay and proceeded to issue a subpoena upon the First Pennsylvania Bank in Philadelphia requiring the bank to produce the bank account records of appellee Lucien Blackwell and/or his wife, Jannie Blackwell. The appellees, Blackwell, Cohen &amp; Rafferty, inter alia, filed an Application for Special Relief in the Commonwealth Court seeking a temporary restraining order, a protective order and an order quashing the subpoena to First Pennsylvania Bank. After a hearing, the Commonwealth Court stayed the subpoena served upon First Pennsylvania Bank pending dispo<a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>sition of the Commission’s preliminary objections. The request that the Commission be enjoined from continuing its investigation was denied. The Commission filed an appeal in this court from that portion of the Commonwealth Court order which stayed the subpoena. While the Commission’s appeal to this court was pending, the Commonwealth Court heard arguments on the Commission’s preliminary objections. In an opinion by President Judge James Crumish, Jr., the Commission’s preliminary objections were dismissed. Judge James Gardner Colins, joined by Judge Francis A. Barry, filed a concurring opinion which raised a serious question as to the validity of the Leadership Committee procedure authorized by Section 4(4) of the Sunset Act which purported to extend the life of the Commission beyond the date it was scheduled to go out of existence. Under the view adopted by Judge Colins’ concurring opinion, the Commission had gone out of existence as scheduled and therefore it had no jurisdiction to continue the investigation of Blackwell, Cohen &amp; Rafferty. Armed with the arguments embraced by that concurring opinion, the appellees, Blackwell, Cohen &amp; Rafferty filed in this court an application to quash the Commission’s appeal. The application to quash the appeal challenged the very existence of the Commission after June 30, 1988 based upon the premise that the Leadership Committee procedure established by Section 4(4) of the Sunset Act which purported to extend the life of the Commission beyond that date was invalid. Subsequently, in an unanimous opinion and order authored by this writer and filed on December 13, 1989, we held that Section 4(4) of the Sunset Act, 71 P.S. § 1795.4(4) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power and therefore invalid and void. Accordingly, we quashed the Commission’s appeal. <em>Blackwell v.

Because the said appellees did not file an answer, that court treated the motion for judgment on the pleadings as preliminary objections. Appellees Scanlon and Talmadge argued that the State Ethics Commission lacked the authority to bring the action in that the Commission’s life had terminated because the provision for postponing termination by the Leadership Committee was unconstitutional. The Commonwealth Court, in a Memorandum Opinion by Judge Craig, citing our holding in <em>Blackwell II </em>and the Commonwealth Court’s subsequent ruling in <em>Blackwell III </em>sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the suit brought by the Commission because of the Commission lack of standing to initiate it. On January 22, 1990, an order in accordance with that opinion was entered. The Commission filed a timely appeal at No. 10 M.D. Appeal Docket, 1990 from that order.</p>

Eventually, the State Ethics Commission filed a Motion for Summary Judgment which was argued before that court on October 4, 1989.

It is argued that retroactive application of <em>Blackwell II </em>could have unanticipated deleterious effects upon the recent operations of those governmental entities. The various agencies, boards and commissions, which had their respective terminations postponed by the Sunset Leadership Committee, continued to function and conduct business as usual. Many people dealt in good faith with these agencies, boards and commissions after their existences were continued by the Sunset Leadership Committee. Countless transactions were entered into affecting numerous persons. It is all of these transactions, the Commonwealth argues, which are at risk if <em>Blackwell II </em>is applied retroactively. We, however, believe that our decision here limiting application of <em>Blackwell II </em>to the instant appeals and all other pending cases wherein the issue of the validity of Section 4(4) was properly raised and preserved eliminates these concerns.</p>

Before <em>Rodrigue, </em>a line of federal appellate decisions had held that general admiralty law applied to such claims. Under this approach, the timeliness of Huson’s claim was subject to the equitable doctrine of laches, and it had not been contested on this basis. The District Court, relying on <em>Rodrigue, </em>applied the state law one year statute of limitations and held the action time barred. The Supreme Court decided that it was inappropriate to give <em>Rodrigue </em>retroactive effect. <em>Rodrigue </em>had not been decided until more than three years after the injury; it would have been inequitable to hold Huson to a limitations period that had expired before he could have become aware of its applicability. The important point for purposes of this discussion, however, is to note that <em>Chevron Oil </em>involved whether to apply <em>Rodrigue </em>retroactively; the decision in <em>Rodrigue </em>had been applied to the parties in that case.

For purposes of clarity, I believe each of these approaches should be consistently referred to by a single designation, and that cases employing them should be properly identified. The first approach, in which a new rule is not even applied to the parties to the case in which the rule is announced, may be described as giving the new rule “purely prospective effect”. The second approach, in which the new rule is applied to the parties to the ease in which the rule is announced and litigation commenced thereafter, is best described, I believe, as giving the new rule “prospective effect”. <em>Chevron Oil/Rodrigue </em>presents such a situation. The third approach, in which the new rule is applied to the case in which it is announced and all other cases then pending on direct review where the issue is raised, may be said to give the new rule “retroac<a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>tive effect”. This is the general rule adopted in <em>Commonwealth v. Cabeza, </em><a href="/pa/503/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="503 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1785953" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0228-01">503 Pa. 228</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="503 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1785953" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0228-01">469 A.2d 146</a> (1983). The fourth approach, in which the new rule is applied even where the issue has been finally decided at the time of the decision announcing the new rule but later is asserted in collateral proceedings, may be described as giving the new rule “fully retroactive effect”.</p>
