    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.6",305,[215,409,1149,358]]]'>The issue presented in this case is whether, according to Pennsylvania zoning law, the change in the use of property, to which a lawful nonconforming use has attached, from a sandwich shop/restaurant to a full service pizza restaurant constitutes the expansion of the nonconforming use rather than the abandonment of the nonconforming use for a new and different use.</p>
    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.7",305,[214,792,1150,742]]]'>Appellant, Christos Pappas, was a hot dog vendor in the City of Philadelphia for over forty years. On January 16, 1981, Pappas purchased the property and the building at 532 North 15th Street in Philadelphia which at that time had a sandwich shop/restaurant on the first floor and four apartments on the upper floors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Pappas continued to operate the sandwich shop/restaurant for approximately three months. Tenants remained in the apartments until May of 1981, at which time their leases were not renewed. With the premises vacant, Pappas began to renovate the building including the restaurant. Pappas’ intention was to expand the restaurant from a sandwich shop which served primarily take-out food to high school students to a full service pizza restaurant with seating for forty customers.</p>
    <p id="b305-7" data-blocks='[["BL_305.8",305,[214,1553,1152,581]],["BL_306.1",306,[253,282,1149,152]]]'>Although the restaurant was not in operation for three years, from March of 1981 until May of 1984, Pappas continued to renovate the premises during this period. Pap-pas contracted for the installation of new plumbing, lights, counter space and seating. In addition, Pappas, himself, worked on renovations to the property. On December 8, 1982, the City of Philadelphia Department of Licensing and Inspection (L &amp; I) inspected the property and cited Pappas with several building code violations. On August 20, 1982, Pappas obtained a building permit from L &amp; I for construction work to remedy these violations. On October 26, 1983, <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>Pappas was again required to obtain a building permit for construction work to bring the building into compliance due to additional violations discovered by L &amp; I.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[248,457,1152,531]]]'>Renovations to the building continued and in 1984 Pappas obtained a $50,000 loan to meet a bid of $61,318 made by a food service consulting and commercial kitchen design company for the installation of kitchen equipment, appliances, and refrigeration. Shortly thereafter, on May 11, 1984, Pappas received notification from L &amp; I that the building permits previously issued in August, 1982, and October, 1983, had been revoked. The letter stated that the property had lost its nonconforming use status because the restaurant was not in operation for a period of three years.</p>
    <p id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.6",306,[244,1010,1152,853]]]'>Pappas appealed the revocation of the permits to the Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Philadelphia (the Board). After making findings of fact, the Board concluded that “the Applicant [Pappas] failed to present the evidence required to establish that the non-conforming use was discontinued for a period of three consecutive years or less” and denied Pappas’ appeal. (Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law of The Board, September, 1984, at p. 14.) The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas affirmed. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed holding that although the Board erred in placing the burden of proof on Pappas to disprove discontinuance, Pappas had abandoned his original nonconforming use (a sandwich shop) for a new and different use (a full service restaurant). — Pa.Cmwlth.-, <a href="/citations/?q=557%20A.2d%20469" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="557 A.2d 469">557 A.2d 469</a>.
