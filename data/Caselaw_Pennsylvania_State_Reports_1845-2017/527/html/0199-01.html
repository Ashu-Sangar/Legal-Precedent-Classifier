    <p class="author" id="b354-7" data-blocks='[["BL_354.6",354,[304,718,317,42]]]'>CAPPY, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b354-8" data-blocks='[["BL_354.7",354,[257,779,1152,636]]]'>The issue before this Court is whether the Superior Court erred in determining that the mandatory sentence for driving under the influence, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731, precludes a credit for time served voluntarily in inpatient alcohol rehabilitation. We find that time served in such “institutionalized” rehabilitation is sufficient “custody” for purposes of crediting “time served” because it falls within the definition of “imprisonment.” Accordingly, since Conahan was sentenced initially to the mandatory minimum, it was thereafter within the discretion of the trial court to award him credit for the time he served in inpatient alcohol rehabilitation. We therefore reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b354-9" data-blocks='[["BL_354.8",354,[256,1435,1151,419]]]'>On February 8, 1988, the Upper Providence Township Police responded to a motor vehicle accident on an exit ramp of U.S. Route One. The police found an unattended motor vehicle blocking the exit ramp. An officer conducted a search of the area and located John Joseph Conahan, who appeared to be intoxicated. Conahan failed to adequately perform field sobriety tests and was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731.</p>

On October 3, 1988, Conahan pled guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol. 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731. On November 7, 1988, pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(e) the trial court sentenced Conahan (a second time offender) to imprisonment for a minimum of thirty days and a maximum of one year. The trial court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9760 then credited Conahan for his ninety-five <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>days of “custodial treatment” and granted immediate parole. In so doing, the trial court recognized not only the concern of the Legislature with “imprisonment,” but also its concern with educating the public and treating underlying alcohol problems. Accordingly, the trial court determined that time served in a restrictive treatment facility is sufficient “imprisonment” within the meaning of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731.</p>
    <p id="b355-4" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[193,744,1153,627]]]'>On appeal, the Superior Court determined that Conahan was not entitled to a credit for voluntary inpatient alcohol treatment and reversed the decision of the trial court. The Superior Court determined that the legislative history shows that the primary purpose of the mandatory minimum sentence provided in 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(e) was to punish, not to rehabilitate. It further determined that the Legislature did not intend the word “imprisonment” in Section 3731(e) to encompass inpatient treatment programs. Finally, it determined that Conahan failed to establish that his confinement was involuntary. <a href="/pa-super/388/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="388 Pa.

It is not a necessary part of the definition that the confinement should be in a place usually appropriated to that purpose; it may be in a locality used only for the specific occasion; or it may take place without the actual application of any physical agencies of restraint (such as locks or bars), as by verbal compulsion and the display of available force. Every confinement of the person is an “imprisonment,” whether it be in a prison, or in a private house, or even by forcibly detaining one in the public streets. Any unlawful exercise of show of force by which person is compelled to remain where he does not wish to be.</blockquote>

    <p id="b357-4" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[201,608,1149,258]]]'>This conclusion was sufficient to dispose of this issue in that case because it concerned the propriety of a credit awarded for time served in a home monitoring program, which clearly did not involve service in an “institutional setting.”</p>

While it is true that one subject to home monitoring has his liberty restrained and risks being sent to prison if he violates the terms of the program, we could not hold that such a sentence was sufficient to satisfy the goals of the Legislature given the abundant amenities and nonrehabilitative temptations present in the home. However, in the case <em>sub judice </em>our definition of “imprisonment” compels a different result.</p>
    <p id="b357-6" data-blocks='[["BL_357.6",357,[194,1447,1151,420]]]'>Conahan voluntarily committed himself to inpatient custodial alcohol rehabilitation, which he successfully completed after devoting ninety-five continuous days towards overcoming his disease.

To hold otherwise would ignore the true cause of the carnage currently being suffered and a proper manner in which to deal with it.

Accordingly, we hold that the trial court properly sentenced Conahan to the mandatory minimum , term of imprisonment, and then acted well within its discretion in awarding Conahan a credit of thirty days for time served in inpatient institutional rehabilitation and in granting him immediate parole.
