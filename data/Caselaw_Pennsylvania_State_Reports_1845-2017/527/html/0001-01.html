Jarrell had a reasonable pretension of expertise as to the degree of impairment of Ruzzi’s earning capacity in that he had 32 years of experience placing employees in jobs, including <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>injured employees, and in that, as part of his work, he regularly reviewed studies on employment trends, including trends in job placement for injured persons. Shockey’s first assertion of error, therefore, is rejected.</p>
    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[190,533,1150,623]]]'>The second issue, whether earning capacity should have been determined by the jury without the aid of expert testimony, is subsumed in the first. Since Jarrell had a reasonable pretension of expertise in the subject under consideration, i.e., the degree of impairment of Ruzzi’s earning capacity, by definition, he had knowledge relevant to the matter under investigation that was not within the ordinary reach. Since this knowledge was relevant to the issues at trial, and since the jury would not have been aware of this knowledge absent Jarrell’s testimony, it was not error to permit the introduction of this expert testimony.</p>

The speculation, presumably, is whether Ruzzi is in fact a member of the class to which Jarrell referred and whether Ruzzi was limited at all with respect to his economic horizons.</p>

Neither is Ruzzi’s work history both before and after the injury speculative. Ruzzi, a high school graduate, worked in the sign business installing signs his entire working life, and he lost considerable time from work following the accident. It is clear that the doctor’s testimo<a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>ny and the work history, including Ruzzi’s educational background, establish that Ruzzi’s economic horizons were limited. He could not pursue his former job and his work history suggested no obvious alternatives. It is perhaps less clear that the government studies cited by Jarrell were applicable to Ruzzi’s case, since the jury was not told how the injuries of those in the studies compared to Ruzzi’s injuries, but this goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. If defense counsel wished to challenge the application of these studies to Ruzzi’s case, cross-examination and closing argument were available for that purpose.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a> We conclude, therefore, that Jarrell’s testimony was not speculative.</p>

As we have seen, Jarrell had examined Ruzzi’s work history and earnings, had viewed the testimony of Dr. Flit, and had interviewed Ruzzi. When Jarrell took the stand, all of the evidence in the case suggested that Ruzzi had a permanent back injury. The foundation for his testimony was adequate.</p>

The basis of this claim is that at the time of trial Ruzzi was employed by AMG Sign Company at a less physically demanding job, but at the same salary he made before the injury. The error in this claim is that it ignores the difference between actual loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity. This court discussed the difference between these concepts as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.7",166,[284,1884,1110,362]],["BL_167.1",167,[231,307,1109,823]]]'>The defendants contend that there was no evidence of impairment of earning power and that the fact that Bochar’s wages were higher after the accident than before proves no deterioration of earning ability.

Parity of wages may show lack of impairment of earning power if it confirms other physical data that the injured person has completely recovered from his injuries. Standing alone, however, parity of wages is inconclusive. The office worker, who loses a leg has obviously had his earning ability impaired even though he can still sit at a desk and punch a comptometer as vigorously as before. It is not the status of the immediate present which determines capacity for remunerative employment. Where permanent injury is involved, the whole span of life must be considered. Has the economic horizon of the disabled person been shortened because of the injuries sustained as the result of the tortfeasor’s negligence? That is the test.</blockquote>

Earning capacity has to do with the injured person’s economic horizons, not his actual earnings, and the fact that Ruzzi was fortunate enough to earn as much as he had formerly earned, but at a new and less physically demanding job, does not establish that a loss of earning capacity, on these facts, is contrary to the evidence.</p>

It speaks for itself and a meaning cannot be given to it other than that expressed. Where the intention of the parties is clear, there is no need to resort to extrinsic aids or evidence.” Hence, where language is clear and unambiguous, the focus of interpretation is upon the terms of the agreement as <em>manifestly expressed, </em>rather than as, perhaps, silently intended.</blockquote>

(Emphasis in original.) In sum, Pennsylvania’s present law of contract, exemplified by cases such as <em>Steuart v. McChesney </em>and <em>Gene and Harvey Builders, </em>clearly requires that courts give legal effect to the plain meaning of what is written in contracts.</p>

There is no ambiguity in the language of the contract — it provides that the Zinssers will indemnify Butler Petroleum for the type of accident which occurred — and, thus, the indemnity clause should be enforced. As we have stated countless times, it is not the proper function of this court to rewrite contracts for the parties or to substitute our commercial judgment for theirs. Rather, our function is to enforce the unambiguous meaning of contracts which the parties have voluntarily executed. If the contractual obligation is clear, freely entered into, and for a legal purpose, we will not intervene to rewrite the parties’ contract.</p>

Zinsser and Janice P. Zinsser.</p>
