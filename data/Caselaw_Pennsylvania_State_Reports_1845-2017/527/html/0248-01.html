This latter form of removal, following formal charges, investigation by the Board, recommendation of discipline, and action by the Court, may be founded on a wide range of activity, described in subsection (d) — “violation of section 17 of [Article V], misconduct in office, neglect of duty, failure to perform duties, [and] conduct which prejudices the proper administration of justice or brings the judicial office into disrepute”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> If the Constitution provides “conviction for misbehavior in office” as a <em>separate </em>basis for forfeiture, this must be something different from the forfeiture accompanying removal directed by the Court on the basis of the <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>record developed before the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board.</p>

Joseph Cauffiel, the mayor of Johnstown had been indicted, tried, and convicted of, among other things, misbehavior in office. Cauffiel had accepted money in exchange for allowing the operator of a gambling house, who had financed Cauffiel’s mayoral campaign, the “exclusive privilege” of continuing his illegal activity. As part of the sentence, the common pleas court had directed that Cauffiel “shall be and is hereby removed from the office of mayor.” Superior Court had affirmed, and our Court had dismissed his application for writ of certiorari. Before beginning his incarceration, however, Cauffiel had directed the treasurer not to pay any endorsements that he, Cauffiel, had not signed. The attorney general initiated a mandamus action, in which Cauffiel was permitted to intervene, and Cauffiel asserted that the constitutional provision for removal from office was not self-executing, that it required legislation to carry it into effect. We rejected this argument and, holding that the removal had been constitutionally imposed, affirmed the grant of mandamus. Observing that the framers of the Article had to have been aware of the many statutes which, “after defining the crime, say that the defendant ‘on conviction’ shall be fined and/or imprisoned, the penalty being imposed by the court before whom the defendant was convicted,” we concluded that it must have been expected “that the constitutional provision providing for a specified punishment ‘on conviction’ would be interpreted in exactly the same way.” <a href="/pa/299/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="299 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1122312" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0276-01">299 Pa. at 280-281</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20A.%20176" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="149 A. 176">149 A. 176</a>.</p>

We held that the indictment could not be sustained, since Section 1009 of the Third Class City Code of 1931, P.L. 932, provided the penalty of forfeiture of office for the conduct involved — voting on a measure in which they had an interest — and thus abrogated the common law offenses.</p>

This conclusion is not without its difficulties, however. Since the enactment of the Crimes Code effective June 6, 1973, common law crimes have been abolished and “[n]o conduct constitutes a crime unless it is a crime under this title or another statute of this Commonwealth.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 107(b). Thus no prosecution on a charge of “misbehavior in office” can now be undertaken. Rather than reach the difficult question whether the legislature could effectively nullify the constitutional provision by abolishing the crime referred to therein, we think it prudent to adopt a holding under which the constitutional provision may still be given effect. Therefore, we hold that the automatic forfeiture provision of Article V, Section 18(Z) applies where a judge has been convicted of a crime that satisfies the elements of the common law offense of misbehavior in office.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In such cases it will have been established <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>as a matter of record, and beyond a reasonable doubt, that the judge has engaged in conduct directly affecting the integrity of the office. In this light, as indicated above the conviction of a crime that satisfies the elements of what was formerly the common law offense of misbehavior in office may be seen as the “fast track” to forfeiture of office, intended to quickly rid the system of judicial officers who have been shown by proceedings of record to have corrupted the office they hold. The other two “tracks” involve separate proceedings, first before advisory boards and then before this Court, in which the seriousness of the misconduct and its effect on a judge’s qualifications to serve may be weighed.</p>
    <p id="b409-4" data-blocks='[["BL_409.6",409,[195,1077,1152,810]]]'>Proceeding from the premise that misbehavior in office is established by a breach of a statutorily imposed duty, the Board argues that Braig has committed such a breach. The duty, they argue, is set out in Article V, Section 17(b), which provides that “Justices and judges shall not engage in any activity prohibited by law and shall not violate any canon of legal or judicial ethics prescribed by the Supreme Court.” The Board concedes that not every violation of the law, however minor, should be considered a breach of this duty warranting forfeiture under Section 18(Z), even though the language of Section 17(b) contains no such limitation. The Board argues, however, that Braig’s crime, a felony punishable by up to five years imprisonment and $1,000.00 fine, is serious enough under whatever test might be adopted.</p>

As it is stated, it is a negative duty, a duty <em>not </em>to engage in certain conduct. By comparison, in all the cases where violation of a statutory duty was identified as the equivalent of misbehavior in office, the statute required that the officeholder perform a particular act or exercise a function of the office in a particular way.</p>
    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[239,794,1153,469]]]'>We also observe that violation of Article V, Section 17 is specifically identified in Section 18(d) as one of the bases for proceedings before the Board and discipline perhaps less than removal. We noted at the outset, however, that the constitution sets out conviction of misbehavior in office as a basis for forfeiture separate from removal under Section 18. It would thus be unreasonable to find that violation of Section 17 constituted the breach of positive duty underlying the offense of “misbehavior in office”.</p>
    <p id="b410-6" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[236,1283,1152,739]]]'>The Board also notes that under the other two clauses of Section 18(Z), i.e., following disbarment or removal after disciplinary proceedings, a judge may forfeit his or her office for conduct that may not even be criminal. The Board then argues that if “misbehavior in office” does not include serious crimes unrelated to the office, we would be left with the incongruous result that judicial office could be forfeited for non-criminal conduct but not for serious criminal conduct. The Board cites <em>In re Greenberg, </em><a href="/pa/442/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="442 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="1935370" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0411-01">442 Pa. 411</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=280%20A.2d%20370" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="280 A.2d 370">280 A.2d 370</a> (1971), vacated on other grounds, <a href="/pa/457/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="457 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="478544" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0033-01">457 Pa. 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20740" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="318 A.2d 740">318 A.2d 740</a> (1974), where a judge convicted of the federal offense of using the mails to defraud was suspended.

Thus it does not follow, as the Board argues, that serious criminal conduct unrelated to the office will necessarily escape the sanction of forfeiture.

Examining the common law cases, we determined that a conviction of bribery in general did not disqualify a person from giving evidence or serving as a juror. However, the crime was infamous if the purpose of the bribery was to obstruct and pervert the public administration of justice, such as where a person summoned as a witness was bribed to not appear before the tribunal and give evidence.

He had been sentenced to pay a $500 fine, imprisonment of three months, and his office was declared forfeited pursuant to the Act. Citing <em>Commonwealth v.

In light of this, Knox argued that his removal from office violated Article VI, Section 4, since he had not been convicted of misbehavior in office or any infamous crime. Noting that misbehavior in office “is committed whenever a public officer fails to perform a positive statutory duty,” Superior Court held that, “[i]t is not essential to a removal that the public official be validly convicted of the common law offenses of malfeasance or misconduct in office. A removal is justified where the officer has been convicted of the violation of a statute which commands the performance of a positive, ministerial duty of his office.” <a href="/pa-super/172/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="172 Pa.

Justice Flaherty’s zeal to protect the judicial system from any taint that might undermine the public confidence and respect is indeed laudable. As a matter of policy, the distinction he draws between a crime that is <em>malum in se </em>or <em>crimen falsi </em>and one that is <em>malum prohibitum </em>might well be an appropriate basis for determining whether judicial office should be forfeited. This Court, however, is not free to set that policy according to the sensibilities of its members. We have not been given a blank slate. The words of the Constitution cannot be ignored.</p>

At the time present Article V became a part of the Constitution, "misbehavior in <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>office" was still an indictable offense at common law. Justice Flaherty would ignore all this and attribute a new, broader meaning in order to produce results more swiftly and more to his liking. Our decision cannot be viewed as demonstrating a lesser degree of vigilance as to the integrity of the judicial system. Misconduct, of whatever nature, is still subject to penalty. We do nothing more than recognize and uphold the purposeful distinctions drawn by the framers of the Constitution as to when it is appropriate to impose the extreme and irreversible penalty of automatic forfeiture and permanent bar from judicial office.</p>

Anyone holding judicial office who is convicted of a crime which is <em>malum in se </em>or <em>crimen falsi </em>as opposed to one which is merely <em>malum prohibitum </em>should be regarded as having been convicted of “misbehavior in office” for purposes of forfeiture of judicial office pursuant to Art. 5, § 18(Z) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Historical distinctions between these types of crimes underlie the differentiation between automatic forfeiture of judicial office under Art. 5, § 18(Z), clause 1 (conviction of misbehav<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>ior in office) and removal under Art. 5, § 18(i), clause 3 (removal following formal charges, investigation by the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, and action by this Court).</p>
    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.4",414,[247,535,1150,905]]]'>Although the Crimes Code contains no crime denominated “misbehavior in office,” the Constitution’s reference to such a crime as a basis for forfeiture should be construed in accordance with the obvious purpose of the provision, to wit, to remove from judicial office anyone whose criminal record would serve to seriously undermine public confidence in and respect for the courts. The fact that a crime was unrelated to the official duties of a judge is not pivotal, for the Constitutional provision does not refer to “misbehavior in the performance of official duties.” Rather, it merely refers to “misbehavior in office,” which, in view of the purpose of the provision, should be construed to mean “misbehavior while in office.” Allowing persons convicted of serious crimes which are <em>malum in se </em>or <em>crimen falsi </em>to continue in office to administer justice to others, and to serve as purported pillars of respect for the legal system, is nothing less than farcical.</p>
