Upon failure of appellee to pay the requisite amount of support, appellant petitioned the court <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>and received an order of support in the amount previously agreed to by the parties.

Subsequently, appellee became unemployed and upon being unable to comply with the court’s order, petitioned the court to modify the award downward. A single hearing date was set for both petitions. Prior to that date, appellant moved to vacate the order setting a hearing date on appellee’s petition alleging that the support order was not subject to reduction because it was predicated on the parties support agreement which was not modifiable. The trial court agreed and denied appellee’s petition.
