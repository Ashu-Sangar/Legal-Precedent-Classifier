    <p id="b294-4" data-blocks='[["BL_294.4",294,[244,551,1152,745]]]'>Appellant was employed for six and a half years as a clerk for a trucking company until she was laid off in January of 1982. She worked thereafter on a temporary fill-in basis for the company and received unemployment compensation benefits until she exhausted them in 1982. Early in January, 1983, she filed a second year’s claim for unemployment compensation benefits. During the same week in January of 1983, appellant secured a job as a waitress at T.G.I. Fridays. After an initial training period of four hours a day for two weeks, she was required to work twenty-five hours a week on either of two shifts — a day shift (10:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.) and a late night shift (4:30 p.m. until 3:00 a.m.), with schedules changing for every waitress each week.</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[242,1316,1151,582]]]'>Appellant is a single parent of two children who were aged nine and thirteen during the relevant time period. Appellant’s mother cared for the children in appellant’s home during both of appellant’s shifts. On February 7, 1983, appellant’s mother cracked a bone in her elbow. Although the injury was treated only with a sling for seventeen days, it did cause enough pain that appellant’s mother was unable to drive a vehicle to appellant’s residence, was unable to cook, was unable to provide transportation the children needed, and was unable to otherwise provide adequate care for the children.</p>

She made inquiries of her sisters, former baby-sitters, and a day care center in an effort to find replacement care for her children, but no care was available during the hours after 6:00 p.m. Her mother also <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>searched and made inquiries in an effort to find replacement care. Appellant requested that her employer place her in a position that required only day shift work, but this request was denied. Appellant had not accrued any sick leave or vacation time in the four weeks that she had worked at T.G.I. Fridays; thus, she was unable to take a leave of absence. Not willing to risk the safety and well-being of her children by leaving them home alone until 3:00 in the morning, appellant terminated her employment on February 9, 1983.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b295-4" data-blocks='[["BL_295.4",295,[189,857,1152,526]]]'>The Office of Employment Security denied appellant’s application for unemployment compensation benefits. Appellant filed an appeal, and a hearing was held before a referee. Appellee’s employer did not participate in the proceeding. The referee determined that because appellant did not show 1) that her baby-sitting problems were “insurmountable,” and 2) that she had made any attempt to remain employed, appellant did not have necessitous and compelling reasons for a voluntary termination, and was thus not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits.</p>

The Board affirmed the decision of the referee. Appellant filed an appeal to the Commonwealth Court which, applying a reasonable person standard to appellant’s conduct, held that appellant did not show necessitous and compelling reasons for her voluntary termination. However, Commonwealth Court ordered the case remanded for a further hearing on appellant’s job status at the time she worked for T.G.I. Fridays. The Commonwealth Court determined that if appellant worked part-time during the week that she had applied for unemployment compensation benefits, she would be entitled to collect partial benefits for the four weeks that she worked at T.G.I. Fridays. 43 P.S. § 753(w)(l). Appellant then filed a petition for allowance of appeal to this Court which was granted. Shortly before oral argument, <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>appellee filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the order of the Commonwealth Court was interlocutory.

Finding that appellant had been employed part-time at T.G.I. Fridays, the Board ruled that she was eligible for partial benefits for the time that she worked at T.G.I. Fridays as a waitress. Appellant filed an appeal to Commonwealth Court in regard to her eligibility for benefits for the time period subsequent to her termination of employment at T.G.I. Fridays. Commonwealth Court affirmed, and we granted appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal and now reverse.</p>

Considering the hours that appellant was required to work, we believe that any reasonable person who had to find child care on this short notice would have done what appellant did. Claimants need not place their children with strangers or unchecked day care agencies<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> in order to show that they have met the aforesaid standards that we impose upon them.</p>
    <p id="b297-6" data-blocks='[["BL_297.7",297,[188,1226,1152,812]]]'>Appellant’s efforts to provide for her family were commendable. She could have stayed home and collected unemployment compensation benefits after the trucking company, where she had been earning $11.89 an hour, laid her off. But no! She instead obtained employment as a waitress where her base pay was $2.01 an hour. She had not yet completed her probationary period of employment with T.G.I. Fridays when her mother was incapacitated. She attempted to find someone or an agency, to no avail, to watch her children while she was at work, and, additionally, she sought to arrange a different schedule with her employer. The employer declined to accommodate her either temporarily or permanently. There is nothing more that we can or should ask of an employee before that employee terminates his or her employment.</p>
