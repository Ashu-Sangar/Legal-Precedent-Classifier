This motion was denied by the trial court, and he was sentenced to consecutive periods of incarceration from four months to eighteen months imprisonment on the Driving Under the Influence conviction and two months on the Driving Under Suspension conviction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant appealed his judgment of sentence, <em>pro se, </em>to the Superior Court which affirmed by <em>per curiam </em>order. <a href="/citations/?q=396%20Pa.%20Super.%20655" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="396 Pa.

Thereafter, appellant filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal, which we granted to examine the issue of whether the trial court erred in refusing to permit the appellant to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>
    <p id="b701-5" data-blocks='[["BL_701.4",701,[193,974,1149,480]]]'>The appellant argues that on the day of his trial he informed the court that he had not spoken to his public defender until that same day, and he requested a continuance to obtain new counsel. He further contends that the Defender’s Office failed to honor his request to file a pretrial suppression motion. It is and has been appellant’s position that the trial court’s refusal of his continuance request had a coercive effect upon his guilty plea, thereby rendering the plea involuntary.</p>

The Commonwealth also contends that there was no evi<a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>dence that counsel refused to file the suppression motion and that this motion was nevertheless without merit.</p>

In analyzing what is fair and just, it has been found by this Court that a knowing and intelligent guilty plea will not be abrogated by a subsequent assertion of a speculative right where such purported right does not call into question the factual basis for the plea and/or the voluntariness of the plea. <em>Commonwealth v. Anthony, </em><a href="/pa/504/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="504 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1787679" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0551-01">504 Pa. 551</a>, <a href="/pa/504/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="504 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1787679" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0551-01">475 A.2d 1303</a> (1984).</p>

As regards to the voluntariness of the plea, it should be noted that prior to entering the plea, appellant was given the opportunity to consult with counsel of his choice, after which he made an on the record declaration that he would continue to be represented by the assigned public defender. Moreover, the record of the colloquy reflects that appellant demonstrated no hesitation in his answer to the judge’s question during the course of his guilty plea colloquy:</p>
