Pierson, by instrument under seal, dated March 28, 1899, for $300, the assignment, including also the interest of the assignor in the estate of his grandfather, William S. Lower, shown by the adjudication of the account of the trustee under the grandfather’s will, of even date with the present adjudication, to be $778.05. Whether this was intended as an absolute assignment or simply as collateral to a loan, did not appear; but as no objection was made on behalf of Horace Jackson, and as the petition for distribution refers to a prior assignment to Roberts C. Banes, payment is awarded to the second assignee, subject to such sum, if any, as may be due under the prior assignment, and subject to such equity as the assignor may have under such second assignment.</p>

Jackson to <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>Henry S. Hallman, October 27, 1900, in consideration of the payment of $600. This assignment, like that of Horace Jackson, recites at length the will of Francis H. Jackson, Sr., the present testator, and also the will of William S. Lower; and after stating that “ the said Francis H. Jackson is now in need of money and has considered that it would be advisable to sell his interest in the said two estates rather than wait until the death of Mary H. Jackson, who is entitled to life rights in the said respective fund, assigns, in terms, all rights of the assignor in the estate of “ the said Francis H. Jackson, deceased, and the estate of the said William S. Lower.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b65-4" data-blocks='[["BL_65.4",65,[114,958,1189,926]]]'>It was conceded by Mr. Harrington, on behalf of Francis H. Jackson, that the assignment was intended to pass, and that it did pass, the interest in the estate of William S. Lower; but it was contended that the insertion in the instrument of the interest under the will of Francis H. Jackson, Sr., was fraudulent, and that the assignor did not understand that he was assigning it. The evidence, however, fails to sustain this assertion. The assignor resides in New York, and received the paper several days before its execution. He had ample time to examine it, and its terms are too clear to permit of misunderstanding. He is a young man of at least ordinary intelligence; and while, as the instrument itself shows, he was, unquestionably, “in need of money,” and while the consideration was wholly disproportioned to the value of what he was parting with, he was dealing with his own, and was at liberty to sell at whatever price he was silly enough to accept for it. Courts cannot protect parties from the consequences of their own folly, where no fraud is shown to have been practiced upon them.</p>

It appeared that prior to this transaction, the assignor had pledged his interests in the estates, or perhaps in only one of them, as security for a loan from one Banes for, nominally, $300; this also, as the auditing judge infers, having been obtained through the agency of Mr. James. When this loan matured, the bearer was unable to pay, and the interests were sold at auction by Freeman &amp; Company to one Hackett, acting, it would seem, on behalf of the lender; and with a liberality not usual among persons who engage in transactions of this ldnd with expectant legatees, it was offered to reconvey on payment of debt, interest and expenses. It was for the purpose of obtaining money for this purpose that the assignment to Hallman was made, and of the sum received, $327.75 were paid to Mr. Arthur W. Depue, representing the lender.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[315,1205,1183,861]]]'>The past experience of the auditing judge, especially that of Larduer’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20W.N.C.%2051" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="16 W.N.C. 51">16 W. N. C. 51</a>, and Kuntzleman’s Estate, No. 26, October term, 1879, caused him to look at this transaction with great suspicion, inclining him to the view that the assignment, though absolute on its face, was intended merely as security for money loaned; but the admission that it was intended as an absolute assignment in the case of the interest in the Lower estate, the only defense being that the interest in the Jackson estate was included fraudulently, made this impossible, and hard as it may seem and actually is, there appears to be no escape from the conclusion that this assignee, who insists on the strict letter of his purchase, is entitled to the $2,000 legacy in this estate, in addition to the #778.05 which he will receive under the adjudication in the estate of Wm. S. Lower — making in all $2,778.05, or more than five times the amount paid to the assignor in October, 1900 — less than one year before the termination of the life estate.</p>

Jackson to the assignee, Henry S. Hallman.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b67-6" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[114,944,1183,613]]]'>We have carefully examined the evidence presented and notwithstanding the earnest argument of counsel for exceptant cannot reach any other conclusion than that expressed by the auditing judge. The vendor is no doubt dissatisfied with and repents the bargain he made, but he has no one other than himself to condemn. As said by Black, O. J., in Davidson v. Little, <a href="/pa/22/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="22 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="413717" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0245-01">22 Pa. 245</a>: “ This case does not seem to be within the rule which sets aside an executed contract with an heir for mere inadequacy of price. Norris was not an heir expectant. The estate was fully vested in him. The fact that another had a life estate in one half of it makes no difference or at most is a very slight circumstance.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b67-7" data-blocks='[["BL_67.6",67,[114,1566,1186,874]],["BL_68.1",68,[296,365,1180,138]]]'>This fully applies to the present case and the facts and circumstances here shown are similar to those in the case cited. The vendor had a vested interest which might not come into possession for years. He was necessitous and through a broker obtained a purchaser for his interest in the estate. The purchaser was a stranger to him and with whom he had no personal negotiations. The contract of sale was executed and the price agreed upon paid. No fraud was practiced by the vendee nor oppression used nor deceit employed by him. Under all the facts shown, we fail to discover any reason why the vendor should not be held to his bargain. It need only be said that Wlielen v. Phillips, <a href="/pa/151/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="151 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="836739" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0312-01">151 Pa. 312</a>, disposes of the question and is on all fours with the present case. There a legatee sui juris entitled upon his surviving his mother, sold his legacy of $4,666.66 for $1,000, to a person who stood in no trust relation to him. In an effort by the legatee to set aside Ids assignment it was held that in the absence of evidence of op<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>pression or bad faith in the transaction, the sale passed a good title to the purchaser. The exceptions must accordingly be dismissed.</p>
