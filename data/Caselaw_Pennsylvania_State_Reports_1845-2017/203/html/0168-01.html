In this case no such question arises. No heir of the deceased owner contests the title or ever did. Joshua Davis’s title was subject to be divested by having the sale set aside, but this was not done. The sale was confirmed. It does not appear what caused the delay in making the deed; but in the absence of exceptions to the confirmation of the sale and the completion of the title by deed, either Joshua Davis, if he had lived, or his estate after his death, would be entitled to a deed to confirm the title. It came as land no matter how the title was taken. If we suppose that no deed had ever been delivered, can it be contended that his title would not have been good, the heirs of Smith not contesting ? Granting, therefore, that a perfect title did not vest in Joshua Davis until the delivery of the deed, as against the heirs of Rev. David Smith, we think, as against every one else, his legal title was perfected by the subsequent payment by his administrators and the deed to them, and related back to the confirmation by the court.

By new acquisition is meant an estate which the intestate has acquired by his own exertions and industry, or by will or deed of a stranger to his blood: 24 Am. &amp; Eng.

It was still the decedent’s money in the hands of his administrators, and payment by the administrators was payment by the decedént and for his benefit. Nor do the terms of the deed change the character of the estate conveyed. “ For the use of the heirs ” simply means that the estate was held by the state for the heirs subject to be vested in them under the intestate laws. The administrator of Smith could make no' other deed than one to the purchaser or his representative, and such representative could only hold for the use of the heirs. In no sense was it a conveyance to them personally, but simply as they would take through their father. If the contention of plaintiffs is correct, Catharine Davis, the widow, might be deprived of her dower rights, although entitled to a share of the personalty had it not been paid for the land. By this course of reasoning the administrators could use all the personal fund to purchase land to vest in the heirs, and exclude the widow. In order to protect the rights of the widow the delivery of the deed can by a fiction be treated as made to her husband.
