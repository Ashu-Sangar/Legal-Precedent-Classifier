To obtain the fruits of that fraud it was necessary to have the note discounted by persons having no knowledge of the fraud which surrounded its inception and vitiated it, and this brings the plaintiffs, who, according to the testimony of the defendant, did discount it, within the exception to the general rule that notice to a partner or agent is notice to his co-partners or principal, and raises a clear presumption that L.

We cannot adopt this suggestion. The discounting of the various notes given in renewal was not done at the instance of the defendant, nor was it in any way for his benefit; but it was wholly in the interest, and at the suggestion of Doty.</p>
    <p id="b572-6" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[327,1013,1181,817]]]'>Holding as we do that there was at least constructive notice to the plaintiff, by reason of the actual knowledge of Doty, who was one of its members, there is no room for the operation of the principle of estoppel. In order that it should apply, the utmost good faith is required from both parties. When the holder of an instrument is aware of any illegality connected with it, he cannot be protected by any such claim. We cannot attempt to define the exact limits within which the knowledge of Doty should be imputed to his partners, but it is sufficient to say that if the evidence of the defendant be accepted as true, the manner in which the note was handled, and the conduct of the plaintiff’s cashier in receiving a commission for the sale of stock, to be paid for out of the proceeds of the note, did not exhibit upon the part of the plaintiff that entire good faith, which equity exacts of one who would deprive a defendant of the right to set up the true condition of affairs as a defense.</p>

B. Doty. It is undisputed, however, that the real relations between Ashman and Doty were such as to make them immediate parties to the note. In so far therefore as the controversy between them is concerned, any defense sufficient to prevent the enforcement of an ordinary contract, will prevail. Lack of consideration, therefore, would be sufficient. It is admitted that no money consideration was given. The testimony of the defendant is that Doty obtained the note under the promise that it would only be used by him for the ptirpose of buying stock in the Bedford Springs Company from other persons; <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>that if he did not succeed in getting options on a majority of the stock, no stock was to be bought for the defendant, but the note was to be returned to Ashman. He testifies also that Doty made various representations as to the value of the stock, and as to its earning capacity and the payment of dividends, and various other matters, all of which were afterwards found to be false. This evidence was contradicted by Doty, but he, while contending that the consideration for the note, was the sale of stock, admitted that none was delivered-to Ashman at the time the note was made, nor could he say that any of the stock was ever delivered to Ashman. The testimony was in many respects contradictory, but the credibility of the witnesses was for the jury. If they believed the evidence of the defendant, there was ample to justify a finding of misrepresentation upon the part of Doty, and that the purpose for which the note was executed was never fulfilled, and that the contemplated consideration for the note, was never delivered, and that the promise made when the note was executed, as to its use, was subsequently violated.</p>
    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[91,1360,1192,1121]]]'>We cannot regard this case as being merely that of oath against oath, with the persuasive evidence of the note, in favor of the plaintiff. It is rather one in which the attending facts and circumstances speak in favor of the defendant, and these may well be regarded as the equivalent of another witness. The peculiar circumstances under which the note was procured from the defendant; the fact that Ashman and Doty were strangers, and were introduced by Bell, the cashier of the plaintiff company, who was paid a commission upon the sale of the stock; the representations made as to the financial condition of the Bed-ford Springs Company, and as to the profits of the business : the interest which Doty had in securing for himself a controlling interest in the stock, and the benefits which would accrue to him by reason thereof; the correspondence between Doty and the defendant as bearing upon the representations made when the note was given, and as inducements to him to sign the various renewals ; the fact that no stock was ever delivered by Doty to the defendant; all these and various other matters appearing in the testimony, were for the consideration of the jury as tending, at least, to corroborate the defendant, and they may have been potent in convincing the jury that his version of the affair was the true one.</p>
