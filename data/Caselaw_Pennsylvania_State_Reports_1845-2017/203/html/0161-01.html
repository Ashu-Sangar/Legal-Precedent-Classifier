The Conyngham Post, in pursuance of the general control of the property vested in it by the trust deed aforesaid, and within the limitations therein expressed, have paid the running expenses of the building, such as light, heat, janitor service, etc., and for the purpose of raising revenue have leased portions of the building to various organizations, including a lease of the large room known as the “ G. A. R. Room,” to “ The International Association of Machinists ” for the current year, for two Tuesday nights in each month, these being two of the four nights in each month on which the Sons of Veterans had formerly used the room as a meeting place. This lease was made after the Harkness Camp had failed or refused to enter into a lease with the Conyngham Post for the use of the room in question as a meeting room, for a year from April 1, 1901, which form of lease contained an agreement by the camp to pay the Conyngham Post the sum of “ one hundred and twenty-five dollars. The same to be paid for the use of furniture (owned by the post) heat and light in room now occupied by Conjuigham Post No. 97 G. A. R.” After the lease to the International Machinists had been made, the Harkness Camp, by its officers, verbally offered to pay the post the sum of $125 for use of furniture, light, heat and janitor’s service, upon the post’s permitting them to occupy the said room on every Tuesday night in the month. The post through its officers replied that this could not be done, as the room was already leased to the machinists for two Tuesday nights in each month, but the counter offer was made, subject to its acceptance within five days, that the post would allow the camp to use the room on the second and fourth Tuesday evenings of each month, those <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>being the only nights for which it was not already rented — the camp to sign a lease at an annual rental of $62.50 “ for the use of furniture, heat and light.” This offer was not accepted, but this proceeding was instituted instead.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[134,582,1186,605]]]'>Under the facts above found, the controlling question in the case would seem to be whether the requirement that the Harkness Camp as lessee, enter into a written lease with the Conyngham Post as lessor, wherein the room should be designated which the lessee should have the right to use as a meeting place, the times when it should be so used, and also containing a stipulation for the payment of a sum certain as compensation for use of the post’s furniture and for light, heat and janitor’s service, is a reasonable regulation, “ subject ” to which (and not otherwise) the Sons of Veterans are required to be “ provided with a suitable meeting place ” in Memorial Hall.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-6" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[132,1206,1187,767]]]'>This question we decide in the affirmative. Under its charter and the deed of the premises the general control of the property in matters pertaining to its use is vested in the Conyngham Post during its existence. It is only stipulated, so far as the plaintiffs are concerned, that such control be exercised in a reasonable manner. We see nothing in the charter of the post nor in the trust deed, whether construed strictly or liberally to prohibit the post from requiring from the camp its assent to a writing by which the latter is “ provided with a suitable meeting place ” and stating where it should be and when it should be used, whether that writing be called a lease or by some other name. Neither do we regard it as unreasonable that such writing should contain a stipulation that the camp pay a compensation for the use of furniture, light, heat, etc., conceded to be reasonable in amount.</p>

This organization has in a lawful manner acquired a legal right to the possession of the room in question for two of the four nights in each month on which the plaintiffs demand it. To make the injunction asked for effective, the machinists must be ousted from possession and the Sons of Veterans put in. The proceeding is in effect an ejectment bill. A court of equity is virtually asked in an injunction proceeding to deprive an innocent third party of <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>actual, and the defendants of constructive, possession' of real property.

    <p class="summary" id="b196-4" data-blocks='[["BL_196.4",196,[288,628,1182,559]]]'>Being of opinion that the plaintiffs have not shown that clear right, with no adequate remedy at law for its invasion, which alone would justify the interposition of a court of equity by way of injunction (Clark’s Appeal, .<a href="/pa/62/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="62 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="1017238" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0447-01">62 Pa. 447</a>; Minnig’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/82/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="82 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="1047862" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0373-01">82 Pa. 373</a>), and believing moreover, that the granting of the injunction would be productive of greater injury than its denial (Wahl v. Methodist Episcopal Cemetery Assn., <a href="/pa/197/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="197 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="918701" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0197-01">197 Pa. 197</a>; Richards’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/57/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="57 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1010471" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0105-01">57 Pa. 105</a>), we think the injunction now asked for should not be granted. We therefore conclude, as matter of law, that the plaintiffs are not at this time entitled to the equitable relief prayed for.</p>
