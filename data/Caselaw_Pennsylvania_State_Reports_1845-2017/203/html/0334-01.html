The plans submitted by Wagner &amp; Reitmeyer, architects, were accepted. Proposals for the construction of the building were invited. These proposals were to be in accordance with specifications and drawings. The specifications disclosed that a plan of heating submitted by the Peck-Williamson Heating and Ventilating Company was 'to be used in the building. The specifications provided that “ the walls shall have all necessary openings, air spaces and all vertical channels or chases for heating, plumbing and ventilating pipes.” The contract for the erection of the building was awarded to plaintiff. It provided for a fixed sum “ without any extra or additional compensation unless expressly assented to in writing before the extra work is commenced.” Plaintiff claimed that the erection of the smoke, heat and ventilating flues and stacks was not covered by the specifications, and that for this work he should be paid $2,225.85 extra.</p>

If the jury believe the evidence on the part of the plaintiff, and, inter alia, that, when Keefer, before he had submitted his proposal, went to the office of Irwin — the secretary of the board of school directors and the chairman of the building committee in charge of this work, and to whom bidders, in the <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>notice of the school board soliciting proposals, were referred for the specifications and drawings in accordance with which they were to bid for the high school building — and inquired for the Peck-Williamson Heating and Yentilating Company’s specifications and drawings, such drawings and specifications were not there, and said Irwin told him not to bid on the heating plant or the brickwork connected therewith, and that he had nothing to do with the plans and specifications for the heating plant, as it had already been contracted for, and Keefer put in his proposal without taking the heating plant and its brickwork into account in his estimate, the school district, defendant, is estopped from claiming that such heating plant or any part thereof was a part of and covered by Keefer’s proposal and included in his contract. <em>Answer: </em>Refused.

A provision in a building contract that no extras shall be paid for unless assented to in writing before the extra work is commenced, may be waived by the conduct of the parties, and if the jury believe the testimony on the part of the plaintiff, and, inter alia, that, when the question of the construction of the stacks, flues and vents, to wit: the brickwork connected with the heating plant, was under consideration, and in doubt or dispute as between said defendant and said Peck-Williamson Heating and Ventilating Company, the defendant, through its building committee, authorized Keefer, the plaintiff, to erect said stacks, flues and vents and promised to pay him therefor, and in pursuance of such agreement and promise the plaintiff erected said stacks, etc., furnishing the materials and labor therefor, then the jury will be warranted in finding that this was a waiver of the provision in the contract that no extras shall be paid for unless authorized in writing by the architects or building committee, and the plaintiff will be entitled to recover therefor at the agreed price, or if, no price were expressly agreed upon, then at such price as said work and materials were reasonably worth. <em>Answer: </em>Refused.
