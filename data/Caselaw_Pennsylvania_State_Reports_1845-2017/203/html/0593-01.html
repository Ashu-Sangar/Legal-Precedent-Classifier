And in the event of any such poor* district having assumed or paid the expenses thus incurred for the relief or burial of any indigent person or persons whose legal settlement <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>is unknown, the county in which such poor district is located shall be liable to such poor district in an action of assumpsit in a civil court for the amount thus expended or incurred, and the want of an order of relief or approval order shall not be a bar to recovery.” Prior to the passage of this act the duty of supporting and caring for indigent persons while living, and burying them when dead, was imposed upon the respective poor districts of the counties in which poor or almshouses were not maintained, whether the legal settlement of such persons was known or unknown. To discharge the duties so imposed, the overseers of the said poor districts are authorized to levy and collect a tax upon all real and personal estates within each township composing a poor district. But the act of 1893, without the slightest indication that can be found in its title of its purpose so to do, shifts from the respective poor districts of a county, where a poor or almshouse is not maintained at the county’s expense, a portion of the burden long borne by the said poor districts, and provided for by a special tax, and imposes it upon the county itself as an additional object of public support. It does more than this. It imposes the burden upon the counties affected by it without giving them, through their commissioners, a voice in determining in any case whether relief should be furnished; overseers of the poor in any district are to be the sole judges whether such relief should be furnished, and against their improvidence county commissioners are powerless, and the general public has no protection, for “ all expenses thus incurred for the relief, support, nursing, care or burial of such indigent person or persons whose legal settlement is unknown shall be borne by the county in which the poor district furnishing such relief is located.” Even the right of the county to be heard in its courts against the improvidence or recklessness of the overseers of the poor seems to he denied by the act, for'its words are that the county must pay, without question or the right to make complaint, however just the same may be.</p>

Their duty is simply ministerial and mandatory." They are absolutely required to pay the expenses, when audited and adjusted by the board of health and presented to the commissioners. They have no control over the board of health, nor any right to have a hearing in the courts as to any bills which they might deem objectionable. Now, while it is probably competent for the legislature to enact such laws, it is their duty, and their constitutional obligation, to give notice in the title of such enactments, of their intention to impose such liability upon the municipal organization which is to be affected, and if this duty is neglected, such legislation is contrary to the requirements of the constitution and’ therefore void.” “ The object of that requirement is that legislators, and others interested, shall receive direct notice in immediate connection with the act itself, of its subject, so that they may know or be put upon inquiry as to its provisions and their effect. Suggestions or inferences which may be drawn from knowledge dehors the language used, are not enough. The constitution requires that the notice shall be contained in the title itself: Phœnixville Road, <a href="/pa/109/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="109 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="542296" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0044-01">109 Pa. 44</a>; Ridge Ave. Pass.

Jones, <a href="/pa/203/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="203 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="994741" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0047-01">203 Pa. 47</a>.</p>

It is rather reasonable to conclude that, with <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>the poor within their borders supported by the respective poof districts, the proposed legislation was to affect only such districts, and not the counties. Further comment could not make this plainer. The judgment of the court below is reversed and the record remitted, with direction that judgment be entered for the defendant on the case stated.</p>
