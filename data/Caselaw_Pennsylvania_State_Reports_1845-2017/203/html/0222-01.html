Plaintiff claimed that he stumbled over some obstruction and fell through the guard rails down to and on the ice a distance of thirty-six feet below. The plaintiff’s evidence was conflicting and contradictory, and a fair inference to be drawn from it was that he had climbed <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>over the rail while intoxicated and fell onto the ice.

They, and not the negligence of the defendant, were the cause of his injuries. There was no evidence whatever that the bridge was defectively constructed as alleged by the plaintiff, nor that his injuries were occasioned by the negligence of the defendant company. The nonsuit was properly entered by the court below and, therefore, the judgment is affirmed.</p>
