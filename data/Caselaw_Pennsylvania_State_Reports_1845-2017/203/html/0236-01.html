In her petition for leave to execute said mortgage, the administratrix states that the debts are only $500, but some additional money is needed for repairs. An examination of the petition of the administratrix for leave to execute the Fay, Hutchinson &amp; Company mortgage, decree dated September 21, 1893, confirmation November 22, 1893, would have disclosed that it was for a grocery bill contracted by the administratrix. The judgments specified in the petition of September 24,1894, were all against Margaret Galloway, not Joseph D. Gallowajn The taxes, city liens, water rents and insurance all accrued subsequent to the death of Joseph D. Galloway, and in no sense were his debts. All these things Mr. Weber, agent for the mortgagee, knew, or ought to have known, as he disbursed the money; but relying, doubtless, on the conclusiveness of the decree of the orphans’ court, he paid no heed to the matter, but paid out the money, borrowed to pay debts of decedent, to claims which accrued long after the death of Joseph D.

The decree was conclusive of everything involved in it and in reaching the result the orphans’ court necessarily passed on the subject of the debts in the schedule, as fully as on the date of decedent’s death, and determined that they were debts of the decedent, a lien on his real estate, and of the proper amount to require the mortgage petitioned for.

That case went to the utmost verge in authorizing collateral attack on a decree of the orphans’ court, but it falls far short of sustaining a judgment like this. In that case the petition for sale merely recited that the de<a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>cedent died intestate, owning real estate but not enough personalty to pay the debts. No averment was made of the date of death, and the only debt set forth in the record was on a parol contract more than eleven years due.

The difference between that case and this is clearly shown by a quotation from the opinion of Williams, Jl, in the first case (<a href="/citations/?q=178%20Pa.%20253" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="178 Pa. 253">178 Pa. 253</a>) : “The court should be satisfied before making an order for the sale of real éstate that there are unpaid debts properly chargeable upon the real estate of the decedent; that the real estate described in the petition is bound by the lien of the said debts ; and that it is necessary to have recourse to the land to enable the administrator or executor to pay them. The most convenient way for presenting these facts to the court is to embody them in the petition, stating the date of the decedent’s death, and whether the debts were at that time secured by mortgage or judgment.” Every step .in the practice here pointed out as correct was exactly followed in the present case.</p>
