    <p class="summary" id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.4",186,[293,632,1182,714]]]'>By a codicil he directs that the house so given to Mary and Lavinia shall be “ maintained for one year, if not sold before, as it must be sold as soon as a purchaser can be secured within .two years.” There is no direction that the proceeds of sale shall not be received by the original devisees ; and as a clear gift in the will is not to be cut down by subsequent words or a codicil except to the extent expressed or clearly implied (Whelen’s Estate, <a href="/pa/175/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="175 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="880560" data-case-paths="/pa/175/0028-01">175 Pa. 28</a>), and as parties to whom proceeds of sale are given may elect to take the land itself (Burr v. Sim, <a href="/whart/1/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Whart. 252" data-case-ids="1829054" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0252-01">1 Whart. 252</a>), it is not easy to see how the positive provision that the property shall be maintained at the expense of the general estate, for one year, can be affected because the devisees or legatees have so elected. The first exception is, therefore, overruled.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b186-6" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[295,1355,1180,404]]]'>The legacies are expressed as being so much from a mortgage for $50,000, and so much in cash or other securities. Objection was made to the allowance of any commissions on this mortgage, which, it would seem, has not yet been collected. Its collection, however, as the auditing judge has said, must, necessarily, precede any distribution, and commissions are to be allowed precisely as if the amount were already held in cash. The second exception is also overruled.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b186-7" data-blocks='[["BL_186.6",186,[296,1769,1179,661]],["BL_187.1",187,[120,371,1181,451]]]'>But it is further objected that upon an estate so large as this ($114,035.38), composed of the mortgage referred to and a few items collected in cash, an allowance of commissions at five per cent is excessive, the estate being free from debt or complication, and, as the account shows, there being but eleven items of credit, including cost of filing account, commissions, and counsel fees. This objection appears to be well founded : Pusey v. Clemson, 9 S. &amp; R. 204; Walker's Estate, 9 S. &amp; R. 225; Whelen’s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith, 410; Lang’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Phila.%20593" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="15 Phila. 593">15 Phila. 593</a>.

It is true that questions arise <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>under the will with regard to the share of Martha Walker, one of the daughters; but with this, except in their capacity as legatees, the accountants have no concern. They are mere stakeholders, having no additional labors imposed upon them as executors by reason of questions of distribution. The third exception is sustained, the commissions reduced, on principal, to three and one half per cent (five percent being allowed on income), and the difference being added to the balance for distribution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b187-5" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[119,840,1184,666]]]'>What has thus been said with reference to the third exception applies also to the fourth. Counsel representing the accountants as executors, represented them and all of the children except Martha as legatees; Their services in the former capacity were comparatively insignificant. The account contains a credit for $150 for counsel fees, and an additional allowance of $150 will not err on the side of illiberality, especially as much of what was done was made necessary by the' manner in which the account was stated, restated and re-restated. The allowance in the adjudication is reduced to $150, and the difference, $350, added to the balance of principal. For the sum thus disallowed as against the estate, the parties represented must be looked to in their individual capacity.</p>

      <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>The auditing judge, following the well settled principle, of which Mickley’s Appeal, Karker’s Appeal, Biddle’s Appeal, etc., are illustrations, held that the legacy to Martha being given, in express terms, “ absolutely,” the limitation to issue, etc., must be understood as referring only to her death in the lifetime of the testator, and the ruling in this respect has not been excepted to. But he also held that Martha took no part of the residuary estate, one seventh of which he directed should be held, principal and income, for her issue, should she leave any, or to the other children of the testator, if she should not. It is claimed on behalf of the latter, though they have filed no exceptions, that the share should now go to them, as Mrs. Walker has not, and never has had, issue; while, on-the other hand, it is contended that the gift of her residuary share is governed by precisely the same principle which was applied to the legacy, and that it also should be awarded to her absolutely.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b188-5" data-blocks='[["BL_188.4",188,[285,1246,1193,815]]]'>It is clear that the award to the executors to hold as above cannot be sustained, involving, as it necessarily does, a trust not created by the will, and an accumulation indefinite in duration and not for the benefit of an existing minority, forbidden by statute. If Mrs. Walker is not entitled to any estate, the share must go to the other children of thé testator. But it is a fundamental rule in the interpretation of wills that an heir will not be disinherited except by express words or necessary implication, and that all doubts will be resolved in his favor and against his exclusion. That this testator did not intend that his daughter should have no part of his residuary estate is manifest. He speaks of one seventh as “Martha’s part,” and this recognition of her interest is repeated when, in providing for the contingency of her having no issue, it is declared that “ her part ” is to be divided to the other six parts ; and again,. “should she have issue ” “her part ” “ goes to that issue.”</p>

It is plain that an immediate limitation of Martha’s share, to her issue or to his other children, was not contemplated. He knew that she was childless, and the birth of issue is referred to as a future event — “ should she not have issue ; ” “ should she have issue;” and of course a construction which suspends ownership and <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>leads to an illegal accumulation will not be adopted if any other is possible. He appears to have been his own scrivener, evidently unskilled in the use of language. He has expressed himself eliptically, but his intention is clear. To all of his children except Martha he gives absolute interests ; to her, for life only, with limitation to her issue, “ should she have issue ” (at the time of her death), to her brothers and sisters, if she should not. In this way a meaning is given to every word in the residuary clause.</p>
