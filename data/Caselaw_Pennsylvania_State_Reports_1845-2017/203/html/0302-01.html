But of the decision based on this reasoning when it was brought to the test of use as a precedent in Commonwealth v. Keystone Electric Light, Heat and Power Co., <a href="/citations/?q=198%20Pa.%20245" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="198 Pa. 245">198 Pa. 245</a>, Mr. Justice Fell, delivering the opinion of the court, said: “ The reason assigned for the decision in Commonwealth v. Northern Electric Light Company, however, is not satisfactory. Carried to its logical conclusion as was done in this case by the learned judge who decided it in the common pleas it leads to a wrong result. Electric light, heat and power companies are manufacturing corporations within the meaning of the act of 1874 and its supplements.” The attorney general recognizes this, but quotes and relies on what Mr. Justice Fell further said of the decision in that case that electric light companies were not exempt from the tax: “ They are not exempt from a tax on their capital stock under section 20, of the act of 1885, because they are not within the policy of the legislature in passing that act, and it was not intended that they should share its benefits.” And he contends in his brief that: “ The question of public policy having been made the ground for supporting the electric light company cases, this principle should be taken into consideration in deciding the case now pending. It certainly could not have been the intention of the legislature as <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>a question of public policy to encourage the creation of foreign corporations for the purpose of transacting their business in Pennsylvania by exempting their capital stock from taxation. The policy of our laws should be to encourage the incorporation of domestic companies for manufacturing purposes.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b335-3" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[133,648,1186,819]]]'>If the question in this case were whether an electric light, heat and power company were exempt from the tax on capital stock we would, of course, unhesitatingly follow the precedent of the Northern Electric Light case and decide it was not. But the electric light cases are not authority for cases involving the question of the right of other companies to the exemption. These are to be decided by determining the proper construction of the acts taxing the capital stock of corporations, and if the language of the acts is clear and unambiguous, the court is in duty bound to enforce them according to their obvious meaning, and is not at liberty to enlarge or limit their scope by any ideas it may have of what should be the policy of the legislature. This has been so often said that it is commonplace, but, as it seems to have been overlooked in the discussion of the electric light cases we refer to a few of the utterances of the courts on this subject.</p>

To summarize the act: It requires that every company whatever, except banks, saving institutions and foreign insurance companies, doing business in Pennsylvania, shall report the value of its capital stock to the auditor general; and every corporation whatever required to report shall be subject to the tax on capital stock ; except manufacturing corporations whose capital stock “is invested in and actually and exclusively employed in carrying on manufacturing within the state.”</p>

There were manufacturing corporations engaged in brewing and distilling; and if nothing further were added their capital stock would be exempt. They are therefore excepted. And there might possibly be manufacturing corporations “ enjoying and exercising the right of eminent domain.” If any, they are excepted. And then the exemption is guarded so as not to apply to such capital stock, if any, of manufacturing corporations as “ may be invested in any property or business not strictly needed or appurtenant to its manufacturing business.” And manufacturing corporations are not exempted from payment of “ local taxes assessed upon its property in the district where located.” And then the object of the proviso is again stated to be “ to relieve from state taxation only so much of the capital stock as is invested purely in the manufacturing business.” Yet with all this care evidently taken to guard and limit the exemption and to leave no <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>room for doubt to what it applies, we are asked to say that the language of the act shows that the legislature intended but omitted to add “except also manufacturing corporations organized or incorporated by or under the laws of any other state or territory of the United States, or by the United States, or by any foreign government.”</p>
