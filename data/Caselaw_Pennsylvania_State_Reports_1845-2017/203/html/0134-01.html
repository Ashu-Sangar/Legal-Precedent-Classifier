Co. v. Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Co., <a href="/citations/?q=128%20Pa.%20516" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="128 Pa. 516">128 Pa. 516</a>. The point is made, however, on behalf of the plaintiff that he was overreached and deceived by the railway company’s agent, and that the testimony affords ample warrant to the court to set aside the release as fraudulent. Was said testimony admissible ? It is undoubtedly true that in a suit between one of the parties to a written contract and a stranger, parol evidence has frequently been received to impeach orreform the contract. It is always received when offered by a stranger, “ who, if it were otherwise, might be prejudiced by things recited in the writings, contrary to the truth, through the ignorance, carelessness, or fraud of the parties; and who, therefore, ought not to be precluded from proving the truth, however contradictory to the written statement of others:” 1 Greenleaf on Ev. sec. 279. The rights and interests of third persons would truly be in peril if the rule excluding parol evidence were to be extended to them, in such manner as to conclude them from giving evidence tending to contradict an agreement made by others: Krider v. Lafferty, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Whart.%20302" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Whart. 302">1 Wh. 302</a>. When the parol evidence, however, is offered in such a suit by one of the signers of the contract, effect can only be given to it provided no damage will be inflicted thereby on the other party litigant. This conclusion is founded on the well established principle' that where one of two innocent persons must suffer from the fraud of a third, that one must bear the loss whose act or neglect has been the occasion of the injury. Inasmuch as the defendant stood in the position of a surety of the railway company for the payment to the plaintiff of the sum of $2,100, another rule of law is pertinent, viz: A surety, on.payment of the debt of his principal, is entitled to be <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>substituted to all tbe securities which the creditor holds; therefore, if substitution be rendered fruitless by any act of the creditor, a release pro tanto, or for the whole, as the case may be, necessarily results; and it is immaterial whether, at the time of the release, the creditor does or does not know of the relation of principal and surety between the debtors: Temple-ton v. Shakley, <a href="/pa/107/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="107 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="8857818" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0370-01">107 Pa. 370</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b167-3" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[111,724,1189,1431]]]'>Gordon v. McCarty, <a href="/whart/3/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Whart. 407" data-case-ids="1833431" data-case-paths="/whart/3/0406-01">3 Wh. 407</a>, has been cited by the counsel for plaintiff as being antagonistic to the above conclusion, but it does not sustain the position they take. The court in that case says that no good reason can be assigned why a surety should take advantage of a fraud, practiced by his principal upon a creditor in obtaining a release, “ If it be that he (the surety) has been in no wise prejudiced by it, or placed in no worse condition now than he would have been provided no such release had ever been obtained.” The succeeding clause of the opinion is involved, but is merely to the effect that if the giving of the release has occasioned injury to the surety, the burden of proving this will lie upon him, but such proof cannot be interposed as an objection to an offer of evidence to establish fraud. In other words, as we interpret the opinion, the plaintiff should in the first place be given an opportunity to show that his execution of the release was fraudulently obtained, and if he succeeds in doing so, the defendant should then be permitted to prove as a defense that the plaintiff’s act in signing the instrument worked him a wrong. That plaintiff’s act in the present instance did the defendant a wrong to the full amount of the insurance is clear. Further, both the plaintiff and the defendant claimed that the fire had been caused by the railway company, and prior to the execution of the release one of the defendant’s officers warned the plaintiff to be careful what he signed for said company. In view of the foregoing, our determination is that parol evidence was not admissible to impeach or reform the release of February 12, 1900.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[111,2175,1181,250]],["BL_168.1",168,[282,364,1182,1181]]]'>This determination renders unnecessary an extended discussion of the question whether said evidence, if admissible, would have justified a chancellor in decreeing a reformation of the release, so as to limit it to damages beyond the amount of the insurance. We have given this subject careful consid<a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>eration and do not deem tbe evidence sufficient for that purpose, for the following reason: There was no fraud or deception practiced on the plaintiff as to the contents of the paper; it lay upon his table for an hour, he looked over it, and it was read to him. Any misrepresentation which was made was only as to its legal effect, concerning which the position of the railway company agent was, that said company was not liable for the property covered by insurance, because the defendant had been paid to take the risk as to that and would have to stand the loss under its policy. Whether or not he was honestly mistaken in the matter we do not know, but we cannot assume that he was not. The instrument expressly sets forth that it shall not be considered as an admission on the part of the railway company that any liability whatever has attached to it in consequence of the accident; hence it is palpable that the plaintiff may not keep the money he received for signing it, and also have it reformed to mean something entirely diffirent from what it states, as a basis for an additional recovery. Waiving the abstract point whether the mistake of law in this case would warrant an impeachment of the release, we decide that it cannot in any event be altered or reformed until the $1,100 received by the plaintiff has been returned to the railway company.</p>
