At the time of her death her son was her only surviving child. Three children of a deceased son survived her and were the contestants. Twenty-four years before the death of testatrix she had, at the instance of her son, placed the property which she then owned in trust. The son testified that he had urged his mother to create this trust because he discovered that she had been by improvident expenditures denuding herself of her property. After testatrix took up her home with her son their incomes went into a common purse, and although her separate income was paid regularly, no separate account was kept of it. About eleven years before her death her brother died, leaving to her a very large amount of property. This property was in another city, and managed for her by agents. Soon after the death of her brother testatrix gave her son, proponent, a power of attorney to transact her business. The son then assumed the entire control of her income, raised money on mortgages, and rendered his mother no written account. He secured the money by time and sight drafts on his mother’s agents, and both the son and the agents apparently combined to keep from her information as to the condition of her estate. She was frequently in want of comparatively small amounts of money necessary to her comfort, and made demands for the same which were not always met. She complained to several people of her son’s extravagance, and threatened more than once to revoke the power of attorney, but this she never did. The evidence for the contestants tended to show that this condition of affairs continued down close to the execution of her will which was made ten days before her death. About fourteen months before her death testatrix and her son went to the city where her property was situated for the purpose of making her will. Proponent testified that at the hotel where they stopped he noted down for his mother the disposition to make of her property, that he then had the draft typewritten, took it back and read it to his mother, that he then made some <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>corrections of it in his own hand, again read it over to her, and she expressed herself as satisfied, and that he then left the paper with her. The following morning this draft was taken by some one to the office of the agents of testatrix, and on the same day was sent by them to a lawyer, not known to testatrix, who drafted from the notes substantially the will in controversy, except that in the draft made at the hotel there was a bequest of $25,000 to one of the granddaughters which did not appear in the will. In the following month this paper was mailed to the son at his home, and three months thereafter the son mailed the copy back to the agents telling them that his mother desired certain alterations. The lawyer who originally drafted the paper made another copy, and mailed it to testatrix who received it about ten months before her death. Nothing seems to have been further known of the paper until the tenth day before testatrix died, when the testatrix while in bed directed her son to take it from her bureau drawer. The evidence showed that the paper then bore the signature of testatrix but not witnessed. At the suggestion of her son and his partner, both lawyers, testatrix made her mark to the paper which was witnessd by the son’s partner and another person. At the time testatrix made her mark, the son had withdrawn from the room, but was within hearing distance. Before he left the room, however, the son read a part of the will to his mother, and distinctly called her attention to the fact that he was the principal beneficiary in it. After the mark w'as made, the son took possession of the paper and locked it up in his office safe. There was evidence that the granddaughter referred to in the draft had been given $50,000 by an earlier will. It also appeared that in the will in controversy an annuity had been provided for a son who died eight months before testatrix, and for whose funeral testatrix had paid. A number of witnesses testified that testatrix had expressed an intention to die intestate saying that her own fortnne had come that way, and that would make her grandchildren equal. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence of undue influence was sufficient to submit to the jury, and that a verdict and judgment against the will should be sustained.</p>

      <em>Answer: </em>This is a prayer to the court to define to the jury undue influence. Undue influence is the use by one in whom a confidence is reposed by another who holds a real or apparent authority over him, of such confidence or authority for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage of his weakness of mind or of his necessities or distress, or to constrain him to do that which he would not have done without the exercise of such control. It is that influence which compels one to do that which is against his will from fear, the desire of peace, or some feeling which is tantamount to force or fear. Undue influence does not necessarily involve physical force or violence. It implies something more than mere advice, argument and persuasion. Advice, argument, and persuasion, if they convince the reason and move the affections only, leaving the will free and unfettered, are not undue influence. But even advice, argument and persuasion, if they be so importunate and persistent and so operate as to subdue and subordinate the will of the testator to the will of another, till the testamentary instrument speaks not his own mind and his own purpose, but the wish and purpose of ¿mother, such advice, argument and persuasion, so operating and with such effect are undue influence. To be undue influence the influence must at least amount to moral coercion. But if it amounts to moral coercion it is undue influence, no matter how or by what instrumentalities produced. A son may ask a mother to make a will in his favor, may persuade her to do so, may be importunate in his persuasion, and if the effect of such persuasion is such as only to move the affections, sense of duty or judgment, it is not undue influence, hut if the persuasion was so importunate or persistent, and so operated as to amount to moral coercion and to subdue and subordinate the will of the mother to his will, and this coercion operated at the time of the testamentary act, it would be undue influence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.4",436,[292,2099,1182,356]],["BL_437.1",437,[134,368,1185,718]]]'>This undue influence must operate at the time of the testamentary act. It may have been exerted before, but it must be in operation at the time of the testamentary act, and must destroy the free will of the testator. It is not, however, necessary that the jury should know what particular agencies were employed to overcome the free will of the testator, and while you cannot find this fact of undue influence upon mere suspi<a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>cion or surmise, it is not necessary that you be able to lay your finger on any particular act of undue influence exerted over the testatrix. It is enough if, upon all the evidence, you are convinced that the paper does not speak the true and voluntary purpose of the maker. It is not necessary that the fact of undue influence be proved by direct evidence, but it may be proved by circumstances. From the surroundings of the testator, the character of the will, the family relations, the conditions of the health and mind of the testator, his dependency upon and subjection to the control of the person supposed to have wielded the influence, the opportunity and disposition of that person to wield it, the acts and declarations of such person, the connection of the person wielding that influence with the preparation, making, or execution of the will.</p>

The fact that under the terms of the will in controversy all of the natural heirs of the testatrix save John B. Robinson, the chief beneficiary, are practically disinherited in favor of John B.

Robinson. <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>
      <em>Answer: </em>We answer to that point — we cannot say that it is a fact that under the terms of the will all the natural heirs of the testatrix save John B. Robinson, the chief beneficiary, are practically disinherited. If, however, you find that to be the fact, then you may take this fact into consideration, with the other evidence in the case, in passing upon the question of undue influence.</p>

Robinson was instrumental in giving instructions from which the will in dispute was drawn and that he was practically the sole beneficiary under the will, then it is incumbent upon him to show affirmatively in this suit that Letitia Robinson, with respect to the paper in dispute, had advice independent of any from John B. Robinson, or those under his control, and that she also had a full knowledge and understanding of the effect of the paper which she is alleged to have executed. If this is not found by you, the verdict should be against the will and for the defendants. <em>Answer: </em>We cannot affirm this point as it is written. If John B. Robinson was a stranger to her blood, and not a natural object of her bounty, this point would be affirmed. However, if you shall find from the evidence that for many years prior to her death Letitia Robinson lived in the house of John B. Robinson, and that he and those under his influence had control of and managed her affairs, that she was advanced in years at the time she executed the will, that John B. Robinson was instrumental in giving instruction from which the will was drawn, and that he was practically the sole beneficiary — if you find these facts you may take them into consideration, in connection with the other evidence in the cause, in passing upon the question of undue influence.

She had been confined to her bed by a severe illness for about three weeks before her death; on the 13th of the same month, ten days before her death, she made her will, the writing in dispute. She was the widow of William O. Robinson, a lawyer of Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, who had died many years before, leaving her with five sons, William, James, Alexander, John and Eccles, to survive. Up to the date of the will, all had died except John B., this plaintiff. Of the other sons, Eccles alone left children, these three contestants, Anna R., Gerald O. and Mary P. Robinson. Eccles married twice ; Gerald O. and Anna R. are children of the first wife; Mary Parker is a child of the second wife; the mother died when the daughter was an infant, and she was taken by her uncle John B. and reared as one of his family. Some years after her husband’s death, the testatrix, Letitia Robinson, continued to live in Pittsburg, but in 1879, she went to her son, John B., at Media, and made her home with him until her death, a period of about twenty years. Her husband had left her property of the value of about $100,000. On January 10, 1876, she conveyed the whole of her estate to George W. Guthrie in trust for herself during life. In this conveyance she was joined by her son John B., who added'to the trust as a further provision for his mother, property to the value of about $10,000. In February, 1889, her brother Eccles Robinson died, leaving her an estate worth over $400,000. In the eleven years following, up to the date of her death, she expended, approximately, $300,000 of her estate, but that part of the property coming to her from her brother Eccles, much of which was real estate in the city of Pittsburg, had largely appreciated in value after she took possession. By her will, with the exception of some jewelry and household articles, the entire residue of her estate, approximately worth $200,000, was devised and bequeathed to her son John B. She had made provision in the will for a monthly payment of $125 to her son James during <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>his life, but as he died, eight months before her, the property which secured the monthly payment fell into and became part of the residuary estate devised to her son John B.</p>

Robinson, who sought to probate the will, plaintiff, and Anna R. Robinson, Gerald O. Robinson and Mary Parker Robinson, the latter represented by her guardian, William J. McClure, defendants. The cause came on for trial on October 19, 1901, when a jury was sworn. The plaintiff, having called Charles H. Thomas and T. Speer Dickson, the subscribing witnesses to the will, who testified to the execution-of it by the testatrix and the circumstances attending the execution, read the will and rested his case in chief; the defendants then adduced evidence, tending to negative the first three interrogatories and to affirm the last two; the plaintiff then by evidence undertook to rebut defendant’s averments. The trial lasted about four weeks. At the close of the evidence the court, peremptorily, instructed the jury to answer the second and third interrogatories “Yes”; as to the first he instructed them to find, that testatrix made her mark to the will; as to whether <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>she also affixed her signature he left that as a question of fact to them. To understand this last instruction, it should be noticed, that the signature was “Letitia mark X her Robinson.” The two subscribing witnesses testified, they saw her make the mark; there was conflicting evidence as to whether the name “ Letitia Robinson ” had been written by her; it was not written in the presence of the subscribing witnesses. As to the last two interrogatories, the court submitted to the jury the conflicting evidence bearing on them. The jury found for plaintiff on the first three and for defendants on the last two; that is, they found, that the signature was that of the testatrix ; that she executed the will, and that at the time she was of sound and disposing mind, but that John B. Robinson had procured the will to be made by undue influence. There was no motion for a new trial and the court entered judgment on the verdict; plaintiff now appeals, preferring 583 assignments of error. Many of them are trivial, suggesting no error worth discussing; many others are repetitions of the same avermentin a different form of expression.

To reverse this judgment, in a stronger sense than is commonly applicable to a disappointed suitor, the laboring oar is on appellant; for under the 41st section of the act of March 15, 1832, directing the issue, there is in effect, an approval of the verdict by the court. Here the learned trial judge after the testimony taken before the orphans’ court and after a further hearing before him, directed and framed the issue, then, after a prolonged hearing of all the evidence on both sides with the parties and witnesses before him, he enters the judgment, which appellants now argue, should be reversed, because the evidence to sustain it is insufficient. “ The issue is of right when the fact arising and in dispute is substantial, unless the whole evidence of the fact be so doubtful and unsatisfactory, that a verdict against the validity .of the will ought not to be allowed to stand: ” Schwilke’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20Pa.%20631" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="100 Pa. 631">100 Pa. 631</a>.

To the same effect are a large number of other authorities. The orphans’ courts of the commonwealth are especially bound to discourage litigation of this kind unless based on credible evidence of material facts, by refusing an issue. And even where an issue is granted, if after the case has been fully developed, the court, in view of the whole evidence, considers it not sufficient to sustain the material facts, it is bound to set aside the verdict. There is here then, in effect, a judicial determination by the trial judge, independent of the finding of the jury, that this verdict ought to stand. We usually say, that a mistake in judgment on the evidence by the jury cannot be reached in a court of review, but in the case before us, under the settled law, the jury is not alone responsible; the court also was mistaken in its judgment on the evidence if the jury was mistaken.</p>

But this verdict does not establish any such high degree of mental capacity as'is referred to in these cases ; it was - not the duty of the jury to specify the degree of mind; testamentary capacity or incapacity was what was submitted to them to find, and the court instructed them to adopt the usual legal phraseology indicating testamentary capacity only. So that on the subject of undue influence, the question of whether the testamentary mind of testatrix was of that kind which made it peculiarly susceptible to influence, still remained open as an element of fact on which evidence, direct or inferential, could properly be adduced to aid the jury in their answers to the fourth and fifth interrogatories. We think, therefore, that assuming testamentary capacity to have existed, as the verdict established it, it was perfectly proper for the court to admit the evidence offered tending to show weakness of mind with relation to the management of her business and estate. If she could be easily persuaded against her interest in money matters, easily controlled and managed by others stronger minded, and more selfish and sordid than herself, although in her social, domestic and religious affairs her intellect was up to the average, still, evidence of weakness of mind in the transaction of business and care of her estate was admissible.

Plaintiff produced the writing, then called the subscribing witnesses who proved its execution; the court permitted the paper to be read; plaintiff then rested; contestants then proceeded with their evidence tending to show that the will was procured by the undue influence of John B. Robinson, the principal beneficiary ; plaintiff then fully replied, and all the evidence having any bearing on the issue was before the court and jury. Contestants, when plaintiff rested his case', might have argued, whether successfully or not we do not decide, that the proof of execution was insufficient, that the principal beneficiary had produced the writing to testatrix and assisted in the execution of it, and that there was no sufficient evidence that she knew its contents, therefore, they might have moved for a verdict in their favor; it would have then been our duty to decide whether plaintiff had made out, prima facie, such a case as cast the burden of proof on defendants ; but they did not do this; they at once attacked the will and sought to overthrow it by evidence tending to show it had been procured by the undue influence of John B. Robinson. Whether at that stage of the trial the burden was on them or not, they chose to assume it; we will not decide whether what they picked up and carried was their load or not, but will treat any defects in the proof of execution, so far as they have any bearing in defendant’s favor on the question of undue influence, as evidence vindicating the judgment, for it will be noticed that after the whole evidence was in, the case, in many respects, was very different from that which it presented when plaintiff first rested; then, John B. Robinson’s evidence, when called on his own side, taking up 132 pages of printed testimony, affirmatively, as to proof of the execution of 'the will, and explanatory of his incidental connection therewith, was not before the jury; after that, it was no longer a case solely for the court, .but for the jury on the whole of the evidence.</p>

Guthrie of the property left by her husband, valued at his death at about $100,000, in which trust the son included about $10,000 of his own property; the trust secured a life estate to the mother with remainder at her death and the death of her other sons, to John B. Plaintiff himself testifies, that he urged bis mother to create this trust, because he discovered that she had been by improvident expenditures, denuding herself of her property. Therefore, it is argued, it is not an unreasonable inference, that at this early period she lacked that business ability and strength of mind necessary to guard her against imposition. It is to be noted, she was at that time only fifty-nine years of age ; if then improvident and too easily persuaded, this weakness would probably become more pronounced as she grew older, in the remaining twenty-four years of her life. The defendants then offered evidence tending to show that from that time down to her death, her incompetency continued. In 1879 she took up her home with her son in Media; their incomes went into a “ common purse,” although her separate income was paid regularly ; no separate account was kept of it. In February, 1889, her brother Eccles Robinson died leaving her property in real estate and cash amounting to over $400,000; part of the trust estate given her by her husband still remained, how much does not clearly appear, for part had been sold and there was on it a mortgage of $20,000. Afterwards, Guthrie resigned, and by proper proceedings Motheral and Lea were appointed trustees; soon after the death of her brother Eccles, she gave her son a power of attorney to transact her business; as nearly as we can gather from the testimony, during the following eleven years of her life her whole annual gross income was about $25,000 ; her debts at her death in mortgages and other claims for loans and bills amounted to about $275,000, the income and money borrowed making a' total of about $500,000, much of which passed into and through the hands of the son individually or as her attorney in fact; during these years the mother kept no account whatever, not even a bank account; her son rendered no written accounts to her for he kept none; he kept <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>at times an individual bank account and one as attorney in fact, subject to his draft, but most of the money from her estate during the latter years of her life was realized from his sight and time drafts on Motheral and Lea, the agents for the estate at Pittsburg. Their accounts showed the amounts they paid out. It is argued that these methods of receiving and disbursing these large amounts of her money, at the rate of $50,000 a year, by her son and agents, disclose an almost childish weakness on her part and make plain a persistent dominance of her mind by the son in all affairs relating to her property.</p>

Any one who patiently wades through the 1,300 pages of printed testimony in the appendix cannot fail to come to the conclusion, that the management at “ both ends of the line,” as they termed Media and Pittsburg, was utterly lacking in business system or method; it exhibits all the reckless devices and shifts of those in continual financial straits, even to what is called in street slang, the “kiting” of checks between the attorney in fact at the one end of the line and the agents at the other.

For example, note this extract from a letter of the son August 31,1899, to the agents at Pittsburg: “ Mother is complaining about a matter which I think you could easily obviate; she says that when Mr. Lea was here, he promised she would not have to wait or wire for money any more, but that he would see it was remitted to her; now why not do this, I do not mean large amounts. She would be satisfied with <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>much smaller sums if they were remitted from time to time.Why not send her a check or a draft this week that way ?

    <p id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[113,638,1186,918]]]'>The reason the money was not sent, will be noted in this reply of Motheral and Lea to John B.

We cannot now, we are going to help Moses in our present financial condition.” Clearly, she believed she had money and had a right to a small remittance; just as clearly, both her attorney and agents withheld from her the reason her demand was denied; then the son suggests, that she be quieted by small sums from time to time in which the agents seem to have concurred. On April 14, 1900, the son asks the agents to borrow for a short time $250 and remit to his mother, as she cannot understand why there is not enough to supply her wants at any time. Two days aftér, on the 16th, the agents remitted the money without intimating it was borrowed, although they had written the son only a few days before that his mother’s account was overdrawn $3,800.</p>

Mr. Slack mailed you the will, you had better have it executed. Is there not some scheme you can suggest to get these taxes up ? The Penna. Co. is threatening foreclosure.” The very same day they wi'ite this brief note to the mother: “We inclose herewith our accounts rents showing balance $1,741.77 due us, and for which we will take credit in next account. We also inclose authorization slips for transfers. Please sign and return to us immediately.” The reasonable inference the mother would draw from the note was, that her estate was indebted to her agents the comparatively small sum of $1,741.77, which they would deduct from next monthly account, yet the son was in<a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>debted to them on accepted drafts on the estate $5,000 or $6,000 to which, that very day they bad emphatically called his attention. Then the next day, the 31st, they write to the son this note: “You had better send us a judgment note of your mother for $2,850 to pay the 1897 taxes. We will endeavor to negotiate same. Probably you had better send us also, several notes to cover the 1898 taxes, $8,132.58, in amounts of $2,500. We will do our best to get the cash on them.” It will be noticed, that in the note to the mother there is not a hint of back taxes past due from two or three years of $11,000, or the son’s overdrafts of several thousand more making altogether probably $15,000. The agents at neither end of the line gave her the information it was their plain duty to give. It was not remarkable, that the mother did not understand why her small remittances out of a $25,000 rent roll did not come promptly to hand. At times, she had a vague apprehension, that through her son’s and perhaps her own extravagance, her large estate was slipping away from her, and she so expressed herself frequently to others and complained to them of her son; when told by reputable persons that she could stop it by taking away from him all power ever her affairs, she said she would do so but did nothing. This is by no means inexplicable. She was not of strong mind; nearly all her children were dead; she was old; if she took such radical action with this son, who treated the estate as his own, and perhaps thought it was, it probably meant a breaking of her home ties, a severance of relations with her remaining kindred ; the thought of this to a woman of her age and growing physical infirmities would be unendurable and she submitted. These are- examples out of many, of the sort of control exercised over her and her affairs by her son and her agents from 1896 to the day of her death. What owner of a large estate of average intellectual capacity would have submitted to such dominance of her affairs, unless it had been brought about and kept up by the design and superior will of others ?</p>

Manley a conveyancer, had drawn a power of attorney for her to her son in 1881, by instructions from the mother communicated to him by the son; this power she executed; within eighteen months afterwards, she came back and com<a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>plained to him of the manner in which her son was mismanaging her property and seemed to be worried; he told her she could at once get rid of this trouble by breaking the power of attorney; she said she would, but, so far as he knew, did not. To a neighbor, Margaret Leedom, with whom she often talked about her affairs, she complained of the unnecessary and lavish way in which her son was using her money, that it would not last during her old age, that she would be reduced to poverty; she was always going to stop him but never did. To another, J. D. Ivison, the proprietor of the hotel where she stayed with her son and his family, she complained, that the son’s checks to her were not cashed, because he had no money in the bank. Her complainants of his conduct were frequent during the three years preceding 1893. To another, Joseph Chadwick, 'editor of a newspaper in Media, she frequently came to borrow a Pitts-burg paper, saying, that at home they hid the papers away from her; before 1889, but while the Guthrie trust was in force she told him her son had secured possession of her estate by a power of attorney while she was sick, and by threats of violence; he advised her to write to her attorney at Pittsburg; she said her son would not mail the letter; he told her to bring it to him and he would mail it; this she did and he mailed it; then about the year 1897 she talked to him about making her will, said her mail had been tampered with in correspondence with Mrs. Odessa Robinson the mother of two of contestants ; these talles or complaints were twenty or thirty in number. To another, George Newman, who was in the employ of the son in 1896 and 1897, she frequently talked and complained of her son squandering her money and expressed fears that none would be left for her grandchildren; that the son instructed him not to give her any letters from Motheral and Lea that came for her in the mail; that she gave him telegrams addressed to Motheral and Lea in the presence of the son, and the son would tell him to take them to the telegraph office, but before that, had instructed him, to only to pretend to do so, and if she afterwards asked him if he had sent them to say “ Yes ” ; that once she wanted the son to do something to which he objected and her son swore at her. Heard her say once, that if she was able to attend to her own business she would see that it was managed differently. William R. Newbold, of the banking firm of Hoopes and Newbold} <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>with whom an account was kept by the son amounting to many thousands of dollars running from March 4,1889, soon after her brother’s death, to June 27, 1892, testifies, that probably on three or four occasions, the mother called to know how her son’s account stood; he declined to answer except in presence of her son; then on informing the son of his mother’s inquiries, the son instructed him to not give her information except when he the son was present, that he would tell her all she wanted to know. To a number of witnesses she expressed an intention to die intestate. Said her own fortune had come in that way and that would make her grandchildren equal.</p>

That even if it should show, that in the years previous to 1900 the son induced or persuaded his mother to do that which was in opposition to her wishes, the question still is, was she of disposing mind and memory when she signed the writing in dispute, and was the act then, without unlawful constraint on the part of the son ? All the authorities cited by counsel for appellant hold this to be settled law and we neither question nor desire to question it. But while the facts narrated as to the size and disbursement of the estate and the testimony of witnesses as to complaints of testatrix: and conduct of the son cover years, they come down close to the preparation and execution of the will. The feebleness of mind which made her susceptible to undue influence had existence in 1876. If it had arisen from illness, or other cause temporary in its nature, the presumption would be, that the end of the cause was the end of the weakness; but the evidence tends to show, this streak of mental infirmity was inherent, commencing, probabty, with her birth and continuing with constantly increasing mani<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>festations through old age until death. A long chain of circumstances running through many years point to the conclusion, that hers was a mind easily controlled as to business matters, quickly diverted from its purposes, and not difficult to subject to the stronger will of another. Appellant’s counsel state a long series of facts separately and ask, is any one of the facts sufficient to prove mental weakness or undue influence ? We answer no, not one of them ; but taking them all together, their continuity, the character of them, extending over many years, they pointed to a weak, irresolute mind readily susceptible to the influence, whether lawful or unlawful of a stronger one. Her frequent complaints to many reputable persons outside her own family, when taken in connection with the lavish expenditures which at fitful intervals she seems to have vaguely comprehended, show this with striking significance. As is said in McTaggart v. Thompson, <a href="/pa/14/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="14 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="405984" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0149-01">14 Pa. 149</a>, “ Nothing can indicate more cleariy weakness of mind, than complaining of that which he can so easily remedy by burning the will.” The testatrix could have, at any time, revoked the power of attorney; at any time have dismissed her agents and transferred their duties to another. In Rambler v. Tryon, 7 S. &amp; R. 90, also a will ca.se, the testator complained to others, that “his wife and father plagued him to go to Lebanon; that they wanted him to give her all or he would have no rest; that he did not want to go to Lebanon.” This complaint was held to have been properly admitted as evidence of weakness of mind and undue influence. That which unlawfully thwarts the wishes of weak minds, only prompts complaints ; the same thing arouses strong minds to action, and they effectively put an end to any interference with their purposes by getting rid of the offender.</p>

John B. Robinson testifies that a will was prepared in 1891, but he believes that one was destroyed; that sometime earlier than July, 1899, there was talk between him and his mother of a will, and she said she would go to Pitts-burg and arrange her affairs there and make a will; that he went to Pittsburg with her in September for that purpose; when they got to Pittsburg he went to her room at the Monongahela house and noted down for her the disposition she intended to make of her property; that he thinks he then took <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>the rough draft made by him downstairs and had it typewritten ; then he took it back and read it over to her; then made some corrections of it in his own hand, again read it over to her and she expressed herself as satisfied, and that he then left the paper with her; the next he heard of it was on October 22, following, when Motheral and Lea mailed to him a copy of a will drawn by Mr. Slack, an attorney in Pittsburg, sajdng, “We inclose herewith copy of will as per your copy,” meaning the copy prepared in his mother’s room ; that he had seen no paper relating to the will from the time he left the copy with his mother in her room at Pittsburg, until he received by mail the copy from Motheral and Lea a month afterwards ; that he delivered the copy so received to his mother who had then returned home; then he heard nothing further until January 24, 1900, about three months after he had given it to her, when she brought it to Mm and said she wanted some alterations, immaterial ones, made, specifying them; he then mailed the copy with the alterations noted, to Motheral and Lea, to have a corrected draft of it made ; that he never saw his mother’s will from that day until November 13 following, a period of about nine months ; on that day she was sick in bed, having been ill for a week ; before breakfast of that morning he went into her room; she said, “ I have a paper in the bureau drawer I want fixed up,” that he went to the drawer, took out the paper, looked over it and said, “ This is your will, mother. Is this the paper you want witnessed ? ” She said it was. “ Get Mr. Dickson and have it attended to.” About ten o’clock he telephoned Mr. Dickson that his mother wanted to see him; Dickson came and they both went upstairs to his mother’s room ; that he went to the drawer, got the paper and handed it to Dickson ; that either before or after he handed it to Dickson he explained it to his mother; that he read some of it and explained its provisions, but did not read the whole of it; that he said to her; “ You must understand, mother, this will give James what you arranged for in Pittsburg and leaves the rest of the estate to me, — the whole of it. Understand what you are doing in this matter. This gives me the estate ; ” and she said “ Yes,” and he went out of the room, but not so far away as not to be within hearing of what was going on; that the will had been signed with the proper name of his mother when he first saw it-that morning; <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>but that Mr. Dickson held the pen for his mother and she also put her mark; that his mother asked Dickson if it was all right and he answered it was. Charles H. Thomas, the first subscribing witness, had lived in the family for eleven years, and knew testatrix well, was called to the room by Mr. Dickson; Mr. Robinson went to the drawer and got the paper, and went over the contents to his mother; then handed the paper to Mr. Dickson, and he said, “Is that all right, grandmother? ” and she said “Yes;” then she. made her mark; he thinks something was said about her signature, and it was said her mark would answer, as her signature was already there; he believed that at the time she was in full possession of her faculties. T. Speer Dickson, the other subscribing witness, was a lawyer and partner of John B. Robinson ; he did not appear at the trial but his testimony at the hearing before the orphans’ court was read from the stenographic notes then taken; he says he went to the room of testatrix; that her son produced the will; that witness then went to her and said he was there to witness her will and she assented; that when he opened the paper he noticed it had been signed by her; he thought it was necessary she should make her mark as it had already been signed, and he suggested that her mark be made; that he took the pen and with both his and her hand^on it she made her mark; after that was done, she took him by the hand and said, “ Now, Mr. Dickson, it is all right, is it ? ” And he told her it was all right; his inference was, that as she wanted to make a will, she wanted to know if that was it and it was all right. He said he never read the will at any time and was ignorant of its contents until after her death. May Disert, the nurse of testatrix, was in the room all of the time, testified to, and says Mrs. Robinson, though very feeble physically was mentally bright; that she heard the son say, “ Mother, here is your will,” that he then read portions of it to her, and she nodded her assent; that this was all the knowledge witness had of the will; that she remembers beside the bequest of personal property to the children, a portion of the estate was set aside to the widow of one of the sons to be paid monthly, and that in response to a question of Mr. Dickson, she said she was perfectly satisfied.</p>

But as before remarked, in so far as the evidence bearing on the preparation and execution of the will tends to show mental weakness, an inability to resist persistent importunity or to assert her own will power concerning the disposition of her property, the evidence is proper for consideration, and to that extent only, we notice it.</p>

Robinson shows, that he talked with his mother concerning the making of her will not later than the July preceding; he wrote to Motheral and Lea, that she was going to Pittsburg to make her will; he went to Pitts-burg with her for that purpose and then with her to her room at the hotel where a rough draft Avas made by him in her presence,; this he took out and had typewritten and brought it back to her room where he left it. The next morning it was taken by some one to the office of Motheral and Lea and the same day by one of the firm, probably Mr. Lea, to the office of Mr. Slack, their lawyer; he had before that time transacted some legal business for John B. and was known to him. Mr. Slack dictated to his typewriter from the notes or rough draft of the will made at the hotel, substantially the aauII read in evidence, except in the draft made in Mrs. Robinson’s room there Avas a bequest of $25,000 to Mary Parker Robinson, which does not appear in the will now before us. Mr. Slack testifies, he sent the copy drawn by him to Motheral and Lea and they testify it was mailed by them to John B. Robinson on October 28, 1899. On January 24, 1900, John B. Robinson remailed the copy to Motheral and Lea, in which he said his mother desired certain alterations ; they delivered the paper to Mr. Slack with the suggested alterations; he made another copy and mailed it to Mrs. Robinson <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>at Media without letter or instructions ; that copy is the one now produced as her last will. It must have reached Media about the first week in February, 1900. So far as appears, nothing further is known concerning it until the morning of November 18, the same day it was executed, when as John B. Robinson testifies, she directed him to take it from her bureau drawer. Testatrix did not know Mr. Slack and never saw him; no communication passed between them; he was the regular attorney of Motheral and Lea. They were very desirous that she should make a will. As early as April, 1900, Mr. Lea, after consultation with his partner, Mr. Motheral, thought it best for them that she should make a will; in that month he called upon her in Media, and urged her to make one. He says their firm had indorsed Mrs. Robinson’s paper to the amount of $20,000 and it was for the purpose of avoiding complications and delay, that they desired a will and the appointment of executors. In what way a will would relieve the settlement of the estate from complications is not clear to us; a will could neither help nor hinder the payment of their debt; no will can affect the right of a creditor to be paid first: Blake’s App., <a href="/pa/134/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="134 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="814941" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0240-01">134 Pa. 240</a>. But whatever the motive, Lea testifies that he went to Media and verbally urged her to make a will; that is something, he says, he would not have written to her about, and gives no- reason, yet whatever it was, it did not restrain him from writing on January 30, 1900, to the son, saying: “ Mr. Slack mailed you the will, you had better have it executed.” Motheral and Lea also had interviews with her at Pittsburg and both talked with her concerning the preparation of the will. Although she remained there six weeks the will was not submitted to her for approval; it was not until after she returned home that the paper came into her hands from her son ; then the son remailed it to Pittsburg with alterations for a new draft of it; this was made and returned to her by mail without letter or instructions, the date blank and a blank space for the appointment of an additional executor.</p>

Mary Parker Robinson was a special object of testatrix’s love and affection; more than once she declared her intention' to provide for this <em>child; </em>in the will of 1891, which had been canceled, she was given $50,000; there is a reasonable inference why the bequest was reduced; the beneficiary was then nine years younger, and not yet reared and educated; besides, testatrix probably knew her estate had been considerably depleted in subsequent years; but why she should cut off this beloved orphaned grandchild entirely, wholly change her mind in a few hours, if she did change it, and give practically the whole of the estate to the uncle, is without credible explanation, if we assume, as we must assume, that testatrix had testamentary capacity, and further, that in making her will she was not influenced by others. If the will came into her hands about the 1st of February, 1900, she spoke not of it again until the morning of November 18 following, ten months afterwards; it was first seen by the son and then, as he testifies, her signature, “ Letitia Robinson,” was to it, but not witnessed ; if that was her genuine signature, subscribing witnesses were not necessary; it would not be unusual ignorance for a layman not to know this ; but to inform and aid her she had two lawyers, her son and Mr. Dickson, both of whom seemed to think it must be again subscribed by her in the presence of attesting witnesses, so she made her mark. The son testifies that in the presence of Dickson he read parts of the will and explained others to her; Mr. Dickson does not so testify; he says positively that he knew nothing of the contents of the will until after her death, although, if it had been partly read and explained in his presence by the son, he must have wholly forgotten that fact; the man Thomas and May Disert, the nurse, largely corroborate the son’s testimony. In the will is a substantial provision for her son James, although he had been in his grave for eight months, a fact well known to her, for she helped make arrangements for his funeral, and about three months before her death had paid the expenses of bis burial ; yet this provision, which she must have known had become <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>ineffective, was permitted to remain unchanged. Taking the-testimony in its most favorable aspect towards appellant, these facts are undisputed; the son is almost the sole beneficiary under the will, he knew her weakness as early as 1876, had for years managed all her affairs to his own large profit, had assisted and advised her in the preparation of her will, was the chief agent in the execution of it, was present and in unmistakable language made known his presence to her just as she was being propped up in bed to make her mark, then retired out of sight but not out of hearing, did not leave the will in her custody, but had it locked up in his office safe.</p>

Robinson contradicts it in some important particulars, and as to others which are calculated to arouse suspicion, he furnishes plausible and reasonable explanations. If the son had not been called at all as a witness, and the verdict on the whole issue had been against contestants, the law, which so rigidly watches the conduct of the chief beneficiary, who aids in the preparation and execution of a will, might have moved the court to set the verdict aside ; yet with his testimony in full, if the jury had credited it, it is probable the verdict would have been the other way; in which event, it is doubtful if the court below would have disturbed it. But the jury seem to have discredited his testimony because of its inconsistency with that given at the preliminary hearing. As already noticed, testatrix made her will on the 13th of November, on the 23d she died, on the 12th of December, four weeks after the will was executed, the preliminary hearing was had; the son was then called as if on cross-examination and testified, that he had very little to do with the preparation of the will; that he had never seen it until the day it was executed ; that he had, to adopt his own language, “ Nothing at all to do with the construction of the will; ” had never talked with his mother about the contents of the paper; that he thought his mother took the paper home with her to Media when she left Pittsburg. When it is remembered that at the trial a year after, he testifies, that his mother went to Pittsburg with him to prepare her will; that she in conference with him did prepare it in her room at the Monongahela House ; that he took notes and had them typewritten, then left the typewritten copy with his mother after <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>some alteration in his own hand; that from this the will was made; that the copy was mailed to him by Motheral and Lea and after consultation with his mother and some alterations was re-mailed to Mr. Slack for the final copy, which was returned to his mother, the inconsistency of the two statements is so glaring, that the jury had reason to discredit him. His explanation is that the letters of Motheral and Lea, and their statements just before the trial, which he did not have before him at the'preliminary hearing, brought to his mind facts which at the hearing he had wholly forgotten. But the sufficiency of this reason was for the jury and was clearly submitted to them by the court below.</p>

The testatrix was a maiden lady who had executed her will in her seventy-ninth year; this remained unaltered for seven years or until 1891; her niece and her niece’s husband were her most intimate friends and companions; in that year, 1891, she concluded to add a codicil to her will; she sent for this nephew by marriage, a reputable lawyer, and informed him of her wish, and he prepared the codicil and left it with her; she then sent for her physician who brought with him another physician to witness it; they spent over an hour with her they read to her the codicil and by questions satisfied themselves, she fully understood it; she then, signed and they witnessed it; both testified, although she was then eighty-six years, old that she was in good health mentally and physically; the nephew, the draughtsman of the codicil, was not present, nor was he in the house when it was executed; the day following she-gave him the will which he by her instructions deposited with a trust company, subject to her order ; although she lived two years afterwards, she made no change; the codicil gave about half an estate of $90,000 to her niece, -the wife of the draughtsman, and $5,000 to him. The court held, that instead of the facts showing undue influence, they negatived that idea.

Ency. of Law, 488, after citing very many cases on the subject of undue influence in dealings between parent and child, gives this as the result: “The courts generally regard such dealings as rather to be favored then condemned, as being one means of performing a parental duty. On the other hand, the courts will eagerly seize upon any circumstances tending to show imposition when proved and will give them due weight. Such a circumstance would be the great age of the parent or his failing health. As used in the law of wills undue influence has been defined, ‘ As that which compels the testator to do that which is against his will, from fear, the desire of peace, or some feeling which he is unable to resist.’ .... The influence necessary to destroy the free agency of the testator and substitute the will of another depends upon the strength of will of the testator. Each case will differ from every other one. As has been said, it is a relative thing always to be taken in the concrete. The question in each instance is, was the influence exerted, sufficient under the circumstances, to overcome the will of the particular testator, whose will is before the court ? ” Then when there is conflicting evidence, or evidence from which conflicting inferences may be drawn, the advantage which a jury has over an appellate court and the intelligent aid it may give in ascertaining the truth is aptly pointed out by Justice Mitchell in Sharpless’s Estate, <a href="/pa/134/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="134 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="814925" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0250-01">134 Pa. 250</a>.</p>

So on the other hand it is equally clear that the proponent’s evidence would not only support but uncontradicted would command a verdict. Does it, however, so completely meet, answer and overthrow the contestant’s case as to leave but a one-sided issue? We cannot say so. Looking at the whole evidence as put before us in print, we do not think we can say, that the balance is not doubtful. So much depends on the means of knowledge, the interest or bias, the manner, the character, and the personal weight each witness carries as an individual among his neighbors and in the community, that a jury is the only appropriate tribunal to determine which way the balance inclines. Having the testimony present to their <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>eyes, as well as tbeir ears, the truth may be made manifest beyond any substantial doubt.”</p>

In this class of cases it is always difficult for a court to adopt a succinct statement of the law which the jury can readily apply to the evidence before them. As the law already quoted says : “ Each case will differ from every other one. Undue influence is a relative thing always to be taken in the concrete.” The learned trial judge enunciated the law in general as found in the books on the subject of undue influence; as was necessarily the case, much of it had no application to the particular evidence before him and therefore, would give no light to the jury in their deliberation upon it; but in view of what he said in the conclusion of his charge, the jury could not have been confused or misled; the learned judge said to them:</p>

That is true, he may do so, he has a perfect right to do it, and if the only effect was to move her affections or sense of duty, or judgment, he has a perfect right to do it. But if these importunities were such as the testator hadn’t the power to resist, and yielded for the sake of peace and quiet, or escaping from serious distress of mind, if they were carried to a degree by which the free play of testator’s judgment, or discretion, or wishes were overcome, it is undue influence. He can coax her, but he must not drive her, either by moral coercion or physical force.”</p>

These declarations were not offered to controvert the facts of the execution of the will, nor to show that it was the outcome of duress or fraud not involving her mental condition. For such purpose they would have been inadmissible as the authorities cited by appellant decide. They were offered as tending to show the mental weakness of testatrix and that the will was procured by the undue influence of her son.

Robinson were permitted to go to the jury and consequently affected other legatees who had nothing to do with the preparation or execution of the will. Under this head appellants’ counsel group 226 assignments of error, setting them out in the old form of a multiplication table. The authorities cited sustain their point, but the point is not framed to fairly cover the ruling of the court on the admission of the offer. In Nussear v. Arnold, 13 S. &amp; R. 323, Clark v. Morrison, <a href="/pa/25/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="25 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="975755" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0453-01">25 Pa. 453</a>, and other cases, it is held that the interest of devisees under a will are several and not joint, therefore, that the declarations of one against his codevisees are not admissible to affect their interests. But it will be noticed in these cases, that the declarations consisted in an opinion of the legatee as to the testamentary incapacity of the testator and for that purpose they were offered. In the first case cited, there was evidence that three women had combined to get the testator drunk and procure from him a will in their favor; that they had declared to him they were persons of virtue and good character. These declarations made in car<a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>rying out the conspiracy were admitted, but the declaration of one of them outside the scope of the conspiracy that “ the testator was incapable of transacting business,” was held inadmissible. Chief Justice Tilghman, in deciding the case, says: “ We are now to establish a general principle to govern all cases of this kind.” That general principle was, that the conduct and declarations of those procuring a will by unlawful means, tending to show their purpose, are evidence; the independent declarations of one as to testamentary incapacity are not. Here, the offer was not to prove declarations of incapacity, it was to prove a confidential relation between the chief beneficiary and testatrix, collusion between him and her agents to procure her to make a will; and by the course of business between them extending over years, the subserviency of a weak mind to stronger ones. The only independent declarations proven were those of John B. Robinson on the witness stand, that his mother was not weak but was entirely capable, and had knowledge of her affairs; these statements formed no part of contestant’s offer and w;ere not the subject of the court’s ruling. The court, after most careful consideration, admitted the evidence of the business and confidential relations of the parties from long before, down to the date of the will, strictly confining it to the purpose offered. In this there was no error. Says Justice Gibson in Patterson v. Patterson, 6 S. &amp; R. 55, “In fact, the evidence of practice on the intellect of a weak man, is usually compounded of ingredients so various in their nature and remote in their consequence and connection, that the question of relevancy is often of very difficult solution. In such a case the court should lean in favor of admitting the evidence, to enable the jury to judge from a consideration of all the circumstances.” The case before us does not to us seem even difficult of solution; if the evidence admitted were to be held incompetent, we can scarcely conceive of any case, short of actual physical duress, where undue influence could be proven. All the assignments of error under this caption are overruled.</p>

The court decided that there was a lawful execution of the writing by testatrix when she made her mark; he submitted to the jury to find whether the name “ Letitia Robinson ” was her genuine signature independent pf the mark; <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>as before noticed, the verdict on both questions was for plaintiff. Whether the circumstances attending the execution of the will tended to show a weak condition of mind unduly influenced at the time by her confidential adviser and principal beneficiary, was for the jury on the fifth interrogatory. It was, in connection with all the other evidence, a circumstance which might show a lack of ability to resist a stronger will; but disassociated from that influence, the facts of testamentary capacity and execution of the will remained undisturbed; and this was not only what in substance the court charged, but plainly charged. Assume that the court’s instructions, that the making of the mark was a due execution of the will, and the instructions submitting to them the genuineness of her signature, were inconsistent, still as the verdict on both points was in favor of the plaintiff, he, not being hurt thereby, has no ground of complaint.

Through an unbroken line of decisions for a century, this court has not failed in unmistakable terms to express its aversion to groundless litigation of a will by disappointed legatees.

The latter is what we do in this case.</p>

As to the <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>first two points the evidence was such that the judge directed a verdict for the will. This left for the jury only the question of undue influence. Upon this there was no evidence amounting to a scintilla that any undue influence, if any ever existed at all, operated at the time of the execution of the will. The instrument in its final form was prepared by counsel in Pitts-burg, mailed directly to the testatrix, and next appears in the evidence when produced by the testatrix from her own custody. The brunt of the argument against the will amounts to no more than that it is unnatural and suspicious. Whether a will is unnatural in a moral or ethical sense which cuts off some descendants and favors others is a question of casuistry with which the law is not concerned. A will is unnatural in a legal sense only when it is contrary to what the testator under the admitted circumstances and with his known sentiments would have made, and it is only on that ground that the question is admissible at all, to. wit: that it tends to show that what testatrix did was not from her own natural impulse but from coercion.</p>
