Committee on loan reported having negotiated a loan of fifteen thousand dollars on first mortgage for five years, and money would be forthcoming next week or as soon as the necessary papers were ready. On motion of Colbert and Smith, the report of the committee on loan was received, accepted, and the president authorized to execute the mortgage.” This loan had been negotiated through John I. Blair from A. H. Scribner in New York city. On the previous 8th day of August, a committee consisting of Conrad Miller, C. Amy, and the secretary had been appointed to borrow $20,000. The agreement now in dispute was signed at the time the money was paid over to the president of the slate company. It was given to Mr. Miller, one of that committee, by Mr. Blair after five per cent commissions had then been deducted. The mortgage to Mr. Scribner was dated two days later. As the resolution above cited imposes no restriction or limitation upon the power of the president, it is insisted that he was invested with full discretion to determine the condition upon which the transaction should he finally closed, and that one of them was the execution of this agreement with the Bangor &amp; Portland Railway Company. This is not tenable. The contract respecting the loan from Mr. Scribner, for which security was then to be given, was quite independent of the engagement to the railroad company of which Mr. Miller was president.</p>

It was a common carrier; transportation as a public duty was imperative, and there was then no other accessible line of railway. It was not apparent that the plaintiff had been instrumental in procuring the loan, for which the mortgage was given to A. H. Scribner. The slate company knew only that it received the money and secured repayment thereof to the lender. In addition to this it knew that Mr. Miller, who carried the check, was a member of the committee designated in the resolution by the defendant’s board of directors to negotiate the loan, and that he was after-wards voted and received “ twenty shares of the capital stock of the company for services rendered in securing 115,000 as per agreement.”</p>
