    <p class="summary" id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[150,694,1186,872]]]'>[I say to you as a matter of law, that when this contract was signed with the stipulation in it that monthly estimates were to be made and paid within ten days to Mr. Chandley, eighty-five per cent of it, he had a right to presume that the money would be coming to him at the proper time, and if he went there in July — I think the 13th — I may be mistaken in dates ; do not take your dates from me; remember I simply use them to apply the law; you take them as you remember them — when he went there in July and met this council, and if they told him — you must determine what was said and done there, because you have two witnesses here as to that, and the evidence is not very profuse, I am frank to say, the evidence in that line — but from what you have you must determine what caused the delay. If that delay was caused by the borough not having the money nor the means to pay him, and if he did not get his pipe by reason of their fault, then they could not say that that was his fault altogether.] [2]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.6",171,[153,1572,1187,869]]]'>[There is one other phase of the case, and that is this: There was evidence here of monthly statements, estimates being made and amounts fixed and no objection raised at those particular times. You heard the discussion as to what was called a waiver. That was an offer. The court ruled it out, and we say to you now that those statements being filed by that engineer and accepted and paid by the borough, according to contract, reserving fifteen per cent, did not waive their rights to claim these penalties. While we say to you as a matter of law that these statements and payments are some evidence, not of waiver, but of admission on the part of the borough, of the correctness of the work, admissions of some evidence — what evidence is for you to say — we say simply some; we cannot say how much, but it is some that ought to go to the jury to take into consideration with the other matters, when you come to weigh it as a whole, and determine the good faith of the suit brought, and the defense made.] [3]</p>

I will simply illustrate by taking the s tandpipe, what I mean by substantial compliance. When you come to take the standpipe — and I use this as an illustration, because it strikes me to be a fair one under all the items that are here — you determine under that contract what was necessary to be done in order to make this standpipe so that it could be used as stipulated in the contract. If you determine from the evidence that placing the standpipe there, erecting and riveting it so as to hold water ready to use, is all that was necessary; that there was some little touches of painting, either outside or in, or that the entire painting was necessary to make a substantial completion : then you can determine what was that substantial completion in order to allow the use of it for that which it is intended to be used, and that would be the time. If you determine that it was necessary to be painted inside in order to be used in substantial compliance with the contract, then it would be time when it was finished inside. You men must determine the question of what was a substantial compliance, a substantial finishing in compliance with that contract, so far as this question goes, in order to determine the measure of damages, or rather the number of days for which default was made by this plaintiff, if any.] [4]</p>

    <p id="b173-6" data-blocks='[["BL_173.9",173,[124,733,1185,666]]]'>When this case was here before it was decided that the contract under which the defendant’s waterworks were constructed did not give to the engineer in charge the power to determine whether certain amounts agreed .upon in advance as liquidated damages for delay in completion should be deducted from the plaintiff’s claim. See <a href="/citations/?q=200%20Pa.%20280" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="200 Pa. 280">200 Pa. 280</a>. At the second trial this question was submitted to the jury. Both parties were in default under the terms of the contract, the plaintiff in not completing the works in the time fixed, and the defendant in not making payments promptly as the work progressed. The plaintiff claimed also an additional time allowance under the terms of the contract because of an increase in the quantity of work required..</p>
    <p id="b173-7" data-blocks='[["BL_173.10",173,[119,1409,1188,1025]]]'>The main contention was as to the responsibility for a delay of three weeks. At the time fixed for the commencement of the work, the borough had not succeeded in selling the bonds it had issued to provide the means of payment. The plaintiff began at once the building of an impounding well, but delayed ordering the pipe and pumps because the bonds had not been sold. If this delay was the sole cause of the noncompletion in time, the responsibility would rest with him. He took the chance of prompt payment when he entered into the contract, and was not justified in delaying the work because the borough did not have the money in its treasury in advance of the time it was due him. But the borough was in default in not making the first and second payments provided for by the contract. After its failure to pay the plaintiff might well hesitate to order expensive materials and machinery, and to the extent to which the delay in the completion of the work was due to its default, the plaintiff was relieved of responsibility. This question together with that of substantia] compliance was fairly submitted to the jury, and we find nothing in the assignments that requires a reversal.</p>
