There was a further finding that the timber was cut according to these sizes by the appellants’ jobber, Joseph Haney, in obedience to instructions which they gave him.</p>

Prior to that year no chemical wood had been sold or marketed from these lands, and no chemical or pulp wood was cut upon them at any time by the appellants until they had been cut over for timber purposes and the logs removed. In October, 1893, and annually thereafter, after the timber suitable for lumber had been cut and taken from the lands by the appellants for lumber purposes, they, by their jobbers, again went over the lands, cut the remaining trees and wood that were not suitable for lumber into pulp wood and chemical wood, and removed and sold the same. The grantees, having unmistakably indicated by their conduct in exercising their rights under the grants to them what they understood as having passed to them under “ all and all manner of timber,” cannot now be heard in <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>support of their contention that another interpretation should be placed upon these words. “ When we are asked to say what the parties meant or intended by their contract, it is entirely safe to point to their own construction of it, as evidenced by their course of dealing under it: ” People’s Natural Gas Co. v.

The conclusion cannot be avoided that the appellants would not be insisting that trees, which they manifestly did not regard as timber at the time of their purchase, should now be regarded as spch, if in the meantime the wood had not acquired value for purposes for which timber, either in the legal or common acceptation of the term, has never been used. The proper interpretation having been given by the court below to the word “ timber,” as used in the deeds to the appellants, the assignments are all overruled, and the judgment against the defendants below, for damages for cutting and removing trees which they had not purchased, is affirmed.</p>
