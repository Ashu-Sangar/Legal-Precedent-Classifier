No time was fixed during which this arrangement should continue, but, in fact, the plaintiff made all charges to the defendant on this basis.” <em>“ </em>The parties did not agree, as contended by the defendant, that the defendant should pay for twine bought by it from the plaintiff the smallest amount per pound paid by any of the defendant’s competitors for twine shipped to such competitors at the same time by the plaintiff, regardless of whether such twine was bought by such competitors in carload lots or in large quantities at a fixed price for future delivery as needed and regardless of when such contracts for future delivery were made.”</p>
