It has an authorized capital of $1,000,000, and a paid up capital of $8,000,000. It was organized for “the manufacture of any metal or article made from any metal or wood,’- and during the tax years was engaged in the manufacture of general materials for railways at Johnstown, Pennsylvania.</p>

In accordance with law the officers of defendant made and returned to the auditor general reports and appraisements of its capital stock for the tax years 1899 and 1900, appraising its capital stock for each year at $3,000,000, and claiming exemption from taxation on the ground that it is a manufacturing corporation, and that all its capital stock was invested in and actually and exclusively employed in manufacturing within the state, and we find this to be the fact.</p>

We do not think there is any difference in principle between the case.s where a foreign corporation is the owner of the capital stock of a domestic corporation and the cases where it is the lessee of such a corporation, and, therefore, for the reasons given in the opinions filed in Commonwealth v. Cambria Iron Company, 210 Commonwealth Docket, 1901, and Commonwealth v. American Car and Foundry Company, 229 Commonwealth Docket, 1901, we are of the opinion that the capital stock of defendant is exempt from taxation because it is invested in and actually and exclusively employed in manufacturing within the state.</p>
