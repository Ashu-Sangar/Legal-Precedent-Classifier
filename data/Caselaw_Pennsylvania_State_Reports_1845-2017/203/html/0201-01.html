To macadamize — Webster defines — “to cover as a roadway surface,” and Stormouth — “to cover a road or path with siñall broken stones, which uniting by pressure form a smooth hard surface.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[280,690,1184,305]]]'>But the defendant claims that section 7 applies only to the streets and avenues then unpaved with anything; in other words, to those outlaying streets upon which the company has never laid its tracks, presumably because there was not sufficient population residing along them to warrant the necessary expenditure.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="AQQv" data-blocks='[["BL_234.6",234,[281,1002,1184,497]]]'>There would be considerable force in this argument had the words “ asphalt blocks, belgian blocks, asphalt sheeting ” been omitted, for the section would then have read “ that whenever the borough shall hereafter pave or macadamize any street or streets along the line of said railway, with broken stone,” said company shall, etc.; and both High and Market streets being already macadamized, the word “ hereafter ” could very naturally and properly be construed as indicating that it had reference only to the dirt streets, that it might be deemed advisable to macadamize in the future.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b234-7" data-blocks='[["BL_234.7",234,[281,1516,1185,561]]]'>Those words, however, being in the ordinance, we must consider and treat them as having been put there for a purpose; and it is more consistent with reason and common sense to hold that the borough authorities desiring that the borough should be able to keep abreast with the progess of the age, and contemplating that the future, perhaps the near future, would require that its street in the central, business and much traveled parts of the town, should be paved with a more modern and better material, inserted them with that in view, rather than that they had in anticipation the paving of the dirt streets on the borders of the borough with any such expensive materials.</p>

McKeesport Pass.

    <p class="summary" id="b235-6" data-blocks='[["BL_235.7",235,[143,1606,1187,355]]]'>But the answer is, that the borough, with its horses, carts and corps of employees, daily making repairs upon its streets, and with its own crushed stone could, with but little additional inconvenience or expense, make those required upon the railway ; while the company, to make the same, would have to purchase or hire horses or carts, hire men and buy its materials, at very considerable expense to itself. .</p>

As was said by Mr. 'Justice Sterreit, in Philadelphia v. Ridge Ave. Pass. Railway Co., <a href="/pa/143/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="143 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="978527" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0444-01">143 Pa. 444</a>, “ the city authorities have just as much right to require it (the <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>railway company) to repave at its own expense, with a new, better and more expensive pavement, as they have to cause other streets. to be repaved in like manner at the public expense.”</p>
