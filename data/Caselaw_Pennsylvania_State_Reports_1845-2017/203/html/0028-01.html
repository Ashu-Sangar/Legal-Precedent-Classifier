In 1892 a petition of the corporation was presented to the court upon which its charter was amended in two respects, first, by changing the date of the election of directors from September to May in each year, and second, by the insertion of a provision to enable the corporation to mortgage its property by-vote of two thirds of the members present at a meeting called for that purpose.</p>

It seems to have been the purpose of the constitution to give, so far as possible, the right of minority representation by the exercise of the cumulative voting privilege in the case of all corporations. The second section of the sixteenth article is as follows: “ The general assembly shall not remit the forfeiture of the charter of any corporation now existing, or alter or amend the same, or pass any other general or special law for the benefit of such corporation, except upon the condition that such corporation shall thereafter hold its charter subject to the provisions of this constitution.”</p>

The decision in that case is in strict harmony with those previously cited, for the reason that the Academy of Music had neither amended its charter nor taken any benefit under that constitution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b61-6" data-blocks='[["BL_61.5",61,[143,990,1187,971]]]'>Still another case seems to indicate that there has been a reluctance on the part of our courts to attach the right of cumulative voting to private corporations which had acquired their franchises prior to 1874. We refer to Commonwealth ex rel. Fernberger v. Butterworth, <a href="/pa/160/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="160 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="852149" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0055-01">160 Pa. 55</a>. The old charter involved in that case prohibited the election of salaried officers as directors of the company. In 1891, however, a general statute was passed which authorized such an election, and the company acted under it and elected officers who received a salary, to be directors. This was held by our own court as well as by the Supreme Court in a per curiam opinion not to have the effect of conferring on the directors of the corporation the right to vote cumulatively. Whether or not an old corporation can by implication, without an express acceptance of the present constitution be subjected to its provisions is a question which must be regarded as still open. So far as corporations of the second class are concerned there is an enactment that their charters cannot be amended unless they shall accept the constitution: Act of June 13, 1883, P. L. 122.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b61-7" data-blocks='[["BL_61.6",61,[142,1971,1185,464]],["BL_62.1",62,[293,377,1183,397]]]'>No such express requirement seems to have been imposed upon coiporations of the first class, notwithstanding the method of amending their charters as provided for in the act of 1874, and in its supplement of 1876. It is necessary, therefore, for us to pass upon the question whether in the absence of any such statute a corporation like that created prior to 1874 became subject to the constitutional provisions as to cumulative voting by amending its charter in the method prescribed by the law after 1874. Some light may be regarded as thrown <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>upon this question by the decision of the Supreme Court in the Commonwealth v. Yetter et al., <a href="/pa/190/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="190 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="905092" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0488-01">190 Pa. 488</a>. The corporation therein concerned was a state normal school, and the act under which it was incorporated was passed in 1857, but the incorporation did not take place until 1893. It was ruled in effect that the constitution of 1874 applied to the case because it was the organic law when the corporate body came into existence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b62-5" data-blocks='[["BL_62.4",62,[291,792,1190,1644]],["BL_63.1",63,[134,357,1182,252]]]'>In the case in hand the amendments which have hereinbefore been recited were made under a petition addressed to the court by the corporation asking that those amendments should be allowed under the act of 1874, and by the decree of the court allowing them it was ordered that “ they shall be deemed and taken to the part of the charter of the Catholic Philopatrian Literary Institute.” It thus appears that under the statute which provided as the act of 1874 did for cumulative voting for directors and like officers, the amendments were made and became a part of the charter. It must be noted that this was done after the constitution of 1874 came into existence, at least a portion of the present charter, therefore, became such under the existing constitution. To that extent at least the franchise of the corporation would be subject to the organic law, but we think that in the disposition of the question like that before us, the charter cannot be split into parts so that the constitution would be applicable • to one portion and not to another. Por any such purpose as the present case demands it seems to us that the amendment of the charter in 1892 must be regarded to have been a renewal of the entire charter as of the date of the amendment, or, to put the matter in another form, as subjecting the corporation to the provisions of the constitution because it asked for and obtained new franchises subsequent to the time when that instrument went into effect. We regard this conclusion as inevitable in view of the premises' before stated. Under such a state of 'facts the formal acceptance of the constitution by an older corporation is not necessary. By obtaining new franchises it became ipso facto subject to the fundamental law which existed at the time they were created. By doing what was done in this case the corporation acquired a benefit under the new constitution, and it must therefore bear the burden of a regulation which, though, out of <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>harmony with the uniform practice of the corporation until the present year, is not in conflict with any express franchise originally conferred. It follows that a new trial, must .be refused and that judgment must be entered in favor of the relators on the special verdict.</p>
