The defendant, depending upon this proposition, contends that its route over Wallace and Brandy-wine a.venues coincided with that previously secured by the Downingtown &amp; Coatesville Company only upon Brandywine avenue, a distance of about 1,600 feet, and claiming that under the act of 1901, a coincidence of routes not in excess of 2,500 <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>feet is permitted, urges that the issuance of its charter was not in violation of the prohibition contained in the act of 1901.</p>

When a company has resolved upon an extension, has had its resolution recorded, and has duly filed an exemplication of this record, it has done everything required of it to establish an extension, and is, we think, immediately invested with a franchise, with an exclusive privilege in the streets covered by the extension. It is only the “ right to actually construct ” the extension which is deferred for thirty days after the date of filing the exemplification. The prohibition to construct the extension for thirty days was introduced probably to secure a period within which, in advance of the streets being actually occupied by the extension, opportunity would be afforded for investigating the validity of the extension, so that in case it should be successfully attacked within the period, for some informality or substantial unsoundness, the streets would be protected from incumbrance. As before stated, however, the legal adoption of an extension is consummated with the filing of the exemplication, and the franchise in the extension route must then immediately arise. In Hannum v. Media, etc., Railway Co., <a href="/pa/200/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="200 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="924425" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0044-01">200 Pa. 44</a>, the court says: <em>“ </em>Undoubtedly a company having a charter route and legally adopted extensions, may begin the construction at any point most convenient to itself. . . . there are here a trunk franchise and branch franchises.” This language of the Supreme Court is quoted as showing that a company secures its trunk, its main line franchise, when its charter is granted, and that it <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>secures its extensions, or branch franchises, when it has — as soon as it has — • “ legally adopted ” them. A provision in the act of 1901 that there should be no actual construction of the charter road until thirty days after the issuance of the charter, could not be held to mean that no franchise, no exclusive privilege in the charter route would attach for thirty days. Neither can the provision that is in the act of 1901, prohibiting the “actual construction ” of the extension for thirty days, be .held to mean that no franchise, no exclusive privilege in the “ legally adopted ” extension route, attaches for thirty days.</p>

The policy of the commonwealth, as reflected in our street railway legislation, is that not more than one company shall be permitted to occupy a street. If, as is contended in behalf of the defendant, a company secures no franchise in the route of its extension until thirty days after its legal adoption, and consequently a second company, during the thirty days, can legally secure a charter covering the same route as the extension, then the way is open for two companies to obtain rights to build roads upon the same streets at the same time. At the end of thirty days the company that legally adopted an extension will be authorized to construct that extension, and the company incorporated during the thirty da)rs with a coincident route, will be authorized to occupy the same streets. Applying the defendant’s contention to its situation and that of the Coatesville &amp; Downingtown Company, the result above pointed out is ex<a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>emplified. On June 26 the Coatesville &amp; Downingtown Company legally perfected the adoption of an extension over Wallace avenue. Neither within the thirty days next ensuing, nor since, was any attempt made to question the validity of this extension, nor can it be doubted that in so far as the state could give authority, this company was invested with a right, after thirty days from June 26, to “ actually construct ” its road on Wallace avenue. During these thirty days the defendant secured its charter to construct a road over Wallace avenue. If defendant’s proposition, that during the thirty days, the Coatesville &amp; Downington Company had no franchise in its extension route which precluded the lawful issuance of defendant’s charter, then has the state authorized both the Coatesville &amp; Downingtown Company and the defendant company to build roads on Wallace avenue at the same time. Such a situation, we are clear, is not intended by the law, and the defendant’s contention that during the thirty days immediately following the Coatesville &amp; Downington Company’s adoption of the extension over Wallace avenue, the defendant could lawfully be invested with a charter franchise to occupy that avenue, is manifestly opposed to the obvious design of existing railway legislation that the streets and highways of the commonwealth shall not be occupied by more than one company at a time.</p>

There can be but one meaning to these words, and that is, if the track is already laid, or even authorized to be laid, on the proposed street or highway, then there can be <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>no incorporation of such company. It cannot come into existence, and, as a matter of course, if a charter should be obtained in such circumstances, it would be simply nugatory; it could confer no power in hostility with tbe law of its creation. It seems to us that there can be no more convincing proof than this, that it is the settled, fixed policy of the commonwealth, as determined by this legislation, that there shall be no more than one lawfully authorized street passenger railway track laid upon the same street or highway at the same time.</p>
