    <p class="summary" id="b329-3" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[162,417,1185,975]]]'>1. Defendant is a Pennsjdvania company incorporated for manufacturing purposes, and during the tax year 1900, all of its capital stock, except $50,000, was invested in and actually and exclusively employed in the business of manufacturing cement in Lehigh county, Pennsylvania. On March 18, 1901, defendant’s officers made and returned to the auditor general a report and appraisement of its capital stock, appraising it at $2,347,385, and accompanied the report with a claim for exemption of the capital stock from taxation, for the reason that all of it except $50,000 was invested in and actually and exclusively employed in manufacturing within the state. They also stated in their report that the defendant company was leased to, owned and operated by another company, but the evidence given at the trial shows that this statement was not strictly correct, and that the fact is that the entire capital stock of defendant was owned by the Aifierican Cement Company of New Jersey, except a few shares held by citizens of Pennsylvania to qualify them as directors, but actually belonging to the New Jersey corporation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b329-4" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[160,1403,1183,508]]]'>2. The auditor general and state treasurer, claiming that defendant, under these facts, was not entitled to the exemption of its capital stock from taxation, settled an account against it, charging it with tax at the rate of five mills on the valuation of $2,347,385 returned by its officers, amounting to $11,736.92. Defendant paid to the state treasurer $250, the amount of tax due on the $50,000 not invested in and actually and exclusively employed in manufacturing, and the question to be determined is whether under these facts the rest of defendant’s capital stock is exempt from taxation.-</p>
