The language is clear and does not admit of any other construction. “ Upon the death of my said daughter, Barbara, the said principal sum of the three thousand dollars and all interest due thereon shall be paid to her legal issue, and descendants if she leaves any, according to the present intestate laws of this state, as if she were absolutely possessed thereof, and died intestate, single and unmarried; . . . . and in case she dies leaving no legal issue or descendants, than the said principal sum and interest due thereon, .... shall descend and be paid to, and I give and bequeath the same unto her brothers and sisters in equal shares and parts according to the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, as if it had been a bona fide absolute estate and she had died possessed thereof, intestate and unmarried.”</p>

This has no bearing on the quantum of her estate, for it is as consistent with the intent to preserve it for the remainder-men after her death as with any other purpose.
