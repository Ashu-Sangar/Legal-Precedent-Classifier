It did not appear that the entry was made with the consent of the owner. Benjamin Kauffman died in 1887, intestate, whereupon the land became vested in his heirs at law, who conveyed the land to William H. Kunlde in 1889. The said land, by divers conveyances, passed to D. B. Hoerner, on September 1,1895, who, by deed in fee, conveyed on February 19, 1901, the entire right of way occupied by the railroad to the company.</p>
