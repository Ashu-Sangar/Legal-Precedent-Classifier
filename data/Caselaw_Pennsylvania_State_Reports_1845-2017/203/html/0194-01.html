Deeming it for his interest to remove to Dakota, he executed upon March 20, 1878, a special power of attorney, authorizing his wife, Sarah Lewis, as his agent and attorney to collect all debts, rents or other moneys due him, or which might thereafter be payable to him, and to use the same for the support and maintenance of herself and children. He also authorized her to make sale of certain real estate, but there was no authority for her to appropriate the proceeds of any such sale of the real estate for the maintenance of herself and'children.</p>
    <p id="b225-10" data-blocks='[["BL_225.14",225,[148,2387,1138,44]],["BL_226.1",226,[326,364,1184,399]]]'>When Mr. Lewis removed to Dakota, it was expected that <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>in due time his wife and family should follow him. For some reason, however, they did not go, and the husband continued to reside in Dakota, while the wife and family remained in Pennsylvania. From time to time he made remittances of money, and more than once came back upon a visit. The wife, in the mean time, continued to collect and use the rentals of the husband’s real estate, and received the wages of the minor children.</p>

On December 11,1895, she executed and acknowledged another deed to her son for lot No. 145, for a consideration as expressed of $1,800.</p>

He also, as part of the consideration, made an agreement to support his mother for the remainder of her natural life.</p>

One of the cases relied upon in the other branch of the case, in sustaining the right to make the conveyance, is Peck v. Harriott, 6 S. &amp; R. 146. In this case, Duncan, J., on page 148, lays down the principle that, “ An attorney who has power to convey, has so essentially the power to receive the purchase money, that a voluntary conveyance, without receiving the stipulated price, or security for it, would be fraudulent, and either the whole contract might be rescinded by the principal or the vendee liable for the purchase money.”</p>

They hold substantially that an agent appointed generally to sell real or personal property must receive therefor a consideration in money, and that he cannot give away the property, or make a conveyance in consideration of love and affection in the principal for the grantee ; and that “ a valid exercise of the authority requires the transaction to be for the benefit of the principal, who is not bound by the pledge or transfer of the property by the agent as security or in payment of his own debts.”</p>

The conveyance based upon this indebtedness to her son, coupled with an agreement for her future support, was not a lawful execution of the power. The husband had aright under the power of attorney to expect that a sale would be made for a consideration which would be of value to himself, and which would yield him some substantial return. The real estate which he owned had a certain market value. So long as he held title to it that value belonged to him. It was certainly the duty of his agent and attorney in fact to obtain for the property when sold something like a substantial equivalent. Instead of making a sale which would yield such a result, the wife undertook to hand over the property to the son, without securing for her principal any equivalent whatever. The fact that the relation of husband and wife existed between them made no difference in the requirement of duty under the power of attorney: Wilson v. Wilson-Rogers, <a href="/citations/?q=181%20Pa.%2089" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="181 Pa. 89">181 Pa. 89</a>.
