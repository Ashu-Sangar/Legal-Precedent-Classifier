That the first payment made by the defendant on account of such moneys, was made February 11, 1892, at which time the defendant paid the treasurer of the school district $901.86, and failed to pay over or account for the additional sum of $2,310.31, which he had theretofore collected, and he still retained said last named amount, together with moneys thereafter collected by him until after the filing of the bill in this case in 1896, subsequent to which he made the following payments to the said treasurer on account of said moneys : April 5,1897, $659.98 ; June 15,1897, $1,449 84; July 29,1897, $115.70; September 1,1897, $32.00 ; April 29, 1898, $4.28 ; May 21, 1898, $255.44, making a total amount paid by defendant on account of said trust moneys of $3,419.10.</p>

At the time of making the deed to T. M. Nagle, the defendant received as a consideration therefor the sum of $90.00, which was not nearly enough to pay all of the taxes standing against said land.</p>

That when the defendant was so requested by the officers of the school district to settle up his accounts and pay over the balance in his hands,- he did not refuse to do so by reason of the treasurer not having receipted up his bids to the county treasurer, and made no objection by reason thereof, and so far as appears never called upon the school board to cause such receipting of his bids at the office of the county treasurer, although beginning with about 1892, the defendant did at diffirent times request Mr. George P. Colt, the treasurer of the school district, to receipt to the county treasurer for the school tax on the lands so purchased by the defendant in accordance with the provisions contained in the above quoted resolution.</p>
