The ownership in fee of said canal bridge and the land upon which it is located is vested in the Pennsylvania Canal Company. The owners of said canal <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>bridge and the land .... notify you not to interfere with the same, or any other property of the said canal company wherever situate, in any manner for passenger railway purposes.

If you persist in such occupation you will be resisted in every lawful way.” At the time this notice was served, October 29, 1897, the construction had progressed to within two miles of the canal bridge, and the defendant decided to disregard it and to continue the work. On November 26, 1897, a bill in equity, with affidavits and bond, was filed by the plaintiff, and a preliminary injunction was awarded. The defendant appeared and filed an answer, but after hearing, the court refused to continue the injunction, dismissed the bill at the cost of the plaintiff, and entered the following decree : “ It is ordered and decreed that the defendant be permitted to cross the canal property of the plaintiff upon the public highway and overhead bridge now in use by the general public. It is further ordered that before doing so the defendant so strengthen the said bridge as to make it sufficiently strong to carry its cars with entire safety; that this. be done without expense to plaintiff, and in such way as not to interfere with the use of its canal; that hereafter the defendant shall maintain said bridge, in a safe and serviceable condition, both for its own use and the use of the general public, at its own proper cost and expense,” from which the plaintiff appealed. The real and only question in the case is whether the Pennsylvania Canal Company is such an owner of land as to make its consent necessary before the street railway company could cross the canal over the bridge.</p>

To conserve both purposes, the canal company was charged with a proper maintenance of the structure; it has full power to raise or lower it, and it could not be changed or interfered with by the local authorities. It is the owner of the bridge by the same title that it owns the waterway beneath it.</p>

The change is at the cost of the railroad company, but the control of the true owner is taken away, and in its stead is substituted the judgment and dominion of the railroad company.

They have never asserted any right of control over the bridge since it was erected in 1831, and do not have the authority now to justify the railroad company in taking that which does not wholly belong to the public. The canal company has a property right in the land and bridge which cannot be taken or appropriated by the railroad company, as it does not have the right of eminent domain : Penna. R. R. Co. v.

The state was not a mere volunteer in building or maintaining the bridge. If the bridge was a part of the public road when the land was condemned, it was the duty of the state to preserve the integrity of the highway and not to destroy it; and if it bisected the roadway, it was its duty to supply, with a bridge or its equivalent, what it has appropriated. The canal is a public highway in the same sense that a railroad is one. “ They cannot therefore for all purposes be considered private property only.
