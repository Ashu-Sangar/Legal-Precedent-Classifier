It also appears that by the law of New York such a contract, though voidable bjr the corporation, was not void, and was not open to collateral attack. Conceding this, the court nevertheless held that the merger of the railroad company with the Olean, Oswayo &amp; Eastern Company in 1896, and the formation of the present New York &amp; Pennsylvania Company, made the latter so far a Pennsylvania corporation as to subject it and its contracts to the regulations and disabilities of Pennsylvania law. After citing the Act of March 24, 1865, P. L. 49, that upon the making and perfecting of the agreement and act of consolidation, etc., “ the several corporations parties thereto shall be deemed and taken to be one corporation .... possessing all the rights, privileges and franchises, and subject to all the restrictions, disabilities and duties of such corporations so consolidated,” the learned judge proceeded, “We think, therefore, the consolidated company assumed all the restrictions and disabilities' imposed upon either of the constituent companies by the laws of the state under which they were organized. The restrictions and disabilities on one of these corporations were, that its directors could not become interested ‘ in any contract for the furnishing of material or supplies ’ to •any railroad or supply company of which they were directors, and that those restrictions, by the 3d section of this act, attached to the consolidated company. The 4th section is still stronger. ‘ All debts, liabilities and duties, of either of said companies shall henceforth attach to said new corporation, and be enforced against it, to the same extent, as if said debts, liabilities and duties, had been incurred or contracted by it.’ But further, it was held in the case of Commonwealth v. Atlantic, etc., Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/53/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="53 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1004744" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0009-01">53 Pa. 9</a>, that upon filing in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth the certificate of consolidation under the .act of March 24,1865, the company thus merged became a legal corporation in Pennsylvania. It seems plain, therefore, that if <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>the New York &amp; Pennsylvania Railroad Company became a legal corporation of the state of Pennsylvania after the merger took place, then all liabilities and duties under the laws of Pennsylvania attached to that corporation, and all acts or contracts illegal as to the constituent corporation, must be illegal as to the consolidated corporation.”</p>
    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[116,692,1184,1285]]]'>In applying this principle, however, the court gave too great a retroactive effect to the merger. It is very doubtful whether even as regards the corporation itself contracts legally made by it could be invalidated by a subsequent act of merger, but however that may be, it is clear that no such effect could be produced upon a private contract between individuals to which the corporation was not a party. Contracts valid by the law of the place and time where they are made and are to be performed are valid everywhere. The agreement of 1895 was between individuals and appears to have been valid in New York where it was made and was to be executed. The railroad company was not party but was the subject of it, and owing to the relation of some of the contracting parties to the railroad, the contract would have been illegal and void if made in this state and in regard to a Pennsylvania corporation. But being a New York contract between individuals and valid there when made, it could not be invalidated by a subsequent act of merger by the corporation whereby the latter became subject to Pennsylvania law. The extent to which the company’s own disabilities would be retroactive may be open to question, but the rights of individuals lawfully contracting were fixed by the contract and could not be destroyed by the subsequent act of a corporation not party to their contract. The principle on which the learned court excluded the agreement of 1895, as a ground of defense, was error.</p>

In our view it becomes a material fact.</p>
