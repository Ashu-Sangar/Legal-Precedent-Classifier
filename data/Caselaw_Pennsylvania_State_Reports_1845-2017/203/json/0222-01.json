Pennsylvania Railroad Company.\nNegligence \u2014 Railroads\u2014Bridge.\nIn an action against a railroad company to recover damages for personal injuries from falling off a toll bridge maintained by the defendant, a nonsuit is properly entered, where the evidence shows that the bridge was properly constructed and in good condition, that there was a guard rail of such a height that a man walking on the bridge would be in no danger of toppling over the rail, that at the time of the occurrence the plaintiff was intoxicated, and that the fair inference from the testimony was that the plaintiff climbed over the rail while drunk and fell into the river.\nArgued April 16, 1902.\nAppeal, No. 64, Jan. T., 1902, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. Luzerne Co., Jan. T., 1894, No. 18, refusing to take off nonsuit in case of Michael Mooney v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Dean, Brown and Mestrezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries. Before Halsey, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on February 24, 1898, between ten and eleven o\u2019clock at nigbt, plaintiff, about forty years of age, fell from a toll bridge, maintained by the defendant, over the Susquehanna river at Nanticoke. Plaintiff claimed that he stumbled over some obstruction and fell through the guard rails down to and on the ice a distance of thirty-six feet below. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence was conflicting and contradictory, and a fair inference to be drawn from it was that he had climbed over the rail while intoxicated and fell onto the ice. The evidence showed that the bridge was properly constructed and in good condition, and that there was a guard rail of such a height that a man walking on the bridge would be in no danger of toppling over the rail.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nJames L. Lenahan, with him Thomas JD. Shea, for appellant.\nJohn MeQ-ahren and Henry W. Palmer, for appellee, were not heard.\nJune 4, 1902:"
