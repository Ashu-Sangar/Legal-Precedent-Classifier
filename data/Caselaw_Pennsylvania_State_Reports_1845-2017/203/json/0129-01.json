    "head_matter": "Keefer, Appellant, v. Modern Woodmen of America.\nInsurance \u2014Life insurance \u2014 Suicide.\nNo recovery can be had upon a policy of life insurance where the insured has killed himself, if the policy contains the following provision: \u201cIf the member holding this certificate shall die within three years after becoming a member of this society as a result of any means or act which, had such means or act been used or done by him while in possession of all his natural faculties unimpaired, would be deemed self-destruction, then this certificate shall be null and void and of no effect.\u201d\nArgued April 28, 1902.\nAppeal, No. 396, Jan. T., 1901, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Cumberland Co., Sept. T., 1900, No. 194, for defendant non obstante veredicto in case of Alice Grace Keefer to use of John Hays v. Modern Woodmen of America.\nBefore MoCcllum C. J., Mitchell, Dean, Fell and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit upon a policy of life insurance on the life of John A. Keefer. Before E. W. Biddle, P. J.\nAt the trial the court directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $3,376, subject to the following questions reserved:\n1. Is the defendant a fraternal beneficiary societj-, or is it an assessment life insurance company?\n2. Does the fact that John A. Keefer, the insured, committed suicide on August 18, 1899, whilst insane, relieve the defendant of liability in the present action ?\nSubsequently the court filed an opinion in which it held that the defendant was an assessment life insurance company in so far as the rights of the plaintiff were concerned. As to the second point reserved the opinion was in part as follows :\nThe parties have filed an agreement cencerning the death of John A. Keefer, as follows: \u201cIt is further stipulated that said John A. Keefer came to his death by his own hands, and not by accident, his death resulting from a gun shot wound; that he was insane when he committed the act which caused his death and that he was impelled thereto as a result of his insanity.\u201d\nIn Pennsylvania no recovery can be had upon a policy of life insurance, where the insured has killed himself whilst insane, if the policy contains a condition that it shall be void in case the person insured shall die of suicide \u201c sane or insane: \u201d Tritschler v. Keystone Mut. Benefit Association, 180 Pa. 205; Sargeant v. National Life Insurance Co., 189 Pa. 341. The benefit certificate before us contains substantially such a provision. The language, \u201cIf the member holding this certificate shall die within three years after becoming a member of this society, as a result of any means or act, which, had such means or act been used or done by him while in possession of all his natural faculties unimpaired, would be deemed self-destruction, then this certificate shall be null and void and of no effect,\u201d clearly includes the death of the insured by self-destruction whether he was sane or insane at the time. Therefore, as was said in Sargeant v. Insurance Co., supra, the crucial question is, \u201c Did he die of his own act ? If he did, that kind of a death was a risk against which the policy did not insure. It was outside of the policy, and hence the policy was inapplicable.\u201d Governed by the established doctrine on this subject, the second reserved question is answered in the affirmative.\nAnd now, December 10, 1901, in conformity with the foregoing opinion, the verdict of the jury is set aside, and it is ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the defendant, non obstante veredicto, upon payment of the jury fee.\nError assigned was in entering judgment for defendants non obstante veredicto.\nJohn Hays, of Hays Hays, with him W. E. Sadler, for appellant.\nJ. W. White, E. B. Wiehersham and Wetzel Hambleton, for appellee.\nMay 19, 1902:"
