If at the trial the defense should go to the merits of the whole claim, the verdict of the jury will settle it, while if it should appear that the real objection is not to the note itself but to the present enforcement of it, the judge acting as a chancellor can control both the judgment and the execution according to the equities shown.\nJudgment affirmed.",
