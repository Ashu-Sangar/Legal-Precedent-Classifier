        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nIn determining whether the rule in Shelley\u2019s case is applicable the test is how the donees in remainder are to take. If as purchasers under the donor then the particular estate is limited by the literal words of the deed and the rule in Shelley\u2019s case has no application. But if the remainder-men are to take as heirs to the donee of the particular estate, then what has been called the superior intent as declared in Shelley\u2019s case operates and the first donee takes a fee, whatever words may be used in describing the estate given to him. \u201c The inheritance in remainder must be given to the heirs of the grantee of the estate for life, as heirs, or the rule has no applicability to the case- .... It is always therefore, a precedent question in any case to which it is supposed the rule is applicable whether the limitation of the remainder is made to the heirs in fee or in tail as such, and in solving this question the rule itself renders no assistance. It is silent until the intention of the grantor is ascertained : \u201d Guthrie\u2019s Appeal, 37 Pa. 9.\nIn construing the deed here we must of course be governed entirely by the'language of the instrument itself. If by it a life estate only passed to appellant with a remainder in fee to his son, the latter cannot be divested in this proceeding by any subsequent declaration of the grantor however formal.\nThe words of the grant are \u201c to Joseph S. Shapley for the term of his natural life, and at his death to his children or heirs.\u201d Prima facie, the word \u201c children \u201d is a word of purchase and not of limitation, and must be so construed unless it is clear that, the grantor used it in the other sense. That it may be so used has been held in many cases which it would be tedious and unprofitable to review here in detail. A number of them are referred to in Yarnall\u2019s Appeal, 70 Pa. 335, 341. The question for us is the sense in which the words were used in this instrument, that is, what was the intent of the grantor in the phrase \u201c children or heirs ? \u201d If he had omitted the word \u201c children \u201d and said \u201cheirs \u201d only, the precise case for the rule would have been presented and the life estate would have been enlarged to a fee, yet the meaning would have been exactly the same and the children would have come in as first in the line of inheritance. If on the other hand he had omitted the word \u201c heirs \u201d and said \u201c children \u201d only, the clear presumption would have been, with nothing to rehut it, of intent to give to them directly as purchasers. But if that was his actual intent, why did he add the words \u201c or heirs \u201d especially in view of the fact that there were no children then in existence but only one child, naturally suggesting the very common form of expression \u201c child or children.\u201d The most evident explanation would seem to be that he had the word \u201c children\u201d in his mind not as descriptio personarum but as representing the next in the line of inheritance, and then the thought occurring to him that there might not be any children he added, \u201c or heirs \u201d to complete the expression of his intent. The illustrative case put by Strong, J., in Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29, 36, seems exactly in point. The testator \u201c has defined the sense in which he had used the words child and children, and shows an intent to express heritable succession. For if in this will, the word issue means child or children instead of those words meaning issue in the sense of heirs of the body, the devise must lapse on the death of any of the daughters without leaving a child though she should leave a grandchild. This was clearly not the testator\u2019s intention.\u201d The phrase in the present case is \u201c children or heirs \u201d and that means heirs of the grantee of the life estate, the word heirs being used as a synonym to enlarge and explain the preceding word which might otherwise fail of its real intendment. The words, therefore, naturally and properly seem to express the intent that the donees in remainder should take not from the donor directly as purchasers, but in succession by inheritance from the grantee of the life estate. The case, therefore, is one for the application of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, and under it the appellant took a fee.\nIt is argued that this construction defeats the plainly expressed intent that the first grantee should take only a life estate. But the rule in Shelley\u2019s case is a rule of law, not of construction and where a case falls within it, it applies inexorably without reference to intent. \u201c It is admitted that the rule subverts a particular intention in perhaps every instance; for as was said in Roe v. Bedford, 4 Maule & Selwyn 363, it is proof against even an express declaration that the heirs shall take as purchasers. But it is an intention which the law cannot indulge consistently with the testator\u2019s general plan, and which is necessarily subordinate to it. It is an intention to create an inalienable estate tail in the first doneq, and to invert the rule of interpretation by making the general intention subservient to the particular one. A donor is no more competent to make tenancy for life a source of inheritable succession, than he is competent to create a perpetuity, or a new canon of descent.\u201d Gibson, G. J., in Hileman v. Bouslaugh, 13 Pa. 344. \u201c The rule in Shelley\u2019s Case is never a means of discovering the intention. It is applicable only after that, has been discovered. It is then an unbending rule of law. ... It is not competent for the testator to prevent this legal consequence by any declaration, no matter how plain, of a contrary intention. . . . No one can create what is in the intendment of the law an estate in fee, and deprive the tenant of those essential rights and privileges which the law annexes to it. He cannot make a new estate unknown to the law: \u201d Sharswood, J., Doebler\u2019s Appeal, 64 Pa. 9, 17.\nJudgment reversed and judgment directed to be entered for the plaintiff according to the stipulation of the case stated.",

J., Mitchell, Dean, Fell and Potter, JJ.\nReversed.\nCase stated to determine the marketable title to real estate. Before E. W. Biddle, P. J.\nFrom the case stated it appeared that Joel Shapley, the plaintiff\u2019s father, wrote on the back of a deed which conveyed to him the real estate in controversy, the following words :\n\u201c For value received, I hereby convey and transfer all my right, title and interest to the property within mentioned, to Joseph S. Shapley for the term of his natural life and at his death to his children or heirs.\u201d\nSubsequently Joel Shapley executed and delivered to Joseph S. Shapley a paper, as follows:\n\u201c Whereas, by certain conveyances dated December 15,1896, .... it was my intention and desire to convey the property therein mentioned to Joseph S. Shapley, his heirs and assigns ; and whereas the words used in said conveyance do not seem to clearly effectuate such intention, therefore, for the purpose of removing all doubt as to the nature of the estate intended to be passed, and for the purpose of carrying such intention into effect, I hereby declare such to have been my intention and desire the same to go on record as such.\u201d\nThe plaintiff contracted to sell the property to the defendants.\nThe defendants objected to plaintiff\u2019s title on the ground that he had a life estate only.
