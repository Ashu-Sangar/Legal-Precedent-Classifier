The Natalie Anthracite Coal Company.\nTax sale \u2014 Purchase by county \u2014 Abandonment of title.\nWhere county commissioners buy lands at a tax sale and subsequently cause the lands to be assessed for county taxes, and thereafter sell the lands for nonpayment of these taxes, the county will be deemed to have abandoned its first title, and the sale will vest a good title in the purchaser.\nArgued April 16, 1902.\nAppeal, No. 98, Jan. T., 1902, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Columbia Co., May T., 1898, No. 106, on verdict for defendant in case of Isaac B. Feltz v. The Natalie Anthracite Coal Company.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Dean, Brown and Mestrezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nEjectment for land in Conyngham township known as the Nathaniel Brown tract. Before Little, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the Nathaniel Brown tract was assessed with county and road taxes for the years 1826 and 1827, and was sold to the county commissioners of Columbia county in June, 1828.\nThese commissioners and their successors in office held this title until 1882, when it was sold at commissioner\u2019s sale to C. G. Murphy, for the sum of $805. Plaintiff claimed through Murphy.\nWhile the county held this title, the county commissioners caused this tract of land to be assessed with the county taxes for 1888, 1839, 1840 and 1841, and to be sold for the nonpayment of these taxes to James Pleasants in 1842. This title became vested in the Natalie Anthracite Coal Company.\nThe court gave binding instructions for defendant on the ground that when the county sold the land in 1842, it abandoned whatever title it had acquired by the sale in 1828.\nVerdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned among others was in directing a verdict for defendant.\nA. Ricketts, with him John Gr. Freeze, for appellant.\nS. P. Wolverton, for appellee.\nMay 26, 1902:"
