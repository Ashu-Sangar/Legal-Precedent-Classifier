B. 812, down through the succeeding English cases to our own time the well defined meaning of the generic term timber, as trees, felled or standing, to be used for building; and review the similar definition given it in the dictionaries and by the courts of different states in this country, as well as by the supreme court of the United States, in United States v. Schuler, 6 McLean, 28; nor need we consider the cases called to our attention in which a broader meaning seems to have been given the word, for, under the findings of the learned court below, fully justified by the evidence, the appellants seemed to have clearly understood the term at the time of the grants to them to be what the appellees contend it is \u2014 trees suitable for lumber purposes.\nThe learned judge to whom the case was referred found that, at the dates of the deeds to the appellants, the minimum sizes for timber upon the lands were as follows : for cherry, ash and oak, eight inches in diameter at the top end of the butt log; for poplar, pine and basswood, birch and cucumber, ten inches in diameter at the top end of the butt log, and for maple, twelve inches in diameter at the top end of the butt log; and there was a finding that the appellants, by their instructions to their jobbers, and in their operations in cutting and removing the timber, recognized that only trees of the sizes named and over were suitable for timber and lumber purposes, and that the trees under the minimum sizes named were not suitable for such purposes. There was a further finding that the timber was cut according to these sizes by the appellants\u2019 jobber, Joseph Haney, in obedience to instructions which they gave him.\nAt the time of the grants to the appellants, there were no. chemical factories in the county, and none were erected until 1894. Prior to that year no chemical wood had been sold or marketed from these lands, and no chemical or pulp wood was cut upon them at any time by the appellants until they had been cut over for timber purposes and the logs removed. In October, 1893, and annually thereafter, after the timber suitable for lumber had been cut and taken from the lands by the appellants for lumber purposes, they, by their jobbers, again went over the lands, cut the remaining trees and wood that were not suitable for lumber into pulp wood and chemical wood, and removed and sold the same. The grantees, having unmistakably indicated by their conduct in exercising their rights under the grants to them what they understood as having passed to them under \u201c all and all manner of timber,\u201d cannot now be heard in support of their contention that another interpretation should be placed upon these words. \u201c When we are asked to say what the parties meant or intended by their contract, it is entirely safe to point to their own construction of it, as evidenced by their course of dealing under it: \u201d People\u2019s Natural Gas Co. v. Braddock Wire Co., 155 Pa. 22; and the intention of the parties at the time a contract is entered into should govern its enforcement: Erwin\u2019s Appeal, 20 W. N. C. 278. The conclusion cannot be avoided that the appellants would not be insisting that trees, which they manifestly did not regard as timber at the time of their purchase, should now be regarded as spch, if in the meantime the wood had not acquired value for purposes for which timber, either in the legal or common acceptation of the term, has never been used. The proper interpretation having been given by the court below to the word \u201c timber,\u201d as used in the deeds to the appellants, the assignments are all overruled, and the judgment against the defendants below, for damages for cutting and removing trees which they had not purchased, is affirmed.",

T., 1902, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Elk Co., April. T., 1901, No. 73, on trial by court without a jury in case of Andrew Kaul et al. v. W. S. Weed & Company.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for the wrongful cutting of trees.\nThe case was tried by Meyer, P. J.\nProm the record it appeared that by deed dated September 23, 1890, S. S. Bullis and wife conveyed to W. S. Weed & Company,\n\u201c All that the undivided one-half part, portion and interest of, in and to all and all manner of timber down and standing, save and except the hemlock timber in and on all and singular those certain pieces, parcels or tracts of land,\u201d etc.\nAnd which deed provided:\n\u201c It being the intention of the .party of the first part to convey to the parties of the second part, their heirs and assigns, all the several kinds of timber herein specified on all of said lands so conveyed, subject nevertheless to the rights of the party of the first part, his heirs and assigns, to enter said lands for the purpose of cutting, peeling, storing and removing therefrom the hemlock bark and timber, and the right to build, maintain, construct and operate all such railroads, wagon roads, structures and appliances as they may deem proper for the removal of the same. And it is expressly understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that the parties of the second part shall so operate and remove the lumber timber sold them in such manner as will in nowise interfere with the removal of said hemlock timber and bark.\u201d\nS. S. Bull\u00eds and wife by deed dated October 23, 1891, conveyed to W. S. Weed & Company the remaining undivided one half of the timber upon said lands in the same language and upon the same terms and conditions as stated in the deed of September 23, 1890.\nThe title to the land subsequently became vested in plaintiffs.\nThe court found further facts to be as follows:\n9. That W. S. Weed & Company, defendants, were wholesale lumbermen engaged in the hardwood lumber business at Bradford, Pennsylvania, and on September 23, 1890, purchased the undivided one-half interest in certain timber upon the lands in controversy and made a contract with S. S. Bull\u00eds, the owner of the other undivided one-half interest therein, and entered upon said lands in pursuance of said deed and contract and commenced operations thereon, by cutting into saw logs timber suitable for lumber, and manufacturing the same into lumber upon their mills or mills of their jobbers and continued to do so until October, 1893, before they cut any chemical wood or pulp wood. That no chemical factories were erected in Elk county until 1894, and that prior to this time no chemical wood had been sold or marketed from these lands. That no chemical wood or pulp wood was cut upon any of the lands at any time until the lands had been cut over for timber purposes and the loga removed. That in October, 1893, and annually thereafter, after the timber suitable for lumber had been cut and taken from said lands for lumber purposes, the defendants by their jobbers, again went over said lands and cut the remaining trees and wood that were not suitable for lumber into pulp wood and chemical wood and removed and sold same. That from the time defendants purchased this timber until 1898, they did not cut any beech trees for lumber purposes and that beech was not considered as timber for lumber purposes or generally used as such in the vicinity of these lands.\n10. That on September 23, 1890, and October 23, 1891, the dates of defendants\u2019 deeds, the minimum sizes for timber upon said lands were as follows: for cherry, ash and oak, eight inches in diameter at the top end of the butt log; for poplar, pine and basswood, birch and cucumber, ten inches in diameter at the top end of the butt log, and for maple twelve inches in diameter at the top end of the butt, log; and that at the dates of said deeds under the prevailing and general custom of the lumbering business in the region of these lands no trees of the kind named, under the sizes above stated were considered or used for timber or lumber purposes, and that defendants by their instructions to their jobbers and in their operations in cutting and removing said timber, recognized that only trees of the sizes named and over, were suitable for timber and lumber purposes. And that the trees under the minimum sizes named were not suitable for such purposes.\n11. That there were trees and wood upon these lands on September 23,1890, the date of the defendants\u2019 purchase of the undivided one half of the timber, and also on October 23,1891, the date of their purchase of the remaining undivided one half of the timber, that were too small in size or too inferior in .quality and shape and not suitable for lumber or timber. That S. S. Bullis, the owner of the lands and the undivided one half of the timber from September 23, 1890, to October 23, 1891, did not sell or intend to sell, nor did W. S. Weed & Company, defendants, purchase or intend to purchase or acquire title to such trees or wood by said deeds of September 23, 1890, and October 23,1891. That under the acts and declarations of the parties, and the surrounding circumstances, the parties to said deeds- intended that only such timber as was suitable for lumber should be sold and conveyed by said deeds.\n12. That defendant cut and removed chemical wood from said lands amounting to 38,184.30 cords, sold stumpage for wood amounting to 6,016.835 cords and 54,171 cords of toothpick wood.\n13. That the market value of chemical wood and pulp wood in 1895, on the stump was twenty-five cents per cord and in the years 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899 and 1900, the average price -was forty-five cents per cord, and that the market value of toothpick wood on the stump was one dollar per cord.\n14. We find as a fact from the deeds of September 23, 1890, and October 22, 1892, and the parol evidence admitted as explanatory thereof, that the word \u201ctimber\u201d in said deeds did not include any timber except what could be manufactured into lumber, and that chemical wood and pulp wood were not within the contemplation or intention of the parties at the time the respective deeds were executed and delivered ; nor was it intended to convey by said deeds any other timber except what might be used for manufacturing into lumber or other articles which could be made or constructed therefrom.\nThe court entered judgment for plaintiffs for $20,967.73. Defendants appealed.\nError assigned among others was in entering judgment for plaintiffs.\nR. B. Stone and John Gr. Johnson, with them Greorge A. Berry and Robert L. Edgett, for appellants.\nTimber includes all sorts of wood from which any useful articles may be made or which may be used to advantage in any class of manufactures or construction: Black\u2019s Dictionary ; Babka v.
