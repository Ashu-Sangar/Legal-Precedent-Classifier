No claim shall arise under this policy unless (1) the party insured has been actually evicted under an adverse title insured against; or (2) there has been a final judgment upon a lien or incumbrance not excepted in the policy; or (3) unless the insured shall have contracted to sell the insured estate or interest and the title has been rejected, because of a defect or incumbrance not excepted in the policy. In this latter ease, the loss or damage, by reason of such defect or incumbrance, shall be payable within thirty days after written notice to the company and proof of loss; unless the company shall demand a valuation of the insured estate or interest, to be made by three arbitrators, or any two of them, one to be chosen by the insured, and one by the company, and the two so chosen selecting an umpire. No right of action shall accrue until thirty days after notice of such valuation shall have been served upon the company, and the insured shall have tendered a conveyance of the insured estate or interest to a purchaser to be named by the company, at such valuation, clear of, or with proper deduction for, all incumbrances other than those hereby insured against; and the company shall have failed, within that time, to find a purchaser for the estate on those terms. ********\n\u201c 10. Whenever the company shall have settled a claim under this policy, they shall be entitled to all the rights and remedies which the insured would have had against any other person or property had the policy not been made. The insured undertakes to transfer to the company such rights, or to permit them to use the name of the insured, for the recovery thereof. If the payments do not cover the loss of the insured, the company shall be interested in such rights with the insured, in the proportion of the amount paid, to the amount of the loss not thereby covered. The insured warrants that such rights of subrogation shall vest in the company unaffected by any act of the insured.\u201d\nOn June 19, 1899, plaintiff wrote defendants a letter alleging that the houses were not completed according to the plans and specifications, and adding: \u201c I am therefore under the necessity of placing the mortgages on the market for public sale and holding your company responsible for any loss by reason of the unfinished condition of the houses.\u201d\nOn July 24, 1899, they again wrote averring certain defects, in the work, adding that the \u201cestimated cost to make the houses ready for occupancy as per plans and specifications is $1,950.\u201d\nOn September 9, 1899, defendants\u2019 counsel answered in detail as to the alleged insufficiency of the work, and averred that it was properly done.\nIn the mean time, between the dates of the last two letters, plaintiffs, without notice to defendants, commenced foreclosure proceedings on their mortgages, recovered judgment thereon, and the sheriff sold the properties thereunder on October 2, 1899. Each property brought $400 at the sale. After the lev. fa., defendants\u2019 attorney was given notice of the fact that the sale would take place. The properties were bought in in the interest of plaintiffs, who did some work upon them, and then conveyed them to the first mortgagee, in December, 1899.\nOn March 2T, 1900, plaintiffs made a claim upon defendants for $600 per house, the difference between the. face of the mortgage and the price realized at the sheriff\u2019s sale.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit, which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nJoseph A.
