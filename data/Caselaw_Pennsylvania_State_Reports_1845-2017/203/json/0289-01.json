    "head_matter": "Commonwealth v. Keystone Laundry Company, Appellant.\nTaxation \u2014 Laundry company \u2014 Manufacturing corporation.\nA corporation chartered for the purpose of \u201c cleansing, bleaching, starching and smoothing textile fabrics by the use o\u00a3 machinery and mechanical appliances, and the application of skilled manual operation,\u201d the principal business of which is \u201cwashing and ironing,\u201d is not a manufacturing corporation, merely because it manufactures soap and dyes for its own use instead of buying them.\nArgued June 3, 1902.\nAppeal, No. 31, May T., 1902, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Dauphin Co., Commonwealth Docket, 1900, No. 173, on appeal from tax settlement in case of Commonwealth v. Keystone Laundry Company.\nBefore Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Bbown, Mestbezat and Potteb, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from tax settlement.\nThe case was tried without a jury under the act of April 22, 1874. Weiss, J., found the facts to be as follows;\n1. The defendant company is a domestic corporation organized \u201c for the purpose of cleansing, bleaching, starching and smoothing textile fabrics by the use of machinery or mechanical\u00bb appliances and the application of skilled manual operation.\u201d\n2, It reported the actual cash value of its capital stock to the auditor general for the year 1899 at $55,000, upon which the accounting officers of the state imposed a tax of five mills equal to $275, from which the defendant appealed, and filed specifications of objections thereto.\n8. The company collects \u201c soiled cotton and woolen goods, household, hotel and restaurant goods and linens of all kinds,\u201d and receives from manufacturers of cotton and woolen goods and fabrics, goods in process of manufacture and preparation for the market.\nThe cotton and linen goods are washed in hot-water and soap until they are clean, then rinsed and washed again in a bleaching solution, then rinsed again, then rewashed in a coloring solution to which is added a scouring solution, which acts as a fixative, then starched by machinery, then thoroughly dried, then dampened and ironed.\nThe process of coloring and bleaching is applied to all the wares except woolen goods.\n4. The material is handled by skilled workmen of whom there are a large number and to whom a large sum of money was paid for wages during the tax year.\n5. Its capital stock is invested exclusively in its plant and business, except the sum of $4,008.74, which is invested in towels, towel racks, soap, etc., which it places in business houses and offices, and launders them from time to time, and upon this part of the capital stock it has paid to the commonwealth $20.43, and appealed from the balance.\nThe exemption from taxation is claimed under the provisions of the Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 355.\nThe court entered judgment for the commonwealth for $275, refusing the exemption claimed.\nError assigned was the judgment of the court.\nJ. L. Ricthey, with him Murphy \u00a7 Hosack, for appellant.\nFrederic W. Fleitz, deputy attorney general, and John P. ElJcin, attorney general, for appellee.\nJune 4, 1902:"
