    "head_matter": "Sunderland\u2019s Estate\n(No. 2).\nWill \u2014 Maintenance of house \u2014 Devise.\nWhere testator devises by his will a house to two children, and directs by a codicil that it \u201c is to be maintained for one year if not sold before as it must be sold as soon as a purchaser can be secured within two years,\u201d the amount necessary for the maintenance of the house for one year must be paid by the executors out of the general estate.\nExecutors and administrators \u2014 Commissions\u2014Mortgage.\nWhere an estate consists of $111,000, composed of a mortgage and a few cash items, and it appears that there are but eleven items of credit, including costs of filing account, commissions and counsel fees, an allowance of three and one half percent commission on principal is proper, and this rate should be allowed on the mortgage, although the mortgage has not as yet been collected.\nDecedent's estates \u2014 Counsel fee.\nWhere all the beneficiaries under a will are represented by counsel, and counsel for one of the parties is employed to secure a construction of the will in favor of his client, he is not entitled to a fee out of the estate merely because he secured a reduction of credits not desired by the other parties.\nWill \u2014 Life estate \u2014 Issue.\nTestator by his will directed as follows: \u201c It is my desire that the mill property be sold before or not later than five years after my decease, and the proceeds with any balance of my estate to be divided into seven parts, one part to each child except M.\u2019s part; should she not have issue her part is to be divided to the other six parts ; should she have issue her part goes to the issue.\u201d Held, that the daughter took a life estate only in one seventh of the residue.\nArgued Jan. 23, 1902.\nAppeal, No. 350, Jan. T., 1901, by Martha S. Walker, from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., April T., 1900, No. 606, sustaining exceptions to adjudication in Estate of John Sunderland, Deceased, et al.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of PENROSE, J., quoted in Sunderland\u2019s Estate (No. 1), ante, p. 155.\nThe exceptions filed by Martha S. Walker were, among others, as follows:\n1. The learned judge erred in allowing the accountants a credit for $1,345.68 for maintaining the testator\u2019s house for the daughters for one year after the testator\u2019s death.\n2. The learned judge erred in allowing the accountants commissions upon the unconverted mortgage.\n5. The learned judge erred in not allowing counsel for Martha Walker a fee out of the estate for services that he had rendered in getting the account properly stated, and other services, that resulted in a benefit to the estate.\n8. The learned judge erred in not awarding one seventh of: said principal to the said Martha S. Walker absolutely.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing the above exceptions.\nJohn Weaver, for appellant.\nRobert J. Wright and James Jay Jordon, for appellee.\nMay 26, 1902:"
