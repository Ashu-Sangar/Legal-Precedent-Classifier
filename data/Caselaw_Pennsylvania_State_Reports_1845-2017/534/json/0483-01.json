        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPAPADAKOS, JUSTICE.\nThis is the appeal of Joseph Thomas Szuchon (Appellant) from the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County denying Appellant\u2019s second counseled petition for collateral relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA) following the imposition of a death sentence.\nOn October 28, 1981, following a jury trial, Appellant was found guilty of murder of the first degree, three counts of kidnapping, two counts of terroristic threats, and two counts of recklessly endangering another person. All charges arose from the slaying of Judy Lynn Snyder and the incidents surrounding her murder on April 14, 1981. In the penalty phase of Appellant\u2019s trial, the same jury imposed a sentence of death.\nFollowing the denial of post-verdict motions on May 3, 1983, Appellant was sentenced to death for the first degree murder, and to consecutive sentences of ten to twenty years imprisonment on the kidnapping convictions, five to ten years of imprisonment on the terroristic threats convictions, and one to two years of imprisonment on the reckless endangerment charges.\nAppellant received an automatic appeal in this court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9711(h)(1) and 722(4), and Pa.R.A.P. 702(b). We affirmed the convictions and upheld the sentence of death at Commonwealth v. Szuchon, 506 Pa. 228, 484 A.2d 1365 (1984), and reargument was denied on January 16, 1985.\nAppellant filed his first petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541 et seq., which was denied on February 27, 1987, without a hearing. Appellant then appealed to the Superior Court which affirmed the denial of PCHA relief on February 29, 1988, Commonwealth v. Szuchon, 377 Pa.Superior Ct. 657, 541 A.2d 1155 (1988) and we denied further review. Commonwealth v. Szuchon, 521 Pa. 620, 557 A.2d 723 (1989).\nAppellant\u2019s current petition under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541 et seq., was also denied without a hearing by the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County on March 6, 1992, and this appeal followed.\nAppellant raises two issues for our review. The first is whether Appellant was entitled to a hearing on his second PCRA petition on his claim that trial counsel was ineffective, during the penalty phase of the trial, for introducing evidence regarding Appellant\u2019s prior robbery conviction.\nAppellant also argues that he was entitled to a hearing on his second PCRA petition because trial counsel was ineffective, again during the penalty phase of the trial, for failing to object to the sufficiency of the evidence admitted to establish the existence of aggravating circumstance seven of the death penalty statute, (i.e., knowingly creating a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the murder victim) 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(7).\nIn order for Appellant to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must first demonstrate that the underlying claim is of arguable merit; that counsel\u2019s action or inaction was not grounded on any reasonable basis designed to effectuate his interest; and that the commission or omission so undermined the trial that the verdict is unreliable. Commonwealth v. Carpenter, 533 Pa. 40, 617 A.2d 1263 (1992); Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987).\nInitially we note that Appellant does not allege facts to demonstrate that the ineffectiveness \u201cso undermined the trial that the verdict is unreliable\u201d and on that basis alone we could affirm the order of the trial court.\nFurthermore, Appellant fails to meet our requirement that the issues now raised are issues which have not been previously litigated. Carpenter, 533 Pa. at 46, 617 A.2d at 1266. Indeed, a review of Appellant\u2019s direct appeal establishes that the underlying issues presented by Appellant have already been decided by this Court and thus cannot be relitigated.\nAppellant\u2019s first issue which regards the introduction of a prior robbery conviction to establish the mitigating circumstance that Appellant had no significant criminal history has been reviewed by this Court. In the opinion of the Court authored by Mr. Justice Larsen, it was noted that \u201cit was placed on the record that appellant entered a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery in 1974. The court, correctly, left it to the jury to determine whether or not this constituted a \u2018significant history of prior criminal convictions.\u2019 \u201d Szuchon, supra. 506 Pa. at 238 n. 4, 484 A.2d at 1370 n. 4.\nThis Court also ruled on Appellant\u2019s second issue which questioned the sufficiency of the evidence to support the aggravating circumstance of a grave threat to another person. Szuchon, supra. 506 Pa. at 259, 484 A.2d at 1381. There we determined that \u201cthe evidence overwhelmingly supports the finding of the aggravating circumstances ( ... knowingly creating a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the murder victim).\u201d Id.\nFinally, our cases require that a second or subsequent petition for post-conviction relief will not be entertained \u201cunless a strong prima facie showing is offered to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred.\u201d Commonwealth v. Lawson, 519 Pa. 504, 549 A.2d 107 (1988).\nThis standard is met if the petitioner can demonstrate either: (a) that the proceedings resulting in his conviction were so unfair that a miscarriage of justice occurred which no civilized society can tolerate, or (b) that he is innocent of the crimes charged. Id.\nOur review of this record leads us to agree with the PCRA court that Appellant has not demonstrated that the proceedings resulting in his conviction were so unfair that a miscarriage of justice occurred. Nor does Appellant allege or demonstrate that he is innocent of the crimes charged.\nSince Appellant has not satisfied the threshold considerations necessary for his claims to be reviewed, the PCRA court correctly denied Appellant\u2019s petition for post conviction relief.\nThe order of the PCRA court is affirmed.\nCAPPY, J., concurs in the result.\n. Post Conviction Relief Act of April 13, 1988, No. 47, \u00a7\u00a7 3-4, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541 et seq.\n. In death penalty cases, the denial of post conviction hearing relief is directly reviewable in this court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9546(d).",
