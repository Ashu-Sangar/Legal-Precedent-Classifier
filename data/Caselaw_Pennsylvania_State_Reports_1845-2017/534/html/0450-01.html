The jury returned a sentence of death based upon its finding that the two aggravating circumstances established by the Commonwealth, that is, the defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(6), and the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense in the commission of the offense, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d), outweighed the mitigating circumstance that the defendant had no convictions since 1971.

The Commonwealth presented the testimony of Amber Cintron, an eyewitness to the events leading to the death of her paramour, James Hayes. While married, Mr. Hayes shared an apartment with Ms. Cintron and her two children. On the evening of March 30, 1984, Mr. Hayes accompanied the three of them to dinner and a musical. They returned to the apartment after 11:30 p.m. in separate vehicles. After walking to the door of the apartment together, the children entered the apartment first, followed by Ms. Cintron and Mr. Hayes. They were startled by a man carrying a gun who followed right behind them. The man was not wearing a mask, and Ms. Cintron recognized him as someone she had known before.</p>

The man fired a shot into his back at close range. Ms. Cintron started screaming and the man aimed his gun at her. She begged him not to shoot her because she had known him since she was a young girl. Unmoved, he shot her twice in the leg area.

Accordingly, the Commonwealth must seek to impeach a defendant’s relation of events by reference only to inconsistencies as they factually exist, not to the purported inconsistency between silence at arrest and testimony at trial. Silence at the time of arrest may become a factual inconsistency in the face of an assertion by the accused while testifying at trial that he related this version to the police at the time of arrest when in fact he remained silent. * * * Absent such an assertion, the reference by the prosecutor to previous silence is impermissible and reversible error.</blockquote>

The defendant was granted a new trial on the grounds that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor’s reference to his post-arrest silence. The prosecutor had asked the defendant whether he had ever thought of telling the police what had happened during a shooting incident. After the defendant had answered the question in the negative, the prosecutor attempted to withdraw the question.</p>
