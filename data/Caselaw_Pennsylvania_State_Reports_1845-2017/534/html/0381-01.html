Appellant BAC, Inc., (BAC) owns a parcel of real estate in Millcreek Township (Township). BAC desires to use the land as a mobile home park.

The procedure we devised grew out of a series of decisions relating back to two constitutional principles. The first is that individuals have the right to enjoy private property. Pa. Const, art. I, § 1. The second is that any governmental exercise of police power to interfere with this right must be reasonable to comply with federal due process requirements. U.S. Const. amends.

The latter principle <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>demands that a zoning ordinance be substantially related to the protection of the public welfare. <em>National Land and Investment Co. v.

A particular use could be totally excluded. Such was the case in <em>Girsh Appeal, </em>where the ordinance made no provision for multiunit apartment buildings. Alternatively, a zoning ordinance could partially exclude a use to such an extent that it engages in “tokenism” or “selective admission.” That was the objection we had in <em>Willistown, </em>where 80 of the township’s 11,589 acres were set aside for apartments.</p>

By concluding that the zoning ordinance does not unconstitutionally exclude mobile homes, the Board implied that BAC failed to carry its burden. No additional evidence was presented subsequent to the Board’s adjudication. Because of this, we are limited to determining whether the Board committed a manifest abuse of discretion or an error of law. <em>Id. </em>at 523, <a href="/citations/?q=215%20A.2d%20597" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="215 A.2d 597">215 A.2d at 607</a>. Operating within this scope of review, we find that the Board acted properly in rejecting BAC’s challenge to the constitutional validity of the Township’s zoning ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[220,1252,1156,477]]]'>In <em>Surrick, </em>we indicated that the critical inquiry into the exclusionary impact of a zoning ordinance must be conducted if it has been determined that the municipality is a logical place for growth and is not already highly developed. The Board did not make a finding with respect to these two threshold inquiries. However, we conclude that even if Mill-creek satisfies these two threshold conditions, the record does not contain sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the zoning ordinance is valid.</p>
    <p id="b468-6" data-blocks='[["BL_468.6",468,[216,1785,1159,582]]]'>Although BAC claims that the zoning ordinance is unconstitutionally excluding mobile homes, it cites no evidence in support thereof. Instead, it points to evidence purporting to establish that the Township has not made adequate allowances for housing for low to moderate income families. The Court of Common Pleas relied on this same evidence as the basis for its decision to reverse the Board’s adjudication. However, this evidence has no value because it addresses whether Millcreek is impermissibly excluding certain classes or groups of people. That question is entirely different from the one BAC raised in its validity challenge.</p>

We stressed that only the former is the proper subject of the analysis we synthesized. This is because it flows from the constitutionally protected right to own and enjoy property. Thus, it grew out of a line of cases striking down zoning schemes for restricting or excluding certain uses of property, not classes of people. <em>Surrick, <a href="/pa/476/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="476 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="1736894" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0182-01">476 </a></em><a href="/pa/476/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="476 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="1736894" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0182-01">Pa. at </a>193 n. 10, <a href="/pa/476/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="476 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="1736894" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0182-01">382 A.2d at </a>110-11 n. 10. Since the focus of BAC’s challenge is that the zoning ordinance does not make reasonable provision for mobile home uses, its reliance on evidence relating to the Township’s alleged failure to accommodate a certain class of people is misplaced. Furthermore, because BAC refers to no additional evidence in support of its claim, we are constrained to hold that it failed to carry its burden to rebut the presumption that the zoning ordinance is valid.</p>
    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[221,1219,1154,532]]]'>The Board said that it rejected BAC’s challenge because it found that the zoning ordinance is not exclusionary.
