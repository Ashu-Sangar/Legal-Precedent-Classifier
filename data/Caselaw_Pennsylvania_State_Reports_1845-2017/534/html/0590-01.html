In those cases, there was no question that an intentional or deliberate violation of an employer rule regarding work related conduct had occurred. In this case, however, whether there was an intentional or deliberate violation of an employer rule regarding work related conduct is at issue. The question is whether evidence of an off-duty arrest alone is sufficient to qualify as a deliberate violation of an employer’s rule, an act of wanton or willful disregard of the employer’s interest, a disregard of the standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of the employee, or negligence indicating an intentional disregard of the employer’s interest or of the employee’s duties and obligations to the employer, <em>i.e., </em>willful misconduct. Thus, where Pennsylvania Power failed to overcome its initial burden of proving that Gibbs’ off-duty conduct constituted willful misconduct under subsection 402(e), proof of the rule’s existence and violation was insufficient to result in ineligibility for benefits in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
