The Commonwealth Court found nothing in the legislation “which states that the local land use regulations are preempted by the project or by the agencies charged with constructing and administering prisons. <em>Ogontz </em>not only prohibits us from automatically conferring preemptive land use powers upon a Commonwealth agency but also rejects attributing preemptive land use powers by inference.” <em>Id. </em>at 26, <a href="/pa-commw/147/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="606 A.2d 1241" data-case-ids="1431641" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/147/0022-01">606 A.2d at 1243</a>.</p>

When PHEAA attempted to acquire and use the Towne House property in violation of the redevelopment plan governing the property, the Commonwealth Court prohibited such use, holding that “Act 130 did not grant PHEAA the power to supersede the local land use regulation” and that “without more, legislation authorizing a state agency project does not inferentially negate the local land use controls.” <em>Olon v.

      <em>Ogontz </em>involved legislation empowering the department of public welfare (DPW) to acquire property for the purpose of relocating 900 patients formerly housed at Pennhurst State School and Hospital, a mental health facility, and the department purchased twelve sites in Philadelphia. When the Commonwealth agency sought to construct a new facility at one of the sites, the city zoning authority denied permission due to the proposed facility’s failure to comply with the local zoning ordinance. This court was presented with the question whether the Mental Health and Retardation Act of 1966, Act of October 20, 1966, Special Sess. No. 3, P.L. 96 <em>as amended, </em>50 P.S. § 4101 <em>et seq., </em>authorizing DPW to plan, supervise, operate, and acquire property for mental health and retardation facilities at various locations throughout the state, or Act 256 of 1970, allocating funds to DPW to develop a regional program to relocate patients from Pennhurst State School and Hospital, created in DPW authority to override local land use and zoning restrictions. We concluded that the general grant of authority to acquire land did not imply a legislative intent that the agency was given preemptive land use powers, and that the agency was subject to the jurisdiction of the zoning board with respect to local use restrictions. We stated, however: “Of course, should the legislature determine that one or more Commonwealth agencies or projects should be empowered to supersede local land use regulations, it need only pass legislation to that effect.” <em>Ogontz, </em><a href="/pa/505/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="505 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1788903" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0614-01">505 Pa. at 628</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="505 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1788903" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0614-01">483 A.2d at 455</a>.
