Appellants present two issues for our review. The first issue is whether the Superior Court erred in concluding that the use of forceps during delivery was not a surgical or operative procedure to which the “informed consent” doctrine applies. The second issue is whether the Superior Court erred in holding that the trial court properly charged the jury as to the “two schools of thought” doctrine. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial.</p>

Towards the end of her pregnancy, Mrs. Sinclair visited Appellee Dr. Block in his office. While there, she signed a consent form which outlined the procedures necessary to treat/diagnose her condition as being “prenatal care, delivery care, postnatal care and/or caesarian section.” Appellants’ Brief Exhibit C. Mrs. Sinclair was not informed, either in writing or verbally, that Appellee might opt to use forceps during delivery of the baby.</p>

She arrived at the hospital where Appellee Dr. Block monitored her progress. After several hours, although Mrs. Sinclair’s cervix reached full dilation, the baby stopped moving through the birth canal, which is referred to by physicians ás an “arrest of descent.” Dr. Block then observed that the baby was turned to the side and was not proceeding through the birth canal in the usual position.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> As a result of the baby’s position and the fact that the baby’s heart rate had slowed, Dr. Block attempted to deliver the baby by using forceps, which would turn the baby to the correct delivery position. The use of forceps to facilitate natural delivery failed. The baby was subsequently delivered by Caesarian section.</p>

It is, of course, true that a woman cannot remain pregnant forever and that the phenomenon of childbirth is not pathological. Nonetheless, childbirth is analogous to injury or illness which also often progress in a natural and predictable fashion. Medical intervention is frequently beneficial in cases of injury or illness just as it is in some cases of childbirth that have become problematic. It is the medical intervention itself that constitutes the procedure that a patient must give informed consent to, however, not the underlying physical condition. On this basis, it is absurd to claim that the use of forceps is part of the natural delivery process. It is not. It is a specific form of drastic medical intervention in the process and informed consent should be required just as it is for a caesarian. Use of forceps is an invasive procedure. It is well known that forceps can cause serious injury to, or serious disfiguration of, the child. A prospective mother could reasonably choose to avoid the use of forceps for the sake of the child’s safety and elect to proceed directly to a caesarian if serious problems develop. She should have the right to choose. Because the majority takes away that right, I vigorously dissent. ^</p>
