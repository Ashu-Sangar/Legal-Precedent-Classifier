In fact, willful violations of the strict guidelines set forth in the Wiretap Act are criminally sanctioned as felonies of the third degree. 18 Pa.C.S. § 5703.</p>

The statutory scheme at issue is quite clear and precise. In subsection (a) of § 5725 it states that any person who discloses information that they have obtained via electronic surveillance shall be liable civilly for <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>damages to the person whose privacy they have invaded by the disclosure. In subsection (b) of § 5725 it clearly states that officers of the Commonwealth will not be protected by the doctrine of sovereign immunity in civil actions brought against them for violations of the provisions of this Act. Finally, in subsection (c) of § 5725, it states that “it is a defense to an action brought pursuant to subsection (a) that the actor acted in good faith reliance on a court order or the provisions of this chapter.”</p>
    <p id="b669-5" data-blocks='[["BL_669.4",669,[180,813,1151,418]]]'>Thus, a good faith defense is only available where the defendant in making the disclosure was relying upon a court order or the specific provisions of the Wiretap Act.

C.S. § 1921(b). Once it was established that the disclosure at issue was not permitted by a court order or the provisions of the Wiretap Act itself, there was no reason to reach beyond the words of the statute in order to interpret the good faith defense. Although the Commonwealth court found that disclosure was not authorized by the Wiretap Act, it went on to find that the appellee’s interpretation of the Wiretap Act was reasonable and they therefore were entitled to the good faith defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> This analysis was improper. As the trial court so <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>aptly noted in rejecting this argument, “to adopt the defense view would be to rewrite the statute to make a good faith defense available to those who ‘reasonably misinterpret the provisions of the chapter.’ ”</p>

The Commonwealth Court inserted the criteria of whether or not this officer’s action was "reasonable,” thus entitling him to the protection of the good faith defense, by relying upon the good faith defense as defined by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Harlow v.

We note that <em>Harlow </em>and <em>Anderson </em>each involved federal civil suits brought against federal officials who were accused of violating the constitutional rights of the respective plaintiffs through the exercise of their discretionary authority. Under the federal common law doctrine of official immunity the defendants were entitled to assert a good faith defense to the civil action. That defense is defined as follows: “government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” <em>Harlow, </em><a href="/us/457/0800-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="457 U.S. 800" data-case-ids="6194865" data-case-paths="/us/457/0800-01">457 U.S. at 818</a>, <a href="/us/457/0800-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="457 U.S. 800" data-case-ids="6194865" data-case-paths="/us/457/0800-01">102 S.Ct. at 2739</a>. "The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.” <em>Anderson, </em><a href="/us/483/0635-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="483 U.S. 635" data-case-ids="28199" data-case-paths="/us/483/0635-01">483 U.S. at 640</a>, <a href="/us/483/0635-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="483 U.S. 635" data-case-ids="28199" data-case-paths="/us/483/0635-01">107 S.Ct. at 3039</a>. It is apparent that the federal common law doctrine enunciated in <em>Harlow </em>and <em>Anderson </em>is not applicable to the good faith defense as explicitly defined within § 5725(c) of the Wiretap Act. As we have stated above, the good faith defense as defined in the Pennsylvania Wiretap Act contains no allowance for the subjective reasonableness of the officer’s action in violating the Act.</p>
