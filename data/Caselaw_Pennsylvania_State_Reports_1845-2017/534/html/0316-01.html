The complaint alleged that the seatbelt she was wearing was defective, causing her to suffer more extensive injuries than she otherwise would have sustained. The action was transferred to Allegheny County, where Billco filed a complaint to join Impex Car Corporation as an additional defendant. The court, acting on preliminary objections, dismissed the complaint against Impex, holding that Impex was not subject to the personal jurisdiction of Pennsylvania courts.</p>

It has no role in the design or manufacture of the component parts it exports or of the final product, nor does it play any part in the selection of which American parts are to be purchased for inclusion in the vehicle. Only by improperly engaging in a kind of unstated “piercing of the corporate veil” could Superior Court conclude that “Impex <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>purposefully established minimum contacts with Pennsylvania as part of the Yugo manufacturing and distribution chain.” Slip Opinion at 11. Even if the actions of Yugo America or Zavodi Crvena Zastava might be considered to be “purposefully directed” toward Pennsylvania, those actions must be considered the “unilateral actions of a third party” which establish no relationship between Impex and Pennsylvania for purposes of jurisdiction.</p>
