The Commonwealth Court holds that because of the “nexus between the activity in which the employees were engaged and the land” this case aligns itself with <em>Sun Ship, </em>where state <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>workers compensation benefits were granted. The Commonwealth Court further suggests that because “Claimant’s work was sufficiently land-based,” his claim falls within the concurrent jurisdiction of both the LHWCA and the PWCA The Commonwealth Court suggests that because Claimant was repairing a barge that was tethered to the land, and because Claimant was required to drive himself and co-workers from their homes in Ohio to the work site in Pennsylvania, Claimant’s work was “sufficiently land-based”. With this analysis, this Court cannot agree, and for the reasons set forth below, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b418-4" data-blocks='[["BL_418.4",418,[260,898,1156,412]]]'>The LHWCA was originally designed to provide protection to maritime workers who were barred from making claims through state workmen’s compensation plans as a result of the United States Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>Southern Pacific Company v.

In 1942, the Court in <em>Davis </em>recognized that many injured workers were uncertain under which compensation program, state or federal LHWCA, they could rightfully claim. This confusion created undue expense and wasted effort, and caused many claimants to allow their limitations periods to pass in one jurisdiction while busily pursuing their claim in the other jurisdiction. <em>Davis </em>remedied this situation by providing what has come to be known as a “twilight zone” for some workers injured in navigable waters. These were workers who could not be strictly defined as either maritime or land-based. <em>Davis </em>itself dealt with a structural steelworker employed by a contributor to the State Workmen’s Compensation Fund on a job dismantling a bridge over a navigable river who was killed when knocked off a barge to which steel was being lowered. Under <em>Davis, </em>a “maritime but local” category was created for workers who were injured in navigable waters but who were performing duties which were not traditionally maritime. Workers who fit into the <em>Davis </em>“twilight zone” would be <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>entitled to a claim under either the LHWCA <em>or </em>the state workmen’s compensation program.</p>
    <p id="b419-4" data-blocks='[["BL_419.4",419,[210,419,1151,526]]]'>In 1972, Congress extended jurisdiction under LHWCA landward to include piers, wharfs and other adjoining areas customarily used by maritime employees. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20903" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="33 U.S.C. § 903">33 U.S.C. § 903</a>(a). In <em>Sun Ship, </em>this landward extension of the LHWCA was interpreted so as to <em>not </em>preempt the state workmen’s compensation laws which had historically applied to land-based injuries. Thus, just as <em>Davis </em>extended state workmen’s compensation programs slightly into navigable waters, so do the 1972 Congressional amendments and <em>Sun Ship </em>extend the federal LHWCA slightly onto land.</p>

      <em>Davis </em>and <em>Sun Ship </em>have defined and narrowed the scope of <em>Jensen. </em>Nonetheless, maritime employees who are performing traditionally maritime functions and are injured over navigable waters, under <em>Jensen, </em>are constitutionally barred from recovering under any state workmen’s compensation law.</p>

The Court relied heavily on its interpretation of the legislative intent behind the specific language of the amendments which are limited to that portion of the LHWCA coverage which extends <em>onto land. </em>The Court found that the 1972 “land-based” amendments were intended to address the “paucity of relief” available to injured maritime workers under the state compensation laws, by providing a more generous federal LHWCA in the cases of <em>land-based </em>injuries to traditionally maritime employees. It was this more generous interpretation of the legislative intent behind the “land-based” amendments which led the <em>Sun Ship </em>Court to hold that the LHWCA and the PWCA share concurrent, and therefore less restrictive jurisdiction. However, the United States Supreme Court’s holding that the PWCA shared concurrent jurisdiction with the LHWCA applied only to that part of the LHWCA which had been extended onto land by the “land-based” amendments. <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>The <em>Jensen </em>doctrine, which protects a uniform maritime law and does not deal with land-based activities, was completely unaffected by the <em>Sun Ship </em>decision.

It is not at all uncommon for ships to be tethered to the land during repairs, and ship repair is clearly a traditional maritime activity. <em>Hughes v.

In addition, we note that the <em>Davis </em>"twilight zone” exception was originally created with the intent to protect claimants who might mistakenly choose the wrong jurisdiction to file their claim, and subsequently lose their claim in the other jurisdiction to the limitations statute. There is no evidence that such was the situation in the instant case. Almost a year after the LHWCA limitations deadline had passed, Claimant filed a claim under the PWCA — his first claim under either the LHWCA or the PWCA. There is no evidence that Claimant was confused as to the appropriate jurisdiction. Claimant simply sat on his rights, and consequently lost his LHWCA claim to the limitations statute. Even if <em>Davis </em>did apply to Claimant, which it does not, this is not the type of claimant the <em>Davis </em>Court intended to protect when they created the "twilight zone” exception to the <em>Jensen </em>doctrine.</p>
