Zitelli (Zitelli) appeals from an order of the Superi- or court vacating a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County which awarded Zitelli $1,226,292.00 from a deferred compensation plan. The issue involved in this appeal is whether the Superior Court erred in vacating the decree and finding that Zitelli was not entitled to any of the monies in a deferred compensation account. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>
    <p id="b445-7" data-blocks='[["BL_445.7",445,[210,1043,1152,370]]]'>Zitelli is a physician and surgeon who specializes in Mohs Surgery.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> He is one of a very limited number of physicians in the United States who specialize in this type of surgery. In 1980, Zitelli accepted a position at the University of Pittsburgh to join a newly formed Department of Dermatology within the University’s School of Medicine and to teach Mohs surgery in the Medical School.</p>

DEAR was incorporated as a non-profit corporation in 1981, and was one of a number of clinical practice plans in existence at the University. Clinical practice plans were developed by the University so that competitive salaries could be paid to University physicians, and so that the University could attract the highest qualified physicians. The practice plans were used as a method to supplement physician member income. Under the practice plans, all of the teaching physicians in a department would form a corporation to treat private patients. The <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>income derived from the private patient practice would then be available both to supplement the overall income of the doctors in that specific practice plan, as well as to provide additional funds for educational and research projects with that Department.</p>

The amount of contributions each year, respectively, were $30,000, $50,000, $80,000 and $650,000. For the years 1986-87, no contributions were made to the account, but, according to Zitelli, a $410,000 payment had been approved.</p>

After his departure, Zitelli filed this action in equity against DEAR and the University seeking to obtain the amounts deposited in the deferred compensation account, the $410,000 which he claimed should have been deposited in the account, and severance pay which he claims was agreed upon by the board of directors of DEAR. DEAR, contrarily, contends that Zitelli is not entitled to any of the deferred compensation contributions because the payments far exceed the University’s guidelines for acceptable salaries. Any payments in excess of the guidelines require University approval, which DEAR claims was not received in the instant case. Additionally, DEAR claims that Zitelli abused his position as a member of DEAR in his attempt to assure himself of the contributions. Finally, DEAR filed a counterclaim seeking to recover damages as a result of Zitelli’s creation of leases for equipment from Zitelli’s children to DEAR, and as a result of Zitelli’s lease of an automobile with DEAR funds.</p>

The Superior Court found that since the idea of a deferred compensation “plan” was never officially approved by DEAR and the University of Pittsburgh, Zitelli was not entitled to any of the money in the plan. The Superior Court found that DEAR and the University approved the first two deferred compensation contributions for Zitelli, but nevertheless found that Zitelli was not entitled to the money because the “deferred compensation plan” itself was never officially approved.

The Superior Court noted that the Chancellor properly determined that the first two contributions of $30,000 and $50,000 were approved by the University and DEAR. Nevertheless, the Superior Court refused to award these contributions to Zitelli because a deferred compensation “plan” was never actually approved by the University or DEAR. Without such “plan” approval, the Superior Court held that the approval of the contributions of $30,000 and $50,000 by the University and DEAR was essentially meaningless. We disagree.</p>

University Guidelines require that any payments in excess of the Guideline amount require University approval. Instantly, the contributions of $30,000 and $50,000 were approved by the Chairman of DEAR, the Dean of the University, the University Chancellor, and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees of the University of Pittsburgh. Regardless of whether or not a deferred compensation “plan” was ever approved, these University officials knowingly approved of the first two deferred compensation contributions. The validity of the $30,000 and $50,000 contributions was not dependent on the existence of a deferred compensation “plan” which had received the imprimatur of university approval, because the contributions themselves had been knowingly approved. Since the first two contributions were approved through appropriate University channels, Zitelli is entitled to them.</p>

As both the Chancellor and the Superior Court held, the remaining contributions to the account were never presented to or approved by the Dean or the Chancellor, or approved by the Compensation Committee. The $80,000 contribution in 1984-85 was ap<a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>proved only by Zitelli himself, as a member of the Board of Directors of DEAR, and Dr. Eaglestein, Chairman of DEAR. The $650,000 contribution in 1985-86 was again approved only by Zitelli and Eaglestein, however, Eaglestein’s approval came after his resignation from DEAR, but was back-dated to appear as though it was given while he was still a member of the DEAR Board. Finally, for the 1986-87 years Zitelli was the only individual to approve of a contribution in the amount of $410,000. The new Chairman of DEAR refused to give his approval, and the contribution was never actually made.</p>

There seems to be no question that the University never had the opportunity to approve these contributions. The parties are in disagreement as to whether DEAR properly approved these contributions. The University claims that since Zitelli was an interested director his approval was meaningless. Zitelli claims, however, that a majority of the directors of DEAR properly approved the contributions. We find, however, that it is immaterial whether or not there was proper DEAR approval. The Guidelines require University approval. The fact that DEAR did or did not approve the contributions is meaningless in light of the fact that there was no University approval. Consequently, even if there was legal DEAR approval, the contributions were required to be approved by the University. This was not done, and, therefore, the contributions were not properly approved.</p>

He based his decision on the basis of equitable estoppel, and found that the University was estopped from denying the validity of the contributions because it was made aware of them through the annual financial statements submitted by DEAR to the Dean of the Medical School. These financial reports indicated that there was a deferred compensation account set up for one of the doctors in DEAR, and indicated the total value of the account. In light of the information obtained in these financial reports and because the University approved the first two <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>contributions, the Chancellor determined that the University waived its own Guidelines by failing to object to the payments when it became aware of them, and thus was estopped from precluding Zitelli from claiming the funds created in the deferred compensation account.</p>

The representation or conduct must of itself have been sufficient to warrant the action of the party claiming the estoppel. If notwithstanding such representation or conduct he was still obliged to inquire for the existence of other facts and to rely on them also to sustain the course of action adopted, he cannot claim that the conduct of the other party was the cause of his action and no estoppel will arise. Where there is no concealment, misrepresentation, or other inequitable conduct by the other party, a party may not properly claim that an estoppel arises in his favor from his own omission or mistake.

The remaining contributions, however, were never presented to or approved by University officials. Zitelli was clearly aware, or certainly should have been aware, that since these contributions exceeded the Guidelines amount, they required University and DEAR approval. Zitelli’s failure to seek such approval was an error of judgment which precludes his claim of estoppel. Furthermore, even Zitelli’s claim that these contributions were approved by the Board of Directors of DEAR is flawed. As the Superior Court found, Zitelli, as an interested Director of DEAR, did not have the authority to vote on his own salary. <em>See </em>15 Pa.C.S. Section 5728 and 18B AmJur2d, Corporations Section 1931. Zitelli’s poor judgment in voting on his own compensation without a sufficient disinterested majority vote to support his position, along with Zitelli’s own omission in failing to present the contributions to <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>University officials for approval, prevent him from relying on the doctrine of equitable estoppel.</p>
    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[242,448,1163,1616]]]'>Zitelli also relies on the submission of the financial reports to support his claim of equitable estoppel. He asserts that the University was made aware of the contributions through these reports, and that their failure to object when they became aware of the contributions acted as an inducement. However, as the Superior Court noted, the financial statement did not identify the name of the doctor for whom the deferred compensation account was created, nor did it indicate the amount of the annual contributions. Only the amount of the first year’s contribution was ascertainable in the financial statement, and this amount was approved by the University. In the remaining statements, since the doctor’s identity was not given and since the annual contributions were not listed, it would have been impossible for the University to determine that any particular years contribution exceeded the Guideline salary. Finally, Zitelli relies on only three financial reports indicating the amount of the deferred compensation account in 1983, 1984 and 1985. The first of these two payments were approved by the University. The third payment was only for $80,000, an' amount which was not readily determinable from the financial report. By the time the University received the financial statement for 1986 when the largest contribution in the amount of $650,000 occurred, the University was already challenging the amount in the deferred compensation account. Thus, we find that the record negates any finding of inducement by the University, especially in light of Zitelli’s questionable conduct in securing the contributions. Accordingly, the Superior Court correctly reversed the Chancellor’s finding that Zitelli was entitled to the $80,000 contribution in 1984-85 and the $650,000 contribution in 1985-86.</p>

Specifically, and in conclusion, we find that the Superior Court erred in finding that Zitelli was not entitled to the deferred compensation contributions made in the years 1982-83 and 1983-84. Accordingly, Zitelli is entitled to the $30,000 and $50,000 contributions and the interest earned therefrom. Zitelli, however, is not entitled to the remaining contributions in the deferred compensation account. We therefore affirm this portion of the Superior Court order and hold that the account, minus the two contributions to which Zitelli is entitled, is hereby dissolved and the funds contained therein are awarded to the use of the Medical School.</p>

At about the time when Zitelli submitted his resignation to DEAR in June of 1987, DEAR and the University put a freeze on the existing deferred compensation account. Zitelli then filed this suit in equity to have the funds distributed to him and to have the freeze on the account removed. Sometime after the freeze had been placed on the account by the University and DEAR, the University and DEAR withdrew $400,000 from the account to be used for their own purposes. This withdrawal was ordered to be returned to Zitelli by the trial court.</p>
