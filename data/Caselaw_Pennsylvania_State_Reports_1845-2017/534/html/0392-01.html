In no event is such research undertaken for wholly disinterested non-commercial motives. That being so, the research exemption is effectively rendered void, an illogicality which our scheme of statutory construction does not permit. Instead, it would seem to me that where, as here, the improvement of the product is an objective, the exemption should apply; while the producer’s self-interest and competitive advantage are clearly implicated, so are the interests of the purchasing public.</p>
