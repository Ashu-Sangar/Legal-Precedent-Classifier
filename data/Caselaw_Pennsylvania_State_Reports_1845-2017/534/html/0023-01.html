After a hearing, the PCRA court, based upon its view that evidence had been improperly admitted at the penalty phase of appellee’s trial, entered an order vacating the sentence of death and remanding for a new sentencing hearing; the order denied all other claims raised by the petition. The Commonwealth appeals from the portion of the order vacating the sentence of death and remanding for a new sentencing hearing.

Although appellee, in his PCRA petition, did not challenge the admission of evidence involving his 1971 conviction, he did assert that <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>evidence of his 1974 New York conviction had been erroneously admitted; the basis of his argument is that the Pennsylvania crime which is most closely related to the New York crime in question is possession of an instrument of crime, 18 Pa.C.S. § 907, a misdemeanor, and that the 1974 New York conviction, therefore, would not have the status of a “felony conviction” in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania legislature, according to appellee, obviously intended “felony convictions” under 42 Pa. C.S. § 9711(d)(9) to mean Pennsylvania felonies. Absent the allegedly improper evidence of his 1974 New York conviction, appellee correctly pointed out that his 1971 New York .felony conviction, standing alone, would be insufficient to constitute a significant history of felony convictions involving the threat or use of violence under § 9711(d)(9). (See <em>Commonwealth v. Goins, </em><a href="/pa/508/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="508 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1793994" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0270-01">508 Pa. 270</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="508 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1793994" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0270-01">495 A.2d 527</a> (1985)). Appellee further contended that his 1974 New York conviction not only lacked the status of a felony conviction in Pennsylvania but that it lacked the element of the threat or use of violence required by § 9711(d)(9). The PCRA court agreed with appellee. The Commonwealth now contends that the PCRA court erred in vacating the sentence of death. We agree.</p>

Had the challenged evidence not been admitted, the fact still remains that the jury found at least one aggravating circumstance (appellee killed his victim while perpetrating the felony of robbery) and no mitigating circumstance. Pennsylvania’s sentencing code mandates that “the verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d) and no mitigating circumstance.” 42 Pa.C.S. .§ 9711(c)(1)(iv); (See also <em>Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, the order of the PCRA court vacating the sentence of death and remanding for a new sentencing hearing is reversed. The sentence of death is reinstated.

In addition to this Court’s review of the issue involving appellee’s 1974 New York conviction, the issue was also reviewed by the trial judge after appellee had submitted the aforementioned pro se letters to this Court in December, 1982 while his direct appeal was pending. This Court's Chief Justice at the time (Chief Justice Roberts) entered an order referring the matter to the trial court for a determination of whether new appellate counsel should be appointed. An evidentiary hearing was conducted by the trial judge on March 3, 1983, during which the issue involving appellee’s 1974 New York conviction was addressed. The trial court, prior to our opinion in appellee’s direct appeal, ruled that new appellate counsel should not be appointed since appellee’s claims (including the claim involving his 1974 New York conviction) were without merit.</p>

Even assuming that appellee’s claim is cognizable for the purpose of this appeal (and we make the assumption only because this is a death penalty case), we have no hesitation in holding that appellee’s conviction in the state of New York in 1974 for criminal possession of a weapon was a felony conviction involving the use or threat of violence to the person under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9). To hold otherwise and accept appellee's argument would require that we interpret the phrase, "felony convictions” under § 9711(d)(9) as including only those felony convictions which have occurred in Pennsylvania or, if they have occurred in another state, have an exact corollary in the Pennsylvania Crimes Code. To adopt such an interpretation would result in this Court, in effect, amending the statute. A felony is a felony no matter where it is committed. Furthermore, appellee’s argument overlooks a material distinction between the New York and Pennsylvania statutes. New York Penal Law § 265.02(4) provides that a person is guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (a felony) if he "possesses any loaded firearm ... [outside of his] home or place of business.” Section 907 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, on the other hand, encompasses weapons which are not loaded. Thus, we have no <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>analogous crime in Pennsylvania. Additionally, it is apparent that appellee’s claim regarding the lack of the threat or use of violence is without merit. The police officer who arrested appellee for the crime which resulted in his 1974 conviction in New York testified that, on the date of the arrest, he had responded to a call of a robbery in progress and had encountered appellee, and an individual later named as the complainant, in the hallway of an apartment building. The police officer testified that appellee was holding a loaded gun.</p>
