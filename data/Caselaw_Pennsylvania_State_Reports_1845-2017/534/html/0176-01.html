Moreover, Superior Court stated the following policy reasons against reviewing pro se briefs where appellant is represented by counsel: that permitting the pro se brief may involve a conflict between lawyer and client, and this conflict could undermine appellant’s chance of success; that counsel is obligated to submit to the appellate court only those issues which he believes to possess merit; that under no other circumstances are counsel and client permitted to present opposing arguments to Superior Court, as may well happen if <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>both are permitted to submit briefs; and finally, that reviewing pro se briefs of counseled appellants would lead to procedural confusion and delay in the appellate process because of the need for the court and the Commonwealth to review and evaluate additional pro se briefs.</p>

If a <em>pro se </em>brief is filed in a counseled appeal, we direct the prothonotary to send the <em>pro se </em>brief on to counsel who is best able to determine in her [sic] professional judgment which of the <em>pro se’s </em>issues should be presented for our review.

To expect such a client to hold his silence on this issue and citation of authority is often unrealistic, even after mutual trust between attorney and client has been established. This kind of client is even more prone to insist on self-expression to the Trial and Appellate Court where counsel is either a public defender or court-appointed, and where mutual trust has not yet developed. Under such circumstances, counsel’s choice is to either file his or her brief for appellant citing preposterous and suspect authority so as to satisfy the client, or counsel may ignore the client’s citations and arguments in the exercise of professional judgment and thereby risk being named as the culpable party in a frivolous post-conviction proceeding. Even the conscientious attorney will be hard pressed to risk a breach with his client over this issue and, under these circumstances, this court will be ultimately faced with a supplemental brief of the <em>Anders </em>variety containing the Louisiana citation.

Appellate review of legitimate issues of justice should not be precluded because the pro se defendant raises an issue that his attorney did not recognize or did not agree with. Many times, defendants are without the resources necessary to secure the legal representation of their choice, leaving them at the mercy of court appointed attorneys. Moreover, the fact that a defendant raises issues in his or her pro se brief, other than those raised by his or her attorney, cannot mean that the issues are not compelling or valid. To make a blanket statement that such issues are not worthy of appellate review denies these pro se defendants any semblance of justice.</p>
    <p id="b266-10" data-blocks='[["BL_266.10",266,[243,1784,1160,317]]]'>Additionally, this Court now allows criminal attorneys to get away with legal malpractice up to and possibly including reckless and wanton disregard of the defendant’s interest. <em>See Bailey et al. v.
