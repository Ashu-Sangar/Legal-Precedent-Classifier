    <p id="b394-9" data-blocks='[["BL_394.9",394,[248,1261,1157,477]]]'>The question presented is whether the Pennsylvania corrupt organizations statute (18 Pa.C.S. § 911 et seq.) can be applied to an individual who committed a series of criminal acts for his own benefit while employed by a legitimate enterprise, where the Commonwealth concedes that there are no identifiable ties between the individual, the enterprise and “organized crime.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> For the reasons that follow we find that the actions of this defendant do not fall within the scope of the corrupt organizations statute.</p>

The defendant took advantage of his position in Thrift Drug to solicit bribes from various contractors over a period of approximately six years. The defendant either solicited direct cash payments from contractors in exchange for awarding them the contract, or utilized various contractors to improve his home at their own expense in exchange for awarding them contracts. Thrift Drug was not involved in the defendant’s scheme. All money and home <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>improvements garnered in this process directly benefited the defendant alone. As a result of this conduct the defendant was charged with five counts of commercial bribery, 18 Pa. C.S. § 4108(a), one count of forgery, 18 Pa.C.S. § 4101(a)(3), one count of tampering with records or identification, 18 Pa.C.S. § 4101(a), and two counts of corrupt organizations, 18 Pa.C.S. § 911(b).</p>
    <p id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[228,731,1152,422]]]'>Prior to trial the defendant filed a motion to quash various counts of the indictment. The trial court granted the motion as to counts six, eight and nine, thus terminating the forgery and corrupt organizations charges. The Commonwealth appealed only the dismissal of the corrupt organizations counts to the Superior Court, where the decision of the trial court was affirmed in a memorandum opinion. This Court granted the Commonwealth’s Petition for Allowance of Appeal.</p>
    <p id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[228,1193,1151,589]]]'>Although the Commonwealth concedes that this defendant has no ties to “organized crime” as that term is defined within the corrupt organizations statute, and that Thrift Drug has no ties to “organized crime,” they argue that the organized, systematic method by which the defendant committed his crimes brings him within the purview of the statute. This proposition ignores the very essence of the corrupt organizations statute as succinctly set forth by the General Assembly. When the General Assembly enacted the corrupt organizations statute it included a lengthy preamble setting forth the purpose and intended scope of the act:</p>

The express intent was to prevent infiltration of legitimate businesses by organized crime. The corrupt organizations statute is a penal statute and must be strictly construed. <em>Commonwealth v. Heinbaugh, </em><a href="/pa/467/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="467 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1717362" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0001-01">467 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="467 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1717362" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0001-01">354 A.2d 244</a> (1976); 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1). Thus, when the Commonwealth argues that “appellee’s conduct is exactly the sort of organized systematic conduct the statute appears to have targeted,” they are utilizing the word organized in a manner not intended by the General Assembly. (Brief for Appellant p. 17.) It was clearly and explicitly the intent of the corrupt organizations statute to ferret out organized crime “as it is commonly understood” and to severely punish those persons who engage in organized crime through <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>a “pattern of racketeering activity.” <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b397-4" data-blocks='[["BL_397.4",397,[215,446,1153,533]]]'>It was not the intent of the General Assembly to use this particular statute to enhance the punishment of an “organized” criminal. A defendant who commits a series of methodical crimes is neither a natural nor an obvious target of the corrupt organizations statute. There are no facts alleged which lift the conduct of this particular white collar criminal out of the ordinary class of white collar criminals and make him appear to be part of the “sophisticated, diversified, and widespread phenomenon” defined in the statute as organized crime. <em>See, </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 911(a)(1).</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.5",397,[216,1009,1152,371]]]'>Given the clear and concise language of the statute and its preamble, the General Assembly cannot have intended such an absurd result.
