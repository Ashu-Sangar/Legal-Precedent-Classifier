Maleski, Insurance Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as Rehabilitator of the Mutual Fire, Marine and Inland Insurance Company (“Rehabilitator”), appeals from the Order of the Commonwealth Court dated September 18, 1991, granting Appellees’, Republic Insurance Company and Republic Insurance Group, petition to compel arbitration; denying the Rehabilitator’s petition for court resolution of this action; dismissing Appellees’ preliminary objections and the Rehabilitator’s complaint; and relinquishing jurisdiction. The Rehabilitator raises three issues for our review. First, whether the Commonwealth Court <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>erred by failing to hold a hearing on the Rehabilitator’s petition for Commonwealth Court resolution of this matter, in lieu of arbitration, as authorized by the Court-approved Plan of Rehabilitation. Second, whether the Commonwealth Court erred by failing to set forth findings of fact supporting its ultimate conclusion. Finally, whether the Commonwealth Court erred by dismissing the Rehabilitator’s complaint and relinquishing jurisdiction rather than staying court action pending arbitration and retaining jurisdiction and supervision over arbitration. Because the Commonwealth Court should have stayed court action pending arbitration, we quash the appeal.</p>
    <p id="b659-4" data-blocks='[["BL_659.4",659,[186,959,1155,576]]]'>The Rehabilitator filed a complaint in the Commonwealth Court alleging that the Mutual Fire, Marine and Inland Insurance Company (“Mutual Fire”) entered into a series of reinsurance agreements with Appellees that Appellees refused to honor. More specifically, the Rehabilitator averred that Appellees breached the reinsurance agreements by refusing to pay due and owing obligations. Appellees filed a preliminary objection to the complaint in the nature of: (a) a demurrer, based on a claimed right to arbitration and (b) a motion to strike, or, in the alternative, for a more specific pleading of ten of the forty-two counts in the complaint.</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.5",659,[186,1560,1150,201]]]'>Subsequently, Appellees filed a petition to stay action and to compel arbitration.
