The employer’s compensation carrier, Pennsylvania Manufacturers’ Association Insurance Company, (hereinafter PMA), Appellee-CrossAppellant, paid Wolfe’s compensation benefits.

The result was an agreement that the case would be settled on the basis of a structured settlement whereby the total value of the settlement would not be paid at settlement, but rather spread out over a number of years. The structure envisioned an initial payment of $110,000.00 to Wolfe, which Wolfe orally agreed to pay Angino as full payment for Angino’s contingent fee, plus monthly payments to Wolfe of $1,250.00 for life. Wolfe was also to receive sizeable lump sum payments every five years for the next twenty-five years.</p>

Eventually the parties agreed to escrow $55,000.00 of the initial settlement amount, pending resolution of the dispute between PMA and Angino. PMA subsequently instituted the instant action seeking to enforce its statutory subrogation lien. The trial court found that PMA’s statutory subrogation interest had priority over Angino’s rights, and awarded the escrowed <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>funds to PMA.

PMA argues that the Superior Court erred in upholding the trial court’s grant of Wolfe’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to Counts II and III of PMA’s complaint and in upholding the trial court’s refusal to award PMA damages from breach of contract or negligence.</p>
    <p id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.5",154,[225,941,1159,423]]]'>In reviewing this first issue, the Superior Court properly noted that this case does not involve a question of entitlement, but rather a question of priority.

Count II of PMA’s Complaint was a contract claim in which PMA alleged that Angino agreed to represent PMA in connection with the Wolfe personal injury suit, but in failing to do so, is liable for damages in the amount of all benefits PMA paid to Wolfe, plus interest. Count III of PMA’s Complaint was a tort claim in which PMA alleged that Angino was negligent in failing to protect PMA’s subrogation interest. The trial court awarded the escrowed funds to PMA, as noted, but granted Angino’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to Counts II and III of the Complaint, refusing to award PMA any damages for breach of contract or negligence by Angino. PMA filed the instant cross-appeal with regard to the Superior Court affirmance of <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>the trial court’s grant of summary judgment as to Counts II and III.</p>

On this logic, it would seem that if an employee enters into a contingent fee agreement and a structured settlement agreement is reached to pay the attorney who creates the fund a 40% fee, the employer’s subrogation lien is subordinate to the contract claims of the attorney. The worker’s compensation carrier is not entitled to any subrogation until the injured employee has the “right” to and receives such compensation.</p>

The reasons for this conclusion are simple ones. The attorney must get <em>first </em>priority because the equitable doctrine of subrogation so dictates and, most significantly, simple principles of fairness instruct us that, <em>but for the attorney’s actions, </em>there would be no fund for <em>either </em>the worker’s compensation carrier or for the client-injured employee.</p>

We clearly required that the attorney’s fees and other proper disbursements be subtracted first from the gross recovery to get the net recovery. What we held there implicitly, we now hold expressly, <em>ie., </em>that the attorney who creates the fund is entitled to be paid first before the worker’s compensation carrier or the employee receives any benefit from a third party settlement. This is regardless of how the attorney’s fee is pro-rated ultimately between the employer and the employee.</p>

It leaves the victim and his attorney in control as to when a case is settled or tried and as to the type of settlement entered into. The carrier benefits from the whole third-party settlement by a combination of initial reimbursement and/or subsequent suspension of payments, until such time as they equal the value of the net settlement. The client is charged a fee on the value of the entire third-party settlement, and the carrier, which takes advantage of the whole fund, must pay a proportionate share for this enlarged — and very valuable— benefit. Both carrier and employee receive something less than full reimbursement because each must pay toward the incurred attorney’s fees and costs which under our system are not recoverable from the third party tortfeasor.</p>

Such a ruling clearly ignores and interferes with a lawful contingent fee agreement, the third party settlement, and equitable subrogation principles.

Under prior Worker’s Compensation statutes, this Court held that the employer's right of subrogation extends only to the <em>net </em>amount of a verdict against a third party wrongdoer after deducting attorney fees and expenses. See, <em>Ellis v. Atlantic Refining Co., </em><a href="/pa/309/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="309 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="1141523" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0287-01">309 Pa. 287</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20A.%20531" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="163 A. 531">163 A. 531</a> (1932).

    <p id="b160-7" data-blocks='[["BL_160.8",160,[246,710,1158,314]]]'>While the majority’s contractual analysis is sound, I think it overlooks the fundamental consideration of the case, which is the fiduciary relationship between attorney Angino and the Pennsylvania Manufacturers’ Association Insurance Company (PMA). Angino totally abandoned his duty to his client PMA, so he should not be permitted to profit from his misfeasance.</p>
    <p id="b160-8" data-blocks='[["BL_160.9",160,[239,1049,1161,859]]]'>After undertaking to represent the Wolfes in a personal injury action against the owner of land on which Mr. Wolfe was injured, Angino agreed to represent PMA, the workers’ compensation carrier of Wolfe’s employer, with regard to PMA’s statutory lien under 77 P.S. § 671, the right to recoup its compensation payments from an injured worker’s judgment against a negligent third party. In so doing, Angino undertook all the duties an attorney owes to his client as set forth in the Rules of Professional Conduct governing the practice of law in Pennsylvania. Such duties include, among others, the need to make full disclosure before representing multiple clients if there might be a conflict of interest between the clients or between the lawyer and one or more clients, Rule 1.7(b), and the prohibition against settling a case involving multiple clients without full disclosure and consultation with all clients, Rule 1.8(g).</p>
    <p id="b160-9" data-blocks='[["BL_160.10",160,[235,1933,1161,423]]]'>At a minimum, attorney Angino neglected to fulfill these obligations to his client PMA. During settlement negotiations with the third-party defendant, Angino never advised PMA that a second option was available which would have provided $135,000 as an initial payment. Further, Angino admitted that he never contacted the third-party insurer to determine whether additional monies could be obtained to cover PMA’s lien. To the contrary, Angino candidly testified:</p>
    <blockquote id="b161-3" data-blocks='[["BL_161.3",161,[252,290,1106,480]]]'>
      <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>In this particular situation, there would have been no reason to have gotten more than our fee up front, because it would have gone to PMA. There is no kidding about the matter. If we had taken in, as an example, up front $150,000, there would have been $40,000 there that potentially PMA would have some call for, so as this case in its factual contents presented itself, once the client decided to go structure rather than deciding to go lump sum, the primary benefits to the client would be for us not to get anything but our fee.</blockquote>
    <p id="b161-4" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[209,809,450,42]]]'>Angino reiterated later:</p>
    <blockquote id="b161-5" data-blocks='[["BL_161.5",161,[249,883,1108,263]]]'>Because that would have been a decision of an attorney and a carrier to say these are the attorneys fees and expenses, and this comes up front, and if any more is gotten it will just go to PMA.... Why would you want to get any more up front because basically you’d just be giving it to PMA[?]</blockquote>
    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.6",161,[206,1183,1150,696]]]'>I think such an.admission is shocking and unethical, coming, as it does, from an attorney who had agreed to represent PMA in regard to its statutory lien. For a 40% fee, Angino was to protect PMA’s statutory lien, but his intent was to avoid a settlement that would provide anything to PMA up front. It was extremely important to Angino that his $110,000 fee be paid entirely up front, but PMA, his client, did not, in his mind, have a similar interest in receiving payment at the time of settlement. It is difficult, to understand how the majority can accept such a standard of representation. I believe PMA, or any client, is entitled to much better protection of its interests. I think, therefore, the trial court was correct in awarding the entire escrow fund to PMA.</p>
    <p id="b161-7" data-blocks='[["BL_161.7",161,[249,1917,1102,41]]]'>Thus I would affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b161-8" data-blocks='[["BL_161.8",161,[248,2002,758,41]]]'>NIX, C.J., joins this dissenting opinion.</p>
