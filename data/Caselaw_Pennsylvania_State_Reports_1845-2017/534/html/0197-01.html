As this Court in <em>Mack Zoning Appeal </em>made clear, frustration of the normal increase of the business coupled with a lack of public detriment is sufficient to constitute an unnecessary hardship.</p>
    <p id="b287-9" data-blocks='[["BL_287.9",287,[211,1865,1152,472]]]'>In the instant matter, the apartment complex was built at a time when the automobile was not a large part of ordinary, daily life. Today, however, automobiles are increasingly necessary. Thus, denying the variance to increase parking would necessarily frustrate the normal increase of the business where the daily need for automobiles has increased. The normal increase of the business, i.e. modernization and expansion, depends on the availability of sufficient parking. R.R. 189a.</p>

      <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>The Board found that the shortage of parking has a major adverse effect on Properties’ facility, which prevents its use or modernization. The Board accepted Properties’ testimony to the effect that additional parking is necessary as part of any modernization and proper operation of these apartments. The Board’s findings were supported by Properties’ testimony that modernized apartments of the type which it proposes in its current plans require the provision of about 1.5 parking spaces per unit. R.R. 140a, 177a. Properties also testified that presently there is a lack of adequate parking to meet today’s standards in the market place. R.R. 45a, 55-6a. Thus, there was substantial evidence supporting the finding that additional parking, which is nonconforming, is necessary to modernize the apartment complex. Properties, therefore, established that refusal of the variance to build additional parking in the R-2 Single Family Residential District would frustrate the normal increase of the business and result in an unnecessary hardship.</p>
    <p id="b288-4" data-blocks='[["BL_288.4",288,[238,1283,1158,533]]]'>Additionally, the Board found that granting the variance would not be injurious to the public interest. The Board stated that the parking will have some impact on Windsor Lane, but the apartments have a long established access to that lane so that the effect of the variance will not be sufficient to warrant a denial under the criteria of the Lower Merion Code. Moreover, the evidence showed that a variance would have the effect of reducing the existing nonconforming use and limiting the overflow parking on Windsor Lane, which both parties agree is desirable. R.R. 42-3a, 156a.</p>
    <p id="b288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_288.5",288,[236,1857,1157,472]]]'>Clearly, the Board did not abuse its discretion where the evidence shows that denying Properties a variance would prevent Properties from taking advantage of the normal increase of the business and would not serve any useful purpose. Moreover, as the Board found and the evidence supports, granting the variance will not cause a detriment to the public. Therefore, since the Board’s findings are supported by substantial evidence, we conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion.</p>

      <em>In re Philadelphia Properties, Inc., </em>No. 2975, slip op. at 6, (Zoning Hearing Board of Lower Merion Township, Feb. 9, 1980). The Board admitted that these findings “do not cover the full range of variance standards,” but justified granting the variance without the finding of all five criteria by relying on the first paragraph of section 912 of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10912, and stating that “the traditional standards apply only ‘where relevant in a given case.’ ”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The Board did make what it thought were relevant findings in this given case, that is: a case where denial of a variance to an apartment complex that is nonconforming as to parking would frustrate the normal increase and modernization of the business. However, in order to make a finding of unnecessary hardship, a consideration of the physical circumstances or conditions must be made. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 10912(1). Therefore, the Board erred when it failed to make a finding with regard to section 912(1), unique physical circumstances or conditions.
