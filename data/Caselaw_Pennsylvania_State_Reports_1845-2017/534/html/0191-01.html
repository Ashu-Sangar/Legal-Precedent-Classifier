    <p id="b275-8" data-blocks='[["BL_275.7",275,[218,761,1152,426]]]'>The Appellant in this case is appealing the denial of his workmen’s compensation benefits. His claim was rejected by a referee who found that his disability was not attributable to an accident he had at work. That decision was affirmed by the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board and by the majority of a divided panel of the Commonwealth Court. However, since the record does not support the referee’s finding, we are constrained to reverse the judgment below.</p>
    <p id="b275-9" data-blocks='[["BL_275.8",275,[220,1222,1150,427]]]'>The Appellant, Abraham Fotta, was employed by the U.S. Steel/USX Corporation at Maple Creek Mine for eight years. On July 23, 1984, while working in the mine as a supply motorman, Fotta slipped from a machine he was riding and fell approximately two feet to the ground. He later filed a claim for benefits under the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In that claim, he alleged that he injured his right ankle and foot.</p>
    <p id="b275-10" data-blocks='[["BL_275.9",275,[219,1683,1150,589]]]'>Fotta’s claim was reviewed twice, and on each occasion he was denied benefits. On the first occasion, the referee dismissed the claim after finding that Fotta’s disability was not due to a work-related injury, but instead to a pre-existing tumor, technically referred to as pigmented villonodular synovitis. The Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (“Board”) affirmed that decision, but permitted Fotta to resubmit his claim so that the referee could consider new material in the form of medical reports from his treating physician, Mark A. Goodman, M.D. Fotta subsequently filed the appropriate petition and was granted a new hearing.</p>

      <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>At the second hearing, Fotta testified and offered two medical reports from Dr. Goodman. Two reports from a second physician, William J. Mitchell, M.D., were also submitted; Fotta offered one, while his employer offered the other. The referee cited this latter report as the basis for her decision to deny benefits.</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[221,649,1157,480]]]'>After this second dismissal, Fotta appealed to the Board, which again affirmed the referee’s decision and noted that the referee’s findings were based upon substantial and competent evidence. On appeal, a divided panel of the Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board’s decision. The majority reasoned that the referee was faced with conflicting medical evidence and committed no error by relying on Dr. Mitchell’s opinion instead of Dr. Goodman’s to conclude that Fotta’s injury was not caused, aggravated or accelerated by the accident at work.</p>
    <p id="b276-5" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[217,1156,1158,369]]]'>The dissenting member of the panel took issue with this view. He concluded that the referee misconstrued the record which, in fact, contained uncontroverted evidence that the accident at work contributed to Fotta’s disability. For that reason the dissenting member would have reversed the Board’s Order. Fotta appealed to this Court, and we granted allocatur. <a href="/citations/?q=527%20Pa.%20637" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="527 Pa. 637">527 Pa. 637</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=592%20A.2d%201304" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="592 A.2d 1304">592 A.2d 1304</a> (1991).</p>

While this report equivocated on whether the pigmented villonodular synovitis itself was aggravated by the fall, it did not discuss, nor did it rule out, other adverse effects that Fotta’s fall might have produced.

In his report dated November 21, 1985, Dr. Goodman attributed Fotta’s problem to a combination of the pigmented villonodular synovitis and the work-related injury: “part of the instability in your ankle is directly related to the trauma sustained in this fall.” Dr. Goodman. reiterated this conclusion in his report dated November 18, 1987: “I think this [gap between the anterior tibia and fibula] accounts for the recurrent instability of his ankle more so than the pigmented villonodular synovitis.”</p>
