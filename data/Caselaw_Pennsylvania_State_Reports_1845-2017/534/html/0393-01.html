The issue presented is whether the non-employee spouse’s share in a deferred distribution of a pension should be based upon the salary which the employee-spouse earned at the date of separation or upon the amount earned at some post-separation retirement date. The trial court determined that the marital share should be based on the employee’s pension to be received at the time the pension plan enters pay status. Superior Court reversed, holding that the amount to be awarded the non-employee spouse should be based on the employee’s salary at the date of separation, but augmented by growth in the pension fund based on factors other than the employer’s or employee’s contributions to the fund after the date of separation. <a href="/pa-super/409/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="409 Pa.

From marriage until husband left the marital home on July 15, 1984, he was a participant in the retirement plan of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, his employer. After separation, husband continued to work for Westinghouse and to participate in the retirement plan. On January 9, 1985, husband filed a complaint in divorce.

In that case, the court determined that the marital share of husband’s pension was calculated by creating a fraction representing the number of years husband was in the pension plan as of the date of marital separation divided by the total number of years in the plan (“the coverture fraction”) <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>, multiplied by the monthly pension to be received by husband at his normal retirement, multiplied by wife’s marital share as awarded at equitable distribution. This is the same method the trial court used in the present case. The trial court in this case expressed the belief that if wife were not paid in dollars calculated at the time of husband’s retirement, her share of the pension accumulated during marriage would be reduced in value by inflation. In the trial court’s words, wife would “be paid in the year 1994 with 1984 dollars even though his salary and thus his pension have been adjusted for inflation.” Common Pleas Slip Op. at 9.</p>

Thus, in valuing the pension benefit, the participant spouse acquires <em>during the marriage, </em>a <em>promise to make deferred compensation </em>for the marriage years based upon a formula that could produce pension benefits higher or <em>lower </em>than the amount that would be arrived at based upon earnings at the date of separation.</p>

The majority implicitly assumes that the post-marital salary increases of the participant spouse result from the participant spouse bringing new energy and skills to the job. However, the typical case in which the court awards a non-participant spouse a share of a defined benefit pension does not involve persons in their twenties or thirties who have been married only for a short time. Rather, experience teaches that, in the typical situation, the time and energy that participant spouse devoted to the job during the marriage and the work skills developed during that period (frequently <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>

In most cases involving the use of a deferred distribution of a deferred pension benefit, the nonparticipant spouse will be the primary homemaker and caretaker of the parties’ children. This spouse will also in most cases be the wife. In accordance with 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(7) (formerly 42 P.S. § 401), the most important thread that consistently runs through the rulings of this Court and the Superior Court involving the Pennsylvania Divorce Code is the full recognition given to homemaking and earetaking.

    <p id="b491-5" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[228,1633,1151,517]]]'>To summarize, the paramount difficulty I have with the majority’s position is understanding how, in a deferred compensation situation, the majority can characterize the participant spouse’s post-separation salary as after-acquired property rather than as an unknown factor that will be used in calculating the value of deferred compensation earned during the marriage. A <em>promise to pay </em>an amount based upon a formula that may be influenced by efforts after separation is “property” acquired at the time of the promise under a normal definition of the term.</p>

In my view, at the time of the parties’ separation, a participant spouse has acquired a <em>promise </em>from the employer to make deferred compensation payments (for the years of the marriage) based upon a formula that can produce <em>higher or lower </em>pension benefits than those calculated based upon the employee’s earnings at the date of separation. Thus, the marital property acquired during the marriage includes this promise to make future payments for the years worked during the marriage.

Without resorting to expansive description of the Westinghouse pension plan involved in this case, the text of which comprises approximately 107 pages, generally the plan contract provides for the payment of benefits in three portions — Basic, Supplemental, and Executive. (1) Under the <em>Basic Portion, </em>an employee is entitled to benefits calculated under one of two methods, whichever is higher. Under the "career accumulation method” (earn a certain amount of pension each year), if one elects to contribute, he is entitled to a monthly pension benefit equal to <em>hi </em>of 1.3% of total compensation for that year up to $14,700 plus 2.4% of the remaining compensation for that year. If one does not contribute, the monthly career accumulation amount for each year of credited service is set forth in the contract, (e.g. $15 for each year of credited service after 1/1/83). Under the "final average compensation method,” if one elects to contribute, he is entitled to a monthly pension benefit based upon the average pay during the 3 highest paid consecutive years in the 10 years before retirement, which yields a monthly pension benefit for each year of credited service pursuant to a table set forth in the plan. (2) Under the <em>Supplemental Portion, </em>contributions are made based upon the amount of the employee’s salary (by my estimate approximately 1.25% of his base salary). Under this portion an employee accumulates an amount of pension each year, and an employee is entitled to benefits based upon his years of credited service multiplied by his earning class multiplied by $1.05 for years prior to <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>1970, and a dollar value set forth in plan schedules for years after 1969. (e.g. One in earnings class 10 — earning between $975 and $1025 a month would have made a monthly contribution of $12.50 in the years after 1969). (3) Under the <em>Executive Portion, </em>an employee makes no contributions, and he earns a final pension benefit based upon his average total compensation multiplied by his years of service multiplied by 1.47%. "Average total compensation” is comprised of his "average monthly salary” and "average monthly incentives” computed based upon the best 5 months in the last ten years before retirement.</p>

Let us suppose that for each year of employment the pension plan provides that the employer pays 2 percent of the average of the last ten years, as determined by the best last five months of each year.

That spouse works ten more years until age 65 in a declining economy where the economic performance of the company suffers a substantial decline. Let us finally suppose that because of the company’s poor performance and poor financial situation, the salary of the participating spouse on average has fallen to $40,000 at retirement. Assuming 20 years of marriage at the date of separation and 30 years of employment at the date of retirement, the majority herein would assign marital benefits to the non-participating spouse in the amount of <em>h </em>(coverture fraction) of 30 (the years of participation in the pension plan), times $60,000 (the salary at separation), even though the actual deferred pension payment for the participating spouse turns out to be based upon $40,000 (the actual average salary over the last 10 years of employment). Can the majority reasonably conclude that the participating spouse had earned the right to a pension based upon $60,000 for the first 20 years of marriage?

Obviously, the demand for final resolution and valuation is paramount where the trial judge is required to set-off the value of pension benefits as against other marital assets in determining a final order of equitable distribution. However, that is not the case here. Set-off is not an issue in this appeal and the question of how to place an immediate value on future benefits can be left to another day. I, for one, see many approaches, including, but not limited to, valuing at the date of normal expected retirement <em>absent </em>evidence that some other date would be more appropriate. In that situation, I would agree that because the parties are demanding an immediate set off, the compromise of utilizing the final salary as of the date of separation may be the only available alternative. However, no such demand is made in the case <em>sub judice </em>and, therefore, there is no need to resort to a legal fiction in order to resolve the issues. Nor is the issue raised in the companion case of <em>Katzenberger v.

While I acknowledge that Mr. Berrington has undoubtedly continued to make contributions after 1990, further evidence of the limited effect of such contributions on the final value of the pension is provided by the fact that during the period between his commencement of employment in 1955 through the year 1987, Mr. Berrington's contributions amounted to only $25,694.71. As of July 13, 1988, these contributions had only earned interest in the amount of $12,693.14. (R.R. p. 99a).

Furthermore, the wife’s benefits should be based on the husband's salary as utilized by the employer in the final computation under the specific pension plan being used.

This type of pension is commonly funded via the accrued benefits method, or the projected benefits method. <em>Valuation &amp; Distribution, supra, </em>at 45-26—27. If the accrued benefits method is used, the plan develops a set of actuarial assumptions for each employee, and then, based on these assumptions, determines the cost of that employee’s benefit for the year. <em>Id. </em>Under the projected benefits method, cost is not determined on a per employee basis, rather cost is determined on an aggregate basis for all employees. <em>Id. </em>However, no matter which funding method is employed, the plan starts with the conclusion, the amount the participant is entitled to receive at retirement under the terms of the plan, and works backward to the premise, that is, what amount the employer must set aside now to fund the future obligation. Canan, <em>supra, </em>at 134. This should assure that upon retirement, the retiree will receive the promised benefit.</p>

Once the present value of the marital portion of the benefit is determined, the court looks to whether there are sufficient marital assets to allow the employee spouse to retain full enjoyment of the pension, while giving to the non-employee spouse an offsetting portion of the other marital assets. Although immediate offset is preferred because it draws to a close the economic relationship between the parties, there are circumstances that preclude use of this methodology. W.

Rather, the coverture fraction<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> is determined so that the portion of the pension benefit earned during marriage may be calculated. Once the fraction is determined, it is multiplied by the actual benefit available when the pension enters pay status. This simplistic method both attains economic justice, 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 3102(a)(6), and complies with the mandate of the Divorce Code that only marital property is subject to equitable distribution, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 3501 and 3502, because the coverture fraction separates the marital from the non-marital portion of the benefit. Therefore, with the passage of time, “the non-employee spouse will receive a decreasing percentage of an increasing benefit.” <em>Troyan, supra, </em>at 3007.</p>

This freezes the non-employee spouse’s share of the pension benefit at its date-of-separation value. Thus, when the benefit enters pay status, the non-employee spouse will begin to receive a benefit which has decreased in value through the passage of time. The majority attempts to compensate the non-employee spouse for the loss of the time value of money by allowing her to share in “increases in retirement benefits ... which are not attributable to the efforts or contributions of the participant spouse.” (Maj. op. at 403). However, with a defined benefit pension, <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>such increases are nonexistent as the benefit is predefined under the terms of the plan. Thus, the non-employee spouse will not receive an equitable share of the pension benefit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Accordingly, I believe that the majority erred when it departed from the deferred distribution formula advanced by the commentators, <em>See, Valuation and Distribution, supra, </em>at 45-GO, Troyan, <em>supra, </em>at 3006-7, and ordered the deferred distribution of the present value of a defined benefit pension plan.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

The fact remains that this plan is a defined benefit plan. Thus, the method of funding should not affect the manner in which a deferred distribution is accomplished. However, if the instant plan was a defined contribution plan, rather than a defined benefit plan, it would be appropriate to determine the present value of the employee spouse’s contributions to the plan. Once a present value determination is made, which is the balance in the employee spouse’s contribution account as of the date of separation, the marital portion of the account (i.e. the coverture fraction) is calculated, and then equitably distributed between the parties. If distribution of this sum is to be deferred, the plan must place the non-employee spouse’s share of the pension into a separate account where it will remain until the non-employee spouse’s right to the benefit matures. During this period, any interest or dividends earned by the account accrue only to the non-employee spouse’s benefit.</p>

To freeze the salary, and also bar the spouse from sharing in post-separation increases to the benefit, which arise solely from the time value of money, works an injustice to the non-working spouse. Thus, I cannot join the majority’s opinion. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>

The coverture fraction represents the portion of the benefit which was earned during marriage. “The numerator of the fraction is the total period of time the employee spouse was [a] participant in the plan from date of marriage until date of separation, and the denominator is the total period of participation in the plan.” <em>King, </em><a href="/pa-super/332/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="332 Pa.

After ordering the deferred distribution of the present value of a defined benefit plan, the majority then requires that this amount be further reduced by the coverture fraction. Because the coverture fraction was used to calculate the present value of the benefit, it defies logic to use the fraction to further reduce the benefit when it enters pay status.</p>

If the majority truly aspires to do economic justice between the parties under the instant distribution scheme, they could award the non-employee spouse the present value of the benefit plus a reasonable rate of return on this sum from the date of valuation to the date the pension enters pay status.
