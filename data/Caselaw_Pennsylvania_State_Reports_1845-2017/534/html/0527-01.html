Scott then began tying up the victims with adhesive tape under the watchful eye of appellant. After Scott had completed taping Dr. Lopotofsky and while he was taping Ms. Nowakowski, Nicholas Romanchick was shot once in the back.

    <p id="b621-6" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[210,992,1153,855]]]'>The trial court determined that whatever merit there may have been in the position of counsel in seeking removal, there was reason for it to believe that, by waiting until some two weeks before trial to present his <em>pro se </em>motion, appellant was simply trying to insure a delay in trial. Furthermore, the trial court, while mindful of the constitutional rights guaranteed to appellant, observed that counsel had provided skilled and dedicated representation throughout the prior trial and the proceedings leading up to the present trial. It determined that appellant’s contention of ineffective representation by counsel totally lacked substance, and concluded that in view of the fact that present counsel had already tided this case from beginning to end, appellant’s own interest could be best served by continued representation by such counsel in view of their extensive familiarity with all of the various issues presented at trial.</p>

Appellant’s reliance on <em>Nicolella </em>is misplaced as it involved a defendant that had not spoken with counsel since the preliminary hearing. His reliance on <em>Tyler, </em>while more appropriate, does not alter our conclusion, as it involved a defendant forced to trial without representation, and there was no evidence that his request for the appointment of counsel was arbitrarily made or made for <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>the sole purpose of delaying trial.

He alleges further suggestiveness because of the nature of the mug shot and surveillance photograph, and because the police officer asked Mrs. Romanchick to select two photographs, one with glasses and one without. Appellant also challenges Mrs. Romanchick’s ability to observe appellant during the crime as evidenced by her inability to state how many men were in the room, and discrepancies between her description of appellant and his actual appearance.</p>

Under such circumstances, she had an extraordinarily good opportunity to observe appellant. It is not significant that she was unable to remember just how many men there were in the room during the ordeal, or fix appellant’s height or weight with a high degree of specificity. Nor are we persuaded that the methods employed in connection -with the initial photo array were suggestive. No information is offered concerning the photographs of the other men, nor is it alleged that the police officer directed Mrs. Romanchick to select the photographs which she did in fact choose. Even if we were to conclude that the photographic identification was unreasonably suggestive, the other factors present in this case convince us that there was little chance of misidentification of appellant.</p>

The typewritten transcript of the prior statement is to the effect that Romanchick had jumped up and was trying to wrestle Defendant just before he was shot, and we have no explanation whatever as to why the word “rush” was substituted for the word “wrestle” in the typewritten transcript. Even a most cursory examination of the transcript tends strongly to suggest that this revision was made by some person other than the person who had made the original longhand revisions of the preceding portions of the transcript and that it was in all probability made at another point in time. There is nothing to indicate that Scott did anything more than glance at Romanchick in the instant just prior to the shot being fired; and it is therefore apparent that, despite his statement to the FBI Agent that Romanchick was shot “through the front”, it is entirely possible that Romanchick was shot through the back as he was attempting to wrestle with Defendant. It is clear from Scott’s prior statement that he was of the opinion that Romanchick was shot through the front simply “because there wasn’t nobody in back of him”, whereas it is entirely possible that Romanchick was shot in the back while attempting to wrestle with Defendant, even if Defendant was at that time in front of Romanchick. When men wrestle they tend to throw their arms around one another, and such a posture clearly could place one or both of Defendant’s hands behind Romanchick even if Romanchick were facing Defendant at the time.</blockquote>

The defense offered by this Defendant at trial was not that it was Scott rather than he who had fired the fatal shot.

In addition, we simply refuse to accept the validity of the proposition that a man who enters another man’s office or dwelling, armed with a revolver, and with the intent to commit armed robbery, and who then shoots and kills at point blank range a man who attempts to prevent the commission of the robbery, can be heard to seek a reduction of the magnitude of his offense from first degree murder to second or third degree murder or manslaughter on the theory that he lacked a specific intent to kill.

Throughout the trial appellant contended that he was not present at the scene, and it was not Scott alone who placed appellant there while Scott taped those unfortunate enough to be present in the animal hospital on that night. Even if we remanded for the requested hearing and it was determined that counsel were unaware of the contents of the tape, which we believe to be very unlikely based upon the record, appellant simply cannot assert the requisite prejudice therefrom.
