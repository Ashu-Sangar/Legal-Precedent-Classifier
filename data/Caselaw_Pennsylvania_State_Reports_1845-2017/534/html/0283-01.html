While section 1540 does specifically grant the trial court and the District Attorney discretion with regard to the effective date of the suspension, this discretion is limited to the period of time prior to the date of sentencing by the trial court.

Pursuant to Section 1550, review of a mandatory suspension by a trial court is limited to a determination of whether the aggrieved party is actually the person whose operating privilege is subject to suspension, unless it involves the disqualification of a commercial operating privilege. In cases involving commercial licenses, the Legislature has chosen to give the trial court the power to grant a supersedeas of a suspension order upon the showing of a reasonable likelihood of successful prosecution of the appeal. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1550(b)(2).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In all other cases, the Legislature has provided for only a limited supersedeas of the suspension order until final determination by the trial court of whether the suspension has been imposed upon the proper person. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1550(b)(1) and (c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

This claim ignores the distinction between his separate appeals from the criminal penalties and the civil penalties associated with his conviction for DUI, as well as the clear language contained in the Motor Vehicle Code.

We note that as a practical matter the courts of this Commonwealth have applied an expanded scope of review in license suspension cases when presented with the merits of a suspension that is not the result of a conviction, such as in the case of the mandatory suspension for refusal to submit to chemical testing. 42 Pa.C.S. § 1547. See generally <em>Commonwealth v. McFadden, </em><a href="/pa/522/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="522 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1818917" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0100-01">522 Pa. 100</a>, <a href="/pa/522/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="522 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1818917" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0100-01">559 A.2d 924</a> (1989). Our review of the matter <em>sub judice </em>is necessarily limited to supersedeas requests pending appellate review of an underlying <em>conviction. </em>Notwithstanding the obvious similarity of a request for supersedeas of a non-conviction based suspension pending appeal from the trial court, we save for another day the question of whether there exist qualitative differences that would support a conclusion that the trial court possesses authority to issue a supersedeas of a non-conviction based suspension pending appeal.</p>

While Petitioner has couched this argument in constitutional terms, he has not argued that the immediate mandatory suspension of driving privileges upon conviction does not seek to promote any legitimate state interest or public value, or that it is not reasonably related to accomplishing that interest or value. <em>Love v.

Based upon the foregoing analysis and disposition, we find it unnecessary to address Petitioner’s remaining two claims that: An order specifically staying the license suspension is not necessary because such a stay is automatic upon filing of the appeal; and that if such a stay is not automatic, Petitioner is nevertheless entitled to a stay in this instance pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1701 and 1732, because he possesses a likelihood of success on the merits, and there is no irreparable injury, no substantial harm to others and no adverse effect on the public interest if the stay is granted. <em>Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission v. Process Gas Consumers Group, </em><a href="/pa/502/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="502 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1784533" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0545-01">502 Pa. 545</a>, <a href="/pa/502/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="502 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1784533" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0545-01">467 A.2d 805</a> (1983). Aside from the fact that the Legislature has clearly not provided Petitioner with a right to an automatic supersedeas at this stage, and the fact that Petitioner’s argument would not warrant a supersedeas under the principles of <em>Process Gas, </em>our holding that the trial court possesses no authority to grant such relief eliminates the need for further consideration of these two questions.</p>
