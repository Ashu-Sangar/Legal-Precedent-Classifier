As the Opinion in Support of Reversal correctly points out, reasonable efforts must be made by PENNDOT to notify the driver of the action taken in removing his or her licensure. However, while it is admitted that what is reasonable may vary from case to case, the conclusion is drawn that by using first class mail delivery to serve notice, the department failed to act “reasonably” in this instance.</p>
    <p id="b707-4" data-blocks='[["BL_707.4",707,[194,953,1156,1396]]]'>That conclusion by the Opinion in Support of Reversal is extended no further than this case because appellant’s most recent address was available. The operative assumption here is that had certified mail been employed to serve notice, the unclaimed return receipt would have alerted the department, and a search for further information could have been conducted. However, the availability of appellant’s address information was serendipitous, due only to appellant’s arrest, since he himself, in violation of a specific statutory directive, failed to inform the department of his whereabouts. Further, the department violated no precept of ours by using first class mail, since there is no authoritative definition of the requirements for acting reasonably to serve notice of license suspension, “no statute, no regulation and no rule of court which requires it or any other governmental unit to serve its orders by certified mail.” (Opinion in Support of Reversal at 7.) Therefore, even though in this case the lack of return receipt might have made the department aware that the notice was not received so that other action could be taken, the department, unlike appellant, was under no specific obligation to do otherwise than it did. Moreover, the Opinion in Support of Reversal fails to explain how the department was to know beforehand that its efforts would be unreasonable. Nor is it explained whether the same steps taken by the department would have been unreasonable had appellant’s new address been unavailable.</p>

However, no amount of insistence on the importance of a driver’s license, whether its possession is termed a right or a privilege, can cure the inability of any form of notice to reach a suspendee whose whereabouts are unknown. Rights and privileges, however essential, must be given some measure of protection by those who hold them, or they are lost. Fulfillment of a statutory duty to apprise the department of a change of address is not so onerous a protective measure for the right or privilege of driving that it cannot be required, especially of “prudent, law-abiding citizens,” <em>McDonough </em>at 291, <a href="/pa/533/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="533 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="1837431" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0283-01">621 A.2d at 574</a> (Flaherty, J., Opinion in Support of Reversal).</p>

      <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>The facts of the case are as follows: Warenczuk was stopped by a state policeman on May 24, 1990 for driving erratically, whereupon the officer noted a strong odor of alcohol on his person. Because Warenczuk appeared to speak Polish only, the officer took him to the state police barracks without administering field sobriety tests. Although the officer had Warenczuk sign a waiver of Miranda rights form, he noted on the form that Warenczuk “does not understand.” The officer also explained the Implied Consent Law to Warenczuk, but was unable to get him to perform, the breathalyzer test successfully. Thereafter, the officer submitted a report of refusal to submit to the test to the Department of Transportation (DOT).</p>
    <p id="b710-4" data-blocks='[["BL_710.4",710,[253,1025,1157,421]]]'>DOT prepared an “Official Notice” which indicates on its face that the notice was mailed on June 8, 1990 to Warenczuk. This notice stated that Warenczuk’s driving privileges were suspended for one year pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> because of his refusal to take the breath test. Warenczuk claims never to have received this notice as it was mailed to a previous address, and he admits that he did not update his address with DOT as he was statutorily required to do.</p>
    <p id="b710-5" data-blocks='[["BL_710.5",710,[251,1472,1158,311]]]'>On October 8, 1990, the Pocono Township Police stopped Warenczuk in an unrelated matter and confiscated his driver’s license because it had been suspended by DOT. On October 15, 1990, Warenczuk was sentenced on the drunk driving charge to accelerated rehabilitative disposition and a ninety day license suspension.</p>
    <p id="b710-6" data-blocks='[["BL_710.6",710,[250,1808,1158,204]],["BL_711.1",711,[181,321,1151,98]]]'>Also on October 15, 1990, Warenczuk filed an appeal from the June 8, 1990 notice of suspension with the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County. At the January 30, 1991 hearing on his appeal, the court found that Warenczuk did not <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>make a knowing and conscious refusal to take the breath test because of his difficulty with English.</p>
    <p id="b711-4" data-blocks='[["BL_711.4",711,[179,443,1159,753]]]'>The Commonwealth claimed, however, that Warenczuk’s appeal was barred because it was not filed within thirty days of entry of the order of suspension by DOT, citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 5571(b) and 5572.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> The trial court held, however, that there was no evidence of record that the notice was mailed in the usual course of business or received by Warenczuk. The trial court acknowledged that there is no statutory requirement that DOT send its notices by certified mail or by other mail which evidences receipt, but it observed that appellate courts have held that a driver’s license cannot be revoked without procedural due process, citing <em>Brewster v. Department of Transportation, </em>94 Pa.Cmwlth. 277, <a href="/citations/?q=503%20A.2d%20497" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="503 A.2d 497">503 A.2d 497</a> (1986).

    <p id="b711-5" data-blocks='[["BL_711.5",711,[179,1221,1152,368]]]'>DOT appealed to Commonwealth Court, raising two issues. The first was whether the trial court was in error in ruling that the appeal was untimely filed; the second was whether the trial court was in error in concluding that Warenczuk’s failure to submit to the breathalyzer testing was not knowing and conscious. Commonwealth Court held that the appeal was untimely and, therefore, did not address the second issue.</p>

Commonwealth Court concluded that because the appeal was filed on October 15, 1990, which is beyond the thirty day statutory limit from the mailing date, the appeal was untimely filed.</p>
