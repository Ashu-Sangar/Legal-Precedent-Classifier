Finding that the murder was accompanied by two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances, the jury sentenced appellant to death. Post-trial motions were denied, and this court <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>obtained jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h) and Pa.R.A.P.1941.</p>
    <p id="b575-4" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[199,409,1152,643]]]'>The facts of this case, as adduced at trial, are as follows. On the morning of May 20, 1987, appellant and his wife, Donna, engaged in an argument which was overheard by Donna Marshall’s nine year old daughter, Shanisha Dunbar. Shanisha woke her younger sister, Ayesha, and told her to go and see what was happening. Ayesha went to the hallway, and looked in her mother’s bedroom. Inside the bedroom, she saw her mother lying on the floor, tied to the side of the bed with a telephone cord, being choked by appellant. When Ayesha told her sister what was happening, Shanisha ran to the kitchen, and returned to her bedroom with a knife which she placed under her pillow.</p>
    <p id="b575-5" data-blocks='[["BL_575.5",575,[198,1080,1150,477]]]'>Appellant, seeing what Shanisha had done, went after her, put her in the bedroom with her mother, and shut the door. Ayesha then heard what she described as heads banging on the floor, and someone spitting up. Shortly thereafter, appellant emerged from the bedroom, and closed the door behind him. Ayesha saw him wash blood from his hands. He then gathered Ayesha and her two other siblings and left the apartment, telling the children that their mother was sick, and that Shanisha was helping her.</p>
    <p id="b575-6" data-blocks='[["BL_575.6",575,[194,1585,1153,477]]]'>Ayesha testified that, as appellant was driving the children to another location, he stopped the car at least two times to stick a needle in his arm. Appellant drove the children to the home of a woman friend, Lyla Jenkins. He left the children with Ms. Jenkins between 10:00 and 12:00 in the morning, telling her he would be back for them shortly. Appellant did not return until the next morning. The children stayed with Ms. Jenkins until Friday, May 22, when they were picked up by members of Donna Marshall’s family.</p>
    <p id="b575-7" data-blocks='[["BL_575.7",575,[194,2090,1150,261]],["BL_576.1",576,[253,285,1156,589]]]'>After dropping the children off with Ms. Jenkins, appellant met Scotty Brecher. Mr. Brecher and another friend were injecting cocaine inside of Mr. Brecher’s van. Appellant told Mr. Brecher that he had killed his wife and stepdaughter. He explained that he was trying to get some money from his <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>wife’s purse while she was sleeping that morning, but that she woke up and caught him. The couple then got into an argument and appellant told Mr. Brecher that he beat her to death. He further elaborated that because his stepdaughter, Shanisha, had seen the incident, he had killed her to “shut her the f— up.” He stated that he had used a hammer to commit the murders, and that he sanitized it after he was finished. According to Mr. Brecher, appellant was emotionless when he recited the gruesome details of the murders. Because of this lack of emotion, Mr. Brecher did not believe that appellant was telling the truth.</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[251,900,1156,417]]]'>Later that evening, around midnight, appellant and Mr. Brecher, after injecting some more cocaine, went to appellant’s apartment building. Before entering the apartment, appellant asked Mr. Brecher if he was ready for what he was about to see. Appellant then opened the bedroom door and Mr. Brecher saw the bodies of Donna Marshall and her daughter, Shanisha. Appellant stepped over the bodies to remove a television set which he later traded for cocaine.</p>
    <p id="b576-6" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[250,1352,1157,316]]]'>The next morning, appellant and Mr. Brecher sold Donna Marshall’s car so that they could purchase more cocaine. Finally, on Friday morning, appellant decided that he should flee the city. Mr. Brecher withdrew money from his bank account and gave it to appellant to aid him in his flight. Thereafter, appellant headed for South Carolina.</p>
    <p id="b576-7" data-blocks='[["BL_576.6",576,[247,1693,1159,372]]]'>On the same morning, police found the bodies of Donna Marshall and her daughter, Shanisha. An autopsy determined that Donna Marshall had been strangled, and that Shanisha died of a fractured skull, brain hemorrhage, cerebral swelling, and a laceration of her heart. Shanisha also had incurred multiple injuries of the neck, and a puncture wound of her right cheek.</p>

At his jury trial in October of 1989, appellant conceded that he had killed both his wife and stepdaughter, but con<a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>tended that, because of his drugged condition at the time of the murders, he had not intended to do so. Appellant did not present any evidence in support of this contention, but instead relied on the testimony of the Commonwealth’s witnesses to establish his drugged condition. Finding that there was no evidence to support his claim that he was actually in a drugged state at the time of the murders, the trial court refused to instruct the jury on voluntary intoxication. After three days of testimony, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of two counts of first degree murder, and thereafter sentenced appellant to death.</p>

During <em>voir dire </em>a potential juror (later selected to sit on the jury) stated that, two and one half years prior to trial, his daughter’s fiance and his 18 month old granddaughter were the victims of a robbery. The fiance was shot and killed, but the infant was unharmed. The juror did not actually witness the crime, but saw the victims at the hospital following the incident. Appellant argues that the <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>failure of his trial counsel to challenge or strike this juror deprived him of effective assistance of counsel.</p>

Mr. Brecher hesitantly stated that appellant might have told him that he was high at the time of the murders. This possible self-serving statement by appellant to Mr. <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>Brecher certainly does not support the conclusion that he was “overwhelmed or overpowered” to such an extent as to be incapable of forming the specific intent to murder. Additionally, other evidence showed that appellant was thinking and acting coherently during the entire incident, i.e., he realized that Shanisha had witnessed his killing her mother and thus killed her to keep her quiet, he washed his hands after the murders, he gathered his remaining children to take them to a baby-sitter and he drove an automobile to Lyla Jenkin’s house where he left the children. Accordingly, since there was scant evidence to show that appellant was under the influence of drugs when he actually committed the murders and no evidence to show that he was overpowered or overwhelmed by drugs at the time of the murders, there was no basis for an intoxication defense. The trial court, therefore, correctly refused to instruct the jury on that basis. <em>See Commonwealth v. Tilley, <a href="/pa/528/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="528 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1829784" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0125-01">528 </a></em><a href="/pa/528/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="528 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1829784" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0125-01">Pa. 125</a>, <a href="/pa/528/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="528 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1829784" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0125-01">595 A.2d 575</a> (1991) (defendant was not entitled to an intoxication defense even though the evidence indicated that he had consumed alcohol and that one of his friends stated that he appeared drunk, because the evidence was not sufficient to show that he was so “overwhelmed or overpowered” to be incapable of forming the specific intent to murder.)</p>

Appellant also argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to this instruction. As he recognizes, it is well established that an intent to kill may be inferred from proof that the actor used a deadly weapon upon a vital portion of the body of another. <em>Commonwealth v. Duffey, </em><a href="/pa/519/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="519 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1813557" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0348-01">519 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="519 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1813557" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0348-01">548 A.2d 1178</a> (1988). Appellant argues, however, that the instruction permitted an inference of an intent to kill where the inference did not logically flow from the given facts, i.e., the use of hands on a woman’s throat, and the use of a hammer on a child. The law holds that, in the absence of direct or concrete evidence of a <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>specific intent to kill, where deadly force is knowingly applied by a defendant to his victim, the intent to kill may be as evident as if the defendant had verbally announced his intent. <em>Commonwealth v. Meredith, </em><a href="/pa/490/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="490 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="1763814" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0303-01">490 Pa. 303</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="490 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="1763814" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0303-01">416 A.2d 481</a> (1980). Thus if the jury concluded that deadly force was knowingly applied to a vital part of the body, the jury could infer that the defendant intended to cause the death that resulted from his actions. We cannot agree with appellant that the use of his hands around the throat of his wife, and the use of a hammer on the body of his young stepdaughter could not constitute the use of deadly force on a vital portion of another’s body. Contrary to appellant’s argument, the court’s instruction did not improperly dilute the Commonwealth’s burden of proof. The trial court merely tailored the standard intent to kill instructions to the facts of this case. The judge instructed the jury that they could draw the inference if the facts supported it, but that they were not required to do so. We find no error with this instruction and, thus, find that trial counsel cannot be ineffective for failing to object to the instruction.</p>

Shortly after the prosecutor completed his opening, the court officer asked the court to take a five minute break. The jurors were excused from the courtroom, and a discussion was held in the judge’s chambers. At this time, the judge told the attorneys that the reason a break was called was because “Juror Number 2 had indicated that she was raped by her father some time ago.

He stated <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>that “I didn’t come out of there with the feeling that there was any alternative with respect to that one juror. I mean this is something that never happened to me”. We find that counsel’s answers demonstrate that he did not have a reasonable basis to effectuate appellant’s interests. At the very least, counsel should have sought to requestion the juror to find out what, if anything, had happened to her.</p>
    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[266,731,1157,478]]]'>That brings us to the third requirement of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Once appellant has shown that counsel was ineffective, he must demonstrate how the ineffectiveness prejudiced him. <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a> (1987). A showing of ineffectiveness alone is not enough. Rather we require that along with proving that counsel was ineffective, appellant must also demonstrate that counsel’s conduct had an adverse effect on the outcome of the proceedings. <em><a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">Id.</a> </em>This, we find, appellant has failed to prove.</p>

However, appellant did not present any evidence regarding what had actually happened to Juror # 2 or regarding what Juror # 2 actually said had happened to her. The only evidence regarding what had happened to this juror is the statement by the trial judge relaying what he was told by the court officer. We do not know if the juror told the court officer directly that she was raped by her father, or if the court officer overheard the juror talking to another juror. Nor, obviously, do we know the precise nature of what was said. There is nothing in the record as it stands to demonstrate prejudice. All we have is a hearsay statement by the court indicating what the court officer told him about another hearsay statement allegedly made by Juror # 2. The record only contains the court’s third-hand summary of the court officer’s second-hand account of the juror’s remarks. There is no way for us to determine if the court officer correctly heard what the juror had said, and thus we cannot even be sure if Juror # 2 was actually ever the victim of incest in her past. If she was the victim of incest, we <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>do not know why she failed to disclose the information, and whether she felt that her thought process was affected by her memories. Appellant’s counsel never produced the juror to testify regarding her experience or her ability to render an impartial verdict, nor was the court officer ever called to explain what he had been told or had overheard the juror say. Appellant has simply failed to support his claim. Without any evidence to show what the juror actually said and to who, and without any evidence to show that the juror was actually the victim of a crime, we find that appellant has failed to prove that counsel’s conduct had an adverse impact on his trial or to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by counsel’s inaction. Appellant has the burden of proving that he was prejudiced and we find that, without any facts to support his claim, he has failed to meet his burden. Thus appellant is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>
    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[196,1167,1152,795]]]'>Appellant’s seventh argument is that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to both the prosecutor’s cross examination of appellant, and the prosecutor’s closing argument during the penalty phase of the trial. During direct examination, appellant testified that 1) he had been in the military and had received a general and honorable discharge therefrom; 2) that he was sorry for his actions which he stated were a product of his drug addiction; 3) that he had a memory loss of the entire incident up until the point where he left for South Carolina; 4) that he someday hoped to see his remaining children; and 5) that he had developed a personal relationship with God since the murders. In response to these statements, the prosecutor, on cross examination, asked several questions which appellant now asserts his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to. We disagree.</p>
    <p id="b589-6" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[196,1996,1152,366]],["BL_590.1",590,[233,291,1164,1386]]]'>During its cross examination of appellant, the Commonwealth asked about his discharge from the military. The prosecutor brought out the fact that he had in fact received a general discharge because he was “unsuitable for service”. The prosecutor then asked appellant if he had spent most of his time in the military in trouble. The prosecutor also asked appellant about his alleged memory loss regarding the mur<a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>ders. He asked about specific facts and circumstances regarding the murders, and asked exactly when his memory loss began. The prosecutor then asked if Marshall knew how his remaining children felt about him, and if he knew they could not sleep at night because they were afraid he would come in and kill them. Finally, the prosecutor questioned appellant regarding his new founded relationship with God, and asked him if he was a “spiritual guy”. We find that all of this questioning was proper response to the facts brought out on direct examination. Furthermore, the questioning was directly related to the mitigating circumstances which appellant was attempting to establish. <em>See Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, </em><a href="/pa/521/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="521 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1817450" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0188-01">521 Pa. 188</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="521 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1817450" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0188-01">555 A.2d 846</a>, <em>cert. denied, </em><a href="/us/498/0881-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="498 U.S. 881" data-case-ids="6443882" data-case-paths="/us/498/0881-01">498 U.S. 881</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=111%20S.%20Ct.%20215" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="111 S.

Although the tone of the prosecutor’s cross examination may have been harsh at times, he was merely rebutting the suggestions made by appellant on direct examination that: 1) he was honorably discharged from the military; 2) that he had a complete memory loss of the murders due to drug consumption; 3) that he did not want to die because he wanted to spend time with his remaining children; and 4) that his new relationship with God should be considered a mitigating circumstance. As we find that all of the questioning by the prosecutor was directly related to the mitigating circumstances brought out by appellant on direct examination, trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to object.</p>
