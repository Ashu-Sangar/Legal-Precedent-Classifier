Eddy, appeals from a decision of the Commonwealth Court affirming the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board which, in turn, affirmed a referee’s decision denying benefits to Mr. Eddy on the grounds that his claim was barred by the statute of limitations. For the reasons set forth below, I would reverse. The facts are as follows. Mr. Eddy drove a truck for Appellee, Bell Transit, Inc., for about eight and one-half years until he was laid off on November 27, 1982, when the business was closed. Appellant had pain and discomfort in his neck during that period, and the pain contin<a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>ued thereafter, while he was self-employed driving a truck. He saw a chiropractor on April 29, 1983, and was told that he had a degeneration of the cervical area of the spine which was due to his work as a truck driver for a number of years. Appellant had surgery (a cervical fusion) and on June 16,1983, told his former employer (Appellee) about the condition. According to Appellant, whose testimony was not rebutted, the employer told him that there was no reason to file a workmen’s compensation claim because he had not suffered an accident.</p>
    <p id="b386-4" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[255,851,1160,751]]]'>On May 13, 1985, after Appellant had resumed driving his own truck, a bump on the head re-injured his neck. On April 8, 1986, approximately three years and 5 months after leaving Appellee’s employ, Mr. Eddy filed a compensation petition. A referee found that the employer’s conduct had not tolled the statute of limitations and that the petition was not timely filed. The date of injury, according to the referee, was November 27, 1982, Appellant Eddy’s last day of work with Appellee. Thus the filing on April 8, 1986, was made beyond the three-year limitation period required by Section 315 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 602. The referee rejected the contention that the statute did not begin to run until Appellant was told the nature of his injury and that it was work-related, which was on April 29, 1983.</p>

(As in this case, the last day of aggravation of the condition was the last day of work, and that was deemed to be the date of injury.) The <em>Young </em>court looked at Sections 311 and 315, but declined to read into Section 315 the words “or any other cause” that in Section 311 applied a “discovery” rule to notice regarding any injury. The court opined that the legislature, having amended the statutory language several times, could not be presumed to have intended to make the language identical, since it had left them dissimilar. <em>(Id. </em>at 362-63, <a href="/pa-commw/97/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="97 Pa.

In that hearing loss case, the court held that a claimant had not suffered a specific loss until his physician had told him that he had lost his hearing for all practical intents and purposes and that the injury was job-related. The Commonwealth Court concluded that <em>Universal Cyclops </em>only applied to the question of when an injury became an injury, not to the question of when a claimant discovered an existing injury. On this important question, I am more persuaded by the dissent filed in <em>Young, supra.</em>
