The issue before this Court is whether Article I, Section 6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution entitles a party who demands a twelve person jury to a verdict from a jury of twelve persons. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Superior Court Order and hold that Section 6 of Article I of the Pennsylvania Constitution entitles a party who properly demands a twelve person jury to a verdict from a jury of twelve persons.</p>

It is a logical assumption that if twelve jurors had deliberated in this matter, the five-sixths verdict might never have been reached. Moreover, an entirely different verdict may have been arrived at. Obviously, this would depend upon the leadership and persuasive abilities of the one juror who did not participate in the deliberations.

This Court is under a duty to guarantee that the intent of the people of this Commonwealth in adopting the Pennsylvania Constitution is carried forward. We are convinced that, when Pennsylvania adopted its first Constitution in 1776, the framers assumed that a jury meant twelve persons. This Court has repeatedly adopted that view. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Collins, </em><a href="/pa/268/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="144" data-cite="268 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1061619" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0295-01">268 Pa. 295</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.%20738" class="citation" data-index="145" data-cite="110 A. 738">110 A. 738</a> (1920); <em>Smith v.

Therefore, even though Section 6 of Article I of the Pennsylvania Constitution does not explicitly state that a jury is constituted of twelve members, our constitutional history and <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>case law make it apparent that “trial by jury” means a jury of twelve persons.</p>
