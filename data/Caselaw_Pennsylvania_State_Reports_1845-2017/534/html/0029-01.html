France Refractories Company (hereinafter J.H. France) and its now wholly-owned subsidiary, the Van Brunt Company, between 1956 and 1972 manufactured and marketed a product containing asbestos. J.H. France also marketed and continues to market products containing silica, which, like asbestos, is <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>claimed to cause physical injury to those who breathe it. On April 19, 1979, Gladys Temple, administratrix of the estate of Charles Temple, filed suit against J.H. France, claiming that her decedent, Charles Temple, suffered from asbestos-related diseases contracted through exposure to J.H. France’s asbestos-containing products from 1948 through 1978.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b115-4" data-blocks='[["BL_115.4",115,[281,708,1110,1569]]]'>J.H. France was insured during various time periods relevant to this action by the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association, St. Paul, Allstate, U.S. Fire, Wausau, and Rock-wood Insurance Companies. Upon receipt of this suit, J.H. France presented the Temple claim to Allstate, St. Paul and PMA for defense and indemnity, the insurers who had provided coverage between 1967 and 1979. None of these insurers agreed to defend or indemnify, and J.H. France undertook its own defense. In 1981 J.H. France filed this declaratory judgment action for the purpose of determining the insurers’ duty to defend and indemnify against the Temple claim. Subsequent to the filing of this declaratory judgment action, additional asbestos and silica-related lawsuits were filed against J.H. France. Apparently because these actions were for injuries allegedly sustained during a time period which went beyond 1979 (into the 1980’s), additional insurance companies became involved. In 1984, Allstate filed its own declaratory judgment action, naming PMA, St. Paul, U.S. Fire, Wausau and Rockwood Insurance Companies, as well as fourteen individuals who had filed asbestos or silica-related lawsuits after J.H. France filed its original declaratory judgment action.' Still other asbestos or silica-related claims against J.H. France were filed after Allstate’s declaratory judgment actions were consolidated, and the carriers who insured J.H. France during the relevant time periods have taken differing positions with respect to their duty to indemnify and defend. If a defense has been provided, it has been provided subject to reservation of rights.</blockquote>

France for claims based on exposure to its products containing asbestos and silica, and if they were liable, how the liability was to be apportioned among the insurers.

Craig-head, an anatomical and clinical pathologist who is an expert in pneumoconiosis and asbestos-related disease. In summary, he testified that “injury” is a “process which alters structure,” and the term is applicable in reference to a cell, a tissue, an organ, or the entire body. “Disease” means “an injury and a response to that injury.” The presence of asbestos in the lungs stimulates a wide range of reactions, which Dr. Craig-head divides into three responses.</p>
    <p id="b117-8" data-blocks='[["BL_117.8",117,[238,1770,1152,363]]]'>First, characterized as “direct injury,” asbestos fibers in the respiratory tract interact with the membranes of the cells lining the trachea and cause the release of enzymes and superoxides which either damage or kill individual cells. If sufficient cells are damaged, tissue (an accumulation of cells) is damaged or destroyed. This injury occurs within minutes after asbestos fibers enter the cells.</p>
    <p id="b117-9" data-blocks='[["BL_117.9",117,[238,2166,1151,207]],["BL_118.1",118,[214,302,1158,415]]]'>Second, characterized as “indirect injury,” the presence of asbestos fibers stimulates macrophages to accumulate. Macrophages are scavenger cells which attempt to envelope foreign particles. As microphages attempt to ingest the fi<a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>bers, there is a release of enzymes which have a damaging effect on tissue. There is also a chemical reaction which scars the injured tissue. The accumulation of scar tissue in the respiratory system prevents the lung from performing its normal oxygen-carbon dioxide gas exchange. The process of macrophage accumulation, tissue scarring, and functional impairment of the lungs begins to occur within a month of exposure.</p>
    <p id="b118-4" data-blocks='[["BL_118.4",118,[212,742,1155,257]]]'>The third response in the asbestosis process is a change in the form of the cells lining the bronchial tree. The normal lining, designed to move dust particles out of the body, is replaced by cells lacking cilia, resulting in a tendency toward accumulation of asbestos particles.</p>
    <p id="b118-5" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[206,1023,1158,577]]]'>The asbestosis process continues to progress even after exposure to asbestos ceases. Medical authorities differ on the reasons for this fact. Substantial authority regards this as the nature of the asbestosis pathogenesis. Another view theorizes that disease progression may be attributable to the eventual, and inevitable, decrease in the respiratory function involved in aging, and also to other factors such as cigarette smoking or infection. In either view, the injury process continues after exposure and may culminate in “manifestation,” such severe functional impairment that asbestosis is finally diagnosed, and of course, the disease may be fatal.</p>
    <p id="b118-6" data-blocks='[["BL_118.6",118,[199,1624,1160,740]],["BL_119.1",119,[225,308,1148,153]]]'>Based on the foregoing record, the Superior Court held that liability of each insurer was triggered if any one of the three— exposure, progression, or manifestation — occurred during the term of its policy. The court prorated the obligations of all insurers whose policies were in effect throughout the development of the disease, including J.H. France as a self-insurer during periods when it did not purchase liability insurance. Although the Superior Court did not explicate this point, it seems implicit in its reasoning that the obligations to defend would be allocated pro rata in the same way as the obligations to indemnify; presumably J.H. France would bear a proportionate share of defense costs for periods when it did not purchase liability insurance. Finally, the Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s ruling that the insurers were not guilty <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>of bad faith in contesting their duty to defend so that J.H. France was not entitled to attorneys fees in this declaratory judgment action.</p>
    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[224,492,1154,1172]]]'>The first issue is whether the Superior Court was correct in applying the “multiple-trigger” theory of determining liability of the insurers — that is, in deciding that liability results if any one of the following occurred during the time an insurer was on the risk: exposure to asbestos or silica, progression of the pathology, or manifestation of the disease. The Superior Court concluded that the medical evidence of discrete cellular injuries occurring upon exposure to asbestos justifies the conclusion that exposure to asbestos causes immediate “bodily injury” in the terms of the insurance policies, triggering the insurers’ duty to indemnify. With this analysis and conclusion, we agree. In similar fashion, the Superior Court reached the conclusion that the term “bodily injury” also encompasses the progression of the disease throughout and after the period of exposure until, ultimately, the manifestation of recognizable incapacitation constitutes the final “injury,” and that these stages in the pathogenesis of asbestos- and silica-related diseases also trigger the liability of J.H. France’s insurance carriers. We find no error in this analysis and conclusion. The insurance policy language and the evidence of the etiology and pathogenesis of asbestos-related disease compel us to reach this result.</p>
    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[221,1688,1153,687]],["BL_120.1",120,[235,302,1155,430]]]'>The insurance policies obligate the insurers to “pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury ... to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.” Whether the claimants’ diseases are “bodily injury to which this insurance applies” depends on the definition of bodily injury. The policies define bodily injury as “bodily injury, sickness or disease which occurs during the policy period.” The injuries at issue are caused by an “occurrence,” which the policies define as “an accident, <em>including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, </em>which result in bodily injury ... neither expected nor intended” by the insured. The medical evidence in this case unequivocally establishes that <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>injuries occur during the development of asbestosis immediately upon exposure, and that the injuries continue to occur even after exposure ends during the progression of the disease right up until the time that increasing incapacitation results in manifestation as a recognizable disease. If any of these phases of the pathogenesis occurs during the policy period, the insurer is obligated to indemnify J.H. France under the terms of the policy.</p>

The definition suggests that any insurance policy triggered under the “multiple-trigger” concept with respect to any specific claim is potentially liable for the entire amount of any judgment or settlement of that claim. An “occurrence” includes “continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in bodily injury.” The insurers which drafted the definition obviously contemplated the possibility of injury resulting from continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, and specified that the process of exposure was to constitute one occurrence. If prolonged exposure, constituting one occurrence, resulted in injury, and if the injury occurred during <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>the time a given policy was in effect, then the injury is an insurable risk under the terms of that policy. Being defined as one “occurrence,” the entire injury, and all damages resulting therefrom, fall within the indemnification obligation of the insurer. In other words, once the liability of a given insurer is triggered, it is irrelevant that additional exposure or injury occurred at times other than when the insurer was on the risk. The insurer in question must bear potential liability for the entire claim.</p>

Because each insurer is fully liable, and because Keene cannot collect more than it owes in damages, the issue of dividing insurance obligations arises. The only logical resolution of this issue is for Keene to be able to collect from any insurer whose coverage is triggered, the full amount of indemnity that it is due, subject only to the provisions in the policies that govern the allocation of liability when more than one policy covers an injury. That is the only way that Keene can be assured the security that it purchased with each policy. Our holding each insurer fully liable to Keene is also consistent with other courts’ allocation of liability when more than one insurer covers an indivisible loss.</blockquote>
