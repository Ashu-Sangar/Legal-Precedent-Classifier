Dr. Johnson was Bolton’s physician. During discovery in the <em>Bolton </em>trial, SEPTA issued a subpoena for all of Bolton’s medical records maintained by Dr. Johnson. The records submitted pertain to each office visit and indicate no complaint of low back pain during Bolton’s early visits to Johnson and no order for x-rays of the lower back. At trial, Dr. Johnson made reference to handwritten notes which indicate that Bolton complained of lower back pain during office visits in 1979, that he ordered x-rays of the lower back, and that he treated Bolton for lower back pain.

To the contrary, the Official Comment to Section 4902 makes it clear that the General Assembly intended Section 4902(f) to be in accord with existing law. 18 Pa.C.S. <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>§ 4902, Official Comment-1972.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Thus, the adoption of Section 4902(f) did not modify the common law two-witness rule; to the contrary, it codified it. As a result, the Superior Court’s conclusion in <em>Broughton </em>that the two-witness rule under Section 4902(f), means “that a witness may testify as to his direct observation, or he may provide circumstantial evidence; but in either case, he must be corroborated by the testimony of another witness, whose testimony may provide either direct or circumstantial evidence,” <em>Broughton, </em><a href="/pa-super/257/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="257 Pa.

Circumstantial evidence, as distinguished from direct evidence, is “testimony not based on actual personal knowledge or observation of the facts in controversy, but of other facts from which deductions are drawn, showing indirectly the facts sought to be proved.” <em>Id. </em>at 221. Direct evidence is obviously more reliable and probative than circumstantial evidence because direct evidence proves a fact without the necessity for the fact-finder to make additional deductions or inferences or presumptions. Thus, although direct evidence and circumstantial evidence are both factual in nature, they are clearly distinct and for purposes of Section 4902(f), circumstantial evidence is an illegitimate and <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>ill-conceived substitute for the mandatory direct evidence prong of the two-witness rule.</p>

In <em>Field, </em>the defendant instituted a lawsuit against the Redevelopment Authority which he settled five days later on terms not made public. Thereafter, defendant was called as a witness before a grand jury and questioned about whether Citizens Bank, of which he was the chairman of the board of directors and principal shareholder, was offered the position of “lead <em>bank”</em>

As a result of that testimony, defendant was charged with perjuring himself before the grand jury. Following a jury trial in which defendant was found guilty, defendant appealed to the Superior Court alleging that the lower court improperly overruled his demurrers to the Commonwealth’s evidence supporting the charge of perjury.</p>

In the former case, not only is there no <em>direct </em>evidence but more importantly, there is no fact evidence whatsoever. In the latter case, utilizing an expert witness plus corroborating circumstantial evidence, there is again no <em>direct </em>evidence. Moreover, the latter case depends entirely upon circumstantial evidence, evidence which requires the fact-finder to make further deductions, inferences or presumptions in order to lead to a conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the fact in issue has been proved. This is precisely the sort of indirect evidence the two-witness rule was designed to prevent unless properly supplemented with direct evidence.
