The Commission reversed the decision of the Department of Environmental Resources (DER) which removed appellant from his position as a regular sanitarian supervisor. The pertinent facts are as follows: Appellant was employed as a sanitarian supervisor in the DER’s Bureau of Community Environmental Control. By letter dated November 15, 1988, Galant was notified that he was being removed from his position, effective at the close of business on November 16, 1988, for being absent without approved leave on numerous occasions, using Commonwealth telephones for personal calls and selling life insurance during work hours.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Commission found that, based on the evidence presented, although Appellant was not entirely without fault with respect to the charges lodged, DER had failed to establish “just cause” for Appellant’s removal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thus, the Commission modified the disciplinary action imposed by or<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>dering that appellant be reinstated to his position and reimbursed for all but thirty days of backpay.</p>

The court stated that having found appellant had done the things charged by DER, the Commission’s duty was simply to decide whether the charges described matters which were “just cause” for removal.</p>
