The undisputed facts are as follows: The Delaware County Solid Waste Authority (“Authority”) is a municipal authority created pursuant to the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945, Act of May 2, 1945, P.L. 382, 53 P.S. § 301, et seq. The Authority owns and operates the Colebrookdale Landfill (“Landfill”) which is located in Berks County and is part of the Boyertown Area School District.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On January 29, 1985, the Authority entered into a stock purchase agreement (“Agreement”) with R.R.M. Corporation (“R.R.M.”) for the acquisition of all of R.R.M. outstanding stock. Settlement on the Agreement occurred on March 26, 1985.</p>
    <p id="b165-8" data-blocks='[["BL_165.8",165,[174,1598,1149,478]]]'>Prior to this Agreement, R.R.M. ran Landfill as a private concern with Delaware County as one of its major users. Pursuant to the Agreement, the land owned by R.R.M. was transferred to the Authority, and members of the Authority became the officers of R.R.M. The Landfill continued to be operated through the corporate vehicle of R.R.M. from the March 26,1985 settlement, until April 26,1986 when a Department of Environmental Resources (“DER”) permit to run the operation could be transferred to the Authority.</p>

Through various purchases and condemnations, the Authority acquired an additional 224 acres of land to bring the total area of the Landfill to approximately 544 acres. Pursuant to DER regulation, a landfill disposal area must be surrounded by a buffer zone. Presently, 296 of the 544 acres of the Landfill are not essential to either the disposal area or as part of the required buffer zone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In the alternative, the Authority asserted it was exempt from taxation since the property was being used for a public purpose. The Board rejected both of these claims. The Authority appealed to the Berks County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court bifurcated the proceedings and first addressed the immunity and exemption issues. After conducting a hearing, the court issued an order that rejected the Authority’s claim to immunity, but granted the Authority a limited exemption. The exemption was limited to the 244 acres that were indispensable to the operation of the Landfill. The court also determined that the Authority was not entitled to an exemption until April 26, 1986, when the permits for operating the Landfill were trans<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>ferred into the name of the Authority.

In the alternative, the Authority asserts that it was exempt from taxation for the entire 544 acres from the March 1985 acquisition of the land. Initially, we note that there is an important distinction between assertion of immunity as opposed to exemption. Property is immune from taxation if the taxing body has not been granted the authority to levy a tax. On the other hand, an exemption does not implicate the authority to tax, but rather excludes specified property from taxation. Thus, by asserting an immunity, the Authority is claiming that the local political subdivisions lacked the authority to levy the tax. <em>See SEPTA v. Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes of Delaware County, </em><a href="/pa-commw/13/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="13 Pa.

It is well settled that property owned by the Commonwealth and its agencies is beyond the taxing power of a political subdivision.

Thus, if the land was not used as either excess buffer or as a site for future expansion it could serve no other commercial purpose.</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[228,960,1151,1144]]]'>The Board, relying on our decision in <em>Appeal of Board of Directors of Owen J. Roberts School District, </em><a href="/pa/500/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="500 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1781086" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0465-01">500 Pa. 465</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="500 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1781086" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0465-01">457 A.2d 1264</a> (1983), also argues that the Authority is not immune from taxation since the prior private owners of the landfill continue to have substantial interests in the property. In <em>Owen J. Roberts, </em>the Rodebaughs’ transferred an estate known as Welkinweir to West Chester State College subject to both a prior easement in gross and a statement of principles. Welkinweir consisted of 162 acres of land, a house containing twenty or more rooms, a garage and equipment building. The easement in gross was granted to the Green Valley association which covenanted <em>inter alia, </em>to maintain the property in a stated condition, and to ensure the property was used for certain limited purposes. After our court analyzed the prior restrictions on the land, we noted that the Rodebaughs appeared to have reserved to themselves a life estate interest in the property. We held that the trial court erred in assuming that the property was immune from taxation based solely on the transfer of record title. Rather, the proper analysis requires the court to look beyond the name on the title to the property and to examine whether a private party actually holds the incidents of ownership.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[229,2127,1148,97]],["BL_172.1",172,[255,303,1159,790]]]'>In essence, the argument is that the immunity does not apply in the present case because the agency does not have <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>sufficient incidents of ownership. Here, the Authority purchased all of the stock of R.R.M., the land was transferred, and all of the officers of R.R.M. resigned and were replaced by Authority officials. From March 26, 1985, the Authority had control of the operation of the Landfill. The only interest prior stockholders of R.R.M. maintained was the right to repurchase the property if it was determined that the Authority could not successfully expand and use the land for the stated purpose of operating the Landfill. Thus, it is clear that the present owner of the property is the Authority, and that there was no reservation of a beneficial interest that was potentially present in <em>Owen J. Roberts. </em>Further, the fact that the landfill was operated through the R.R.M. corporate vehicle did not alter the fact that the Authority controlled R.R.M., owned the land, and operated the site.</p>
