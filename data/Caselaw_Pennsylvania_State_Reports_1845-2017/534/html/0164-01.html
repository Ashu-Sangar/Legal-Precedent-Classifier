The District sought to enjoin the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (PLRB) from issuing an adjudication or conducting a hearing on two unfair labor practices filed by the West Shore Education Association (Association) against the District. In an unreported Memorandum Opinion, Commonwealth Court held that certain sections of the Sunset Act, Act of December 22, 1981, P.L. 508, No. 142, 71 P.S. § 1795.1, were unconstitutional. The court then concluded that taking into consideration the invalidation of these provisions with provisions previously stricken by this Court effectively destroyed the intended purpose of the Act, rendering the entire Act invalid. Since the Sunset Act was invalid, the PLRB remained a viable agency. Therefore, the Court concluded that no authority existed to support the granting of the District’s injunction.</p>

In support of its request for injunctive relief, the District argued that the PLRB no longer existed since it had not been constitutionally reestablished under the Sunset Act. In contrast, the Association argued that if the Leadership Committee and resolution process under the Act is unconstitutional, then the entire Act is unconstitutional since that procedure is not severable. Once the Act is declared void, the PLRB would remain viable under its enabling legislation, the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act, Act of June 1, 1937, P.L. 1168, No. 294, 43 P.S. § 211.1 et seq. Accordingly, the PLRB would have authority to adjudicate the Association’s unfair labor charges against the District.</p>

The purpose of this Act was to evaluate and monitor the need and use of state agencies. Under Section 6 of the Sunset Act, an agency (not its enabling legislation) is terminated unless continued or reestablished under the Sunset Act. To implement this purpose, the Act utilized the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, which was charged with “evaluating the management and performance of an agency”, 71 P.S. § 1795.2, and created a Leadership Committee, 71 P.S. § 1795.3. The Leadership Committee was a joint committee of the General Assembly comprised of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and Majority and Minority leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Leadership Committee’s primary function is to “direct and coordinate the implementation of the sunset review procedure” 71 P.S. § 1795.4(1), but did have the authority to postpone review or termination of an agency for a period not exceeding one year. 71 P.S. § 1795.4(4). However, section 7 of the Act, 71 P.S. § 1795.7, provides a procedure to <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>reestablish or continue an agency scheduled for termination under the Act. Under section 7, an agency scheduled for termination may be reestablished by the General Assembly by legislation, provided such legislation is adopted prior to November 1 of the year that the agency is scheduled to be terminated. On November 1, the presiding officers of each House must schedule for consideration a resolution determining whether an agency scheduled for termination on December 31 of that year should be continued until the next review and termination cycle scheduled for that agency. 71 P.S. § 1795.7(b). Finally, under section 6(a) of the Act, the PLRB was scheduled to be terminated on December 31, 1983.</p>

In November of 1984, pursuant to section 7 of the Sunset Act, both chambers of the General Assembly adopted Sunset Resolution 17 reestablishing the PLRB. On December 30, 1984, then Governor Thornburgh signed Senate Resolution 17 but was not given the identical House Resolution for signature.</p>

Thus, it was within the power of the General Assembly to create a sentencing commission for the purpose of recommending sentencing guidelines. Since its recommendations were merely advisory and not mandatory, its function did not infringe upon the powers of the judiciary to exercise its discretion in imposing sentences within statutory constraints. While both <em>Blackwell </em>and <em>Sessoms </em>are instructive with regard to the exercise of constitutional authority, neither one is controlling in this appeal, since here we are reviewing legislative action taken pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Sunset Act when the Governor has affixed his signature to that legislative enactment<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>.</p>

Therefore, we must agree with the Commonwealth Court that the legislature would not have enacted the remaining valid provi<a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>sions without the Leadership Committee or resolution process. Accordingly, we must invalidate the entire Sunset Act.</p>
    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[196,398,1148,211]]]'>Since the Sunset Act is invalid, the limitation on the existence of the PLRB as set forth in the Sunset Act is void. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court acted properly in denying the District’s request for injunctive relief.</p>
    <p id="b257-6" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[240,636,988,37]]]'>The order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.</p>

In <em>Blackwell II, </em>we declined to address challenges to other provisions of the Act including Section 7(b) because we could dispose of the appeal based upon our discussion of Section 4(4). Accordingly, it was unnecessary to invalidate the entire Act, as the resolution process under <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>Seclion 7(b) arguably presented a procedure to reestablish an agency scheduled for termination.</p>
