The land is owned by the Redevelopment Authority of the City of Philadelphia and leased to the O.P.D.C. Penn’s Landing Corporation (hereinafter “Penn’s Landing”). Penn’s Landing is a non-profit municipal corporation. The area itself is open to the public free of charge. However, fees are assessed for entrance to various exhibits, concerts and activities.</p>

Appellee Halber filed a complaint in negligence against the city of Philadelphia, Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority and Penn’s Landing. In both cases Penn’s Landing filed motions for summary judgment claiming immunity pursuant to the RUA. The trial court involved in each case granted the motions for summary judgment. On appeal to the Commonwealth Court the judgments were reversed, as that Court <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>found the protection of the RUA inapplicable to Penn’s Landing.

The trial court in the Halber case gave no specific reasons beyond citing to the general provisions of the RUA. The trial court in the Mills case stated that “Penn’s Landing falls within- the parameters of the [RUA] since the land is made available by the owners free of charge to the public for recreational purposes.” (Opinion of the trial court, at No. 6105 June term 1989, p. 3).</p>

In applying the RUA and the case law referred to above to the land as fully described herein, it is apparent that the RUA was not intended to provide immunity to a highly developed recreational area such as Penn’s Landing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

We find that the factors relied upon by Penn’s Landing, that the area is used for recreational purposes by the general public and that no admission fee is required to enter Penn’s Landing, are not dispositive in applying the immunity protections afforded under the RUA. Rather, we believe the intended beneficiaries of the RUA, in addition to the general public, are landowners of large unimproved tracts of land which, without alteration, is amenable to the enumerated recreational purposes within the act. The purpose of the RUA was to provide immunity to landowners as an incentive to them in exchange for their tolerance of public access to their lands for recreational pursuits. The RUA was not intended to insulate owners of fully developed recreational facilities from the normal duty of maintaining their property in a manner consistent with the property’s designated and intended use by the public.</p>
