    <p id="b425-12" data-blocks='[["BL_425.11",425,[230,1786,1153,589]]]'>This appeal arises from the events of July 1, 1988, at approximately 11:30 p.m. Pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 6308(b), the Pennsylvania State Police had set up a systematic roadblock at the entrance to the Blair Heights Housing Project in Clairton. The officers were checking for vehicle registration, proof of insurance, and driver’s license. Trooper Raymond Paul noticed a 1967 Pontiac convertible, driven by Appellant, pull up to the check area. According to Trooper Paul, the vehicle came to a sudden stop and then started to back up and pull away from the officers. The officers immediately pursued the car and stopped it.</p>

      <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>The officers then approached and asked Appellant to step out of the car and produce his driver’s license and registration. When Appellant got out of the car Trooper Paul saw a .357 magnum on the floor alongside the driver’s seat. He ordered the passengers out of the car and recovered the gun, which he found to be fully loaded. He also found drug paraphernalia in the back seat. Appellant did not have a license to carry the gun. The officer arrested Appellant and transported him to the police station. After Appellant was taken to the station, police discovered eight packets of heroin and nine packets of cocaine in the patrol car behind the seat where Appellant had been sitting. Appellant was later charged with drug and firearms violations.</p>
    <p id="b426-5" data-blocks='[["BL_426.4",426,[247,1050,1165,694]]]'>Appellant filed a pro se pre-trial motion to suppress, <em>inter alia, </em>evidence obtained during the search of his automobile, arguing that the evidence was obtained pursuant to an illegal search of his person. (K. 30-32.) Following a hearing at which Appellant was represented by counsel, the trial court denied the motion and found Appellant guilty on two misdemeanor counts of possession of a controlled substance, one misdemeanor count of carrying a firearm without a license, and one misdemeanor count of possessing a firearm illegally as a former convict. The court found Appellant not guilty on two felony counts of possession with intent to deliver. Appellant filed a pro se motion for a new trial and arrest of judgment, which was denied.</p>
    <p id="b426-6" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[244,1786,1162,586]]]'>Appellant then appealed to the Superior Court, raising only the issue of whether his conduct in avoiding the roadblock had given rise to a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot or that he had committed a violation of the Vehicle Code. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Judges Popovich and Kelly wrote to affirm on the merits; Judge Wieand would have affirmed without reaching the merits, because he found that Appellant had waived the suppression issue by failing to raise it in a post-trial motion.</p>

The trial court acknowledged that it had denied the pre-trial motion to suppress, but the only discussion relevant to the roadblock issue was a brief factual reference to the pre-trial motion: “As to the suppression motion, a suppression hearing was held in which two Pennsylvania state troopers testified that the defendant was arrested as he attempted to drive his motor vehicle away from a police checkpoint where routine traffic stops were being conducted.” (Trial court slip op. at 2.) The court engaged in no discussion of the substance of the issue.
