    <p id="b519-9" data-blocks='[["BL_519.8",519,[175,1331,1152,524]]]'>The Commonwealth charged that the Appellant committed an act of indecent assault on a ten year old girl in November of 1985, and an act of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse on the same girl in December of 1985. The Appellant had worked with the girl’s grandfather. The families had been acquainted for several years, and had spent time together over the preceding months.

    <p id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.10",521,[209,658,1149,97]],["BL_522.1",522,[258,309,1157,479]]]'>Unquestionably, sections 5913 and 5914 involve two distinct rules.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The first was a rule disqualifying a husband or wife <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>from giving any testimony adverse to the spouse. This broad rule was not without exceptions. Within Section 5913 was provided an exception for charges of threatening, attempting, or committing an act of bodily injury or violence on the spouse or children in their care, an exception for charges of desertion and maintenance, and an exception for charges of bigamy. The statement of the rule of incompetency was also preceded by language indicating that exceptions may be found elsewhere in the . subchapter.</p>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.6",522,[257,813,1157,315]]]'>The second rule, found in section 5914, is more limited. It provides that spouses are incompetent to testify to confidential communications. The only exception stated within the section is that this protection may be “waived upon the trial.” Again, however, there is prefatory language to the effect that the rule is as stated, “except as otherwise provided in this subchapter.”</p>

The <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>court failed to explain, however, how this interpretation could stand against the criticism that it renders section 5914 entirely superfluous. If a husband or wife is incompetent to testify against the spouse at all (section 5913), there is no need to state separately that a husband or wife is incompetent to testify to confidential communications (section 5914). Likewise, if the exception applies to both rules, then there is no circumstance where the confidential communications rule of section 5914 is applicable that the competency provision of section 5913 is not. If there is another reading of the statutes that avoids this difficulty and gives effect to all the provisions, it is to be preferred. See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(2) (presumption that legislature intends entire statute to be effective).</p>
    <p id="b523-5" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[214,1065,1149,263]]]'>Such an interpretation is not difficult to discern. Subchapter A of Chapter 59 of the Judicial Code, in which these sections appear, contains another section dealing with spouses as witnesses in criminal proceedings, i.e., section 5915. That section provides that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b523-6" data-blocks='[["BL_523.5",523,[253,1350,1110,252]]]'>In any criminal proceeding brought against the husband or wife, if the defendant makes defense at the trial upon any ground which attacks the character or conduct of his or her spouse, the spouse attacked shall be a competent witness in rebuttal for the Commonwealth.</blockquote>

Thus, with respect to spouses as witnesses, the general rule is incompetency. This rule does not apply, that is, one spouse is a competent witness against the other, where it is charged that the other threatened, attempted, or committed an act of violence or personal injury to the spouse sought to be called as a witness or to children in the care of either of them. Even if the spouse is generally competent to testify under the “bodily injury or violence” exception, however, he or she is not competent to testify to confidential communications. The sole exception to this rule is that a husband or wife is competent to testify to rebut a defense based upon grounds that attack his or her character <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>or conduct. In such case, the testimony could encompass confidential communications.</p>

    <p id="b524-8" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[243,834,1161,798]]]'>Of the statements identified by present counsel as being objectionable, it is clear that the first does not qualify as a confidential communication. The record is replete with indications that the Appellant told many people other than his wife that he wished to adopt an “older” girl. The Hanchariks had even contacted a county agency, applied to be foster parents, and gone through foster care home study towards this end. Undoubtedly, in the course of this process, the Appellant expressed his desire to adopt an older girl in the presence of, indeed directly to, a party other than his wife. Even if there was an instance when the Appellant indicated his desire to adopt an older girl to his wife in a confidential marital communication, his wife clearly could testify regarding any of the other instances where he gave the same indication in a non-confidential setting.</p>

Instead of developing the record as to trial counsel’s strategy or lack thereof on this point, however, present counsel “waive[d] any argument other than what’s in the memorandum” filed in support of the post-verdict motions, thus leaving the record of the trial as the only evidence regarding his claim.</p>

It appears that counsel fully intended to use Mrs. Hancharik’s testimony about the status of their marital relationship to buttress the theory suggested by the Appellant that his wife was behind the filing of these false charges against him because “something is really wrong with our marriage, our <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>divorce is mixed up into this.” Notes of Testimony at 135, R. 49a. Although counsel apparently planned to introduce this line of testimony by way of cross-examination “for purposes of impeaching her credibility,” N.T. at 52, and thus objected on the grounds of relevance to its admission in the Commonwealth’s case in chief, N.T. at 51, for present purposes it is sufficient to note that from the outset,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> in one form or another, counsel intended that the jury hear this line of testimony.</p>

Even if counsel could have pursued this strategy without allowing the jury to hear Mrs. Hancharik,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the test is not whether more reasonable trial strategies were available, but whether trial counsel could have had some reasonable basis for the strategy that was chosen. Perhaps counsel believed that Mrs. Hancharik’s demeanor would buttress his theory. Perhaps counsel thought his theory would be more credible if evidence from which jealousy could be inferred came from Mrs. Hancharik herself rather than solely from the Appellant, who had obvious reasons for fabricating such a scenario. Clearly, there are many reasons why counsel might reasonably have chosen not to object to the testimony now challenged, and thus there is no basis for determining that he rendered ineffective assistance.</p>

    <blockquote id="b529-10" data-blocks='[["BL_529.10",529,[260,1108,1109,480]]]'>He just claimed that he loved her very much and he needed a daughter to complete his family. I told him if that was the case he had to consider the grandmother’s feeling cause she’d spent a lot of time with her grandmother throughout the years. She just couldn’t be shut off from her life. I said I’m not her mother. You will have to go talk to her mother and he did. He told her of his need for a daughter and how much he really loved Kathy and Kathy enjoyed being with us as far as I knew.</blockquote>

The Superior Court en banc <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>disagreed by determining that the statements were confidential.</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[229,430,1162,363]]]'>As posed by the majority of our Court, the statement-issue reads (Maj. opinion at p. 437): “that ‘he loved [the girl] very much and needed a daughter to complete his family’ and ‘he could relax when [she] was around.’ ” Without explanation, the majority then concludes that the “testimony complained of just as clearly does come within the scope of section 5914 as confidential communications.”</p>
    <p id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[228,829,1160,633]]]'>It is not clear at all. A close reading of the transcript as quoted above shows that Appellant’s confession of love <em>also </em>was made to the victim’s mother, according to the uncontested testimony of his wife as to that fact. The record, therefore, speaks for itself as either a public statement or a waiver of any intent to maintain confidentiality. In either case, I conclude that the language cannot be designated as a confidence. I fear that the majority has decided that the Appellant’s sexual act upon the girl defines his profession of “love” as a presumption of romantic love. The evidence, therefore, is being read backwards from his deviate conduct to his feelings of “love.”</p>
    <p id="b530-6" data-blocks='[["BL_530.6",530,[222,1498,1161,477]]]'>The general context of the relevant testimony, moreover, offers no support for the majority’s conclusions. Appellant told at least two people that he loved the girl, but likewise repeated his feelings that an adopted daughter would satisfy his vision of a “complete” family along with his son and that he could “relax” with her as a family member. As the majority recognizes, he told at least several other people that he wanted to adopt an “older” girl. Nothing about this broader testimony manifests any sense of confidentiality.</p>
    <p id="b530-7" data-blocks='[["BL_530.7",530,[220,2001,1157,359]]]'>Because I cannot agree that a predicate of spousal confidentiality existed by virtue of this statement, I find that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the testimony. I am convinced that the majority opinion has been misled by an acutely strained reading of the testimony in order to establish a confidential communication between the Hanchariks.</p>
    <p id="b531-4" data-blocks='[["BL_531.3",531,[214,293,1153,644]]]'>
      <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>I likewise disagree sharply with the contention that the statutory scheme embodied in sections 5913, 5914 and 5915 of 42 Pa.C.S. would foreclose revelation of a spousal confidence under these circumstances. The Superior Court decided the issue correctly, and even assuming arguendo that a confidential communication was present, I would agree that where an exception is provided in criminal cases involving an act against a child, the defendant’s spouse would be competent to testify. As pointed out by Judge Tamilia’s concurring opinion, the evolution of legal doctrine on this subject from the common law to modern statutes indicates an undeniable trend to protect children who have been abused.</p>
    <p id="b531-5" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[213,960,1151,1231]]]'>In a more technical sense, by enacting amendments to § 5913, the legislature, I am convinced, meant to destroy the spousal privilege where a child in the home suffers violence. Contrary to the majority’s reading, I interpret § 5914’s prefatory pronouncement, “Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter,” to refer to § 5913 and § 5915 and underscore the fact that the identical language appears in the former as well. Sections 5913 and 5914, therefore, are meant to read that a spousal confidentiality exists, except where certain conduct specifically destroys the privilege, as in this case. Section 5914 must be read in terms of the exceptions provided by § 5913. When two statutes conflict, the more specific one closely applicable to the controversy controls over a more generalized provision. The narrower and earlier statute should decide the meaning of the subsequent statute, § 5914 in this case. A common sense construction of this language makes it plain that spousal incompetency is limited by the stated exceptions. Finally, a court is not permitted to alter or ignore the unmistakable language of a statute. <em>Commonwealth v. Scott, </em><a href="/pa/516/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="516 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="1808582" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0346-01">516 Pa. 346</a>, 357, <a href="/pa/516/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="516 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="1808582" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0346-01">532 A.2d 426</a>, 429 (1987) (construing § 5913). While cognizant of bad draftsmanship, I am convinced firmly that Mrs. Hancharik’s testimony was permissible.</p>
