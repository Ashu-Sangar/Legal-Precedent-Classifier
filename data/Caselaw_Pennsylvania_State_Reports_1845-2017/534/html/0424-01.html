    <p id="b508-10" data-blocks='[["BL_508.9",508,[230,1269,1156,313]]]'>At issue in this appeal is the applicability of Act 16 of 1989, which rewrote the statutory provision dealing with spouses as witnesses against each other, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5913 (Supp.1993), and the interplay between that section and the provision dealing with confidential communications between spouses, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5914 (Supp.1993).</p>
    <p id="b508-11" data-blocks='[["BL_508.10",508,[225,1612,1162,747]]]'>Mary Newman, the Appellant, was subpoenaed to testify at a coroner’s inquest/preliminary hearing on November 14,1989, concerning a charge of homicide against her husband, Kenneth Newman, arising out of the death of Raymond Little in March of 1988. The Commonwealth’s offer of proof with respect to her testimony was that she was present and observed certain events involving her husband, the victim, and a co-conspirator, and that her husband had admitted to her that he struck the victim on the head with a stone. According to the Commonwealth, the Appellant had provided this information to detectives investigating the homicide. Upon her refusal to testify at the coroner’s inquest, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County entered an order holding her in contempt. A stay of incarceration was granted pending this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.3",509,[201,308,1150,360]]]'>
      <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>We must first address the Appellant’s argument that Act 16 of 1989 does not apply to this case and thus 42 Pa.C.S. § 5913 as it existed before June 29, 1989, states the controlling rule. This question must be resolved at the outset, for if the Appellant is correct, she is not competent as a witness against her husband. We find no merit to this argument, however.</p>
    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[199,705,1151,479]]]'>Prior to the passage of Act 16 of 1989, Section 5913 stated a general rule disqualifying a husband or wife from giving any testimony adverse to the spouse. It also stated several exceptions to this broad rule. One spouse could give testimony against the other in proceedings for desertion and maintenance, in cases where husband or wife was charged with threatening, attempting, or committing an act of bodily injury or violence against the spouse or any child in their care, and in cases of bigamy.</p>
    <p id="b509-6" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[195,1214,1153,468]]]'>Act 16 of 1989 rewrote this section, changing it from a rule rendering one spouse incompetent to testify against the other to a rule recognizing a privilege not to testify against one’s spouse. The exceptions were carried over; thus, in cases where previously an exception rendered a spouse competent to testify, now it is stated that there is no privilege in such situations. Additionally, an exception was added for cases where the charges include murder, rape, or involuntary deviate sexual intercourse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[260,310,1156,304]]]'>
      <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>Thus, if Act 16 does not apply, the Appellant is incompetent to testify against her husband and no exception applies that would permit her testimony. If it does apply, she is a competent witness and she has no privilege not to testify, since “one of the charges against [her husband] includes murder.”</p>
    <p id="b510-5" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[257,645,1158,691]]]'>The Appellant’s argument that Act 16 does not apply is based on section 2, which states that the Act “shall apply to all criminal cases pending on the effective date” of the Act, which was June 29, 1989. The Appellant notes that the death occurred in March of 1988 and that the man charged as a co-conspirator in the crime had pled guilty prior to the adoption of Act 16. Accordingly, there was no case pending on the effective date of the Act. Indeed, argues the Appellant, the Commonwealth did not originally file charges against Kenneth Newman because without the testimony of his wife the case would have been too difficult to prove; charges were brought after the Act became effective on the belief that the Appellant could then be compelled to testify.</p>
    <p id="b510-6" data-blocks='[["BL_510.6",510,[254,1360,1160,849]]]'>This argument is specious. Obviously the General Assembly intended Act 16 to apply to all cases initiated after the effective date. The “pending cases” language of Section 2 does no more than express the legislature’s intention that the new rule should apply to cases already “in the system” as well. Such cases would necessarily involve criminal conduct occurring before the effective date of the Act; thus, it is clear that the legislature made a conscious decision not to limit the application of the Act to criminal conduct occurring after its effective date. Since the hearing in this case at which the Appellant was called to testify was held on November 14,1989, the rule of 42 Pa.C.S. § 5913 as rewritten by Act 16 of 1989 controls. The Appellant is a competent witness against her husband and, because one of the charges against him is murder, she may not assert a privilege not to testify against him.</p>
    <p id="b511-4" data-blocks='[["BL_511.3",511,[193,283,1154,1496]]]'>
      <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>The Appellant also argues that it would be unfair to allow the Commonwealth to “take advantage of a potential windfall” by using the Appellant’s testimony, since at the time she was interviewed by investigators (in February of 1989) it was “well known” that information obtained from her could not later be compelled in the form of testimony. We perceive no unfairness. It has always been permissible for the Commonwealth to use information obtained from one spouse to build a case against the other spouse. The competency rule, now privilege, is a testimonial one. We find it highly doubtful that the Appellant freely informed the investigators about matters implicating her husband in the crime in reliance on the assumption that it could do no harm since she could not be called to repeat the information in any formal proceeding. Even if this were the case, however, such an assumption would have been unreasonable. Subject only to constitutional limitations, the legislature is always free to change the rules governing competency of witnesses and admissibility of evidence. The application of the new rule in circumstances such as this does not constitute an <em>ex post facto </em>law. See <em>Hopt v. Utah, </em><a href="/us/110/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="110 U.S. 574" data-case-ids="3503664" data-case-paths="/us/110/0574-01">110 U.S. 574</a>, <a href="/us/110/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="110 U.S. 574" data-case-ids="3503664" data-case-paths="/us/110/0574-01">4 S.Ct. 202</a>, <a href="/us/110/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="110 U.S. 574" data-case-ids="3503664" data-case-paths="/us/110/0574-01">28 L.Ed. 262</a> (1884), where, at the time of the homicide, a convicted felon could not be called as a witness, but before trial the law was changed, and a convicted felon testified and implicated the defendant. The Court held that the law was not <em>ex post facto </em>because it did not criminalize a previously innocent act, it did not enhance a crime previously committed, and it did not change the proof needed to obtain a conviction.</p>

We noted that the two sections stated two distinct rules. The prefatory language contained in each section, “Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter,” could not be read to engraft the provisions explicitly stated as exceptions to Section 5913 onto Section 5914, for to do so would result in the exception swallowing the rule, rendering Section 5914 superfluous. That language, we found, referred to Section 5915, which renders a husband or wife competent to testify, even as to confidential communications, when “the defendant makes defense at trial upon any ground which attacks the character or conduct of his or her spouse----”</p>

Even if a husband or wife may be called to give testimony adverse to his or her spouse, however, he or she is not competent to testify to confidential communications.

The trial court’s order that she divulge the information was proper under the law. The majority is incorrect in determining that, upon a finding that the interspousal communication was confidential, she would be rendered speechless.</p>
