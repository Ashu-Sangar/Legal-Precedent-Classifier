    <p id="b220-12" data-blocks='[["BL_220.11",220,[223,1718,1159,640]]]'>On June 27, 1989 five members of the Montgomery County narcotics enforcement team were having lunch in a restaurant in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. At approximately 1:55 p.m., two men entered the restaurant and were seated. One of them carried a black satchel with an antenna protruding. The men sat at the table briefly, then moved two or three feet to another table, where, without prior greeting or conversation, they joined two other men who were already seated at the second table. One of the men already seated was appellant Martin. The men talked, one of them looked under the table, and one of them went to the telephone area, where he was observed talking on the telephone.</p>

The men stopped talking, got up, and moved to another table in a remote unoccupied section of the restaurant. At approximately 2:10 p.m., drinks were served and the man with the black satchel placed it on the table and pushed it across to Martin while looking around in what police characterized as a suspicious manner. Martin, who also was looking around “furtively,” took the satchel and placed it on his lap. Martin’s hands were not visible to the detectives, but he looked down at the satchel and his arm movements suggested that he might have placed them in the satchel. Martin then placed the satchel on the table and pushed it back to the first man. The men then raised their glasses as if making a toast. The detectives believed at this point that a drug deal was in progress and that the toast was the consummation of the deal.</p>

The man who had opened the trunk returned to the restaurant, where he rejoined Martin and the other man.</p>

After being advised of his rights, the occupant of the taxi consented to a search of his <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>person and belongings. The search revealed a small amount of marijuana. The police radioed this information to the detectives at the restaurant and placed the man who had been searched under arrest.</p>

Each man carried a satchel. As the men prepared to enter the vehicle, detectives approached, guns drawn but at their sides, and indicated that they wanted to know what had occurred in the restaurant. Martin was directed to place his brown satchel on the ground. One of the detectives then directed the trained dog to perform a sniff search of Martin’s brown satchel. The dog indicated to its handler that the satchel contained drugs. Thereupon, one of the detectives opened the satchel and found a small quantity of marijuana, an address book, and $70,500 in consecutively numbered $100 bills. Martin was then arrested.</p>

The search was properly conducted without a warrant, according to the trial court, because it was conducted incident to a lawful arrest and exigent circumstances existed.</p>
    <p id="b223-4" data-blocks='[["BL_223.4",223,[211,581,1151,917]]]'>Superior Court also believed that the police possessed a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The suspicion was based on the men moving to different tables, furtive looks, passing the satchel, the celebratory toast, and the arrest of the man in the taxi, who had a small amount of marijuana. On the basis of this reasonable suspicion, according to Superior Court, Martin was properly subject to an investigatory detention, and since his satchel may have contained drugs or a weapon, it was proper to direct Martin to place the satchel on the ground and to conduct the canine sniff search of the satchel. Superior Court then concluded that the dog’s alert to the satchel coupled with the suspicious behavior of the men constituted probable cause to search the satchel. Exigent circumstances existed in that Martin and his companions would have left the scene if police had been required to obtain a search warrant. Hence, police, according to Superior Court, were permitted to open the satchel.</p>

Obviously, if the government has probable cause on which to act initially, it may do so under the normal rules existing. On the other hand, where there is probable cause initially, the police may want to be even more sure of their conclusion, which is by definition “probable,” by adding to the factual basis with the results of a canine sniff. Probable cause is not set in stone, it is a set of circumstances which create an inference that a thing more “probably” may be found in a given location. The choice of adding facts which may further a finding of probable cause is clearly for the government to make and even though a redundancy may occur, it potentially offers the police a stronger set of facts on which to act while at the same time offering the innocent <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>citizen an additional layer of protection from intrusive government action.

Ohio, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">392 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">88 S.Ct. 1868</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">20 L.Ed.2d 889</a> (1968). In <em>Terry </em>a balance was struck between the governmental interest and the limited intrusion upon the citizen.

I see that as no different than ordering a man or woman to place his or her purse, wallet or coat on the ground for sniffing. I agree with the majority that the governmental interest involved does not outweigh the citizens interest to be free from search and seizures unless based upon probable cause, when it involves the search of the person or the personal belongings which that -person is carrying.

In fact, the only possible result would be the elimination of the use of dogs trained in narcotics detection.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[251,735,1163,927]]]'>Under the majority’s standard, the police must have probable cause to believe the satchel contains contraband before conducting a sniff search. If the dog sniff indicates the presence of drugs, then nothing has been gained because the police already had probable cause to believe that the satchel contained contraband. However, if the dog sniff does not indicate the presence of drugs, then the police are in a quandary. As Justice Cappy’s concurring opinion points out, depending on the facts of the case, the probable cause determination may be undermined. (Concurring Opinion, Cappy, J. at 147 n. 1). At the very least, the evidence of probable cause would be equivocal. It stands to reason that the police will not use a technique, which they are not required to use, that could only work to undermine their law enforcement efforts. Therefore, I do not view the majority as creating “a potential layer of protection.” Instead the police are told to discard an unintrusive tool that was utilized to meet a compelling need.</p>

If the police wish to seize an object, pursuant to probable cause in order to obtain a search warrant, they are certainly entitled to do so. However, a detention of the suspect that goes beyond the scope of a brief investigatory stop is an arrest. Thus, the police are instructed to conduct a useless dog sniff, and then to arrest the suspect, but at the same time are told not to conduct a search incident to a lawful arrest. Rather the new hybrid procedure is to arrest appellant, and then conduct nothing more than a <em>Terry </em>frisk.</p>

This conclusion exalts form over substance. Once the drug detection canine alerted the police that the satchel contained contraband, the police had probable cause to arrest. The contemporaneous search of the satchel, which was at Martin’s feet at the time of the search, was a proper search incident to a lawful arrest.</p>
