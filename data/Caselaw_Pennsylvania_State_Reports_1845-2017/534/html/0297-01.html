    <p id="b381-7" data-blocks='[["BL_381.6",381,[222,577,1149,371]]]'>In January of 1986, appellant, Kevin Stanley, was found guilty by a jury of robbery, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3701(a)(l)(ii), in connection with an armed intrusion into the apartment of a nurse who was threatened with death, and robbed of $26.00. The sentence imposed was five to ten years imprisonment. On appeal, appellant’s conviction was confirmed by the Superi- or Court, and this court declined to permit further review.</p>
    <p id="b381-8" data-blocks='[["BL_381.7",381,[220,976,1152,476]]]'>In February of 1990, appellant petitioned pro se for post conviction relief, and counsel was appointed. An amended prayer for relief was dismissed without hearing the following December, on the basis that the trial court had found it to present no genuine issues concerning any material fact, and because appellant was not entitled to collateral relief or any further proceedings in the matter. The Superior Court affirmed, <a href="/citations/?q=415%20Pa.%20Super.%20660" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="415 Pa.

    <p id="b381-9" data-blocks='[["BL_381.8",381,[217,1492,1153,529]]]'>The sole basis for this appeal is appellant’s assertion that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a hearing on whether appellant’s counsel was ineffective for having failed to call two witnesses pursuant to his pretrial alibi notice. In order to find ineffectiveness, it must be demonstrated that the underlying claim is of arguable merit, and that counsel’s act of omission or Commission had no reasonable basis directed at effectuating his client’s interests. Counsel’s action or inaction must also have resulted in prejudice. <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a> (1987).</p>

The existence and availability of the witness must be shown, as well as counsel’s actual awareness of, or duty to know of the witness; the witness’ willingness and ability to cooperate and appear on the defendant’s behalf; and the necessity for the proposed testimony in order to avoid prejudice. <em><a href="/pa-super/368/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="368 Pa.

It is inconceivable that counsel, having filed the notice of alibi, was unaware of whether the witnesses could or would cooperate, otherwise no notice should have been forthcoming. Moreover, appellant’s defense was based on misidentification, a theory which would have been substantially reinforced by presentation of an alibi.
