This case was affirmed on appeal in Penna. Hospital v.

    <p id="b581-3" data-blocks='[["BL_581.4",581,[147,489,1153,968]]]'>All of which means simply that, conceding impairment of value, since he who owned the land at the time of the plotting could hold his property till the street was actually cut through, or, if he voluntarily sold, could make the purchaser equitably discount to him the future damages which the latter would presumably collect from the municipality, therefore, when another corporation, possessing the right of eminent domain, forcibly takes the real estate in question, before the proposed street is opened, and thus, without the owner’s consent, deprives him of every opportunity to protect himself from the harmful results of the plotting, it-must be recognized that such corporation also takes the owner’s inchoate right in what the city eventually will pay to it for the damage done the property, and this it should settle for; but, as already stated, the practical method of working out the payment is the course followed by the court below.</p>
