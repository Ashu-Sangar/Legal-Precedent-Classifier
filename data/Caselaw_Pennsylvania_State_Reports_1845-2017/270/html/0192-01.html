The latter vehicle was moving at the rate of from six to eight miles an hour, and the minor was traveling iat a slightly less rate of speed. When the automobile reached Fitzwater Street (the cartway of which was twenty-six feet wide), it turned thereon, at right angles and in a westwardly direction, without any signal being given of such intention; whereupon the minor, who says he saw it headed west, and was himself at the curbline of the street when it was at the middle thereof, also turned in the same direction and was “between the automobile and the north side of Fitzwater Street.” His bicycle, he says, was then moving slowly, under “perfect control”; but, instead of wheeling to the north curb and waiting there until the oncoming automobile had passed, he continued diagonally across the street in front of it, and succeeded in passing nearly the entire distance jn safety, the rear wheel of the bicycle being struck, <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>however, by the left front wheel of the automobile, resulting in the injuries to recover for which this suit was brought.</p>
    <p id="b221-5" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[102,510,1158,1195]]]'>Under these facts the case was for the jury on the question of defendant’s negligence. The chauffeur was in duty bound to anticipate the possibility of other vehicles being on the street between the car and the curbline of Broad Street, and hence was required to give some notice of his intention to make the turn, or else to wait until he was sure the way was clear so to do, But the minor also was required to exercise care. With his bicycle under “perfect control” and going slowly, he should have turned to and waited at the north curb of Fitzwater Street, until the automobile had passed, but instead of doing- this,—possibly because of a desire not to travel further away from his home, which was southeast of this point,—he kept on across the street directly in the path of the approaching automobile, taking the chance of getting over in safety.

The suit was properly brought as a joint action under the Act of May 12,1897, P.

In all the respects stated, it is exactly like the Act of May 8,1895, P. L. 54, relating to joint actions by husband and wife, in case of an injury to the latter, which, in Rinker v.
