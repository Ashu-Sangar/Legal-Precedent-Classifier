It differed from the ordinary endowment contract in that the amount of insurance was paid in full at the time of its execution. To secure the company in the collection of the premiums, a mortgage was taken—which covered the cost of insurance, plus the interest on the sum advanced, and other charges—to he satisfied at the end of the endowment period, provided there was no default in payments fixed; or sooner, if the insured should die. A policy of this character is not objectionable when an insurable interest appears: United Security L. I. &amp; T. Co. v. Ritchey, <a href="/pa/187/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="187 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="900270" data-case-paths="/pa/187/0173-01">187 Pa. 173</a>.</p>

The bond and mortgage, given as collateral to secure the payment of the premiums, were executed by the defendant, and, on their face, both referred to an agreement by which the rights of insurer and insured were fixed. Default in the payment of an installment resulted in these foreclosure proceedings.. To the scire facias issued, the defense was made that the mortgage was given to secure the performance of a contract, which was speculative in its nature, Brown having no insurable interest in the life of Tyler. This contention was sustained in the court below, and binding instructions were given for defendant.</p>

For the plaintiff to recover, it was essential that it offer in evidence the mortgage. This, and the accompanying bond, referred in terms to the agreement of even date, which clearly showed the character of the transaction. On its face, the relationship of the parties appeared, which disclosed the lack of insurable interest. If other facts altered this situation, they should have been proven, and thus have placed the contract, upon which the suit was based, without the class condemned by public policy.</p>
