Defendant has a single track electric railway along the center of Third Street in the city of Chester. The street is paved and in use for general traffic by automobiles and other vehicles. On the evening of May 28, 1915, plaintiffs’ son, Gerald Thomas; eight years of age, jumped upon the rear step on the blind side of one of defendant’s cars, to have a free ride, and supported himself by grasping the iron gate which separated the step from <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>the platform. While the car was in motion, the conductor struck the gate with his foot, or kicked it, ostensibly to frighten the boy off (at least it had that effect) and he jumped into the street, where he was struck and killed by an automobile jitney, which was moving rapidly in the opposite direction. The jitney was in full view when the boy left the car and struck him before he could clear its path.</p>

Here the conductor’s behavior is aggravated by the fact that he was apparently attempting to force the boy from the car in disregard of traffic upon the street. The natural and probable consequence of such act, under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, would be personal injury to the lad; hence, that act, rather than contact with the jitney, was the proximate cause of the accident. The principle is well stated in Shearman and Redfield on Negligence, section 10, as quoted with approval in Burrell Twp. v. Uncapher, <a href="/pa/117/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="117 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="555790" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0353-01">117 Pa. 353</a>, 363, that, “Negligence, however, may be the proximate cause of an injury of which it is not the sole or immediate cause.
