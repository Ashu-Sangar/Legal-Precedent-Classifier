The title asserted by the original plaintiff has its foundation in the claim that his daughter held title to the property in trust for him, as the result of its purchase money coming from him. The learned chancellor, who heard the case, determined that a trust in the father’s <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>favor had not been established by the proofs and dismissed the bill; plaintiffs have appealed.</p>

The following year, the husband acquired title to an adjoining lot and seven years thereafter, in 1889, he and his wife, through the instrumentality of a deed from an intermediate grantee, conveyed this lot to the wife, who continued to hold both lots until 1898, when they were sold for a consideration of $3,200, which was received by her. Between the time of the purchase of the first lot and the sale of both of them in 1898, improvements were made upon them, which were paid for by the earnings of the whole family. At the time of the sale of the properties, <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>some indebtedness on them was paid and tbe balance remaining, about $2,000, was deposited by the wife in a savings bank from which she later withdrew it, and with it and $400 additional, which she borrowed, purchased the property on Stone Avenue, the subject of this litigation, the deed being made to her daughter, Margarite Scheller, one of the defendants, in whom the title remained for twenty years, when this bill was filed by the father, who asserted the property was his. Just whose money paid for the lot first purchased in 1881 does not appear, but presumptively it was the wife’s; of course, the conclusion must be that the husband’s money paid for the second purchase, but when he, by his grant, placed the title to it in the wife, the legal presumption is that a gift was intended (Earnest’s App., supra); so we have the wife, vested with title to both lots, one by purchase with her own money, the other by gift from her husband, selling them, receiving the purchase money, depositing it in bank to her own credit, thereafter withdrawing it to pay in part for another property, title to which she placed in her daughter’s name, where it remained for twenty years. It should and would require strong and convincing proofs to upset the daughter’s title under these circumstances. The evidence discloses that the father knew of his wife’s intention to invest the money received from the sale of the Pittston Avenue property in the purchase of the Stone Avenue property; but there is no evidence that anything was said about the name in which the title should be taken, or that he requested or directed his wife to take title in his name or in their joint names as tenants by entirety, and there is neither allegation nor proof that, when the wife purchased the property and put the title in her daughter, she intended the latter should hold it in trust for her or for any one else. For seventeen years preceding the death of his wife, the husband was separated from hei and lived in another county; after her death, he consulted an attorney and was then fully informed that title <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>to the property had been taken in the name of the daughter and that the deed was of record. Shortly after receiving this information, he took up his residence with the daughter and remained with her until about the time of filing the bill, almost three years. By his will he specifically devised the property in question to two of his children, who were the substituted plaintiffs in the bill, so that if his and their contention be upheld, the daughter, Margarite Scheller, would receive nothing. “A child may accept a voluntary deed from a parent without being subject to an obligation to make affirmative proof that the grantor was fully acquainted with the character of the act in which he was engaged and that the conveyance was fair and conscionable”: Carney v. Carney, <a href="/pa/196/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="196 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="916743" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0034-01">196 Pa. 34</a>.</p>

L. 158, objection was made. We need not pass on the question as to whether these witnesses were competent; their testimony, which was taken by the court and subsequently excluded, appears in the stenographer’s notes, but, even- if admitted, it would not establish a case against defendants. There is no evidence of the husband having any money except his monthly earnings, which he gave to his wife or permitted her to receive, and which, along with the earnings of the children, was used in payment of family expenses and the improvement of the Pittston Avenue property; from this showing, it could not be predicated that the property in question was bought with the husband’s money alone. The evidence disclosed the wife was a frugal and industrious woman, and that she at times kept boarders, thus contributing to the family funds. <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>Certainly it could not be determined,—in view of the testimony that not only the father’s contributions, but those of the whole family, went into the purchase of the property,—that the father should have a decree that the property belonged to him; indeed, the mere fact, if it were the fact, that his money and his alone purchased the property, would not be sufficient to raise a trust in his favor without some proof, and there was none, that he had directed the title should be placed in his name and his confidence that this would be done had been abused.</p>
