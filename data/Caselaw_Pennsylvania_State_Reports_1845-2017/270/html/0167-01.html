In view of the positive testimony of plaintiff that defendant was acting as her agent, and the denial by defendant that he was, [and his assertion] that he was to have the benefit of any advantageous settlement he could make, it seems to us that this clearly raised a question of fact as to what the actual agreement was, viz: whether the plaintiff was to have the benefit of the difference between the face value of the notes and the settlement or whether the defendant was entitled to it.”</p>
