Had a preliminary investigation been made to show the possibility of his appearance, notwithstanding his mental disturbance, it would have revealed, as appeared from the testimony of the superintendent of the hospital, that he was much better, and was at that time in a “state of remission” ; during which period, Dr. Lynch stated, he could give a “perfectly lucid statement.” It is further to be noted that there was admitted in evidence a statement concerning the crime made by Shrope while this trial was in progress. Before receiving the same, in answer to a question of the court, the alienist testified that, though Shrope was insane, he then had “ability to remember and describe what he [had] heard.” If this was true, the witness could not be said to be incompetent; and, if his evidence was desired,—and without it no conviction could have been had,—he should have been produced. Error was committed in the admission of the former testimony without the proof of Shrope’s present <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>incompetency. The fourteenth assignment must, therefore, be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b287-3" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[128,446,1166,1021]]]'>Another complaint appearing upon the record requires consideration. It was the theory of the Commonwealth that the deceased was murdered in the perpetration of a robbery. A description of the occurrence appeared in the testimony of Shrope, who told of the forcible opening of a tin box by Loomis, illustrating at the first trial how it was held by defendant. At this second hearing, the former evidence of Shrope was admitted. A witness was called who detailed how Shrope had held the box, when explaining to the jury on the former occasion the manner in which it was grasped by Loomis. Upon it were several marks, one a finger-print at a point corresponding with the place designated as that at which it was held by Loomis. At the first trial, experts had identified the finger-print as that of the de-. fendant. When the case was called a second time, this position was abandoned, and the Commonwealth offered no evidence in regard to it, admitting that the mark was not that of Loomis.</p>
    <p id="b287-4" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[129,1487,1154,638]]]'>The defendant was then permitted to show that the finger-print was not made by him,. not as furnishing proof of any substantive fact by which to prove or disprove the matter in issue, but solely to impeach the credibility of Shrope. This limitation was emphasized in the charge, and the correctness of the view taken by the learned court is now the subject of question, raised by the second and third assignments of error. The same proposition is suggested in the fourth, based on the answer to the ninth point of the defendant, but this request could not have been affirmed, as binding instructions were asked.</p>

On the other hand, nothing connected with the crime should be excluded <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>from the consideration of the jury whether the tendency is to inculpate or to exonerate the party who is accused. “It may be laid down that in no case is evidence to be excluded of any fact or circumstance connected with the principal transaction from which an inference as to the truth of a disputed fact can reasonably be made”: 8 R. C. L. 180. Special latitude is permitted in the admission of evidence, where the proof upon which the Commonwealth depends is circumstantial: Ward v. The State (Tex.), <a href="/sw/158/1126-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="158 S.W. 1126" data-case-ids="8296358" data-case-paths="/sw/158/1126-01">158 S. W. 1126</a>; Alexander v.

Wigmore (volume 1) on Evidence, section 139), in discussing the principle involved, says: “If the evidence is really of no appreciable value, no harm is done in admitting it; while, if it is in truth calculated to cause the jury to doubt, the court should not attempt to decide for the jury that this doubt is purely speculative and fantastic, but should afford the accused every opportunity to create that doubt. A contrary rule is cruel to a really innocent accused.”</p>

The remoteness of the testimony offered, or its significance in furnishing aid in deciding the fact to be found must, of course, be subject to the control of the court: Com. v. Ryan, <a href="/mass/134/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="134 Mass. 223" data-case-ids="2126627" data-case-paths="/mass/134/0223-01">134 Mass. 223</a>; Alexander v.

So, it is proper for him to put in evidence the clothes worn at the time of a murder, accompanied with the spilling of large amounts of blood, as some proof of the fact that he was not the assassin: People v. Jackson, <a href="/ny-crim/19/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="182 N.Y. 66" data-case-ids="1189869,2323128" data-case-paths="/ny-crim/19/0342-01,/ny/182/0066-01">182 N. Y. 66</a>. Such negative evidence may raise a strong presumption of innocence: 1 Wharton on Criminal Evidence, 869, and cases cited. Likewise, a defendant is entitled to prove facts which do not in themselves establish innocence, but which corrobo<a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>rate the denial of guilt expressed under oath. He has the right to fortify his own testimony by any and all circumstances and facts fairly tending to support him: Chitwood v. United States (C. C. A.), <a href="/f/153/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="153 F. 551" data-case-ids="3920146" data-case-paths="/f/153/0551-01">153 Fed. 551</a>.</p>
    <p id="b289-3" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[117,545,1155,1632]]]'>In the present case, the Commonwealth insisted that the killing was the result of a robbery. The tin box, which had been forcibly opened, was handled by someone, and around the rifling of it the case against the defendant was largely built. It was offered as part of the res gestae at the first trial, and the finger-print found thereon was proven to be that of Loomis; at the second trial it was in evidence, but the Commonwealth admitted that the mark was not that of the defendant. Loomis denied that he had handled the box or committed the robbery, and it was some corroboration of his story to prove that the finger-print was not made by him. This might have little effect upon the jury, in view of the presence of the other blurred marks upon the box, but the defendant was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt it might raise. If weight is to be given finger-print testimony (State v. Kuhl (Nev.), <a href="/nev/42/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="175 P. 190" data-case-ids="8577584" data-case-paths="/nev/42/0185-01">175 Pac. 190</a>; People v. Jennings, <a href="/citations/?q=252%20Ill.%20531" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="252 Ill. 531">252 Ill. 531</a>; People v. Roach, <a href="/citations/?q=215%20N.Y.%20602" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="215 N.Y. 602">215 N. Y. 602</a>), then the jury, in passing upon the guilt of Loomis, would be justified in taking into consideration the fact that someone else handled the . box either at or about the time of the murder. The testimony was not objectionable on the ground of remoteness, and, though possibly not throwing much light upon the guilt or innoence of the defendant, yet, on a trial for his life, he was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt which it might raise in the mind of the jury. It should have been permitted to consider this fact, with all the other evidence in the case, in passing upon the matter at issue. Assignments two and three are, therefore, sustained.</p>
