Such inquiry is permissible, however, in a proceeding like the one at bar, so far as it throws light on the necessity for the condemnation. That is to say, since the organic law and relevant Pennsylvania legislation, defining the franchises of water companies, confers on those concerns only the right to appropriate property necessary to their corporate wants, examination may be made concerning the district a corporation is authorized to serve, at least to the extent that this inquiry is helpful in determining the question of the necessity for appropriating the water in controversy in order to supply such territory, whatever its limits may be; in other words, inquiry may be made under the Act of 1871 to determine whether a particular condemnation is essential to the proper fulfillment of the defendant’s lawful corporate purposes: Raystown W.

    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[287,1270,1153,1079]]]'>Finally, appellants claim that, because defendant “has not shown any action of its board of directors, declaring a necessity” for the present condemnation, it is “without the right to make the appropriation.” In considering this contention, it may be noted that there is nothing in the water company acts similar to the provision found in the Act of March 17, 1869, P. L. 12, as to condemning land for railroad purposes, which specifically refers to the right to take being exercisable “whenever, in the opinion of the board of directors of the railroad company, a condemnation may be necessary for corporate purposes”; but “appropriation” means taking under the power of eminent domain,—not by simple purchase, a right which water companies also possess,—and, in Boalsburg Water Company v. State College Water Co., <a href="/pa/240/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="240 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="993151" data-case-paths="/pa/240/0198-01">240 Pa. 198</a>, 209 (which is the only water company case we find mentioning the subject), this court said: “Of course there must be corporate action, which means the adoption of resolutions to condemn, without which there can be no adverse taking of the property of another.”</p>

    <p id="b279-3" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[117,781,1150,1139]]]'>The present bill does not allege defendant failed to take necessary corporate action before proceeding with its condemnation, and the notes of testimony show that, up to the time of submitting requests for findings, the case was tried on the plan of impliedly conceding the usual prior corporate action and contending that this was not conclusive on the question of the necessity for appropriating plaintiff’s property, but might be met by proofs on the part of the latter that no such necessity in fact existed. In. other words, the case was conducted on the theory, not that defendant had omitted to pass the necessary preliminary resolution of the condemnation (which, it was stated at argument, had in fact been done) or had failed to aver or prove such corporate action, but on the theory that, admitting the existence of proper corporate action, this merely showed a prima facie right to make the appropriation, so far as the question of necessity is concerned, which necessity plaintiffs proposed to disprove; and this, we said in Boalsburg W. Co. v. State College W. Co., supra (p. 212), a plaintiff so situated might do.</p>
