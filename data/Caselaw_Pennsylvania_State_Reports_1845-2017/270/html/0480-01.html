The other nephews and nieces, who also appeal, contend that, so far as the ownership of the principal is concerned, neither the view contended for by the first named appellant nor that adopted by the court below presents a proper construction of the will in question; they argue that the intention of testator was to preserve his interest in the Warren Manufacturing Company intact for twenty years, giving to his nephews and nieces, and the issue of those deceased, the income derived from this business during that period, and, at its end, the capital stock thus held to be divided among only such of his nephews and nieces and issue of those deceased as then survived.</p>

As to the equitable ownership, we agree with the court below that testator intended, on his death, his nephew E. Orton Jennings to become seized of a fee in both the principal and income of the share designated by the will as “falling to” him; the corpus to be transferred, free of the trust, at the end of twenty-years. The expression “falling to,” with its context, we take to mean the same as “given to.”</p>

In this connection, it is of some significance that, in .writing his will, testator physically struck out, after the word “shares,” the words “of income” and inserted in place thereof the phrase “both of principal and income”; thus, on the very face of the document, indicating an intention to state plainly that those receiving the income should take the principal. Therefore, after in this manner using words sufficient to vest an absolute interest in the principal, testator must indicate a fairly clear in<a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>tention to take away the estate previously given before a divesture can be upheld; here no such intention adequately appears.</p>
    <p id="b512-5" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[291,516,1155,752]]]'>It is true testator says, in the part of the will which we have been discussing, that the income shall be divided between.the persons designated by him in equal shares, or “the survivors of them and the issue of any deceased”; but it may be noticed the language is “the issue of any deceased,” and not “any who may die.” We agree with the court below that this means the property shall go to such of the seven persons named as may survive testator, and to the issue of any of them who predeceased him leaving issue. After naming so many persons as legatees, it is fair to assume testator contemplated some of them might die during his lifetime, and that this accounts for the substitutionary provision, as to survivor-ship, issue, etc., to which attention has just been called..</p>
    <p id="b512-6" data-blocks='[["BL_512.5",512,[291,1281,1153,804]]]'>Where like words—“the survivors of them and the issue of any deceased”—occur later on, in connection with the direction to distribute the principal, we agree they are used in the same sense as in the prior part of the will, and do not indicate a desire, on the death of any of the beneficiaries within the twenty years, to divest their interests in favor of issue or, for want thereof, in favor of the survivors of a class; but the language thus employed presents simply a repetition of the designation of those who take vested estates at the death of testator, and a direction to actually divide the corpus among such persons at that time. In other words, the language in question should be read as though followed by the phrase “as previously stated,” or some such expression; for this is the apparent intention of testator.</p>
    <p id="b512-7" data-blocks='[["BL_512.6",512,[292,2096,1150,318]],["BL_513.1",513,[148,349,1155,706]]]'>It must be admitted testator’s purpose is clumsily expressed, but we are not convinced the orphans’ court erred in interpreting his meaning. We have studied the entire will, but, as said by the court below, its other parts shed no helpful light on the item before us; this is true even of the separate trust created for Charles C, <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>Jennings in the item itself. We. need only say, of the many authorities cited to us by counsel, that “precedents are of little value in the construction of wills, because, when used under different circumstances and with different context, the same words may express different intentions. When the intent of the testator, and by that is meant his actual intent, can be fairly gathered from his words, the fact that another testator has used the same words with a different meaning is of no avail. Neither precedents nor rules of construction can override the testator’s expressed intent” (Redding v. Rice, <a href="/pa/171/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="171 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="985560" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0301-01">171 Pa. 301</a>, 306); and this, in the present case, the court below correctly found from the will.</p>
