On December 4, 1918, plaintiff had on deposit, in cash, in the savings department, in the First National Bank of Lansford, Pa., the sum of $1,057.46.” The averment just quoted is followed by two other paragraphs, setting forth a demand by plaintiff for the return of the deposit and defendant’s refusal. In answer, the affidavit of defense reads: “3. Denied: defendant averring that the only deposit which plaintiff had on December 4,1918, in defendant’s bank, was one of $120.59, which was increased to $180.59 by deposit made by plaintiff on December 7, 1918, and to $184.34 by an interest item entered to plaintiff’s credit on January 1, 1919, which total deposit of $184.34 was withdrawn by plaintiff from defendant’s bank on January 18, 1919, leaving no further deposit there to plaintiff’s credit”; this averment is followed by admissions of the demand and refusal alleged in the statement of claim.</p>

Bomberger, <a href="/pa/262/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="262 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="1044355" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0043-01">262 Pa. 43</a>, 46); but it did not do so. On the contrary, as just shown, immediately after the word “denied,” the affidavit of defense enters into a detailed explanation, effectually controverting plaintiff’s allegation that he had on deposit with defendant, on the date in question, the sum claimed in the third paragraph of his declaration, and defendant therein further avers that, at time of suit, it had no cash on deposit to credit of plaintiff. So far as the alleged deposit now under discussion is concerned, we entirely agree with the court below that the affidavit of defense is sufficient.</p>

The filing of the affidavit constituted no waiver of defendant’s right subsequently to rely upon the inadequacy of plaintiff’s averments, when the latter asked for judgment on the pleadings. In Federal S. Co. v. Farrell, <a href="/pa/264/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="264 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="1048583" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0149-01">264 Pa. 149</a>, we held the filing of a reply by plaintiff to a counterclaim of defendant did not waive the former’s right, upon a motion for judgment on the pleadings, to question the sufficiency of the averments of the counterclaim; and defendant in the present case, so far as the proposition in hand is concerned, is in the same relative position as the plaintiff in the authority under discussion. All of this brings us to the conclusion that, if no affidavit of defense <em>to </em>the averments of the statement of claim which deal with the alleged deposits of stocks and securities was required, then defects in the answering averments are <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>immaterial; and, as before said, so far as the parts in question are concerned, plaintiff’s declaration calls for no pleaded reply.</p>

Other insufficiencies in the manner of stating defenses might be pointed out; but, as previously ruled, and as we shall proceed to show, plaintiff’s declaration on the items in question calls for no affidavit of defense, and, even were this otherwise, the <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>statement, as drawn, is not adequate to support a judgment, as far as these items are concerned.</p>

McLean, <a href="/citations/?q=267%20Pa.%20558" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="267 Pa. 558">267 Pa. 558</a>, 557; Wilson v. Adams Ex.

Moreover, there is nothing in the Act of 1915 authorizing judgment by default for want of an affidavit of defense in an action of tort (see, on this point, Wilson v. Adams Ex. Co., supra, at bottom of page 387, <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>and opinion by Judge Henderson in Smith v.

Superior Ct. 210</a>; also section 18 of the Practice Act), and, if there.were, plaintiff’s declaration would be insufficient to support the entry of such a judgment, because, with a possible single exception, there is no proper averment of the value of. the stocks and bonds alleged to be wrongfully withheld, or of the date when the supposed conversion occurred The face value is the only one given, neither the actual nor market value appearing; and, as to the dates of the alleged demands and refusals, no particulars are furnished. In the single instance where market value is mentioned there is no allegation that the stocks in question were deposited by, or held for, plaintiff, the only statement in this regard being that defendant had such stocks “in its custody.” The damages claimed are not sufficiently liquidated to give the court a proper basis upon which to enter judgment; and, in the absence of the material averments to which we have called attention, plaintiff is not entitled to judgment.</p>

    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[136,1814,1148,539]]]'>This appeal involves some nice points of practice; therefore, we have gone into the several questions, which present themselves, more at length than is usual in affirming an order such as the one now before us. That part of plaintiff’s claim which falls strictly within the category of assumpsit was sufficiently met by the affidavit of defense, and the remaining parts of the claim, sounding in tort, demand no pleaded reply; for these reasons, which we have elaborated in this opinion, the court below did not err in refusing judgment.</p>
