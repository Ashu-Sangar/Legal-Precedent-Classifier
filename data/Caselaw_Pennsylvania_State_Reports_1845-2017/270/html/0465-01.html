When the court issuing the process has determined it has not been contemned, the appellate courts cannot decide otherwise. We said in Commonwealth v. Shecter; <a href="/pa/250/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="250 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="1016954" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0282-01">250 Pa. 282</a>, “It is settled law that each court is the exclusive judge of con-tempts committed against its process......As early as 1791 this rule was recognized by this court in the case of Penn v.

Without it they would be utterly powerless. The authority to deal with an offender of this class, belongs exclusively to the court in which the offense is committed ; and no other court, not even the highest, can interfere with its exercise.’ ”</p>
