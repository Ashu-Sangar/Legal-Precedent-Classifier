H. McCloskey, Jr., Inc., succeeded to the business of McCloskey &amp; Bahls; that McCloskey &amp; Bahls had assigned to the North Penn Bank, as collateral for their indebtedness, all their right, title and interest in the money they were to receive from the United States Government on a contract at League Island Navy Yard, and they also had <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>pledged, in the manner described in the answer, as additional security, all their equipment and real estate; that M.

Mc-Closkey, Jr., Inc., and that he promised, on behalf of the corporation, to pay all of the obligations of the former firm of McCloskey &amp; Bahls, and, on account of such obligations, the said corporation had paid in point of fact the sum of approximately $20,000. The Phoenix Trust Company, therefore, asserts a set-off against the present dividend, and, further, avers that it has brought suit in Court of Common Pleas No. <em>A </em>against McCloskey &amp; Bahls for the collection of its claim, which amounts to nearly $300,000.</p>

It is not suggested anywhere in the answer that the bank had ever charged against the deposit account of the corporation any sums or overdrafts or loans due by McCloskey &amp; Bahls. The new corporation was regarded as any other depositor and presumably its drafts were honored as such. There is no assertion that the bank held any obligation of the corporation, neither is there any averment that, by any corporate action, the debt or obligation of the old partnership had been assumed by the new corporation. No verbal arrangement, understanding or promise by McCloskey individually, even if it be that he is a majority stockholder, could in anywise obligate the corporation to pay the debts of the copartnership. To assert that the corporation took over, or succeeded to, the business of the former copartnership is without significance. In the absence of fraud, for one to purchase property or equipment of a partnership or an individual does not in anywise bind the vendee to pay <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>outstanding debts, excepting such as might have legal lien against the property so purchased.</p>

If personal property in the way of equipment passed into the hands of the receiver, which belonged to the North Penn Bank, or against which it had a lien, an appropriate remedy lies for its recovery, if it can be found and identified. There is nothing in the facts as we view them which would justify us in holding the North Penn Bank to be a preferred creditor against the estate of the corporation. If the bank, or the trust company which succeeded it, has a claim which it can assert against the corporation that claim should be asserted upon the settlement of the accounts of the receiver.</p>
