    <p class="summary" id="b38-9" data-blocks='[["BL_38.15",38,[334,1594,898,43]]]'>Bechtel, P. J., filed the following opinion:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-10" data-blocks='[["BL_38.16",38,[287,1648,1150,588]]]'>It will be noted that this case was decided prior to the passage of the Act of 1919 amending'the Compensation Law of 1915. The claimant was injured in attempting to reach his place of work on the morning in question while traversing a private road leading into the workings of the defendant company, which said private road was used by the defendant company for the purpose of transporting materials to and from the colliery, by the public in hauling coal therefrom and by the workmen in going to and from the colliery. This has been the case for many years.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b39-2" data-blocks='[["BL_39.4",39,[103,590,1154,265]]]'>The sixth finding of fact is as follows: “The injury sustained by the claimant was by accident in the course of his employment and was caused by the condition of the defendant’s premises, the claimant’s presence thereon being required by the nature of his employment.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b39-3" data-blocks='[["BL_39.5",39,[104,863,1155,430]]]'>If these findings of fact are correct, the conclusions of law reached by the board naturally followed. It is not our province to disturb them. We have considered carefully the opinion of the referee and .the opinion of the board in support of its findings. This opinion has carefully considered the case and its conclusions are amply supported by authorities cited therein. We do not feel that we could profitably add anything thereto.</p>
