Appellant contends the taking of an exception is sufficient, since such action makes the point and answer a part of the record for purposes of error without the request to file, as required <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>in the case of the charge generally.

    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[268,499,1150,1351]]]'>It directs that written requests shall be presented, and, when answered, shall be filed and become part of the record of the case for the purposes of error. In considering the effect of this provision regard must be had to its purpose. The Act of February 24, 1806, P. L. 334, furnished a way by which the portion of a charge complained of could be gotten upon the record; and the Act of April 15, 1856, P. L. 337, directed that it, should be filed, upon request, in its entirety. Neither statute made provision for the points and answers. So that these instructions might be considered in the same way, the Act of March 24, 1877, was passed. Thus the entire statement of law presented to the jury was preserved for the purposes of review; but there was no intention to distinguish between the charge and the points. The title of the act shows both to have been referred to, and the second section provides, as does the first, that when “the charge and answers of the court to points” are filed, they shall be part of the record for the purpose of assigning the error. They are placed by this legislation on an equality, and no change has been made by the subsequent acts providing for the transcription of notes of testimony (Act May 24,1887, P. L. 199), and for the taking of exceptions in all cases (Act May 11, 1911, P. L. 279, section 2).'</p>

There is no reason why a different rule should apply as to the points and answers. They are in effect one and the same. “A charge includes any and all final instructions addressed by the court to the jury for the purpose of governing their action in making or aiding to make a final disposition of the case in favor of one litigant or <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>the other”: 11 C.
