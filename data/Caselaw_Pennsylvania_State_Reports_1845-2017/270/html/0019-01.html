Counsel for appellant, who presented his case fairly and ably, concedes the issues involved were for the jury, and complains of but one trial error—that the court in its charge said, “If this plaintiff did get off this car before the car came to a full stop, then you would be <em>justified </em>in finding her guilty of contributory negligence”; whereas, he contends, the court, to give expression properly to the rule of law which badges it as negligence per se to get off a moving car, should have instructed the jury that, if plaintiff did get off the car before it came to a full stop, they “must” find her guilty of contributory negligence. All must agree with the proposition that to get off a moving car is negligence per se, and concede that the excerpt quoted from the charge was an inadequate presentation of the rule to the jury; but we cannot subscribe to the conclusion that it was such a fundamentally erroneous statement of law as requires "a reversal of the case.</p>

It was counsel’s duty, if the part of the charge now assigned as .error was deemed inadequate, to have then called the court’s attention to the matter of complaint, in order that it might have been amplified, or put in more imperative form. It is manifest, from a reading of the entire charge, that the court had no intention to pare down the rule of plaintiff’s duty not to alight from a moving car, or to minimize the result to her if she violated such rule; furthermore, we are convinced the jury understood what their duty was, and were not misled by the inexactitude of expression now assigned for error.
