    <p id="b461-3" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[101,1009,1153,479]]]'>The appellant contends that the lessees must pay for the portion of the minimum one hundred thousand tons, not mined and taken out in any year, the royalty rate for that year, and later, when the coal is actually removed, must make a second payment for the same coal, if the royalty rate for the year when the coal is actually mined is higher than it was in the year when the one hundred thousand tons minimum was paid for at the then royalty rate.</p>
    <p id="b461-4" data-blocks='[["BL_461.5",461,[99,1500,1155,916]],["BL_462.1",462,[315,354,1153,970]]]'>The touchstone to apply to the solution of the problem we are called upon to consider, is the legal principle heretofore mentioned; under it, the coal was sold to the lessees and it became their property when they or their assignee paid for it, just as absolutely as would the surface had it been the subject of the grant. Carrying in mind the principle of sale of the coal in place, the lease by its terms clearly and unequivocally provides what royalty shall be paid as the coal is acquired from time to time. It was covenanted that the lessees should pay for a minimum of one hundred thousand tons a year; as the transaction was a sale, when this minimum was paid for, title to that amount of coal vested in the lessees, and necessarily at the price paid for it, which was fixed at either twenty-five cents per ton, or by the price of coal at the time, but at whatever rate the royalty was paid, when paid, the number of tons then paid for belonged to <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>the lessees. If the lessees should pay in any year for more coal than they mined, the payment at the minimum rate, or at a higher rate, if the increased selling price put up the royalty, vested the coal so paid for in them, and no further royalty payments were due upon it; being their coal, lessees would have the right “to mine it and take it away.” As it was defendant’s coal, because paid fox’, the phrase “they shall have the right to mine and take away a quantity equal to such excess of payment” necessax’ily means a quantity equal to the amount purchased by them by the payment of the royalty due at the time it was paid, and without any further payment. That this was the clear intent of the parties is shown by a further clause in the contract, where, recapitulating the effect of the provisions in the lease as to payment, they say, “the purpose and intention of this provision being to allow the said lessees to mine and take out <em>all the coal they have paid for under this lease ”</em>

If the royalty to be paid had not been fixed, the number of tons paid for could not be arrived at in advance of the mining, because the price could not be determined until then, so that this clause would become unworkable if appellant’s construction of the contract should be adopted.</p>
    <p id="AaGz" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[82,926,1160,1027]]]'>.Appellant’s further proposition- is, that the parties have established the meaning of the contract on the basis he now contends for by their course of conduct in certain years of the mining. The learned court below disposed of this contention by its finding that “the conduct in this case did not amount to external construction, in fact it amounted to no more than the unauthorized obiter dictum of the [defendant’s] bookkeeper, disclosed by pure surplusage in statements otherwise' contractually complete and not made practical at any time by incorporation in any settlement.” Our examination of the testimony convinces us that this correctly disposes of appellant’s second contention; however, it is only when a writing is equivocal or obscure that the court may interpret it in accordance with the conduct of the parties (Millard v. Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western R. R.
