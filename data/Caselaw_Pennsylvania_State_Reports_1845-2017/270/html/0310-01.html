Separate accounts were filed of each fund; accountant, in its petitions for distribution, asked the court to declare that each trust continued as to all the parties then living; without discussing the matter in his adjudication, the auditing judge so held; no exceptions were filed to this ruling, and the adjudication was, therefore, confirmed absolutely, on December 19, 1917. On April 1, 1920, within the five years prescribed by section 48 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1917, P. L. 447, 514,- a petition of review was filed, petitioners alleging that, in the adjudication, the will was mistakenly construed, that its proper interpretation would give them their share of the estate absolutely, and that, for reasons specified, they did not appear at the audit and then make claim for it. Some of the respondents, in their answers, admitted the facts set forth in the petition, and consented to the prayer thereof; the others, including accountant, averred the will was properly construed, and for this reason only alleged the petition should be dismissed. Subsequently, the facts averred therein were expressly admitted; the case was heard upon the pleadings; the court below decreed the petition should be dismissed; and this appeal was then taken by D.

Wharton Smith. Appellee makes the same argument as to the words italicized above, as it does regarding the same language in the twelfth article, and this fails for the same reason we gave there. The conclusion stated convicts the court below of error in not awarding this share also to appellant and his brothers and sister absolutely, unless the latter paragraphs of this article affect the matter; it will now be shown they do not.</p>

Provided however and it is my mind and will that during the minorities of any persons who under the aforesaid trusts may become entitled to a share of my residuary estate only the interest and income of such share shall be paid to such persons during their respective minorities. And provided fur<a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>ther that if said trustee shall deem it best so to do instead of paying the interest and income of my residuary estate unto my children and unto their issue as herein-before provided for, they may pay and apply the same to and for their proper support maintenance and education.”</p>
    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.4",344,[261,664,1153,1285]]]'>This paragraph applies only to “shares happening in the division of my residuary estate after the decease of my wife [not also after the decease of her daughters or their issue] unto grandchildren or remoter descendants of mine,” that is, to issue of testator’s children who predeceased him, as provided in the last clause of the 2d paragraph above quoted; and hence has no applicability here, since Virginia survived her father, and the share of herself and her descendants pass under the first clause of the 2d paragraph, which the 3d paragraph, above quoted, continues and finally ends so far as concerns the trust for the parties therein specified; just as the 4th paragraph continues and finally ends the trust specified in the last clause of the 2d paragraph. Appellee’s contention at this point is that the words “after the decease of my wife,” italicized above, refer to any period of time however remote, whereas they clearly refer to and have the same meaning as “from and immediately after the decease of my wife,” specified in the 2d paragraph. This also the context compels; for, as pointed out above, paragraph 2 covers two cases, paragraph 3 continues and ends the trust set forth in the first thereof, and paragraph 4 continues and ends the trust set forth in the second thereof.</p>

It is .clear, .therefore, the court below <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>erred in holding the trust continued as to appellant’s share of the residuary estate of testator.</p>

This, though referred to, was not decided in the opinion below; and we are not required to answer it at length, since, upon this ground, the right to a review was not questioned in the pleadings, and hence should not be considered: Luther v. Luther, <a href="/pa/216/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="216 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="950354" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0001-01">216 Pa. 1</a>. It may be well to point out, however, that section 48 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1917, P. L. 447, 514, under which this proceeding was had, provides that “Within five years after the final decree confirming the original or supplementary account of any fiduciary, which has been or may be hereafter passed upon, petition of review being presented by such fiduciary or his legal representatives, or by any person interested therein, alleging errors in such account, or in any adjudication of the orphans’ court, or any report of an auditor of such account, which errors shall be specifically set forth in said petition of review, said petition and errors being verified -by oath or affirmation, the orphans’ court <em>shall </em>grant a rehearing of so much of said account, adjudication, or auditor’s report as is alleged to be error in said petition of review, and give such relief as equity and justice may require, by reference to auditors, or otherwise, with like right of appeal to the proper appellate •court as in other cases: Provided, that this act shall not extend to any cause when the balance found due shall have been actually paid and discharged by any fiduciary” ; and that this is an advance on section 1 of the Act of October 13,1840 (P. L. 1841, page 1), since it requires a review to be granted if any error is made by the adjudication, as it has been here. The Act of 1840 has no such provision, and the decisions quoted against the review arose under it.</p>

As we have construed testator’s will, an error of law appears in the adjudication, and, under such circumstances, the act says the court <em>“shall </em>grant a rehearing” thus making the review a matter of right (Bailey’s Est., <a href="/pa/208/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="208 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="998169" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0594-01">208 Pa. 594</a>), unless distribution has been made. In the stress of war times, during 1917, when these accounts were filed, adjudicated and confirmed, appellant and his brothers were admittedly engaged or about to be engaged in the duty of helping their country in its time of need; and hence, under such circumstances, the court could, entirely aside from the act, have wisely exercised the inherent power which it possesses, and granted the review (Sloan’s Est., <a href="/pa/254/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="254 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="1025467" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0346-01">254 Pa. 346</a>), since, under the admitted facts, no one could possibly have suffered by its so doing.</p>
