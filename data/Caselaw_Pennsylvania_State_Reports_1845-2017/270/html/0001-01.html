Thus they arrived at the conclusion that “die without issue” described a succession of issue, or “heirs of the body,” of the first taker, to the extinction thereof, or what is known as an “indefinite failure of issue,” and that, therefore, such first taker possessed an estate tail, which cut out the remainder.</p>

When a case naturally falls within that rule, it applies with all its attributes (Pattin v. Scott, <a href="/pa/270/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="270 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="1066044" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0049-01">270 Pa. 49</a>), but, as pointed out at page 4, supra,] the intention of the testator to indicate a line of inher-j itance from the devisee must be found in each case before the rule is applied; and, in ascertaining this intention,, where the word “issue” is used, the Act of 1897, as con- ' strued by this court, when it controls, sweeps away much old law and gives a plain guide for the future.</p>
    <p id="b33-5" data-blocks='[["BL_33.4",33,[119,1712,1155,589]]]'>The Act of 1897 does not provide simply an additional canon of construction, but, as we have seen, it changes an obsolete guide, substituting therefpr one which is im tended to, and, as against the old rüie, unquestionably will, assist in ascertaining the actual meaning of testators; this, representing, most fortunately, the modern tendency of the law,—to find and enforce the “actual intent” in each case,—should be taken advantage of and given the broadest opportunity for success by the judiciary : Lewis v.

We may add that, even without regard to the Act of 1897, a strong argument could be made to show the present testatrix contemplated providing for only such issue as might be living at the death of her daughter; which, of course, would be equally fatal to the contention that she intended to create an estate in tail: Lessee of Findlay v.
