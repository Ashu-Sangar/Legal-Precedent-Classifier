The right here involved, and the voting franchise, are the only means by which peaceful changes in our laws and institutions may be sought or brought about, and they cannot, with safety to the State, or the whole body of the people, be gathered into the hands of the few for any purpose whatsoever; therefore, on principle, the law will not sanction their delegation. We may add that a temporary giving up or denial of an inalienable right such as the one in hand is as void as though permanent in character; that portion of Buie 23 hereinbefore quoted, as construed by defendants,—denying plaintiff the right to petition the legislature,—has no binding force; hence Spayd was improperly expelled for a violation thereof.
