    <p id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.9",521,[162,816,1159,812]]]'>On September 5, 1906, the requisite number of citizens presented their petition to thé Court of Quarter Sessions of Cambria County, under the Act of May 8, 1876, P. L. 131, praying that a toll bridge belonging to appellee might be condemned, taken as a county bridge and freed of tolls. The matter was 'so proceeded with, in the quarter sessions, that a decree was entered, declaring the bridge a county bridge and that the taking of tolls, thereon should cease. No exceptions were filed on the county’s behalf, but the bridge company appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the decree of the quarter sessions (Moxham and Ferndale Bridge, <a href="/pa-super/36/0298-02" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="36 Pa.

    <p id="b521-7" data-blocks='[["BL_521.10",521,[164,1638,1157,593]]]'>No tolls were collected by the bridge company after June 1,1908. On its petition, the venue of the case was changed to Blair County, where, on October 20, 1919, more than eleven years after it had been denied the right to receive revenue from the bridge by the decree of the quarter sessions of Cambria County, a verdict was found in its favor fixing the amount of compensation for the taMng of its property. The County of Cambria filed a motion for judgment in its behalf notwithstanding the verdict, which was refused by the trial court, and from this action it has appealed.</p>

These positions, relied upon at the trial of the case, in effect asked the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County to set aside a decree of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Cambria County; a rather startling proposition under our judicial system. The latter court, by decree, in a proceeding in which no exceptions were filed by the county, had declared the bridge to be just what the appellant asked the former tribunal to adjudge it not to be; there would be an end of orderly judicial procedure if such results as appellant seeks could be brought about.</p>
