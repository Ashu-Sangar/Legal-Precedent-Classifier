It could not take private property until adequate compensation had been paid or secured, and the security required was a bond in the sum of $150,-000 with sureties to be approved by the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County to be filed before the company could proceed to erect its dam. These preliminary steps were taken and the company erected its dam prior to 1871. The Citizens Company, plaintiff, appellants here, some time afterward acquired land along the north bank of the river, part of which is immediately above and west of the dam, and, because of such ownership, claims riparian rights, including the right to take from the dam quantities of water necessary to enable it to operate its engines, boilers or plant. Such water was taken by means of pipes laid into the dam, around which the company had driven piles and placed timbers to protect the intake from ice, rubbish and other matters. This pipe has been used and maintained for ten years or more. It insists on the natural flow and impoundage of the water being maintained in and around its pipes as they were placed in the dam, and this demand becomes more urgent during periods of drought, as diversion or interference with the supply for any purpose injures the operation of its works.</p>

This gate or opening was constructed before plaintiff had acquired title to the land, and it so happens that its in<a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>take is above and close to the gate, and when it is opened the water, rushing out from the dam, creates a suction at the intake, causing an accumulation of rubbish, sticks and grass around the pipe, thus interfering with plaintiff’s use of the water for manufacturing purposes. Defendant removed the piles and timber protection and by force prevented others from being replaced; the dam was dredged close to the intake and the course of the so-called channel changed by defendant. Plaintiff, to prevent further damage, filed this bill against the boom company and the Lycoming Edison Electric Co. to restrain the use of the water in the dam- for any purpose other than the operation of the boom, to prohibit the use by the electric company, as indicated, and its interference therewith by plaintiff and with the protections placed about its pipe.

And, had the title passed by amicable adjustment for the purpose of the present litigation, the boom company’s right would not be different in kind from that obtained by condemnation. Such title possesses the same attributes as are ordinarily implied in the acquisition of property by a company having the right of eminent domain. This has been variously defined, and in this State it may be said generally to be an exclusive easement, closely akin to a fee, sometimes termed a base, conditional or quali<a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>fled fee, with the right of reverter to the original owner, his heirs or assigns, in case of abandonment. The condemnor has the free and exclusive enjoyment and use of the land taken for a public purpose as though it was owned in fee, and, even though immediate or continuous use may not be made of it, neither title nor possession will revert to the original owner unless there is an actual abandonment. “It is a right to exclusive possession, to fence in, to build over the whole surface, to raise and maintain any appropriate superstructure, including necessary foundations, and to deal with it......as absolutely and as uncontrolled as an oymer in fee. There was no such easement at common law, and it may well be doubted if it is not a misnomer to extend to this newly-invented interest in land the name of easement.

The plaintiff, as owner of the land adjoining that taken by the company for the purpose of constructing its reser<a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>voir, is in no proper sense of the term a riparian owner”: Finn v. Providence Gas and Water Co., <a href="/pa/99/0631-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="99 Pa. 631" data-case-ids="446177" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0631-01">99 Pa. 631</a>, 640. As this is a navigable stream, whatever may be the rights of the public generally to the use of the water as it passes through the dam or above or below the dam, the rights appertaining to the land owned by plaintiff would rise no higher under this act than that adjudged as incident to land along a nonnavigable stream; that is, the boom company had the exclusive right to possession of the land and water. It could have fenced or enclosed the pond or reservoir and thus prevented plaintiff from placing its pipe, piles and timbers over its land. While the boom company did not acquire title to the water, it did enjoy a certain use of it, and while it remained in the dam its use as to adjoining land owners was exclusive. The boom company’s right is not to be restricted solely to the right to collect water in a basin and store it until called upon for corporate uses, with a joint right in an adjoining owner to use the land along the dam and the water in it for such purposes not then actually depriving the company of the use of the water, as, for instance, the erection of a boathouse along the dam, building wharves in it, boating on the surface and the right to cut ice, or the building of water pipes or projections into the dam: Reading City v. Davis, <a href="/pa/153/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="153 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="840344" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0360-01">supra.</a> To so hold would not only curtail the estate secured, but it might so weaken the right or power of eminent domain as to cause it to be of no practical effect or use. The enabling act gave rights to the boom company relatively as high as those given to water companies: Finn v. Gas and Water Co., supra.</p>

Assuming that it had riparian rights, it does not follow that it included the use of water in the quantity and for the purpose claimed. “In a long, unbroken line of cases it has been held that the diversion of water from its natural course in a stream by a riparian owner for purposes other than those incident to the proper enjoyment of the riparian land is unlawful.
