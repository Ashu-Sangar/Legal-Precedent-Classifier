It divided the balance into six parts, instead of five, which it is now insisted was error. An appeal was taken by five persons jointly,—subsequently, a judgment of non pros was entered as to all but one. The disputed part of the adjudication amounted to $3,800, and the interest of each of the distributees complaining here is less than $800. Under such circumstances, the questions raised should be disposed of by the Superior Court, and to it the appeal must be remitted.</p>
    <p id="b401-12" data-blocks='[["BL_401.16",401,[119,1845,1154,535]],["BL_402.1",402,[290,351,1151,96]]]'>The Superior Court Act (June 24, 1895, P. L. 212) fixed the amount in controversy for jurisdictional purposes at $1,000, and provided a way of determining the sum involved in certain cases. Subsequently, $1,500 was named as the standard by which the tribunal to review was decided (Act May 5,1899, P. L. 248). By this legislation, certain rules were laid down to ascertain the jurisdictional amount. The attempt was made by section 4 to cover all situations which might arise, but the wording used was not sufficiently broad; and, as a re-<a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>suit, doubts, have arisen in particular cases as to the proper court to which the appeal should be taken.</p>
    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[284,459,1157,580]]]'>The section referred to provided the manner of determining the amount in controversy in actions of ejectment, and issues, in the common pleas or orphans’ court, involving the right to possession or title to property. In such cases, the certificate of the trial judge conclusively settles the question. Where the claim is for damages based on tort or breach of contract in any suit or distribution in either orphans’ or common pleas court, the amount of the judgment, decree or award is used as the standard; and if no sum is recovered, then the amount claimed controls.</p>
    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[278,1059,1159,1028]]]'>It is apparent that these rules will not meet all orphans’ court proceedings which become the subject of appeal— the present case is an illustration. Other portions of the act must then be used as a guide. Section 2 gives to the Superior Court jurisdiction where less than ’$1,500 is involved where “any single claim, any dispute, distribution, or other proceeding in the orphans’ court,...... if......the amount or value thereof really in controyersy in such single claim, dispute or other proceeding be not greater than fifteen hundred dollars.” It is to be noticed that the amount of the single claim in a distribution controls, and not the total sum of the distribution, in determining the question of jurisdiction. If it be kept in mind that section 4 regulates only certain specified cases, and that those not within its express terms are to be governed by other provisions of the same act, the seeming conflict in some of the decisions can be readily explained. To prevent further misunderstandings, certain observations may profitably be made.</p>
