No fraudulent conduct was averred or proven, nor was it shown there were any stockholders whose rights were affected adversely, or who objected to the repurchase. The corporation was a purely private one, and, as there was no fraud shown, there was nothing to prohibit the corporation from buying back its stock thus sold.</p>

The ninety-day provision was not a bar to plaintiff’s right to recover. It was not so considered in the affidavit of defense nor in the testimony. When, on May 15th, the company was notified of the intention to exercise the option, no complaint was made as to time, and later the president of the company agreed with the attorney representing plaintiff to pay the amount of the subscription. Defendant depended on an assignment of the stock to be relieved from liability, but plaintiff produced the stock and is not to be prejudiced by any intermediate assignment.
