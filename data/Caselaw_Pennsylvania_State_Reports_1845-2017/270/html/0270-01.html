S. L. I. &amp; T. Co. v. Brown, the preceding case). There, a nephew was named as the insured, though the policy was issued at the request and for the benefit of Brown; here, the risk was upon the life of Thomas Howes, and the application for the insurance, the bond and mortgage executed by Brown, as well as the agreement referred to, designate him as “manager of storage house.” That his employment in this capacity was by Brown is not specifically set forth, though doubtless such was the fact. It is insisted that the description indicates an insurable interest in his life which differentiates the case from the one referred to.</p>
