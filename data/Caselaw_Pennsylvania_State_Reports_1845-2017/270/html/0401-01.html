In the fall of 1916 the city of Scranton entered into a contract with the defendant for the pavement of the cartway in Wyoming Avenue between Larch and Marion streets. The^ work included the usual cutting, filling, levelling, rolling, etc., during which vehicular traffic was excluded therefrom by barriers at street intersections. There was, however, no precautions taken to prevent lateral entrance thereon by pedestrians. The avenue was of the width of fifty feet, from curb to curb, which included a ten-foot wide parkway in the center. Before laying <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>the pavement, it was necessary for defendant to dig a trench, near the center of the avenue and extending parallel therewith ten feet, of the width of two feet and to the depth of five feet. This was done on November 9th of that year, while plaintiff, who resided on the second floor of a house abutting upon the avenue opposite the trench, was temporarily absent from home. Before daylight the next morning, John Murray, a miner, while walking diagonally across the avenue, as a short cut to his work, was seriously hurt by falling into this trench, of which he had no prior knowledge, although he was in the habit of crossing the avenue at this point and knew work was being done thereon. Murray, who was disabled by the fall, groaned aloud with pain and called for help, which plaintiff heard and hastened to his assistance. She walked rapidly down stairs and out to the center of the street where she found Murray and, in an effort to assist him, was injured by falling into the trench, of the existence of which she had no knowledge and which she failed to see because of darkness, it being unguarded by light or barrier. Defendant’s contract with the city imposed upon him the duty of properly guarding the street during the performance of the work, which had then progressed until the surface was prepared for the pavement. We have outlined the facts as plaintiff’s evidence tends to establish them. The trial judge granted a nonsuit, and his order discharging the rule to take off the same forms the basis of this appeal by plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[303,1915,1147,482]],["BL_431.1",431,[92,346,1160,1961]]]'>In our opinion the rule to take off the nonsuit should have been made absolute. While it is not necessary in every case to guard the sides of a cartway closed to traffic, it is necessary to take such precautions as will reasonably safeguard the public; whether they have been taken in a particular case depends upon local conditions and is generally a question for the jury. Defendant, who stood in the place of the city, was bound to take reasonable precautions, consisting primarily in <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>excluding vehicular traffic by placing barriers at street intersections, which was done; but whether the trench in question required an additional guard to protect pedestrians, who might lawfully come upon the street from abutting property, depended upon the circumstances and was for the jury. This question is comprehensively treated in a note to Elam v. City of Mt. Sterling (Ky.), <a href="/citations/?q=20%20L.R.A.N.S.%20513" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="20 L.R.A.N.S. 513">20 L. R. A. (N. S.) 513</a>, where it is stated (p. 675), “It has been held that a municipal corporation does not in all cases fulfil the duty incumbent on it by law by merely placing [a] barrier across a street which is obstructed, to protect travelers from injury, without adopting any measures to guard against accidents to those who may have occasion lawfully tó come on the dangerous portion of the way from private lands adjoining and lying within the limits, which are closed against travelers approaching in other directions: Burn-ham v. Boston, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Allen%20293" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="10 Allen 293">10 Allen 293</a>. Whether a place in or near a street where an injury occurred required a guard or barrier for the protection of travelers, and whether the municipal corporation was guilty of actual negligence in not constructing such guard or barrier, are questions for the jury in an action against the corporation for an injury resulting from an obstruction or defect in the street.” This is so because the duty is not fixed but shifts according to the circumstances. Necessity for guards is generally a question for the jury (6 McQuillin on Mun. Corp. p. 5705) and whether what was done in a particular case, in an attempt to guard a dangerous place, was sufficient is also generally a question for the jury. However, where the protection of a trench in a street is clearly insufficient it may be so declared as a matter of law. Eor example, in Crowther v. City of Yonkers, <a href="/ny-st-rep/39/0748-02" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="39 N.Y. St. Rep. 748" data-case-ids="2061932,2062034" data-case-paths="/ny-st-rep/39/0748-02,/ny-st-rep/39/0748-01">39 N. Y. St. R. 748</a>, defendant was declared negligent because its only guard of a sewer trench was a light at one end.</p>

His right to go upon the street, when so closed, can neither be broadly affirmed nor wholly denied as a matter of law; for it turns upon the nature of the repairs, the progress of the work, his knowledge or notice of conditions, his reason for using the street, whether there by design or accident and all the circumstances. The fact that a street is in preparation for a pavement, is not notice that' a deep trench has been made therein: see Hall v. Town of Mason (Iowa), <a href="/citations/?q=34%20L.R.A.%20207" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="34 L.R.A. 207">34 L. R. A. 207</a>.</p>

It doubtless might be so held had she gone there in the dark without a substantial reason; but she went to relieve serious distress or possibly to save life. Under such circumstances she will not be held guilty, of contributory negligence unless her act was so rash that an ordinarily prudent person would not have undertaken it (Corbin v. Phila., <a href="/pa/195/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="195 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="914045" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0461-01">195 Pa. 461</a>; Toner v. Penna. R. R.
