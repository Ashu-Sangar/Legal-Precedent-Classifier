The relation of a mine foreman to the mine operator as fixed by the Act of June 2, 1891, P. L. 176, and as defined in Durkin v.

L. 712. The Act of 1891 provided that it should not be lawful for any person to act as mine foreman unless registered as a holder of a certificate of qualification or service under the act, but the amendment adds this provision “unless, in the judgment of the employer, he is a person possessed of qualifications which make him equally competent to act in such position.” The amending act further provides that the owner “shall have supervision, direction and control of the mine foreman,” and that the mine foreman shall be the agent of the operator. Recurring to the contract, we ascertain that it provides, the mine foreman shall have control of the work, and the contractor and all his employees shall be subject to his orders and directions. It will thus be seen, that the contract specifically provides for the control of the means of performance by the mine foreman, that the manner of doing the work shall be to the satisfaction of the manager, that the defendant shall have the right to suspend or terminate the work without notice to the contractor, with the right to remove from the work any workmen, who in the opinion of its manager are incompetent, careless or for any other reason unsatisfactory, and that the interpretation of the contract with reference to the work shall be by the manager, whose decision shall be conclusive. It is therefore manifest that, through the manager and mine foreman, full control'over the means and manner of performance was reserved to defendant, and there was left in the contractor no independence whatever in manner and means of performance. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that the relation of the deceased to the defendant was that of employee, and not independent contractor; in so holding and awarding; compensation to his widow, the court below was right.</p>
