        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Frazer,\nPlaintiffs, husband and wife, sued to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by Martha Hope, the wife, and for loss of a horse and damages to a wagon, the property of James Hope, the husband, the result of a collision between defendant\u2019s car and plaintiffs\u2019 wagon, plaintiffs alleging negligence on the part of the motorman operating defendant\u2019s car. The jury rendered verdicts in favor of plaintiffs, and defendant appealed.\nMrs. Hope, one of the plaintiffs, was driving on a public highway a one-horse covered Dearborn wagon having two small glass inserts in the rear curtain for observing approaching vehicles from behind. Defendant\u2019s railway tracks paralleled the highway on her right. Mrs. Hope testified that, on noticing a wagon and automobile approaching from the opposite direction, she looked back through the glass inserts, and, not seeing a car in sight, drove toward and close to the car tracks of defendant and had proceeded forty-five or fifty feet when her wagon was struck by one of defendant\u2019s cars which approached without warning, the force of the contact turning the wagon completely around and throwing plaintiff to the ground, the car running approximately three hundred feet before being brought to a stop. A witness for plaintiff, a passenger on defendant\u2019s car, stated the wagon was \u201cside-swiped,\u201d that the car approached at a speed of twenty-five or thirty miles an hour and ran about two hundred and fifty feet after the collision before stopping. The accident occurred on a steep hill, the surface portion of the roadway outside of the railway being merely of sufficient width to permit the passing of two vehicles. The motorman testified plaintiff\u2019s wagon was in view a distance of three hundred feet from the point of the accident.\nOn the foregoing state of facts, the questions of negligence on the part of the motorman and contributory negligence of plaintiff were clearly for the jury. Plaintiff had a right to use the road and to turn toward or upon the tracks of defendant, if necessity required that she do so, subject, however, to the duty of looking for approaching cars and taking proper precautions to avoid a collision'. While defendant\u2019s car was entitled to the right of way it was the duty of the mortorman to exercise that right in such manner as to afford those driving close to or upon the railway reasonable opportunity to leave the track or remove a sufficient distance from it to avoid injury. He was, accordingly, bound to observe the situation of plaintiff\u2019s wagon in front of him on the narrow roadway, and to anticipate that, in passing vehicles approaching in the opposite direction, plaintiff must necessarily drive close to the tracks, and he (the motorman) must not only give warning of his approach, but have his car under such control as the dangers of the situation seemed reasonably to require: Harper v. Transit Co., 258 Pa. 282. As the case was clearly for the jury, defendant\u2019s motions for a new trial and judgment non obstante veredicto were properly dismissed.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

In an accident case, where it appeared plaintiff\u2019s wagon was side-swiped by defendant\u2019s electric car going at a high rate of speed, at a point where the roadway outside of the tracks was of sufficient width to permit the passing of two vehicles only, it was the motorman\u2019s duty, with the wagon in full view in front of him, to anticipate that, in passing vehicles approaching in the opposite direction, plaintiff must necessarily drive close to the tracks, and he (the motorman) must not only give warning of his approach, hut also have his car under such control as the dangers of the situation seemed reasonably to require.\n2. Plaintiff had a right to use the road and to turn towards or upon the tracks if necessity required, subject, however, to the duty of looking for approaching cars and taking proper precaution to avoid a collision,\n3. In such case, the question of defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence is for the jury.\nArgued February 8, 1921.\nAppeals Nos. 205 and 206, Jan. T., 1921, by defendant,, from judgment of C. P. Delaware Co., June T., 1917, No. 301, on verdict for plaintiff, in case of James Hope et ux. v. Southern Penna. Traction Co.\nBefore Moschzisker, C. J., Frazer, Simpson, Sadler and Schaffer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries to plaintiff\u2019s wife, and for injuries to horse and wagon. Before Johnson, P. J.\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the facts.\nVerdict and judgment for James Hope for $1,607.08, and for Martha Hope for $3,392.92. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was refusal of judg- \u25a0 ment for defendant n. o. v., quoting record.\nJ. B. Hannum, for appellant.\nIf the roadway at the side of the track is wide enough to allow the safe passage of a vehicle, one who drives so close to the track as to be struck by an approaching car or who stops his vehicle so close to the track as to be struck by a car which he has just turned from the track to avoid, is guilty of contributory negligence: Morrow v.
