        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe one question here involved concerns the interpretation of item 2 of the will of Henry C. Miller, deceased, and, particularly, what estate his daughter Amanda took under it.\nTestator died April 9, 1862, survived by his widow, Phoebe, and his daughter, Amanda. The widow died July 16,1891; the daughter died, intestate and without issue, May 19, 1919, having married Joseph C. Swank on Sep-, tember 2,1897.\nThe will provides: \u201cI give and bequeath unto my beloved wife Phoebe all my real estate and personal property of what kind or nature the same may be during her natural life, and from and immediately after her decease I give and devise the same unto my daughter, and to her heirs, and in case of the death of my daughter Amanda without any heirs, I give and devise the same unto Stephen Miller, son of Charles Miller, deceased.\u201d\nStephen Miller claims that Amanda had a life estate only, and, she having died May 19, 1919, without issue, he is entitled to the remainder in fee; while it is contended by Joseph C. Swank, surviving husband of Amanda, that she, having survived her father and mother, took an absolute estate.\nThis latter contention the court below correctly sustained. The devise is to Amanda and her heirs. When \u201cheirs\u201d is employed in connection with remaindermen, the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case applies, unless other language in the will clearly demonstrates that the word was not intended in its technical sense, as a term of limitation. The strong presumption arising from the use of technical words of limitation is not easily overcome; it may be rebutted, but it can be done by nothing short of affirmative evidence of a contrary intent, so clear as to leave no reasonable doubt (Harrison v. Harris, 245 Pa 397; see also the opinion of our court in English\u2019s Estate, 270 Pa. 1). Here there is no such evidence; and we agree with the court below that, if, in view of the prior limitation in fee, it is necessary to give any meaning to the testamentary provision added after such limitation, the proper construction is that the words\u2014\u201cin case of the death of my daughter, Amanda, without any heirs\u201d\u2014have reference to her death before the testator or his widow.\nThe decree is affirmed at cost of appellant.",
