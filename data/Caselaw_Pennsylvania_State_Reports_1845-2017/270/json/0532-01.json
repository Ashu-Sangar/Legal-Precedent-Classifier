        "text": "Opi-nion by\nMr. Justice Kephart,\nAppellant assumed the mortgage of Prudence Mc-Mahan to C. Ward Eicher was collateral security for a debt owed by Alexander McMahan to Eicher, and that it was paid when the assignees of McMahan paid Eicher\u2019s note for which the mortgage Was pledged as collateral. The mortgage was an absolute obligation, with no reference to any collateral undertaking. The proof failed to show the mortgage was without consideration or was given as an accommodation for Alexander McMahan, or that his assignees thereafter paid the mortgage. The evidence offered to establish these facts failed to disclose anything relieving defendant. Eicher was not connected, personally or through an agent, with any representation which would indicate no value passed to defendant or that he had accepted or taken the mortgage for the accommodation of Alexander McMahan. Eicher borrowed from a trust company, giving his note, assigning this mortgage as collateral for that loan; the note was subsequently paid by the assignees of Alexander McMahan\u2019s estate and the collateral was returned to Eicher. Why the assignees paid the note does not appear in the evidence. If it was paid in discharge of Mc-Mahan\u2019s liability to Eicher, the account of the assignees would show it, as also if the assignees, without authority, advanced funds in liquidation of this note from McMahan\u2019s estate. Both of these accounts were in the hands of the court or should have been. Of course the mortgage ought not to be paid twice, but there is nothing to show it was so paid. The payment, by the assignees, of Eicher\u2019s note may be accounted for in a number of. ways, none of which would be for the benefit of Prudence or Alexander McMahan. Until there was some evidence tending to show payment on their account, it was not necessary for Eicher\u2019s assignees of the mortgage to produce evidence showing why the assignees paid this note. It was stated at the bar of this court that Eicher was counsel for the estate and otherwise interested. The court did not err in rejecting the offers of evidence here assigned for error.\nWe have considered all the assignments and they are overruled. Those not specifically dealt with are deemed to be without merit.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed,",

T., 1921, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Westmoreland Co., Aug. T., 1920, No. 329, on verdict for plaintiffs, in case of M. Brighenti and E. L. Hibbs, assignee of C. Ward Eicher, who was assignee of Barclay-Westmoreland Trust Co., which was assignee of C. Ward Eicher v. George H. Steiner, executor of estate of Prudence McMahan, deceased, and Olive A. Steiner, devisee of said Prudence McMahan.\nBefore Moschzisker, C. J., Frazer, Walling, Simpson, Kephart, Sadler and Schaefer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nScire facias sur mortgage. Before Beacom, P. J., specially presiding.\nAt the trial it appeared that on February 1, 1909, Prudence McMahan, executed a mortgage for $3,800, to C. Ward Eicher. On February 10th, following, the mortgage was assigned to the Barclay-Westmoreland Trust Co., as collateral security for a loan to Eicher for $3,800. The note of Eicher for the loan was subsequently paid by the assignees of Alexander McMahan\u2019s estate, and the mortgage was assigned to Eicher, who subsequently assigned it to plaintiffs. Defendants claimed that Prudence McMahan had executed the mortgage as an accommodation to her brother Alexander McMahan and to help him out' of' his financial troubles, and they assumed that payment of Eicher\u2019s note by Mc-Mahan\u2019s assignees was payment of the mortgage. There was no proof that the mortgage was given as security; nor was there any explanation why the assignees of Mc-Mahan had paid Eicher\u2019s note, nor any proof that such payment was payment of the mortgage.\nOther facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nThe court gave binding instructions for plaintiffs.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiffs for $6,688, Defendants appealed.\nErrors assigned were refusal of various offers of evidence, quoting bills of exceptions, and charge of court, quoting it.\nLewis C.
