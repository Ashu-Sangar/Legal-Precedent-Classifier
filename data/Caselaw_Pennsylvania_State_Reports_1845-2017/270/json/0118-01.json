        "text": "Per Curiam,\nDefendant appeals from an award in plaintiff\u2019s favor by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board and affirmed by the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County. On August 7, 1919, the husband of plaintiff, while engaged at defendant\u2019s colliery in loading coal, complained of receiving injury, from which he died three days later. Plaintiff\u2019s contention is that her husband\u2019s injury was the result of a sprain, received while at work, which ruptured a blood vessel of the stomach. The compensation board, accepting this theory of the death, awarded compensation, and the common pleas affirmed the board\u2019s action. The defense was that plaintiff failed to produce sufficient evidence to sustain the board\u2019s second finding of facts, as follows: \u201cWhile in the performance of his duties as such employee [deceased] met with an accident in attempting to lift a brakes'tick and thereby suffered such strain internally as to cause hemorrhages of the stomach and bowels that his death followed as \u00e1 natural consequence thereof.\u201d A careful reading of the testimony convinces us that the board\u2019s conclusion should be sustained.\nDeceased was an unusually healthy man, never having-complained of stomach trouble or other sickness, and worked regularly. He immediately made known to his fellow workmen that he had received an injury in the abdomen while engaged at his work and on reaching his home complained of pain in his stomach, informed his wife he was \u201clifting something in the mines and strained himself,\u201d retired to bed and remained there until his death three days later\u2014in the meantime \u201csuffering with copious hemorrhages in the stomach and bowels.\u201d The medical testimony showed the hemorrhages could have been caused by the rupture of a blood vessel, the result of a strain. The evidence referred to is competent and sufficient to support the finding complained of; accordingly, the award must be confirmed and the appeal dismissed.\nThe award is confirmed and the appeal dismissed.",
