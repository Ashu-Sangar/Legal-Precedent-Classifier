In 1920, the partnership purchased a tract of land and in 1931 purchased another tract of land. Reuben died in 1937 and his brothers, Harry and Jacob continued to carry on the partnership business. Reuben’s estate still had rights in the partnership; but Reuben’s rights in specific partnership property expired at his death and vested in his surviving partners: Sections 42 and 25 (2)' (d) of the Uniform Partnership Act, March 26, 1915, P.

Reuben’s administratrix subsequently executed a quit-claim deed to the partnership real estate for $200, transferring all of Reuben’s interest therein to plaintiff, so that no claim or complaint is made by the estate of Reuben Goldberg.

    <p id="b105-4" data-blocks='[["BL_105.4",105,[206,1027,1150,1314]]]'>The Uniform Partnership Act created a new kind of estate “a tenancy in partnership”. Because of the confusion and the inequities which frequently arose from treating partners as joint tenants and the application of the legal incidents of joint tenancy to partners, the Uniform Partnership Act was passed by the Legislature, with the intention of establishing a new type of ownership and providing a fair and workable law, which would eliminate the confusion and inequities which had arisen and would protect partners and partnership creditors. This is important to remember in construing the Act because if there be any ambiguity therein or “When the words of a law are not explicit, the intention of the Legislature may be ascertained by considering, among other matters — -(1) the occasion and necessity for the law; (2) the circumstances under which it was enacted; (3) the mischief to be remedied; (4) the object to be attained; (5) the former law, if any, including other laws upon the same or similar subjects; (6) the consequences of a particular interpretation; (7) the contemporaneous legislative history; and (8) legislative and administrative interpretations of such law.” 1937, May 28, P.

Section 25 (1) and (2) (b) of the Uniform Partnership Act provides: “(1) A partner is co-owner with his partners of specific partnership property, holding as a tenant in partnership.

An examination of the reasons for the Partnership Act and thé rights given to partners thereunder, as well as other provisions of the Act, make clear that that was not the intention of the Legislature. We agree with the opinion and decision in <em>Becher v. Hercules Foundries, Inc., <a href="/citations/?q=33%20N.Y.S.2d%20367" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="33 N.Y.S.2d 367">33 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=33%20N.Y.S.2d%20367" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="33 N.Y.S.2d 367">N.Y.S. 2d 367</a> (1942). The Court there sustained an action by a remaining partner for work, labor and services and for damages for breach of contract where his co-pa:rtner had assigned those specific partnership claims to him. The Court said: “The Partnership Law does not preclude an assignment by one partner to another partner of a cause of action or specific property theretofore belonging to a partnership of two persons, but merely forbids such an assignment by one: partner to- a third party or stranger- unless it is joined- :in by all of other part<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>ners, or [forbids] an assignment to a partner not executed by all the other partners.”</p>

The reasons for the non-assignability by one partner alone of his interest in specific partnership real or personal property are set forth in the Commissioner’s Notes, 7 Uniform Law Am notated, Partnership, pages 145-150, and may be summarized as follows: (1) It prevents.the interference by outsiders with the conduct of partnership business and the possession, management and disposition of partnership property (See <em>Horton’s Appeal, </em><a href="/citations/?q=13%20Pa.%2066" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Pa. 66">13 Pa. 66</a> (1850)); Lewis, the Uniform Partnership Act, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20Yale%20L.J.%20617" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="24 Yale L.J. 617">24 Yale L.J. 617</a>, 631 (1915); (2) Partnership-is a voluntary relation, — a person may not have a partner thrust upon him without his consent; (3) It is often impossible to measure a partner’s beneficial interest in a specific partnership asset; (4) Neither other partners nor firm creditors may be deprived of the right to have all firm assets applied to the payment of firm- debts, (See <em>Blaker v. Sands, </em><a href="/kan/29/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="29 Kan. 551" data-case-ids="60784" data-case-paths="/kan/29/0551-01">29 Kan. 551</a> (1883)); (5)-A creditor of one partner may not attach or in any manner acquire a lien on specific partnership property to the exclusion of firm creditors or creditors of other partners. The reasons are persuasive, practical and wise, but they have no application to a case such as the instant one. Under Jacob’s assignment to Harry no outsider could interfere with the conduct, possession or management of the partnership or partnership property. No new partner is admitted into the partnership. No other partner or no partnership creditor is deprived of his right to have the partnership assets applied to the payment -of partnership debts;, and ho other partner nor the creditor^ of the partnership :are. prejudiced and neither are subordinated to claims of <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>creditors of individual partners. Even, therefore, if section 25 (2) (b) stood alone, a construction which prohibited an assignment or release of specific partnership property to the remaining or surviving partner, or to the remaining or surviving partners, with the consent of all, would be unreasonable.</p>
