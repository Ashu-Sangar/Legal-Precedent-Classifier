The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant. Plaintiffs appealed contending the court below gave an erroneous <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>instruction to the jury when it affirmed one of the defendant’s points for charge, viz.: “the speed of the automobile was not the proximate cause of the accident”.</p>
    <p id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[197,583,1147,481]]]'>The injuries occurred on the morning of December 29, 1948, at about 1:00 a.m. The wife-plaintiff was requested by defendant to accompany her while, in her automobile, she drove another lady home from a bowling club party. The defendant being unfamiliar with the road had the wife-plaintiff accompany her to show her the way. The wife-plaintiff rode on the front seat with defendant, while the other passenger was seated in the rear.</p>
    <p id="b341-5" data-blocks='[["BL_341.6",341,[198,1084,1146,433]]]'>There was a light rain. As the automobile proceeded along the highway known as Buena Vista-Love-dale Hollow Boad, in Elizabeth Township, Allegheny County, it went into a skid, traveled two hundred feet sideways down the road toward the left side of the highway, over a little embankment, through a fence, and into a telegraph pole. There the car turned over on its right side.</p>
    <p id="b341-6" data-blocks='[["BL_341.7",341,[197,1528,1148,816]],["BL_342.1",342,[248,360,1144,429]]]'>The evidence shows that the car skidded slightly (or “swayed a little bit”) as it proceeded down Eden Park Boulevard. This was at a point approximately three and one-half miles from the place of the accident. After leaving Eden Park Boulevard the defendant had no difficulty in driving. The route led through the Borough of Versailles, over the Boston Bridge, up the Renzie Hill, up and down Dewey Hill and thence on ■to the Buena Vista-Lovedale Hollow Road. There is a sign posted at the top of Dewey Hill reading “Slippery When Wet”. The Lovedale Hollow Road enters from the right at the bottom of Dewey Hill. Just beyond the intersection the road curves to the left. Although defendant had driven this road many times in the daylight she did not recall having driven on it at <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>night. This two lane roadway was of asphalt construction and is level at the place the accident occurred. Defendant was driving thirty to thirty-five miles per hour as she approached the intersection, reduced her speed slightly, then after passing.the intersection resumed the same speed. After the defendant’s automobile had negotiated the curve the automobile skidded on a patch of ice and the accident resulted.</p>
    <p id="b342-4" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[248,803,1145,761]]]'>The court charged the jury that the operator of an automobile must regulate the speed of his motor vehicle commensurate with the circumstances. At the close of the instructions the defendant requested the court to charge that “the speed of the automobile was' not the proximate cause of the accident”. This point was affirmed. Such a charge was obviously inconsistent and had the effect of a circuitous directed verdict for the defendant: <em>J. C. Gearing v. L. M. Lacher, </em><a href="/pa/146/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="146 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="827921" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0397-01">146 Pa. 397</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.%20229" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="23 A. 229">23 A. 229</a>; <em>Williamson v.

The defense was based upon the fact that the defendant’s automobile skidded upon an invisible patch of ice upon the highway, of which the driver had no notice and could not reasonably have been expected to discover. It is uncontradicted that the skidding occurred not because of any <em>slippery condition </em>of the wet road, but because of the <em>ice formation </em>on the road. The record is devoid of any evidence of the presence of ice for three and one-half miles prior to the scene of the accident. Defendant drove up and down a very steep hill and around winding curves without any skidding <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>of any kind. There was no reason to suspect that the defendant could not proceed with perfect safety at the same moderate speed at which she had theretofore been traveling. Judge Baldrige said in <em>Hatch v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa-super/99/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="99 Pa. Super. 141" data-case-ids="688893" data-case-paths="/pa-super/99/0141-01">99 Pa.

At the point where the accident occurred the road was level and there was nothing to give notice of the treacherous icy spot. Two of the occupants of the car, wife-plaintiff and defendant, testified that there was no difference in the appearance of the road at the spot where ice had formed from any <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>other portion just traveled. The third passenger was not asked if she saw any difference. Clifford A. Halle, the first witness to arrive at the scene of the accident, testified that the surface of the road merely <em>looked </em>wet from the rain and that because of the ice there formed he had a hard time “keeping [his] feet”. John E. Brennan, a constable in Elizabeth Township, likewise testified that the appearance of the ice, as compared with the wet roads, looked the same. Both Mr. Brennan’s car and the ambulance skidded at the scene of the accident. This occurred in spite of the fact that Mr. Brennan was informed of the icy condition.</p>

    <p id="b345-6" data-blocks='[["BL_345.7",345,[199,1404,1147,817]]]'>It has been submitted on behalf of the defendant that the accident was caused by a patch of ice and that there was no way for her to know that ice would appear on the highway. The fact that winter with all its glacial forces had taken over the countryside (it was December 29th) would certainly suggest the possibility that Jack Frost and his sprightly crew might be glazing the roads. In fact, ice had been discovered at a point described as Eden Park Boulevard and Walnut Street (some 3 or 4 miles back from the scene of the accident.) The witness John R. Brennan, called by the defendant, testified to noticing ice on the road “about 100 yards from the upset car.” He also testified that the ambulance which called for the injured plaintiff skidded because of ice on the road.</p>

It could well be that it was the water on the ice which converted the defendant’s automobile into a sled, or it could be that the automobile would have skidded even without the presence of ice. The road signs proclaimed that the road would be slippery when wet and there was a plethora of evidence on the general slipperiness of the road. Mrs. Lundin testified: “Q. Did you know what the condition of that road was when it was wet? A. Yes, the road was very slippery.” Miss Kathryn Tremont testified: “Q. What is the condition of it when it is wet? A. Well, it is one of those hard surfaces, black surface roads, it is slippery.” John R. Brennan testified: “Q. That road was wet on the night of this accident? A. Yes. Q.

The majority opinion contends, however, that the speed of Mrs. Heilman’s car is irrelevant to the case, but how can speed be ruled out? Is 35 miles an hour such a snail’s pace that it can never be provocative of accident? It is a self-evident observation that, in given circumstances, even 10 miles an hour can be evidence of negligence. (For instance, churning and splashing over a flooded road at 10 miles per hour could easily be causative of tortious incident.)</p>

Mrs. Lundin urged Mrs. Heilman to “take it easy, to take it slow.” The defendant herself was conscious of the slippery conditions. She testified: “Q. Do you know whether that blacktop road was slippery when wet? A. I suppose it was . . . Q. When you reached Walnut Street was there anything that happened concerning your car? A. Well, we felt it sort of slide, but it wasn’t much of a skid. It just <em>could be from the wet road.”</em>
