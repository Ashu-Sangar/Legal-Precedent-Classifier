Waiving, a -hearing, he was there<a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>upon committed to the Lackawanna County Prison. On April 13 the alderman’s transcript was returned to the Clerk of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. On that same day the Grand Jury in and for the County commenced its deliberations and remained in active session until April 16, at which time the court excused it from further service but subject to being re-summoned if occasion should require. A new grand, jury was sworn and came into being on September 8. The district attorney presented to this grand jury on September 11 an indictment charging appellant with the crime of murder. A session of the petit jury in the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Lackawanna County commenced on May 4 and continued until May 8. Another such session commenced on October 5 and continued until the conclusion of the trial of another homicide case which was conducted before this venire.</p>

On October 26 he filed a motion for his discharge from imprisonment, invoking the two-term rule. An answer was filed by the district attorney and a reply to the answer by appellant. The court refused to allow the rule and from that refusal the present appeal was taken.</p>

    <p id="b586-5" data-blocks='[["BL_586.6",586,[253,1408,1150,763]]]'>It is appellant’s contention that two sessions of petit juries having been held subsequent to his commitment, and he not having been tried at either one, he should be discharged from imprisonment. The district attorney on the other hand contends that he was unable to present the case for indictment in April because of lack of time for preparation; therefore appellant could not have been tried in May; furthermore, it was impossible to try him in October because a lengthy murder trial was then being conducted before the jury. The district attorney calls attention to the cases which hold that there may be circumstances of physical, moral or legal necessity which, preventing trial, take a case out of the statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>We do not deem it necessary to pass upon the merits of the argument thus presented by the district attorney because, in our opinion, the Act of 1860 requires, in order to entitle a defendant to discharge from imprisonment, that two <em>terms </em>shall have passed after his commitment without his having been indicted and tried therein.</p>
    <p id="b587-3" data-blocks='[["BL_587.6",587,[193,752,1148,818]],["BL_588.1",588,[252,358,1148,762]]]'>The Act is not as clear as it might be in that it apparently uses the word “term,” the word “session” and the word “court” as though they were synonymous. Ordinarily the “term” of a court is understood to be the time prescribed by law within which it may be in session, whereas the “session” of a court is the time of its actual sitting: I Standard Pennsylvania Practice p. 242, §293. The difference between prescribed terms and the holding of sessions within such terms was clearly pointed out by Judge Keller in <em>Fisher v. Fisher, </em><a href="/pa-super/74/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="74 Pa. Super. 538" data-case-ids="645640" data-case-paths="/pa-super/74/0538-01">74 Pa. Superior Ct. 538</a>, 542-544. The question therefore arises: Does the Act of 1860 establish a “two-term” rule or a “two-sessions” rule? Terms are fixed by statutes or, under the Act of April 27, 1927, P. L. 420,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> by the courts themselves, and, when thus estab<a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>lished, they constitute definitive periods of time which lend themselves to easy application, whereas “sessions” or “courts” may be held at varying times, several possibly in a single term or perhaps none during one or more successive terms. Moreover, it would be difficult in this connection to determine whether different “sittings” of the court from time to time constituted one “session” or a series of “sessions” within the intendment of the Act. We conclude, therefore, that the Act must be interpreted as meaning fixed “terms” of court, and that it is only when two such terms shall have passed after the commitment of a defendant without his having been, indicted and tried therein that he would be entitled to discharge from imprisonment.</p>
