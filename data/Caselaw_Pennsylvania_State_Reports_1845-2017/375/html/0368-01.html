The jury found him guilty of first degree murder and fixed the penalty at death. The murder was a particularly brutal one.

This contention carries the theory or doctrine of ‘diminished responsibility’ to an extreme and would vest in a psychiatrist and not in the Courts the right and power to determine and fix punishment for crimes. <em>Such a theory or philosophy would soon transfer the punishment of criminals from Court to psychiatrists and would inevitably result in a further breakdown of law enforcement and eventual confusion and chaos. </em>Fortunately our cases are opposed to such an undesirable result.”</p>

Upon appeal we should reverse a lower court only for an abuse of discretion or an error of law. The Court en bane in the instant ease carefully and wisely studied the testimony and examined the members of the Commission, and concluded that Patskin was now and has been at all times concerned, legally sane, and that <em>they toere not satisfied that the defendant is at present mentally ill </em>as defined under the terms of the Mental Health Act. The test is the petitioner’s condition, not at the time of the trial but at the time of the petition and commission. Nevertheless, we believe that the legislature never intended the issue of insanity or any issue which was decided by a jury and approved by the Courts — who, we may add, will never knowingly permit an insane man to be tried, sentenced or executed: <em>Com. ex rel.

While the science of psychiatry has made tremendous strides, the Courts of Pennsylvania have at this stage of scientific knowledge refused, and we believe wisely refused, to substitute psychiatric tests or conclusions for our long and wisely established “right and wrong” test. The law of Pennsylvania (following <em>M’Naghten’s Case, </em>10 Cl. &amp; Pin. 200 (1843)) provides that the test of insanity is whether the defendant at the time of the commission of the killing knew the nature and consequences of his acts, or the difference between right and wrong: <em>Commonwealth v.
