Ross, employes of the Great Lakes Forwarding Corporation, were each operating an empty tractor caravan trailer, a type used for transporting new automobiles. Both tractor-trailers were forty-five feet long. On the morning of <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>June 1, 1948 they were engaged in driving the empty tractor-trailers from Philadelphia to Toledo, Ohio, having delivered their cargoes of motor vehicles. They were traveling west on route 220, intending to make a right turn in the road in the Borough of Tyrone. Plaintiff Meade was in the lead with Boss following in his machine. Meade missed the turn, Boss overtook Meade and assumed the lead. It was 3:30 in the morning and the weather foggy. They approached the grade railroad crossing, the main line of defendant railroad, consisting of five tracks running east and west, over which were operated many express passenger trains at high speed and numerous freight trains. Their intention was to cross the railroad, and come upon route 220 which they had missed in Tyrone. The road which they were on ran across the tracks and led from Tyrone to Thomastown, about one mile south of the crossing. It was of macadam construction and twenty-five to thirty feet wide north of the crossing. For a distance the road ran parallel to the tracks and then took an abrupt right angle turn to the left across the tracks and the station platform which was situated between the third and fourth sets of tracks. A light was located on the middle of the platform above and beside the roadway. After crossing the tracks and the station platform the road turned again to the right at a right angle. There was also another road to the left at right angles to the track. A bank bounded by a retaining wall was directly in front of traffic as it proceeded across the tracks. The road to the right was not more than twelve to fifteen feet wide; that to the left was eight feet wide. Thus in crossing the tracks the only alternatives were to go right or left on these narrow roads. Boss, who so preceded Meade in his tractor-trailer, made the turn across the tracks and upon reaching the other side found that he would be <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>■unable to negotiate the turns either to the right or left. He shifted out of gear, set the emergency brake, and opened the door to alight from the cab to inform Meade of the situation. He noticed at this time that the warning lights were blinking and the crossing bell was ringing signaling the approach of a train. Ross then closed the door, put the tractor in gear, released the emergency brake and drove forward a few feet at a speed of three miles an hour. He went as far as possible and then turned the tractor up the road to the left. This maneuver removed this trailer from the fourth track over which the train was approaching. When Ross had gone as far as he was able and was about to jump from the tractor, through his right rear view mirror he observed Meade drive up on the right side of his trailer, hit the wall and endeavor to cause the tractor to climb the bank. As Meade was attempting thus to climb the bank the train struck the rear of his trailer, threw it into the tractor-trailer Ross was driving and dragged Meade’s tractor-trailer down the track approximately one hundred and twenty-five feet with Meade in its cab.</p>

He then proceeded across the tracks after noticing that there were no signals in operation. He testified that the light on the platform in the middle of the tracks caused him to believe this was the end of the crossing since it was as far ahead as he could see. When he reached the light he realized that there were two additional sets of tracks. As he passed under the platform light he became aware that the flashing lights were in operation. It was then he noticed Ross’s trailer to his left on the tracks. He also testified that he then went forward in first, gear as <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>quickly as possible, hit the wall, tried to climb the bank, but was struck by the oncoming train. The record discloses that there were several warning signs along the street on the north side of the tracks which informed users that the street was not a through highway and that there was a dead end near. The drivers testified that the signs were not visible due to the foggy weather.</p>

He heard the train whistle and saw its headlight after he had gone about another ten feet. The span of time when the first signal was seen until the collision was about three to six seconds.

Meade, employed as a driver, started from his home in Sweet Valley, Pennsylvania, to drive an empty tractor-trailer to Toledo, Ohio, the headquarters of his employer, the Great Lakes Forwarding Corporation. Early the next morning he arrived in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, and, departing from that city, travelled westwardlv on a Thomastown Road, which paralleled certain railroad tracks of the defendant company. At 3:30 a.m., he came to an abrupt right-angular turn in the road to the left, the turn coinciding with a railroad crossing. A fellow-employe, Herbert M. Ross, operating a vehicle similar to that of Meade’s had preceded Meade and was actually moving over the tracks at the time that Meade stopped to survey the scene before him. Within the inner corner of the turn in the road appeared two signs, one reading STOP — DEAD END, and the other reading: SHARP CURVE OVER RAILROAD TRACKS. The second sign was illustrated with an elongated “S” bearing sharp termini, indicating the acute angle at which a traveller turned to enter upon the tracks and the sharp angle at which he would leave the crossing on the other side. The sign STOP— DEAD END was obviously a warning to the traveller not to proceed directly ahead and could not possibly be interpreted as any prohibition against entering the crossing. As a matter of fact, the second sign, which was at least three times as large as the first mentioned, <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>and was bordered with conspicuous batchwork, actually assured the wayfarer of the safety of the crossing since it explained, by means of the graphic arrow, just how one should approach and depart from the railroad right of way.</p>

No signal of any kind informed him of any approaching train. Fully conscious, however, of the incipient dangers hovering in the vicinity of all railroad tracks, Meade moved over the crossing slowly and alertly. When he arrived at the platform and his front wheels were “practically up to” the fourth track, light signals blinked and crossing bells rang. Accelerating the speed of his vehicle, Meade moved ahead 10 feet when a yet unseen oncoming locomotive sounded an admonitory blast. In the next instant an express train was upon him. It struck the rear of the tractor-trailer, dragged it some 125 feet, inflicting serious injuries to Meade and demolishing his vehicle, as well as setting it afire.</p>

An overshadowing hill on the western side of the intersection, coupled with a wide sweep in the tracks, made necessary because of the topography of the land, practically screened trains from view until they thundered into the crossing. The engineer involved in this accident had a peculiar and unique knowledge of the properties of the crossing which he regarded as a “jinx.” When asked why he was so familiar with this road over the tracks, he replied “because I have hit a lot of automobiles [there].” He then attempted to correct this admission by adding “not a lot,” but no retraction could wipe away the fact that he burst into the fog-enshrouded crossing at 60 miles per hour without a warning until the crushing momentum of his locomotive was about to destroy the helpless vehicle in his path.</p>

A duty devolved upon the railroad company to install such devices as would reasonably protect travellers from destruction by passing trains. The functioning of the warning lights and bells at this crossing was found to be entirely inadequate in the circumstances. A crossing bell which sounds so closely in point of time to the actual arrival of a train is not a bell of warning but a knell of doom. The plaintiff testified that the crash occurred within 3 to 6 seconds after the bell rang. Such brevity in warning has been declared by this Court to constitute negligence. In <em>Bickel v.

To have pressed on, with such a vehicular encumbrance, in the face of dire warning of disaster could only have meant a will to self-slaughter, and there is no evidence to suggest any suicidal intention on the part of Meade. Ross immediately preceded Meade, and he just barely missed being struck by the train since he succeeded in negotiating the crossing before the locomotive arrived. This confirms Meade’s testimony that no warning was given before he started over the tracks because had the signal devices been operating at that moment they would, in all likelihood, have been observed also by Ross and he would not have moved forward in the face of such announced and imminent danger.</p>

I fail to see the pertinency of such attachment. Meade either had the right to cross the railroad tracks or he did not. There is not one syllable in the entire record to the effect that the crossing was closed to him or to anyone else. The <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>STOP — DEAD END sign at the Crossing did not mean that Thomastown Road died at that point. This highway was a macadamized road 25 to 35 feet wide and was used every day by all types of vehicles. The DEAD END sign meant what it obviously said, namely, that one should or could not proceed any further in the straight-ahead direction. One could, however, turn to the left and proceed southwardly on the ample crossing over the tracks. The other sign — SHARP CURVE OVER RAILROAD TRACKS— did not prohibit passage, it invited it; it did not repel travellers, it beckoned them on.</p>

Meade could have missed ten roads and still have the right to cross the tracks without being run down by a locomotive. All the signs which appeared before Meade reached the crossing were no more controlling in this case than circus billboards. One of the signs referred to by the majority — a Stop Dead End sign — was attached to the Pennsylvania Railroad Station in Tyrone, a mile distant from the crossing. It merely advised the traveller that a Pennsylvania Avenue ended at that point and if he did not change his course here, he would run into the Station! It had nothing at all to do with the Wilson Crossing.</p>

Looking at the photographic exhibits in the case and reading the testimony, it is clear that these signs merely advised that the straightaway of Thomastown Road would end some time soon and, as it developed later, that straightaway-endness occurred at the crossing. The signs did not say that Meade could not reach the next immediate milestone in his journey by proceeding along Thomastown Road and over the crossing. Furthermore, the railroad had no jurisdiction over instructing Meade the course of travel he should follow in reaching any destination satisfactory to himself. Meade had the right to go over the crossing for any reason which offered him advantage in connection with his mission, so long as he violated no law, and the pages of the record repulse any suggestion of law violation.</p>

No quantity of discussion, no citing of cases, no historical relating of what occurred prior to 3:30 a.m., June 1, 1948, can reply to that question with any answer but Yes.

It might, therefore, be it was not rung in time to serve as ample warning to persons using the crossing; <em>at all events it was for the jury to say whether the warning was ample and if a wMstle should have been blown at a distance from the crossing sufficient to give earlier wanning of the approaching train.”</em>
