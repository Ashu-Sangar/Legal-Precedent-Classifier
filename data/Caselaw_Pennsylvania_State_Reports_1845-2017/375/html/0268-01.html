The alleged cloud relates to a clause in the deed to plaintiff’s predecessor in title. The court below overruled preliminary objections to defendant’s answer and new matter and dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b294-6" data-blocks='[["BL_294.10",294,[245,1004,1144,1372]]]'>The City of Pittsburgh, the defendant, acquired title at a tax sale to 819 Fifth Avenue in that city. After the period of redemption had expired the city sold the premises to Solomon Caplan, father of plaintiff, for $4,000. The sale was made pursuant to an agreement between the city and buyer that no damages would be claimed for the future widening of Fifth Avenue. The agreement of sale, containing the clause in question, was approved by the City Council and by the Court of Common Pleas: Act of May 21, 1937, P. L. 787, as amended, 72 PS 5878 (a) et seq. Thereafter the city deeded the premises to Solomon Caplan, who as grantee made the following covenant in the deed: “THE GRANTEE, or his successors in title hereby covenant and agree that if, at any time in the future, the City of Pittsburgh by proper action condemns for street widening purposes for public use the following part of the above described real estate, no claim for damages will be filed or expected by the above grantee or his successors in title.” The portion of the real estate affected by the covenant is an area of approximately 21 by 22 feet, and is described in the deed by metes and bounds. The deed was recorded. By devise and various mesne conveyances Samuel Caplan, the plaintiff, is now the owner of such real estate.</p>

      <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>Plaintiff maintains that the covenant created <em>an interest in land, </em>which was not then vested, but which was to commence “at any time in the future” when the city might condemn the described portion for street widening purposes, and should an interest be thus created it would be void as a violation of the rule against perpetuities. As an alternate reason for striking down the covenant plaintiff argues that even though it be held that the clause does not create an <em>interest in land, </em>nevertheless the clause is void <em>as a covenant running with the land </em>since such covenants are only enforceable when they create “land interests, easements or servitudes”. Plaintiff therefore maintains that the covenant is void and constitutes a cloud upon the title which he seeks to have removed.</p>

    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[251,451,1145,1481]]]'>We agree with the learned court below that the covenant constitutes “a covenant not to sue”. Professor Williston in his work on Contracts states that <em>a contract not to sue </em>is in effect a <em>release </em>and is therefore <em>a present </em>discharge: Yol. Six, Williston on Contracts (Revised Edition) sec. 1823 p. 5164. This section reads: “A release properly is a present discharge; and a release of a right to be acquired <em>in the future </em>is, therefore, anomalous, and, in the view of early lawyers, an impossibility; but a covenant of perpetual forbearance has been from early times, in order to avoid circuity of action, a bar at law to an action, and if the covenantee or covenantees are the only defendants, a covenant of permanent forbearance is, therefore, as effective as a release. The distinction between such a covenant and a release is, nevertheless, of importance, for a covenant not to sue one or any number less than all of several joint debtors does not have the consequences of a release, and is given only its literal meaning. <em>There is no doubt that a release of a possible contingent liability under an existing contract is effective, </em>and, though the early law did not concern itself with implications, deeming the express words of a writing a conclusive limit of its meaning, there is no doubt in modern times that an attempted release of a future right must be construed as amounting at least to a covenant not to enforce the right whenever it arises.</p>

In the present section only such transactions are in-<a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>eluded where a right is wholly discharged without the creation of a corresponding right in another person.</p>

This constituted an effective <em>release. </em>Such a proceeding created no interest <em>in futuro■, </em>but <em>presently released </em>all future damages.

As early as 1869, in <em>Groh v.
