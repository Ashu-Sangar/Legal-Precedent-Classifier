The latter is an improved highway. The natural surface drainage is from the east down the hillside through the lots of owners whose houses front on the east side of Moltke Avenue. The land to the west of the dirt road is unimproved and slopes down to a railroad. Surface water from the higher ground drains on to Moltke Avenue. In freezing weather the roadway, at times, was covered with ice. <em>For about a week prior to plaintiffs injury the weather was mild, alternately freezing and thawing, with some ram. </em>Automobiles passing over Moltke Avenue formed ruts in the ice then on the roadway. Plaintiff on the morning of January 1, 1943, walked northwardly in the roadway of Moltke Avenue and when' a few feet from East Mountain Road slipped in an icy rut and fell. Although he lived in the neighborhood and used the road every day, he did not observe the hazard because of a fall of snow that morning which concealed the ruts in the ice. <em>There were no sidewalks along Moltke Avenue and the roadway was commonly used by pedestrians as a footway. </em>The city had actual as well as <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>constructive notice of the condition of Moltke Avenue under conditions then prevailing.

The question here is whether the municipality, under the circumstances of this case, was required to provide a drainage system adequate to prevent the accumulation of ice along the street from surface water naturally flowing upon it from adjoining higher ground.” (Italics supplied)</p>

    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[172,403,1145,99]]]'>On Sunday, December 19, 1948, snow fell in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.6",119,[170,513,1149,433]]]'>The snow brought with it the natural corollaries of white blanketed streets, glazed surfaces, and the usual wintry hampering of movement, both pedestrian and vehicular, on the thoroughfares of the city. The six inch fall, however, while impeding traffic to a degree, did not immobilize it, and automobiles ploughed through the accumulation of flakes, leaving treads and tracks in their frothy wake.</p>
    <p id="b119-6" data-blocks='[["BL_119.7",119,[170,959,1151,763]]]'>On the night of December 24th, at about 11:20 o’clock, Mrs. Genevieve Solinsky, who lived on Eeno Lane, left her home to attend Christmas Eve mass, to be celebrated at the Holy Trinity Church located at the corner of South and South Meade Streets, several blocks away. After taking some 15 to 20 steps she slipped on a ridge of ice, fell and was injured. She and her husband brought suit against the City of Wilkes-Barre averring negligence in its maintenance of Beno Lane. At the termination of the plaintiff’s case in the trial before the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, the Court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it refused later to take off. From that refusal an appeal was taken to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b119-7" data-blocks='[["BL_119.8",119,[169,1735,1149,484]]]'>The crucial question before us is whether the admitted ridges and hills of ice on Beno Lane were there for a sufficient period of time to visit constructive notice on the municipality as to their existence and potential peril to man and vehicle utilizing the roadway, for Beno Lane had no sidewalk. To answer that question, there must naturally first be an understanding as to when the glacial impediment first made its appearance.</p>

But this meteorological conclusion ignored the testimony of the plaintiff that from Sunday, December 19th to Friday, December 2áth, Reno Lane was never free of ice and snow. It also discarded the evidence that the moving traffic on Eeno Lane, aided by the sunlight of the day, had chopped, softened and churned the snow into little hills, valleys and other surface irregularities which, then, visited by the frost and freeze of the night, solidified into ridges and mounds of ice.</p>
    <p id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[257,1006,1149,484]]]'>The lower court’s decision apparently also swept away without consideration the definitive testimony of the husband-plaintiff that already on Tuesday, December 21st, there was a hardness to the ruts and ridges caused by the tire marks in the snow, and the testimony of the witness William Danowski that the ruts and ridges he saw on Friday were of the same character as those which came to his attention on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

A jury could have found from the evidence that during this entire time such was the condition, though it may have changed somewhat from day to day. They could have found that such was the condition at the time plaintiff fell. The evidence is by no means conclusive that the condition of the walk which resulted in plaintiffs fall was caused by a thaw within a day or two prior thereto which materially changed the rough and dangerous condition, which, as said, had existed for at least four days. At least, the question was for the jury.”</p>

There the assumed constructive notice ran from 3 o’clock of a Monday afternoon to 6 o’clock of the Tuesday afternoon immediately following. The accident happened in the large metropolis of Philadelphia with its interminable stretches of sidewalks so that, as the Court indicated: “It could not be reasonably said that the city would have violated its duty to inspect its 4,000 miles of sidewalk, and where the snow had not been cleared away from them, to cause its removal between three o’clock Monday afternoon and six o’clock on Tuesday evening when the plaintiff fell. Such a lapse of time is not sufficient to visit the city with constructive notice of the alleged defective condition of the pavement: Swan v.

This again would be a question of fact for the jury. It cannot be said as a matter of law that Mrs. Solinsky was negligent because she went out at night to attend church services and that she traversed a dangerous lane when no less dangerous route was indicated. There is no evidence that she did not proceed with caution in the circumstances.

It was for the jury to determine whether or not plaintiff exercised proper care in passing over the crosswalk at this intersection, notwithstanding its icy condition. She was not obliged to remain at home merely because the city failed to keep open its sewer and remove an obstruction from its streets, on the pain that if she ventured upon the sidewalks or streets and was injured through the negligence of the municipality she cannot recover: Evans v.
