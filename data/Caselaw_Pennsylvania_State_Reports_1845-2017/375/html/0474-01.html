      <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>It does not here appear that plaintiff as an individual or in his representative capacity had any grievance to be redressed or any right to assert that would not be common to the public at large in Luzerne County. The alleged failure of defendants to inspect systematically and thoroughly the conduct of primaries and elections and to investigate election frauds is something that affects the good government of the county and the welfare of all the citizenry. There is nothing to show that plaintiff is more peculiarly affected thereby than others or that he has suffered any injury different in kind from that of the general public.</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[271,1007,1154,1309]],["BL_503.1",503,[177,354,1154,1531]]]'>There are other reasons why the complaint in these proceedings must fail. Mandamus lies only to compel the performance by a public officer of a ministerial duty and, while there undoubtedly are some duties imposed by law upon county boards of election that are purely ministerial, it is gravely doubtful whether the inspection of the conduct of primaries and elections and the investigation of election frauds do not involve the exercise of a broad range of discretion in the manner and extent of their performance. Moreover, a fatal objection to the granting of the relief here sought is the fact that, as stated in 55 C.J.S., 109, 110, §66: “The ordinary office of the writ of mandamus is to coerce the performance of single acts of specific and imperative duty, . . .; and ordinarily it is not an appropriate remedy to compel a general course of official conduct or a long series of continuous acts, to be performed under varying conditions, . . .”. To this there is added in 34 Am. Jur. 864, §74: “It is plain that where the court is asked to require the defendant to adopt a course of official action, although it is a course required by statute and imposed upon the official by law, it would be necessary for the court to supervise, generally, his official conduct, and to <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>determine in numerous instances whether he has, to the extent of his power, carried out the mandate of the court. It would in effect render the court a supervising and managerial body as to the operation and conduct of the activity to which the writ pertains, and so keep the case open for an indefinite time to superintend the continuous performance of the duties by the respondent. Accordingly, the writ will not issue to compel the performance of a series of acts by a judicial officer;. . . nor to compel performance of other acts of a continuous nature.” That mandamus will not lie to compel the pursuance of a general course of official conduct and the performance of continuous duties has been generally held: <em>Murphey v. Brock, </em><a href="/ga/206/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="206 Ga. 9" data-case-ids="248064" data-case-paths="/ga/206/0009-01">206 Ga. 9</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20S.E.2d%20564" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="55 S.E.2d 564">55 S.E. 2d 564</a>; <em>Diamond Match Co. v.

It is obvious that to mandamus these defendants to perform the duties of their office which are set forth in the complaint would be to make the court a continuing supervisor of not only the good faith but also the ability with Avhich they Avill hereafter perform the duties of their office, for it is to be noted that the complaint does not contemplate an order upon them to act with reference to some past event, but rather to behave themselves in the future. That, of course, is not the proper function of a mandamus.</p>
