    <p id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.11",377,[209,1062,1147,821]]]'>This is an action of trespass brought by John Ignatowicz and his wife, Josephine, for damages on account of injuries received by the wife-plaintiff on March 18, 1950 when she fell on defective steps constructed by the City of Pittsburgh. Mrs. Ignatowicz owned and occupied certain property known and numbered as 35 Hartford Street, which abuts Hartford Street on the westerly side. Hartford Street is an open unimproved street 30 feet wide, within the City limits. A number of years ago, because of the very steep grade of the street, the City erected wooden steps in the middle of the cartway. By a general ordinance relating to streets not otherwise covered by special ordinance, 6 feet on either side of Hartford Street is reserved for sidewalks and 18 feet is set aside for cartway.</p>
    <p id="b377-7" data-blocks='[["BL_377.12",377,[209,1905,1146,420]]]'>The steps in question were erected 13 feet from the western edge of the street; that is, they were not built in the 8 foot area reserved for sidewalk but had been constructed in what would normally be the cartway. The front wall of the wife-plaintiff’s house and also the front walls of the adjoining houses along the street are built flush with the building line or western edge of the street.</p>

      <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>Sometime prior to March 18, 1950 (no evidence wag available exactly when), a porch was erected which extended 5 feet into the 6 foot area reserved for sidewalk. In front of the porch the 8 foot space extending ont to the steps was fenced in by hedges and converted into a front yard. The wife-plaintiff fell when one of these steps contiguous to her yard gave way as she was descending the stairway. The present appeal is from the refusal of the lower court to remove the compulsory nonsuit which the trial judge granted on the ground that the plaintiffs were under a primary duty to repair this portion of the steps.</p>

    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[172,630,1147,767]]]'>The rationale of all of these decisions is that the duty imposed upon abutting owners arises out of actual dominion and control over property adjoining a sidewalk rather than ownership of a fee in the soil. It is only just and reasonable to allow the risks and burdens incident to ownership to fall on those who enjoy benefits through occupancy and control. The plaintiffs in the instant case have for some undetermined number of years enjoyed a lawn and porch contiguous to these steps which afford the means of ingress and egress to and from their property, and it now comes with ill grace for them to disclaim liability because the intervening ground appropriated and occupied by them is laid out as a cartway.</p>

As a consequence of this invitation, Mrs. Ignatowicz suffered serious injuries. Charging Mrs. Ignatowicz with “ill grace” is simply adding gratuitous insult to fortuitous injury.. Under the Agreed Statement of Facts in the case the defendant City admitted that: “The defective condition of said step <em>existed for a long period of time, with direct knowledge of the City of Pittsburgh </em>of said defective condition as a result of petitions of the property owners for the repair of the same and direct contact in connection therewith with City council.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
