Appellee, on the contrary, maintains that the purchase price is definitely fixed by clause “2 a” of the agreement (unaffected by any other of its provisions), to wit: payment of <em>“at least </em>$150 per month for a period of 15 years”, viz.: $27,000. <em>Standing alone </em>this clause (if the phrase “at least” be eliminated) undoubtedly constituted a definite and unequivocal contract. But clause “2 a” must be read <em>in conjunction </em>with clauses “2 b” and “3”. If the survivor elects to pay in instalments under option “2 a”, which he did, but desires to liquidate his indebtedness at any time during the 15 year period, he is permitted to do so by paying 40% of the net worth as of December 31 <em>“preceding the </em>death”, with credit given for all instalments theretofore paid. Had appellee elected to pay for the stock in a <em>lump </em>sum, instead of in instalments, he would, under clause “2 b”, have been able to liquidate his obligation by paying appellants 33-1/3% of the net worth of the corporation “as of the preceding December 31st”.</p>

All clauses of the agreement must be read in conjunction with each other and the document construed in its entirety: see former opinion and cases therein cited. In our prior decision, in the absence of evidence concerning the “net worth” of the corporation, we hypothesized such value. We used $180,000 merely by way of illustration (p. 237). An absurd result would follow. Under the court’s decision all appellee had to pay was $27,000 in instalments of . $150 a month for 15 years. Had he elected to pay in a.lump sum, he would have been required to pay 33-1/3% of such hypothetical net worth, i.e., $60,000. And if appellee elected under clause “2 a” <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>to pay in instalments, under clause “3” of tlie agreement, if he desired to anticipate payment of remaining unpaid instalments he could do so by paying 40% of such value, or $72,000, with credit for all previous instalments already made. Ordinarily a person is rewarded for anticipating payments, not penalized.</p>
    <p id="b265-3" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[196,686,1147,647]]]'>Furthermore “2 b” provided ascertainment of net worth <em>“as of the preceding December 31st” </em>while clause “3” stipulated “December 31st <em>preceding the death”. </em>It has been contended the words “as of the preceding December 31st” mean from the <em>“date of the agreement”. </em>Appellants maintain, to the contrary, these words plainly referred to the <em>death of testator■, </em>not the date of the agreement. It was for these reasons that we considered that proof of surrounding facts and circumstances might shed light upon the words of the agreement. Since no such evidence is before us, interpretation and construction must be made without such aid.</p>
    <p id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[197,1353,1147,378]]]'>The court below, from the corporate balance sheets and tax returns, fixed the “net worth” of the corporation on both dates. On December 31, 1942 (relating to date of agreement), the figure was $50,934.37 (in plaintiffs’ exhibit 4, p. 122a, $50,944.37) and on December 31, 1948 (relating to the date of death), it was “approximately $102,000”.</p>
    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.7",265,[198,1741,1147,596]],["BL_266.1",266,[254,343,1147,871]]]'>Construing the agreement in its entirety, it is manifest that the parties did not intend to covenant that the purchase price of the stock of the decedent should be $27,000 payable in monthly instalments of $150 over 15 years. It seems incredible that the parties would have agreed that the appellee would be penalized if he paid in a lump sum or anticipated payment of instalments. Such contention also overlooks entirely the words <em>“at </em>least” in clause “2 a”. Should the net worth of the corporation, however, be determined in relation to <em>date of death, </em>fixed by the court <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>below at “approximately $102,000”, the intention of tbe parties then appears clear. Appellants’ one half of $102,000 would be $51,000. Such consideration may be paid in instalments of <em>“at </em>least” $150 per month over a period of 15 years. Such instalments therefore must be made in such amounts and in such additional sums as will be necessary to liquidate the indebtedness within 15 years. By the agreement, appellee had the election to accelerate the payment of such instalments by paying 40% of the net “net worth” of the corporation or $40,800 (instead of $51,000) with credit for all instalments theretofore paid. But if appellee had elected to pay the whole consideration in a lump sum he could do so by paying 33-1/3% of such net worth or $34,000. Such a contract is understandable and obviously is what the words indicate.</p>
    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[251,1235,1149,1040]]]'>Apparently appellee’s contention is that should it be held that the consideration was not definitely fixed at $27,000, the “net worth” of the corporation must be considered in relation to the <em>date of the contract </em>and not the date of the death. The value at that date was fixed by the court below at $50,934.37. Appellants’ half interest would therefore have been $25,467.19. Even under this theory appellee would have thus been paying $27,000 as the consideration, $1,532.81 more than such value thus calculated. In the absence of surrounding facts and circumstances it clearly appears, from the language of the agreement, that the parties intended to pay the value existing <em>at date of death. </em>Had the parties intended that the consideration should be a specified sum they would have so provided. The fact that on December 4, 1941, appellants’ testator agreed to sell his stock for $10,000, has no relation to its value at the date of the agreement, April 21, 1943, or at the date of death, April 29,1949.</p>
