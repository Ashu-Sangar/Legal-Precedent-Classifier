Under its provisions $1,000 was bequeathed to a cemetery association for perpetual care of the burial lot. All clothing, furniture, household goods and personal effects were bequeathed to decedent’s daughter Florence. The residue was divided as follows: two thirds absolutely to the daughter Florence. The remaining one third was placed in trust for the daughter’s two children, Herbert L. May and Marion May Linton. There are contingent provisions relating to possible deaths of the daughter and her two children without leaving issue, whereupon the daughter’s husband, Harry L. May, is given a life estate with remainder to surviving children of the deceased son (the contestants).

Decedent informed them that she did not want any of her money to go to the family of the widow of the son and that she was not leaving anything to contestants because with their shares in her late husband’s trust and under their father’s will they would be amply provided for. Mr. May testified that he made elaborate notes of her instructions. Later in his office in Steuben-ville, Ohio, Mr. May testified that he drafted the will in accordance with her instructions and on February 2, 1946, he went over, the draft with decedent item by item, and. every paragraph' was carefully discussed and explained. He further testified that he requested decedent to call her bank and have them recommend a Pittsburgh firm of attorneys. Decedent did this and one of the leading firms of Pittsburgh, that of Reed, Smith, Shaw and McClay was selected. Mr. May testified that a lawyer in Steubenville told him that James H. Beal,.

Neither decedent nor Mr. May had ever met either Mr. Beal or Mr. Ittel before this time. Decedent was conducted by Mr. May into Mr. Ittel’s office. It was testified by Mr. Ittel that for approximately an hour he went over the will with decedent alone in his office. He said that decedent told him what she wanted to do with her property and who were the members of her family and why she was making this testamentary disposition; she also told him the reason for her exclusion of contestants because they would jointly receive from decedent’s husband’s trust and from their father approximately $1,000,000. Mr. Ittel further testified that after going over the will carefully with decedent she expressed her satisfaction with it. Mr. Ittel then called in his secretary, Miss Esther S. Sehucker. Decedent executed the instrument and Mr. Ittel and the secretary signed it as witnesses in her presence and in the presence of each other. As subscribing witnesses they later proved their signatures at the probate of the will.</p>
    <p id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[251,1458,1144,651]]]'>After executing the will decedent, in company with Mr. May and his son, went to the trust department of the Union Trust Company, in the same building as the offices of Beed, Smith, Shaw and McClay. She there left the will, and took a receipt, and the document was placed in the bank’s vault for safe keeping. The following day the bank mailed a letter to decedent, acknowledging receipt of the new will and enclosed the old 1936 will. The will remained in the bank until after decedent’s death on April 11, 1947 (about fourteen months). Meantime decedent had retained a carbon copy of the will.</p>

No witness of either proponents or contestants testified that Mr. or Mrs. May had ever men<a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>tioned in their hearing the subject of will or testamentary disposition. Certainly no evidence of importunity to make any testamentary disposition by any of proponents appears in the record. The circumstantial evidence is substantially as follows: Decedent’s maid, Minnie Byrd, said Mrs. May ivas “always bossy and domineering” toward her mother; that in April or May 1946, after the Mays left, decedent said to her, “The May’s made me do something, and won’t let me change it.” Also, “I would like to change my will, but, they will think I am crazy.” Gertrude Tucker, a nurse, testified that in January, 1946 she heard loud talking coming from the living room (where decedent was with her daughter and son-in-law) and later said decedent told her “that she wished she could undo what she had done.” Agnes Maloney, another nurse, said that Mrs. May was importuning her mother to give her a <em>letter of attorney </em>to sign checks but that decedent refused to do so. Ina Johnson, a nurse, testified that Mrs. May was rude, abrupt and argumentative with her mother. She also testified that she had found torn check stubs in a waste basket after decedent’s death, indicating that checks had been drawn by decedent to the order of the son’s widow and to contestants, but had been destroyed by the daughter. There was also testimony that one of the contestants had endeavored to cash the checks at the bank, the day after the death, but could not do so because of decedent’s death. Catherine Dillon, another nurse, who daily bathed and massaged decedent, said that on the day, February 6, 1946, when decedent executed the will, she was crying and unsettled and said she was going to town with Mr. May and her grandson because “she had to go.” Elizabeth Boe, a nurse at a hospital where decedent was a patient from October 17, 1946 until early January, 1947 testified that the daughter <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>Florence was a patient in another room in the hospital and telephoned her mother, permitting her to believe she was in Steubenville; that she directed the nurse not to permit the son’s widow to visit her mother except in the presence of a member of the May family; Lila C. Carney, a beautician, said she heard frequent arguments between the mother and daughter <em>but on cross-examination did not relate a single incident wherein the daughter had prevailed. </em>She also testified that the daughter, after the death, attempted to bribe her to become proponents’ witness. Dennis Robinson, decedent’s chauffeur, testified that the daughter was bossy and domineering toward her mother; Marie Labuda, a hospital nurse, heard the daughter call her mother “an old fool” and that when her mother would not do as the daughter wanted she would use profane language towards the mother. Mr. Ruslander, a highly reputable member of the Allegheny County bar, who had been decedent’s attorney, testified that after the son’s death he made a condolence call, and she told him that she knew of her late son’s dissatisfaction with the 1936 will but that she was going to correct this by a codicil or by gifts. The above testimony constituted the basis of this will contest.</p>

It is true that the opinion intimates, if it does not directly state, that this fact did not impose upon him the burden of showing that no improper influence controlled the making of the will, and this because there was no claim that the testatrix’s intellect had been weakened. It might readily be pointed out in that connection that bodily infirmity may well render one quite as amenable to undue influence as weakness of mind, since a person suffering from grievous physical disability is not likely to be any better able to withstand the pressure of argument and coercion by a dominant personality but, on the contrary, would be more resigned to seeking peace at any price; indeed the authorities recognize this and declare that, even though a person has testamentary capacity, if he is so <em>physically infirm or </em>mentally weak as to be susceptible to undue influence, and a substantial part of his estate is left to one occupying a confidential relation to him, the burden is upon the <em>latter </em>to show that no improper influence controlled the making of the will: <em>Phillips’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/244/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="244 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1003479" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0035-01">244 Pa. 35</a>, 43, 44, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20A.%20457" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="90 A. 457">90 A. 457</a>, 460, 461; <em>Schwartz’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/340/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="340 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1203351" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0170-01">340 Pa. 170</a>, 173, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.2d%20374" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="16 A.2d 374">16 A. 2d 374</a>, 375; <em>Lewis Will, </em><a href="/pa/364/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="364 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1223518" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0225-01">364 Pa. 225</a>, 233, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%2080" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="72 A.2d 80">72 A. 2d 80</a>, 85.

What possible reason? Ever since their birth the testatrix had been devoted to these two grandchildren. One of them was named after her. They visited her frequently. She was proud of them. After her son’s death she expressed herself as being worried what would become of them. She manifested at all times profound interest in their schooling, their clothing, and their social lives. She gave them gifts from time to time and on <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>one occasion gave an automobile (over the strenuous opposition of Mrs. May) to one of them. When they came to see her she hugged them. All the testimony is to the effect that she idolized them. Why did she disinherit these two young girls in favor of the adult May children? Mr. May, the lawyer son-in-law, who undertook to advise her in regard to her will and actually drafted it, thought it advisable to write into the will of his own accord, and not at the instigation or instruction of the testatrix herself, an alleged reason. It is no wonder that he thought this advisable for appearance sake, since he was acting as lawyer-scrivener of a will in which, of an estate of the value of approximately $600,000, two-thirds was being bequeathed to his wife, Avith a contingent reversion to himself, and the remaining one-third to his children, and Avith the two children, Stephanie and Ann, standing in the same relation to the testatrix as his own children completely disinherited, and Avith his Avife named as sole executrix. Mr. May, as will later further appear, was extremely conscious of the fact, and disquieted by it, ■that his conduct and that of his wife Avere such as were bound to give rise to the charge of undue influence. But, ironically enough, the “reason” which Mr. May thus wrote into the Avill in an attempt to explain such an obviously peculiar action on the part of the testatrix was transparently false and even ridiculous. What Mr. May wrote was as MIoavs: “I having heretofore made substantial gifts to Stephanie Frank and Ann Frank, children of my deceased son, Herbert I. Frank, and being satisfied they will also be assured of ample funds from the estate of my deceased husband, Abraham Frank, I therefore give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate” etc. (■to the May family). But apart from the fact that the testatrix, well knowing, of course, of what Stepha<a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>nie and Ann were thus “assured,” had nevertheless in all the wills she had previously written provided in none of them for less than one-third of her estate to go to her son and then to his children, — apart, I say, from that fact, the May children had received at least as much as these two children as gifts from the testatrix during her lifetime, and the May family shared equally in the Abraham Frank Estate. Indeed, without burdening this opinion with the detailed figures, the fact is that, of the moneys descending from the testatrix (if her present will is sustained) and from her deceased husband, the May children will ultimately acquire and succeed to the sum of approximately $1,750,000; the two children of Herbert, on the other hand, will ultimately acquire, of all the moneys similarly descending from the testatrix and her husband, a maximum amount of approximately $880,000. It is needless, therefore, to point out the absurdity- — ■ not to say effrontery, — of the attempt to give such an obviously sham justification for testatrix’s leaving the one-third portion of her estate to her daughter’s children (after having given their mother the other two-thirds), and nothing to her son’s children, on the ground that the latter were amply provided for, notwithstanding the fact that the May children, to whom the one-third of the estate was being given, were <em>twice as well </em>“amply provided for”! And Mr. May in face of that same fact, had the boldness to testify that the testatrix told him, as an explanation of her action, that “I think the children (Herbert’s children) are well enough taken care of or will be and I see no reason <em>why your family should not he just as well taken care </em>of.”!</p>

This purported justification for the disinheritance is quite as puerile and obviously false as the other one. It is probably quite true that originally the testatrix looked with disfavor upon the marriage of her son who had remained a bachelor and lived with her until his middle life, but her feeling was against his marrying at all, as is perhaps not unnatural with mothers under such circumstances, and was not directed in any way against the woman he had selected to be his wife. As a matter of fact the testatrix had bought for the married couple a house costing at least $26,000 as a wedding present, and subsequently she gave Rose from time to time gifts aggregating $30,000. The relationship between mother and daughter-in-law was described by all the witnesses who either lived as intimates in the testatrix’s household or attended her in her illnesses, as most friendly and affectionate. It was not the testatrix but Mrs. May herself who had animosity against Rose, — an animosity so great that she even tried to prevent Rose from visiting the testatrix (as Rose did nearly every day) whenever the latter was a patient in the hospitals. It was testified that the testatrix phoned to Rose every morning, and on one occasion she expressly said that while she did not approve of the marriage at the time, Rose had turned out to be a wonderful wife and a wonderful mother. Even the trial judge made a finding to the effect that the testatrix had “accepted Rose Buck as her daughter-in-law and that a warm, friendly, and perhaps affectionate relationship had grown up between them.” But what is of far greater importance is the fact that the testatrix was not obliged, even if she did desire to prevent Rose from getting any of her money, to disinherit her son’s children. Certainly even a first-year law student could <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>have advised the testatrix that she coiild make a bequest to a trustee to pay them the income for their lives and, at their death, the principal to their issue or to any other persons she might choose to designate, and without therefore the slightest possibility of Rose sharing in such a legacy. But, as we shall see later, neither Mr. May nor Mr. Ittel did so advise her, the former because he obviously did not want her to have such information, and the latter because it was not his duty nor his function to do so.</p>
    <p id="b179-3" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[193,923,1150,652]]]'>Having thus shown the utter futility of Mr. May’s attempt to advance reasons for the testatrix’s disinheritance of Herbert’s children, and that in fact no such reasons could possibly have existed, the question accordingly persists: Why did she do it?

Leo Ruslander, Esq., an esteemed and respected member of the bar, had long been an intimate friend of the testatrix and her husband. He was for many years associated in the office of A. Leo Weil, Esq., where most of the testatrix’s former wills had been written. In 1930, four months after her son’s marriage, she had, in the will then made, given as much as one-half of her estate to her son for life and at his death to his children if any, but in subsequent wills she had left only one-third of her estate to her son and at his death to his children, and Herbert had frequently protested that his family should receive one-half of the estate the .same- as his sister, Mrs. May. <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>About ten days after Ms death, on January 15, 1946, Mr. Ruslander paid the testatrix a condolence visit, and she apparently poured out her heart to him. He had prepared for her, and was of course familiar with, her last previous will in 1936. She expressed to him a feeling of regret that she had provided therein only a third instead of an equal half of her estate for Herbert and his children, said she was sorry she had not changed her will during his lifetime in accordance with his request, and told him she intended to do something about it now that he was dead. So far, therefore, from any wholly incredible intention on her part to cut out Herbert’s children now of all times when they had lost their father, she expressed to this intimate confidant her intention to give them even more than the one-third of her estate provided in her previous wills. And yet we are asked to believe that, of her own free volition, only five days later, on January 20 or within a day or two thereafter, in an interview between her and her daughter and son-in-law, without coercion, persuasion or even so much as a suggestion on their part, she not only gave instructions for the preparation of a new will which would not increase the legacy to Herbert’s children of one-third of the estate, but, on the contrary, would take even that share away and disinherit them altogether!</p>

As against these witnesses, the Mays did not produce a single person who had any sustained relations whatever with the testatrix, — not one of her relatives, friends or close acquaintances. The servants, the chauffeur, the nurses, all testified to conduct on the part of Mrs. May in her interviews with her mother consisting of outbursts of temper, scorn and vilification, thereby creating an emotional, mental and physical strain beyond the testatrix’s endurance and such that after these exhausting sessions she would sob and be so prostrated that her physician was forced to warn Mrs. May against subjecting her mother to these altercations. Mrs. Byrd, the testatrix’s personal maid, testified that Mrs. May called her mother a “damned old fool” even at the moment when they were putting her on a stretcher to take her to the hospital, that after Mrs. May’s visits the testatrix would be nervous and slump in her chair as if she would just as soon die as live, and would cry for days, and that all the arguments that occasioned this condition were about testatrix’s “money, money, money.” Mrs. Tucker, a nurse, testified that there was always loud talk and berating of her mother by Mrs. May, and that the night after the very session which occurred sometime between January 20th and 25th at which the alleged instructions in regard to the will were given, the testatrix was deeply agitated, depressed <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>and crying. Mrs. Maloney, another nurse, testified that the testatrix said to her, “Oh, Mrs. Maloney, if Florence would only leave me alone.” Miss Johnson, a nurse, testified that Mrs. May’s visits left her mother crying, weak, upset and exhausted, and that it would take two or three days for her to recuperate. She described how, against the testatrix’s protestations, Mrs. May insisted on getting from her a power of attorney on a morning when, in the hospital, she was a very sick woman, violently vomiting, tired, sad, discouraged and “weepy.” Mrs. Carney, a beautician, who knew the testatrix intimately for twelve years, testified that she told her that “She (Mrs. May) is my own daughter but I hate the way she takes charge of things and takes possession.” Miss Labuda, a nurse, testified that there were repeated arguments in which Mrs. May called her mother a fool, indulged in curses, and left the testatrix upset, crying and even vomiting. Robinson, the chauffeur, testified to noisy, boisterous arguments between Mrs. May and the testatrix about money matters.</p>

After she had succeeded in obtaining the power of attorney she made out checks, each for $3,000, to herself, to her husband, to her son, to her daughter, and to each of her daughter’s two infant children. Shortly thereafter the testatrix herself made out checks, each for $3,000, to Herbert’s children, Stephanie and Ann. The four checks which Mrs. May made out to herself, her husband and each of her children, were cashed, but she succeeded in having the two checks to Herbert’s children held up on the ground, not justified by the fact, that there was not enough money in bank to meet them. Incidentally, Mrs. May’s daughter attempted to cash the two checks to <em>her </em>children the very day after the testatrix died, concealing that fact from the bank. The testatrix, pathetically eager to make sure that Herbert’s children would obtain the money covered by the two checks, wrote on one of the stubs: “Be sure to pay this and above check whether I am here or not. Mother.” The stubs on one of which this inscription was written were found in a waste basket torn in pieces, under circumstances which clearly point to their having been destroyed by Mrs. May. It is of interest to note in this same connection that in the ease of a cheek which the testatrix gave to her daughter-in-law with which to buy a car for Stephanie, the testatrix told her to cash it immediately before Florence (Mrs. May) found out about <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>it, — thus again showing a complete fear of her daughter.</p>

A very few days later — sometime between January 20 and 25th according to Mr. May’s testimony — there occurred the visit of Mr. and Mrs. May to the testatrix at which it is clear, as will appear from her own subsequent declarations, that she was bullied into disinheriting these grandchildren. The interview was an extremely tumultuous one. Two witnesses testified that Mrs. May’s voice was especially loud and harsh. The Mays state that the only subject for discussion was whether the testatrix should give half of her estate to Mrs. May and half to the latter’s children, or two-thirds to Mrs. May and a third to her children. It would not seem that the decision of that question would require a long and acrimonious argument, since that Avas a relatively minor matter for the Mays themselves to decide and one as to Avhich the testatrix Avould have had no particular feeling or interest, while Mrs. May testified that she herself did not care about it one Avay or the other.

The other interesting point is that Mr. May admits that the testatrix never <em>expressly </em>said she did not want Herbert’s children to get anything, but that he merely <em>inferred </em>that from the fact that she said she wanted to change the one-third to Herbert and that the question was whether to make it half and half or one-third and two-thirds, Mr. May’s <em>inference </em>being that this question related to a division, not between his family and Herbert’s children, but between his wife and their own children. When we have in mind the testimony of Mr. Ruslander as to what the testatrix told him concerning her intentions in regard to her will, the loud shouting of Mrs. May in the discussion becomes readily understandable. It is no doubt true that the Mays were correct when they testified that the subject of the bitter discussion was the choice between a division of the estate half and half or two-thirds and one-third, but not, as they assert, as determining a division between Mrs. May and her children but between the May branch of the family and Herbert’s branch, and it is no wonder that it took a prolonged time of shouting and intimidation of this sick and harassed woman to make her not only recede from her intention to increase the former share that would have come to Herbert’s children but, on the contrary, take away from them entirely what in all her previous wills she had provided for her son and them.</p>

This is one of the most telling facts in .this case. If the testatrix told Mr. May, as he claims that she did, that she did not want Rose to get any of her money and was therefore leaving all of it to the Mays, certainly any disinterested lawyer performing his duty would have immediately pointed out to her the very simple way in which she could have accomplished her desire without disinheriting these children. Mr. May is guilty of what must have been a deliberate concealment on his part of this obvious solution of any such problem, so that it clearly appears that, at best, the will here in controversy is not the will of an instructed Anna Frank, but of an Anna Frank grossly deceived by the intentional silence of her attorney trying to get her money for Ms own family.

The testatrix’s faithful chauf<a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>feur having been dismissed for the day, it was Mr. May and his son who, without consulting her doctor or her nurse, took her to Mr. Ittel’s office in their car. Never since her son’s death had she left her apartment except attended by her nurse. Nurse and servants give us a graphic picture of the condition in which she was when taken away and of her attitude toward the coercive pressure that was being imposed upon her. Three such witnesses, all wholly disinterested, testified that she was extremely weak, that she had to be supported in order to walk, and that she was nervous, distraught and extremely upset. One of her nurses warned her that, in her opinion, she was not in a fit condition to go to town; she was nervous and crying and “really wasn’t herself,” but she insisted that she was going <em>because she had to go. </em>She told another of her nurses that Mr. May and his son were taking her to town, <em>that she did not want to go, but she had to go. </em>We shall see later what she said upon her return. She had to be supported by the May father and son on either side when they took her into Mr. Ittel’s office. They waited in the corridor outside while the interview between Mr. Ittel and the testatrix took place. There are certain facts that must be borne in mind in connection with Mr. Ittel’s testimony in regard to that interview. The first is that he was <em>not the testatrix’s laioyer </em>nor employed as such. Indeed, why would the testatrix have wanted or needed Mr. Ittel or any other attorney? Mr. May had drafted her will and the only important change made from the wills drawn by her previous lawyers was to take away the legacy of the one-third of the estate from Herbert’s children and transfer it to Mr. May’s children. Why, then, as far as the <em>testatrix’s </em>interest was concerned, would she have required an additional lawyer? The second point to be remembered is that Mr. Ittel knew nothing what<a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>ever about the testatrix, of ber advanced age, of the strokes and illnesses she had suffered, of her distressed mental and emotional condition since the death of her son, of her family life, of the stormy interview between her and the Mays and of what transpired there, of Mrs. May’s relations with her mother, or of any of the other facts and circumstances that an adequate interview would have disclosed if conducted by the client’s <em>own </em>lawyer. But Mr. Ittel was not engaged by or for the testatrix in order to represent <em>her </em>interests but by and for Mr. May to represent <em>his </em>interest, — to be a witness for <em>him. </em>She made some statements to Mr. Ittel about her family, he read her the draft of the will and inquired whether that was what she wanted, and she said that it was. He, like Mr. May, made no attempt to inform her — to give her the all-important legal advice — that if she really did not want her daughter-in-law to share in her money, that purpose could be readily accomplished without any necessity whatever of disinheriting these grandchildren. To instance how loose and casual the conversation between them must have been, Mr. Ittel testified that he gleaned from what she told him that Herbert’s children were each getting one-half million dollars from her husband’s estate, which, of course, was absurdly untrue. The will having been signed and witnessed, Mr. May and his son entered and took her home. Mr. Ittel never had any illusion as to his not representing the testatrix and did not send her a bill for his services. He did not send Mr. May a bill because, as he stated, he knew it was a considerable estate and, “as all lawyers do,” he felt he wanted to attract “that business” into the office. What I would emphasize is that, human nature being what it is, the testimony of Mr. Ittel, however conscientiously given, must be appraised as coming from ah <em>interested </em>witness, — interested be<a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>cause of Ms having been employed by and for Mr. May, interested because of his natural professional pride in satisfactorily performing the duty for which he had been engaged, interested because his office was engaged in the trial of the case on behalf of the Mays. Was the court below, and is this court, justified in reversing the verdict of the jury when the only issue involved was a purely factual one and this star witness for the Mays, like all their other witnesses, was not a disinterested one, so that it is no wonder he did not carry conviction with the jury as he undoubtedly would and should have done had he been the <em>testatrix’s </em>lawyer instead of <em>Mr. May’si</em>

She told Mrs. Tucker, one of her nurses, that she regretted something she had done and <em>wished </em>she could undo it but that <em>the Mays would not let her. </em>One of her previous struggles with her daughter was when the latter had practically <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>hammered her into giving her a power of attorney. She had told several of her nurses that if she gave Mrs. May a power of attorney she would not have a cent left, and when she was finally obliged to give in, she handed the executed instrument to Robinson, her chauffeur, saying, “Well, Dennis, here I go.” And to Mrs. Carney, the friend who served her as a beautician, she said: “They will make me do what they want now.” After the session with the Mays in the late January already described, Mrs. Tucker, her nurse, testified that she was crying and said to her, “You don’t know what I go through.” Is all this the language of one who has been <em>peacefully persuaded </em>by argument into making suggested provisions in her will? On the contrary, it is the voice of the testatrix herself, a voice now from the dead, saying to her intimates around her, not easily or lightly but with sobs and obvious mental distress, that she was dominated and bullied into doing things that she did not want to do. And she said the same thing in regard to the very will now in question.</p>

The shackles once placed upon her could not thus be broken. She herself said that Mrs. May <em>icould not allow her to make another will.</em>

For instance I have not referred to the testimony in regard to Mrs. May’s several attempts to induce the contestants’ witnesses, — the testatrix’s maid, chauffeur, and beautician — to testify on her side; Mrs. Carney, the beautician, stated that she said to her, “I will make it worth your while if you do.” I merely allude also in passing to the fact that when Mrs. Gallinger, the aged sister of the testatrix, refused to testify for Mrs. May, Mr. May wrote her a harsh letter stating that they would no longer make her the monthly payments which they had been sending her in accordance with the express request of the testatrix that they should take care of their “Aunt Net and Aunt Bert.” Here, too, as in the case of the tearing up of the stubs of the checks to Herbert’s children, they were showing how much they cared about carrying out the solemn adjurations of their deceased mother. It is noteworthy that they were unable to procure a single worthwhile witness among the relatives, friends, maids, nurses, chauffeur, and other intimates of the testatrix, who would testify on their behalf, and would say that Mrs. May’s relations with her mother and her conduct toward her and domination over her were other than as testified to by all the witnesses.</p>

And this, aided by her husband’s failure to perform his professional duty, she accomplished, not by legitimate persuasion, but by intimidation, harshness, abuse, and terrorizing of her aged, ailing and distressed mother. To quote from the charge of the trial judge approved in the leading case of <em>Robinson v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/203/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="203 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="994779" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0400-01">203 Pa. 400</a>, 435, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.%20253" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="53 A. 253">53 A. 253</a>, 265, “I repeat, so that there shall be no mistake about it — as we have said to you a son may importune his mother to make a will in his favor, and counsel for plaintiffs has repeated various forms of appeal, which you heard, that he may make to her, to induce her to make a will in his favor. That is true, he may do so, he has a perfect right to do it, and if the only effect was to move her affections or sense of duty, or judgment, he has a perfect right to do it. But if these importunities were such as the testator <em>hadn’t the power to resist, and yielded for the salce of peace and quiet, or escaping from serious distress of mind, if they were carried to a degree by which the free play of testator’s judgment, or discretion, or wishes were overcome, it is undue influence. </em>He can coax her, but he must not drive her, either by moral coercion or physical force.” All the evidence in the present case plainly establishes that here the testatrix did not have the power to resist the importunities of these proponents of her alleged will. <em>Ser mind was not persuaded but her will was overcome. That is exactly what the law calls undue influence.</em>

With the possible exception of the children’s mother not a single one of those who testified for the contestants was an interested witness whereas every person who testified for the proponents as to any fact vital to the issue was very much interested. The jury, which obviously had this in mind, found that the will had been obtained by undue influence.
