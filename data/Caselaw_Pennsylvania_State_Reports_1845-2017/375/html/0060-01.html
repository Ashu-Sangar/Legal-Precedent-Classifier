Hoffman. The court below entered a nonsuit as to Dr. Hoffman, who was superintendent of the Allentown State Hospital. The plaintiff did not appeal from the refusal to take off the nonsuit. A verdict was returned against Dr. Risser and Dr. Daley, on which judgment was entered, and the defendants appealed from the refusal of their motion for judgment n.o.v.</p>

He was about 19 years of age and physically sound. About May 1, 1946, the plaintiff escaped from the hospital and was returned by the police on the following day. He was brought to the hospital in a manic state, violent, threatening to run away and liable to injure himself and others. His physical condition was good.</p>
    <p id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.5",86,[268,1401,1146,927]],["BL_87.1",87,[174,352,1148,934]]]'>The illness from which plaintiff was suffering is characterized by fluctuations from periods of depression, worry, loss of weight, to periods of over-activity, lack of restraint and excitability. Part of the time the patient may seem entirely normal. His emergence from one mood to another may occur suddenly. During the over-active period the patient, in common language, is a raving maniac. Plaintiff’s record at the hospital was one of furloughs in the charge of his family, stealing and wrecking of automobiles, and return from such escapades to the hospital by the police. On May 2, 1946, when the plaintiff was brought back to the hospital by the police, Dr. Risser directed the supervisor of nurses, Buck, to administer a wet pack. Having done so, the supervisor of nurses reported to Dr. Risser that the plaintiff’s physical condition was all right, but that he was violent and threatening, and <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>that there was no way of keeping him except in the pack. Thereupon Dr. Risser ordered a second wet pack. Later the supervising nurse reported to Dr. Risser that the plaintiff was still violent and threatening, but that his physical condition was good. Dr. Risser ordered the wet pack treatment continued so long as the patient was violent and maniacal, providing his physical condition remained good. All told three wet packs were administered by the nursing personnel and the attendant, the last pack being administered on May 3. These wet pack treatments differed in no way from the accepted and standard practice, not only in the Allentown State Hospital but in all other mental institutions operated and maintained by the Commonwealth. Such treatments are the most modern and humane method yet devised for the restraint of violent, raving and desperate patients.</p>

Such treatment is administered in the following manner: Sheets numbering usually six are immersed in water. They are then wrung dry, the arms are separately wrapped, and the sheets then wrapped around the body and the arms and legs, so that the patient is completely swathed in sheets from his head to the tips of his toes. Two sheets are used as ties, one placed about the body and arms in the region of the elbows and tied, and the other is tied above and below the knees. The patient is able to move his limbs but he cannot free himself. He is then immersed in a tub of water, the temperature of which <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>is controlled by a thermostat at about 94 to 96 degrees. He is kept in the water for a period of approximately six hours. He is then taken out, the sheets are removed, and he is bathed and the body rubbed with oil or grease. Fresh sheets are then applied and he is again immersed in the water. Generally the patient receives a series of these treatments, the number and duration of which depend upon his mental and physical condition.</p>
    <p id="b88-4" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[259,850,1147,816]]]'>During the time of the wet pack treatment proper practice requires the <em>nursing personnel </em>to note the temperature of the patient, the pulse rate and respiration, and make report to the physician of the patient’s condition if anything unusual occurs. While the treatments are given only on order of the physician, their administration, — that is, wrapping of the patient in sheets, the immersion in water, check of water temperature, pulse, respiration, and observation of the patient and reporting thereon to the physician, — is strictly a nursing procedure, and is performed only by the nurses and attendants. At no time are physicians present or required to be present unless the reports from the nurses and attendants indicate a necessity therefor.</p>

He testified that the mental condition of the plaintiff might require continuing the treatment without regard to the physical condition.

This, in the face of testimony produced by the plaintiff’s own experts showing that the treatment and methods employed were of long standing both in the Allentown State Hospital and elsewhere.

This Court said: “ ‘All that is shown is that the defendant did certain things and <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>failed to do other things. Bnt whether a careful, skilful, and diligent practitioner would have done otherwise, we do not know’. The plaintiff concedes the accuracy of the principle of law thus applied. It is argued, however, that a jury of laymen under the present facts could find negligence in the same manner as in any other tort action. It is urged that a lay jury might find that plaintiff’s jaw was found to have been broken, and from this fact might conclude that defendant had used unwarranted force and was therefore negligent. We disagree with such doctrine . . . Negligence may not be <em>inferred </em>by <em>laymen </em>merely because the jaw was found to have been broken. A jaw could be broken even though there was no lack of care or skill by the dentist. <em>Expert </em>testimony is necessary to establish negligent practice in any profession: . . . Wigmore on Evidence, Third Edition, Vol. VII, Sec. 2090, p. 453. As plaintiff failed to offer any <em>expert </em>witness to establish the measure of professional skill required of a dentist in extracting a tooth, she did not meet the burden of establishing, by the weight of the evidence, that defendant failed to treat her with reasonable and ordinary professional skill: [citing cases] . . . The record discloses no testimony as to the standard of care required under the circumstances and such burden was therefore not met by plaintiff.”</p>

The testimony of all the experts called on either side of the case was that this requirement was not a part of the standard and accepted practice. .</p>

Later a hospital intern was directed by the surgeon to remove the stitches and in doing so failed to remove two of them. This Court on appeal affirmed the principle that the liability of the defendant does not apply to treatment administered by floor nurses and interns in the regular course of service furnished by a hospital, and that as to all such care and attention the nurses and interns would clearly be acting exclusively on behalf of the hospital and not as assistants to the surgeon.</p>

The plaintiff’s only expert on this phase of the case, Dr. Mareks, stated that he did not “believe that infection had a thing to do to contribute to the development of the deformity [of the plaintiff’s hands]”; and testified that “the use of unsterile instrument ... to open blisters as mentioned, <em>might </em>contribute or be a contributing cause to infection, but not a contributing cause to the deformity this man has.” (Italics supplied).

Powell, now 29-years of age, apparently enjoyed good health — physical and mental — until he enlisted in the United States Army at the age of 18. After being honorably discharged from the military service for medical reasons, he returned home and obtained employment at the Bethlehem Steel Company as a chemical analyst in the testing of metal. As an infant, Powell showed aptitude in music, and in youth and young manhood learned to play, repair and tune pianos and play the trumpet. Prior to entering the Allentown State Hospital his hands were without defect or blemish and responded faithfully to the demands of his vocation and avocations of chemical analyst, musician, piano tuner, typist and carpenter. Today those hands are in ruins. Scarred, gnarled, crippled and deformed, they have lost 60% of their normal functions. The inevitable tools he needed in earning his livelihood have been practically destroyed.</p>

In the early part of May, 1946, Reynold Powell was <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>returned to the Allentown State Hospital from which he had escaped after having reportedly been beaten by an attendant. On the evening of his readmittance to the hospital Dr. Mark Risser, without examining him, ordered him to be prepared for wet packs. Powell was undressed and placed on a table. A wet sheet went tightly around each arm. Both arms were pinned ■to his sides, and four other enveloping sheets encased his body from chin to toe. Two more wet sheets, folded into ropes, were thrown about his waist and legs and knotted tightly, maximum tautness being achieved by one of the attendants placing a foot against his body and pulling against the middle. In this mummified form Powell was now tied to his bed and complete immobilization was secure.</p>
    <p id="b95-4" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[182,1186,1150,1153]]]'>As the sheets began to dry, constriction set in, which impinged on Powell’s breathing and shot pains through his chest. Powell complained but his complaints were ignored. After six hours he was released from his sheeted imprisonment but another wet-sheeted straitjacket was prepared. Powell protested but the attendant said: “We have orders to put you in another pack.” Powell was calm, weak and cooperative, but under orders of Dr. Risser the attendants again bound him tightly and again tugged at the roped sheets to achieve the last inch of adhesive closeness. No one took his pulse, no one ascertained his temperature. He was placed into a tub of warm water which soon became hot. Again Powell’s resulting protestations fell on deaf ears. Agonizing with pain, running with perspiration and tormented with unquenched thirst he screamed for relief which brought from the night supervisor the reproof: “... if you don’t shut your . . . mouth, you’ll stay in pack six hours later.” Shortly after this, Powell fainted. When he revived, it was eaidy morning.</p>

At the end of the first pack, one of Powell’s arms was in pain. At the end of the second pack, both arms were swollen and numb; his hands, which apparently received the full impact of the constriction, had “puffed” to twice their normal size. Again no doctor or nurse examined Powell at this juncture; again neither his pulse nor temperature was taken; again he was swathed in the binding sheets and again he was placed in the tub of hot water, in which he remained this time for five hours. When the vise-like sheets were removed at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, his hands were scarcely recognizable as hands.</p>

This is a cloak of argument worn to confuse the unwary. The criticism of an individual member of a class does not condemn the whole class. Doctors have appeared in court before and some have won and some have lost the lawsuits in which they have been involved, but the medical profession did not, because of that litigation, lose dignity or prestige. In fact, down through the years the medical profession has continued to advance and progress until today it is recognized and respected as the greatest benefactor of mankind since the days' of the Divine Physician who healed the side and the weary, gave sight to the blind and lifted the dead from their graves. We are concerned here only with the alleged negligence of two particular men of medicine, and not the whole field of healing in which the disciples of Aesculapius plant the seeds of health, sanity and well-being. No gardener objects to the uprooting of toxic weeds; no doctor, including the two who are defendants in this civil case, will or should object to discarding methods and practices proved more disposed to break down vital tissue than to weave it into healthy and substantial muscle and flesh.</p>

Although he testified he saw the plaintiff when he was in the first pack he did not note pulse or temperature, or see to it that they were recorded. Dr. H. F. Hoffman, superintendent of the Allentown State Hospital, testified that a patient’s <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>temperature and pulse, while, undergoing wet pack treatment, should be taken every 30 minutes.

    <p id="b98-5" data-blocks='[["BL_98.4",98,[236,582,1151,1478]]]'>It was not enough for Dr. Risser. to look at a patient once, and then commit him to the machinery of an insane asylum without some periodical supervision to assure, that the patient was not being tom between grinding gears of inattention or misbehavior. Although Dr. Risser had ordered the continuation of a very drastic treatment, he ignored the recipient of that treatment until he was brought before him for surgery after the third application of a therapeutic violence he himself had prescribed. Had he examined Powell after the second pack it is reasonable to assume he would have ordered either the discontinuation or modification of the treatment because the patient was displaying at that time vivid symptoms of distress and breakdown' from the harsh measures being employed. Dr. Risser did not even know that Reynold Powell had fainted during the ordeal of the second pack, but it was within the periphery of his- responsibility to ascertain what untoward results, if any, had followed the severe course of action he had dictated. He allowed Powell to go through the third crushing pack as a simple matter of routine: “Q. How did he get in the third pack? A. Wé consulted about this thing during the late evening, and I told Mr. Buck, ‘If this young man’s physical condition remains good and he is still violent and maniacal, you can go on with pack treatments until the following morning.”</p>

    <p id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[189,623,1149,707]]]'>Dr. Daley, the co-defendant, stated that the question as to whether a third pack should be prescribed was “a question of judgment, and at times pretty keen judgment.” In spite of the high standard of wisdom needed to determine whether the harsh scouring regimen should be continued, neither one of the defendants made any effort to apply that wisdom; The fate of a helpless young man entrusted ;to their. safekeeping was left in the hands of one without the capacity or responsibility to make the momentous decision: “Q. In this particular case, that judgment, which you say must be pretty keen, was left to the attendants? A. It was left to Mr. Buck, the night supervisor.”</p>

It was testified that the wet pack treatment is normal procedure in a mental institution and that it is freely given without anticipative mishap. Since the plaintiff’s injuries immediately followed the wet pack treatment, it is logical that he came to grief because of that treatment. Why? Was it because the wet packs were not needed at all? Was it because they were applied improperly? Was it because the patient’s condition could not withstand them? The defendants had the duty to explain. We have repeatedly held that where the thing which causes the injury is shown to be under the management of the defendant, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of events would not happen if the defendant, who has the management uses proper care, the burden is then placed on the defendant, not to explain the accident, but to show that he used due care.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">*</a> Dr. Kisser not only failed to show that he used due care, but he demonstrated with his own testimony that he omitted doing what the circumstances required him to do.</p>

Nothing can be more objectively associated with modern surgery, modern medicine and modern hospitals than the continuing, incessant sterilization of every instrument, glass, vessel and utensil which comes into contact with a patient’s malady or wound. Every school child is taught the extreme value of hygiene, every housewife knows the absolute need for cleanliness in handling all items used in feeding her infants or caring for a sick one at home. Hence, it is not necessary to introduce expert testimony to show that the use of an unsterilized knife on an open injury will cause infection. In <em>Hodgson v.
