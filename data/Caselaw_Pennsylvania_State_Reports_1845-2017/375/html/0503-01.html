The extent of such facilities necessary to meet these descriptive terms is not averred; nor is it averred that the defendant bad any information or knowledge with reference thereto. Averment is made, however, that tbe defendant’s agents falsely, intentionally and fraudulently represented at tbe time tbe premises were being inspected that tbe facilities thereon met tbe standards required by plaintiffs and that in reliance upon such representations a five-year lease beginning May 1st, 1947, was entered into.</p>

      <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>There is not the slightest donbt that if plaintiffs had merely averred the falsity of the alleged oral representations, parol evidence thereof -would have been inadmissible. Does the fact that plaintiffs further averred that these oral representations were <em>fraudulently </em>made without averring that they were <em>fraudulently </em>or by accident or. mistake <em>omitted </em>from the subsequent complete written contract suffice to make the testimony admissible? The answer to this question is “no”; if it were otherwise the parol evidence rule would become a mockery, because all a party to the written contract would have to do to avoid, modify or nullify it would be to aver (and prove) that the false representations were <em>fraudulently </em>made.</p>

Kline, </em>368 Pa., supra, plaintiffs had brought a bill in equity for an injunction to restrict defendants from violating a lease. Defendants denied the validity of the lease, contending that it had been obtained by the following false and fraudulent statements of an agent of the plaintiff: (1) that the lease would provide payments from its date; (2) that the lease would provide for payments of |300.00 a year in the event gas was obtained in paying quantities; and (3) that the lease would provide them with free gas. With'respect to this defense we said (page 519) : “The statements of the agent as to the <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>rent or royalty and the free gas, even if proved, could not, under the facts of this case, amount to fraud. This is nothing but an attempt by defendants to alter, by parol evidence, a subsequent written agreement with respect to three matters fully and specifically covered at length in the written agreement. Such an attempt, in view of our recent decisions on this subject is astonishing . . . .”</p>

There is no averment by plaintiffs that these clauses in the lease were inserted by fraud, accident or mistake; or (we repeat) that any representation was omitted by fraud, accident or mistake; or that the lease did not contain the entire contract and agreement between the parties. Merely bringing an action in trespass for deceit instead of in assumpsit for breach of contract will not suffice to circumvent the parol evidence rule. If plaintiffs relied on any understanding, promises, representations or agreements made prior to the execution of the written contract or lease, they should have protected themselves by incorporating in the written agreement the prom<a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>ises or representations upon ■which they now rely, and they should have omitted the provisions which they now desire to repudiate and nullify.</p>
