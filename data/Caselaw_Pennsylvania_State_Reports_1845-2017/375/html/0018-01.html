Notwithstanding repeated requests for action the city delayed issuing a permit, and, on April 4, 1950, it enacted an ordinance, to become effective April 14, 1950, which provided that a permit should not issue, even in the case of milk delivered pasteurized, until an examination had been made of the dairy farm where the milk Avas produced, of the receiving station or plant Avhere it was received, of the plant where it was pasteurized and bottled, and of every place Avhere it was handled.

It is self-evident that the right of property includes not only that of owning and possessing it, but also of selling and transferring it to others. No one would contend that any State or municipality would have the constitutional right to deny to a merchant the right <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>to sell, within its jurisdiction, any ordinary items of personal property, wares or merchandise not requiring supervision under the police power. The only limitation to that right as far as milk or other articles of food are concerned is that regulations to insure the purity and wholesomeness of the product may be adopted as a condition to the granting of permission for its sale or distribution. Indeed there can be no question but that, under the provision of section 18 of the Act of July 2, 1935, P. L. 589, the City of Johnstown is authorized to enact such regulations, even though they may be additional to, and more rigid than, those imposed by the federal or State authorities. But such regulations must be <em>reasonable </em>and not arbitrary and <em>absolutely prohibitive. </em>If the City of Johnstown were to inspect plaintiff’s milk, and also, if it should so desire, the places of supply from which it was obtained, and if, as a result of such inspection, the city were, in good faith, to reject plaintiff’s application for a permit, plaintiff undoubtedly would be obliged to submit to that decision. But such is not the situation here under review. The City of Johnstown refuses to malee any inspection whatever, but nevertheless, in effect, condemns plaintiff’s product, much like a court condemning a defendant without a hearing. It is obvious that if such an attitude were to be judicially sanctioned as being legally and constitutionally permissible every other municipality in the Commonwealth, as well as the Commonwealth itself, could adopt it likewise, with the result that plaintiff could be refused the right to sell its milk, although a perfectly proper object of commerce, anywhere within the entire State. Can a lawful vendor of a lawful product be legally brushed off in that manner?</p>

But there does not seem to be any case anywhere — certainly none is cited in the city’s brief — in which such claims were upheld.

The Supreme Court of New Jersey.said. (p. 463, A. p. 375) : “Respondents concede that they have no knowledge respecting the .quality of prosecutor’s milk and milk products, or the sanitary condition under which its milk is produced, handled or marketed.

The town refused the application “because it would entail too great a financial burden to inspect the source of supply,” and also because “the town had already a sufficient supply to satisfy the needs of its inhabitants.” It appeared that the plaintiff’s milk was inspected and approved by many other municipal Health Boards, including those of Newark, Paterson, Montclair, Perth Amboy, Elizabeth and Union City. The court said (p. 888, A. p. 232) : “It clearly appears that the refusal of the permit was without substance and is not predicated upon any desire to conserve the public health and safety. Mere lack of funds to investigate a source of supply is not sufficient reason to justify the refusal of a permit in view of the circumstance that there seems to have been adequate inspection by state inspectors.

Such a statute or ordinance, however, must be reasonable and not arbitrary; must not invade the fundamental liberties of the citizen; must, on the one hand, tend to accomplish the purpose of its adoption; and, on the other, must not go beyond the reasonable demands of the occasion.” The court below had stated that “ ‘It is obvious that adequate inspection is a reasonable precaution. It is obvious that considerations of convenience, efficiency and cost of inspection are proper to be taken into account in determining the question of reasonableness. It is also obvious that there is somewhere a limit of distance beyond which inspection by the city’s agents would be too inconvenient, too costly and too likely to be ineffective to be practicable. It seems to me there can be no doubt of the right of the city council to fix a reasonable limit beyond which it will not provide for inspection, and beyond which, for that reason, pasteurization plants will not be licensed. In this ordinance the limit is the boundary line of the municipality.’ ” Notwithstanding these views of the court below the Supreme Court reversed the latter’s refusal to mandamus the City of Minneapolis to grant the requested permit, saying (p. 143, N.W. p. 123) : “If the inspection fee is deemed insufficient, there appears to be no good reason why such insufficiency cannot be remedied in a manner that would impose no unjust hardship on anyone concerned. There is nothing in the record to show Avhat, if any, inconvenience the city may be put to that Avould justify such a harsh requirement as provided by the ordinance. We are obliged to hold that the ordinance, in so far as it prohibits the sale of pasteurized milk or its products in the city of Minneapolis unless the same shall have been pas<a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>teurized in a pasteurization plant located within the city limits, violated relator’s constitutional rights of property and contract.

The right to sell milk, unlike that to sell liquor, which is a privilege, should only be restricted or regulated as the safeguarding of the public health may require.” In that case the plaintiff’s permit to sell milk in the City of Louisville was refused by the Health Director on the ground that it was contrary to the policy of the city’s Health Department to grant permits to distributors of raw milk produced from plants located outside of the city or in the rural districts of the county that were at that time so operating.

Supp. 236</a>, a regulation of the Health Commissioner of Baltimore prohibited the sale or use of cream for the manufacture of ice cream in Baltimore if the cream was produced from dairies situated more than 50 miles from the city. The court held that, though the primary purpose of such a regulation may have been to insure ideal sanitary milk and cream supply for the city, the regulation was invalid as to a shipper from another state because of its being a burden on interstate commerce. It was contended that the regulation was reasonable because it was not practical, or reasonably possible, effectively to inspect the dairy production of milk at such distances, the number of available' inspectors be<a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>ing, from the standpoint of expense, necessarily limited. The court held that, apart from any question of interstate commerce, the regulation was also unreasonable as to citizens of Maryland outside the 50 mile limit provided in the regulation. The court said (p. 242) : “Milk and cream are not only necessary articles of food but are perfectly lawful subjects of commerce. They may not be excluded from the ordinary currents of trade and commerce whether interstate, or intrastate, except by regulations reasonably designed to protect the health of the community.” And further (pp. 243, 244) : “The real objection of the Health Department to the foreign cream is based on the alleged impracticability of adequate and effective supervision by its own representatives of the dairy farms which produce the milk supply from remotely situated foreign dairy plants. This of itself is not a sufficient basis for excluding the cream although very probably it would support regulations of a someAvhat different nature than those applicable to the local supply which would afford every reasonable assurance to the Health Commissioner for the protection of the health of the community. Thus in lieu of personal inspection by representatives of the Health Commissioner of Baltimore City, very probably certificates could be required from appropriate officials of other states from Avhich the cream is imported ... It is entirely possible that gradually higher and higher standards avíII be set and maintained in the different milk producing centers. But until such conditions generally prevail under which the Health Commissioner here would feel amply justified in accepting certificates of other states’ officials without personal inspection, he can still control the situation in the interests of the health of Baltimore by making such inspections of foreign dairy plants and farms by his representatives, at the expense <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>of these plants, as may be reasonably required by general regulations applicable to such foreign plants without discrimination against them in favor of the local plants. If the product of such foreign dairies does not conform to reasonable local requirements the milk can of course be excluded on that ground. In short, the police power of the State and its municipal sub-divisions can be exerted to any extent necessary to insure the health of the community against impure or unsanitary foreign cream, but it may not be exerted as a barrier against all foreign cream, even though not deleterious to health, on the mere ground that the local supply is adequate. The case does not in any way imply the necessity or obligation of the Health Commissioner to make inspection of dairy plants or farms situated so far from Baltimore that it is not reasonable or practicable to do so in view of the limited personnel of his Department. It is optional with him, within the limitation of his facilities, whether to make such foreign inspections or not. But if he finds it impracticable or inadvisable to do so, then some other form of requirement reasonably adequate to the occasion must be adopted, sufficient to protect the local health but not to constitute an impassable barrier for interstate commerce.” The court therefore held the regulation in question to be invalid.</p>

In that case the complainant dairy operated a large milk processing plant and its products were obtained from a large territory not only in Oklahoma but also in Missouri and Arkansas. Although its plant <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>and milk products were inspected by the State Health Department and by cities, state and federal inspectors, they were refused a permit by the health officer of the city to operate in Wewoka on the ground that the city could not inspect the complainant’s milk shed or the producers from whom it got its milk. The court held that a provision in an ordinance which enabled the health officer to bar milk and milk products shipped from a great distance unless he could assure himself that they met the provisions of the ordinance was an unreasonable provision. Quoting other authorities to the same effect, the court stated that milk and cream are perfectly lawful subjects of commerce and may not be excluded from the ordinary currents of trade and commerce except by reasonable regulations designed to protect the health of the community. The court pointed out further that under the action taken by the city the complainant was powerless to do anything to enable it to obtain the permit applied for, and that the city’s action constituted an impassable barrier to anyone desiring to sell milk within the City of Wewoka regardless of the standard of quality of the product. The court said (p. 290, P. p. 1060) : “Lack of means of supervision alone was not a sufficient basis for excluding the milk products of plaintiff or refusing a license . . .

The question naturally arises, — what are the alternatives the city could adopt in place of establishing such an unjust and invalid embargo? In the first place, it would be reasonable on its part to accept as satisfactory the approval given to appellant’s milk by the United States Public Health Service, the State authorities, and those of the City of Pittsburgh and the various third class cities and boroughs that have uniformly acted favorably on appellant’s applications. Or, in the second <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>place, it could conduct reasonably thorough inspections in the nature of “spot checking,” which, while sufficiently intensive and extensive to warrant reliance thereon, would not be so onerous as to be either impracticable or unduly expensive. Incidentally, in this connection, it is obvious that <em>no </em>inspection, however exhaustive, could be conclusive in its results unless each and every dairy farm were inspected each and every day of its operation, because the cleanliness that might be found there the day of the inspection might be followed by unsanitary practices the following day; in other words, any system of inspection whatever can only be relatively dependable. A third alternative open to the city, as suggested in several of the cases above cited, would be for it to impose upon plaintiff the expense arising from the alleged necessity of employing two additional milk inspectors; only in that event it should similarly impose also upon other milk producers now permitted to operate in the city the cost of inspecting the sources of <em>their </em>supply.</p>

However, apart from the fact that the city did not advance this as a reason for its refusal to grant plaintiff’s application for a permit, the fact that this inspector, according to his testimony, was directed by the head of the Department of Health, “to go out and see as many [of plaintiff’s] farms as I possibly could see and just get an overall picture of what I seen. . . . See as many as you can as fast as you can;” and the inspector himself said that he did not know what the purpose of this could be, would seem to cast some doubt upon the motivation and good faith of the inquiry thus entrusted to him. ; .</p>

If, however, plaintiff is justified in its contention that the refusal of its application for a permit to sell and distribute its milk in Johnstown was an arbitrary, unjustified and illegal withholding from it of its right so to do, a mandatory order of the court directed to the city officials to issue the permit applied for would clearly be justified under all the authorities.</p>

The record is remanded to the court below with direction to issue a writ of mandamus to compel defendants to grant to plaintiff the permit applied for, either forthwith, or, at the option of defendants, after such reasonable inspections, if any, of plaintiffs dairy farms, receiving stations and pasteurization plants, as defendants may choose to make, and upon their finding therefrom that the production, care and treatment of plaintiffs milk sufficiently comply with the sanitary regulations provided in the city’s applicable ordinance and those of the city’s Department of Health.</p>
