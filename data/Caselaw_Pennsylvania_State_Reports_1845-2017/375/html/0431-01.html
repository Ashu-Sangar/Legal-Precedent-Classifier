The court below granted the injunction and at the same time appointed an assessor to prepare an accounting of the township’s assets and liabilities as an aid in the proper disposition of the case. The township appealed to this court and we reversed the decree enjoining the defendants and remanded the record to the court below for further proceedings in connection with the apportionment prayed for: <em>Pleasant Hills Borough v. Jefferson Township, </em><a href="/pa/359/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="359 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="473149" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0509-01">359 Pa. 509</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%20697" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="59 A.2d 697">59 A. 2d 697</a>. Thereafter the assessor submitted a report containing a list of the assets and liabilities to be adjusted and valuations thereof, and fixing the relative percentages of the assessments as between the borough and the township for the year 1947 as the basis of the adjustment as prescribed by section 703 of the Act of May 4, 1927, P. L. 519. The percentage thus fixed was approximately 47% for the township and 53% for the borough. Exceptions were filed to the report of the assessor by both parties, considerable testimony was taken, and the chancellor filed an adjudication which was subsequently sustained in all respects by the court <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>in bane.

    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[249,629,1150,1367]]]'>The first of the questions in dispute arises from the fact that shortly before the incorporation of the borough the township had sold a bond issue of $325,-000, the gross proceeds of which, with premium and adjusted interest, amounted to $326,076.56. The purpose of the issue was the purchase of existing water lines, the construction of additional ones, and the procuring and maintaining of a supply of water for the residents of the township. Out of the proceeds which the township had in bank it paid the sum of $10,045.75 for maps, plans and specifications for the construction of the lines, and a few days after the incorporation of the borough, namely, on April 7, 1947, the township commissioners awarded the principal contracts for the work of construction; the contracts were executed on April 24, 1947. The court held that the liability of the township on these bonds as of April 1, 1947 (that being the time of the incorporation of the borough and therefore, under sections 701 and 702 of the 1927 Act, the date governing the apportionment of the assets and liabilities of the township) was not the sum of $325,000, the principal of the bond issue, but only the difference between that amount and the amount of the cash proceeds then in bank, namely $316,030.81.</p>

The ordinance itself which provided for the issue contained a provision appropriating all monies derived from the sale of the bonds for the purpose stated therein, and declared that they should not be used for any other purpose.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The situation, from a legal standpoint, was just the same as if the money had been trusteed for the payment of the obligations to be incurred under the contracts for the construction of the water mains. Had those contracts actually been entered into but a day before April 1, 1947 there would be no question but that the liability of the township thereunder would have offset the asset of the cash proceeds of the sale of the bonds: cf. <em>Southmont Borough v. Upper Yoder Township, </em><a href="/pa/284/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="284 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="1092081" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0287-01">284 Pa. 287</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.%20281" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="131 A. 281">131 A. 281</a>. But, since the proceeds were appropriated both in fact and in law to the obligations under the contracts to be entered into and which in fact were subsequently executed, it would seem clear that the borough cannot escape its proportionate liability for the payment of the indebtedness on the bonds merely because the contracts had not been actually let prior to April 1, 1947. It was therefore error to deduct the amount of the proceeds in bank from the amount due on the bonds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

If, as is now held, the borough is liable for its proportionate share of the bonded indebtedness, it should be entitled to a similar apportionment of the value of the water mains purchased by the proceeds of the bond issue. In our opinion these water lines, together with all such lines both in the township and the borough, and all the sewer lines as well (which we understand are located wholly within the borough) are apportionable assets.

Water lines, sewer lines, and a sewage disposal plant have an appraisable commercial or market value; they are not like property which has no productive value, such as the war memorial considered in the case of <em>Township of Baldwin v.

Indeed in each of the contracts made by the township with water companies for the operation and mainte<a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>nance of the water distribution system and “for the sale of said water system,” the township gave to the company an option, under certain conditions, to buy the system at prices determined according to a formula therein provided. Some testimony was submitted at the hearing in the court below in regard to the replacement value of the sewer lines and the sanitary treatment plant in the borough. As to the latter, the court fixed the apportionable value as $55,000 which was approximately the amount testified to by two of the expert witnesses as being the estimated cost of reconstruction of the plant. On the other hand, there was testimony that the plant was in a deplorable state of disrepair so that another expert witness testified to a value of only about $19,000, an estimate based on the alleged original cost with a deduction for deterioration. A proper valuation would be the estimated reconstruction cost but with the element of depreciation and the physical condition of the plant taken into consideration, and therefore the court was in error in failing to give weight to the evidence that certain parts of the plant require repair: <em>Borough of Hanover v. Hanover Sewer Co., </em><a href="/pa/251/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="251 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="1019674" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0095-01">251 Pa. 95</a>, 98, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.%20132" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="98 A. 132">98 A. 132</a>, 133. When the present record is remanded it will be incumbent upon the court to take such additional testimony as may be necessary to determine the apportion-able valuation as herein indicated of all the water and sewer lines in both borough and township the same as of other physical assets and properties, and to make a proper valuation of the sewage disposal plant. As to the maps, plans and specifications for which the township expended some $10,000 in connection with the construction of the water mains, they must be regarded as a part of that entire project and, if it be determined that they have any present value, an apportionment thereof must be made the same as with respect to the water system itself.</p>

The court allowed this claim in the amount of $8,064.60 and accordingly deducted that amount from the value of the building for apportionment purposes. Whatever the moral obligation may be for the payment of this claim it should have been disallowed because barred by section 704 of the 1927 act which specifically provides as follows: “Three months’ notice shall be given, by order of court, to all persons having claims against any of such townships, to present the same on or before the day therein named.

Included in those expenses was an item of $2,-000 paid to the township solicitor for professional services and costs advanced in resisting the borough incorporation. The borough contends that it should not be charged with any portion of that fee, but the township was wholly within its legal rights in contesting those proceedings and the payment thus made by it constituted a liability as of the date of the incorporation of the borough and was therefore properly subject to apportionment.</p>
