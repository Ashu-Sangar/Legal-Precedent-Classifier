      <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>On November 17, 1947, Mary Florence Sheeler and Joseph D. Snyder, the decedent, made an application for a marriage license, and on the 23rd day of November were married. Both parties were well advanced in years. This was the third marriage for the husband and the second marriage for the wife. They had a courtship of some seven or eight months prior to the marriage, and afterwards resided together in the home owned by the wife, where they lived until May, 1951, when Snyder died. His will was duly probated and under its terms the wife received nothing. She filed an election to take against the will and applied for widow’s exemption. The court below, after full hearing, dismissed her petition because of an antenuptial agreement executed on November 17, 1947.</p>

    <p id="b212-4" data-blocks='[["BL_212.5",212,[262,473,1148,319]]]'>It will be observed that the agreement contains the provisions that each of the parties had made a full and frank disclosure to the other as to the property owned by them and its nature and amount, and that each party had been advised as to their respective rights in the event of their marriage.</p>

But where the antenuptial agreement discloses that each of said parties has made a full and frank disclosure to the other as to the property owned by them and its nature and amount, such provision is prima facie evidence that a full and fair disclosure of his worth had been made by the husband to the wife: <em>McClellan Estate, </em>supra.

The attorney for the estate then cross-examined the witness as to these matters and there was re-direct and re-cross examination.</p>
