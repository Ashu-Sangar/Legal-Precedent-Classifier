They aver, therefore, that, after <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>investigation of the facts, the charter of the corporation should be revoked and punitive measures taken against the persons responsible.

The Association has appealed to this Court under the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, 12 PS 672, which authorizes an appeal where on- preliminary objections, the jurisdiction of a court is raised.

Thus a proved fraud would stand uncorreeted because the court could not act and the Attorney General would not act. Justice, always portrayed as blindfolded, would in this instance be armless as well. The majority opinion would cripple and hamstring the courts of Pennsylvania in a manner suggestive of some tyrannical regime. It would make the Courts subsidiary to the executive branch of the government. Although up until now the courts have been regarded as the guardians of the liberties of the people, this decision would declare that it is the Attorney General who shall determine if and to what extent the courts may lift the sword of the law to strike down the serpent of falseness admittedly within the temple of justice.</p>

It holds that the courts made up of a judiciary elected by the people shall be at the mercy of a non-elected official who may be hundreds of miles away. It says that no matter what may be the evidence of the fraud, or the proof of the deceit, or the extent of the treachery perpetrated upon the courts, the Courts are helpless. The courts are made to wait on the Attorney General who may delay, ignore, procrastinate or deliberately refuse to intervene. The Courts, heretofore always occupying the throne of justice, would be left sitting on the doorstep waiting and hoping. It is a humiliation that beggars description. <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>A particular Court knows it has been deceived and defrauded, it knows that the defrauders are continuing with their nefarious work, yet the Court is powerless to act because someone does not officially notify the Court of something it already knows.

Some religious body? The incredible truth is that the Court in this case is yielding judicial power, not intentionally of course, but nonetheless actually and realistically to the fortuitous benefit of the most sinister, most deadly, most anti-American and most destructive organization in our land — the Communist Party of the United States.</p>

I also take judicial notice of the fact that the Attorney General of the United States, after suitable investigation, declared that the Yiddisher Kultur Farband, (translated: the Jewish Cultural Association), is a subversive Communist front organization. Only several days ago, sworn <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>testimony was given before a United States Government inspector that in these same Farband headquarters, a banquet-party was held in honor of Steve Nelson, the nationally recognized Communist leader who, when asked before a Congressional investigating committee which country he would support in the event of war between the United States and Russia, replied : “I refuse to answer that question.”</p>

Presumably the organization has been operating ever since. This is another illustration of how the Communist Party, judicially recognized as a criminal conspiracy working to overthrow our government by force and violence, can and does use our courts in the furtherance of its revolutionary plans. If, as the majority opinion indicates, the integrity of the Court’s decrees are to be entrusted to the guardianship of the Attorney General, why has the Attorney General not acted heretofore? As long ago as February, 1950, Matt Cvetic, former FBI undercover agent, testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, that the Yiddisher Kultur Farband was a Communistic organization. Why did the Attorney General not step in then with quo warranto proceedings and demand cancellation of the charter of this illegal enterprise? This fact alone demonstrates the impracticability — and the danger — of leaving to the Attorney General alone the responsibility of protecting decrees of our Courts of Common Pleas in the 67 counties of our Commonwealth. In addition to the other reasons already men<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>tioned as to why the procedure outlined by the majority opinion is not feasible, there is the very important one that the Attorney General’s office is not sufficiently staffed to provide watchmen and deputies in all the Courts of Pennsylvania to determine if and when any particular corporation chartered by the Court is committing a fraud on the Court.</p>

We know that Communist agents have been discovered in all the departments of the United States government. We know that Communist spies have stolen the awesome atom and H-bomb secrets. We know that Communists have infiltrated into labor unions, into the professions, the arts, the sciences and we know they have polluted literary and cinematic streams. Within the next year or more, 25,000 flag-draped caskets will be returning from Korea and each one will contain, mingled with the mangled form of an American soldier, a Communist bullet or the fragment of a Communist shell or grenade. And 50,000 Communists in the United States will cheer that grim harvest because they are of the same brand as those who committed the slaughter in Korea. Among the ghouls sneering at the ineffable coffins will be not only the members of the Communist Party but the members of the Communist front organizations, of which the Yiddisher Kultur Farband is one.</p>

The most notorious of them all deceived the President of the United States and sat at his elbow recommending cessions of vast territory and uninhibited international power to Communist Russia. The people of the United States look to the Army, the Navy and the <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>Air Force for protection from the enemies these traitors have aided and comforted. But they have the right to look, above all, to the Courts for protection. As the Attorney General said: “The court’s primary duty is to protect the community from injury and unlawfulness by a corporation. Its duty is not any less where it learns <em>after </em>granting the charter that it had been fraudulently misled, and the purposes of the corporation are not authorized.” (Emphasis supplied by Attorney General.) But the court below is being prevented from doing this <em>primary duty. </em>And, as a consequence, a full-fledged Communist organization is being allowed to operate untrammeledly by a decision which does obeisance to form and overlooks substance, which evades responsibility, flouts logic, spurns realities, and abandons protection of that Court which is courageously asserting the integrity and the independence of constitutional judicial powers.</p>

Not only that, but it was within his power to sit as a committing magistrate on his own initiative to formally charge with crime those whom he believed were probably guilty of perjury or sedition in this transaction.</p>
