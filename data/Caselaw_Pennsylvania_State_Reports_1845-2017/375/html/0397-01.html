      <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>The Pennsylvania Turnpike is renowned throughout the nation for its excellent construction, spacious dimensions, and engineering design, calculated to produce maximum safety with celerity of travel. It is made up of two separate highways, one easthound and the other westbound, separated by a medial strip 10 feet wide, each comfortably accommodating two lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. The Turnpike has lately achieved, unfortunately, a reputation for sanguinary accidents which has somewhat blemished the proud banner which originally proclaimed it as the “Dream Highway.” Most of the traffic fatalities and injuries on this stupendous thoroughfare have been traced to the demon of speed. Speed is the burden of this particular lawsuit.</p>

Goldberg, owner of a 1949 Studebaker two-door Sedan, entered the Pennsylvania Turnpike at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, carrying with her a guest passenger, Celestine Kotal, antecedent of the plaintiff in this case. Their ultimate destination being Freeport, Pennsylvania, they traversed the distance from Carlisle to Donegal without mishap or incident, passing through the latter station at about 11 p.m. Some four miles west of Donegal, the westbound highway of the Turnpike “veers” to the left. At or about this point, the Studebaker caught up with a Schreiber truck-trailer, operated by Jack Greenawalt, which was moving at 50 miles per hour. In this “veering” area the Studebaker went ahead of the truck-trailer, passing it on the left with no deceleration of speed, estimated to be 60 miles per hour. Here the highway began a downgrade. The weather was dry, but the surface of the roadway was lighted only by the headlamps of the vehicles and the fitful illumination shed every 25 or 50 feet by “cat eyes”, the glass reflectors atop the short posts border<a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>ing the medial strip and the right side of the highway. After passing the heavy truck-trailer, the Studebaker continued at its same pace, but when the highway bent to the right, the Studebaker failed to take the curve, left the concrete and plunged into the middle untravelable space, knocking over several reflector posts. Its velocity unabated, it upset, righted, and turned over several times until it reached the middle of the eastbound lane when the vagaries of momentum sent it cartwheeling back across the medial strip and on to the westbound lane where it finally came to a stop, lying on its roof with wheels in the air. In the violent capsizings of the car, Miss Goldberg was thrown to the concrete of the eastbound lane and Mrs. Xotal to the berm of the westbound lane, both suffering mortal injuries resulting in practically instantaneous death.</p>
    <p id="b424-4" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[243,1239,1149,475]]]'>At the trial of the lawsuit instituted by the administrator of the estate of Oelestine Xotal against the administratrix of the estate of Geraldine Goldberg, the driver of the Schreiber truck-trailer testified to the happening of the tragic event. The jury returned a verdict in the sum of flO,182.00. The defendant moved for judgment n.o.v. and for a new trial. Both motions were refused by the court below and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.6",424,[242,1736,1148,596]],["BL_425.1",425,[182,347,1150,1203]]]'>The defendant argues that the decedent driver committed no act of proved negligence and that the jury was permitted to guess as to the cause of the accident. The jury could well find from the evidence that the cause of the crash was the excessive speed of the Studebaker car under the particular circumstances of the highway. In <em>Knox v. Simmerman, </em><a href="/pa/301/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="301 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1126392" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0001-01">301 Pa. 1</a>, the nature of the accident was sufficiently analogous to the one before us to apply to this case the principle therein enunciated: “It was a clear day on a broad dry pavement, the coupe was in the exclusive control of the <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>defendant, and the accident was such as under normal conditions does not occur; hence, it so happening, unexplained, would justify a jury in presuming the defendant was negligent. It is not a case of res ipsa loquitur, for negligence is not presumed from the mere happening of the accident, but from the circumstances under which it occurred. It was an abnormal occurrence such as in the usual course of events does not occur. An automobile when driven along a. dry level road in daylight at proper speed and under control is not accustomed to leave the pavement and dash against a stone pile at the road side. That the coupe did this very extraordinary thing is some evidence that it was not properly driven. In Shafer v. Lacock, Hawthorn &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/168/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="168 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="868518" data-case-paths="/pa/168/0497-01">168 Pa. 497</a>, 504, the rule is stated, that, ‘When the thing which causes the injury is shown to be under the management of the defendant, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants, that the accident arose from a want of care.’ ”</p>

Did the driver become ill? Did she have a heart attack? Did a mechanical defect assert itself suddenly and throw the automobile out of control? Did the left front wheel, without warning, come loose from the machine, throwing the car out of control? . . . Was there some object on the road which threw the car out of control? All of these questions <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>are unanswered either directly or by reasonable inference by the proof submitted by plaintiff, yet they are equally or more consistent with what happened than is the unwarranted assumption that the safe driver all at once became a negligent driver.”</p>

It can be argued in the realm of uninhibited conjecture that the victim of an assassin’s bullet might have died of a heart seizure before the bullet penetrated his chest and unless the prosecution can eliminate every heart malady as the cause of death, no conviction is possible. In <em>Saganowich v. Hachikian, </em><a href="/pa/348/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="348 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="1220239" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0313-01">348 Pa. 313</a>, this Court said: “.. . the law does not require the elimination of every possible cause of the accident other than that on which plaintiff relies, but only such other causes, if any, as are fairly suggested by the evidence . . .

In point of history, bodies were originally returned to the earth in a winding sheet alone. “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it was thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.” No biblical scholar, however, insists that this affirmation intends an injuncton against the clothing of the lifeless body in robes of wood, stone or marble.

In Sherman and Redfield on Negligence, sees. 59 and 60, the rule applicable to the case is thus stated: ‘The accident, the injury <em>and the circumstances under which they occurred are in some cases sufficient</em>

This Court in its opinion said, inter alia (page 11) : “The contention that a new trial should be granted rests upon certain alleged errors in the charge of the learned trial judge. Particularly is complaint made of the affirmance of plaintiff’s fourth point for charge, which reads as follows: ‘If the jury finds that the instrument causing the injury here complained of was under the management of the defendant or its agents, and the accident is such that under ordinary course of events would not happen if the operator of the motorcycle had used proper care, it affords reasonable evidence in the absence of satisfactory explanation by the defendant that the accident arose from the want of care.’ ” This Court then said: “In consequence of this instruction, the trial judge permitted the jury to presume negligence on the part of <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>the police officer operating the motorcycle, from the mere happening of the accident. <em>This was error, negligence cannot be presumed on the part of defendant’s employee even in the absence of a satisfactory explanation on his part as to how the accident occurred, or even in the absence of exculpatory evidence by him. </em>Negligence, or a failure to exercise due and proper care, must be affirmatively shown by plaintiff in order to sustain a verdict.”</p>

I would further hold that the exclusive control doctrine is applicable to cases where <em>all </em>of the following facts or elements are present: (a) where the thing which caused the accident is under the control of or was made or manufactured by the defendant, and the accident or injury would not ordinarily happen if the defendant exercised due care, or made or manufactured <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>the article with due care; and (b) where the evidence of the cause of the injury or accident is not equally available to both parties, but is peculiarly or exclusively accessible to and within the possession of the defendant; and (c) the accident itself is very unusual or exceptional; and (d) the general principles of negligence have not heretofore been applied to such facts. The reason for defining or laying down the doctrine in such broad language is because the Courts should have a leeway in particular cases or fields where, due to modem times and changing conditions, accidents will arise from causes and conditions which at the present time are not readily foreseeable. Examples of the proper application of the exclusive control doctrine would be, in my judgment, <em>Shafer v. Lacock, Hawthorn &amp; Co., </em>168 Pa., and <em>Durning v.
