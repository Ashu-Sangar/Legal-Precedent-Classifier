The one factual difference, which the appellant urges, is that the present petitioner did not aver dereliction of duty on the part of the county return board as a ground for granting him leave to appeal, nunc pro tunc, under Section 1407 of the Pennsylvania Election Code (25 PS \u00a73157) from the county return board\u2019s computation and certification. Wrongdoing on the part of the board is not a prerequisite to a right of appeal under Section 1407 which extends to \u201cAny person aggrieved by any order or decision of any county board regarding the computation or canvassing of the returns of any primary or election . . . .\u201d\nThe mistake in the certification was due to a patent clerical error on the part of precinct election officers of White Oak Borough in the spelling of petitioner\u2019s name on the triplicate or closed return sheet transmitted to the county return board. Without any fault or dereliction on the part of the petitioner, he was uninformed of tbe mistake until the brief period for appeal from tbe action of tbe county return board, allowed by tbe Election Code, bad expired. However, be acted timely in tbe circumstances and was not guilty of lacbes or otherwise remiss. Tbe undisputed facts presented a clear case for equity\u2019s intervention to restrain or prevent tbe commission or effect of an act contrary to law.\nDecree affirmed at tbe appellant\u2019s costs.",
