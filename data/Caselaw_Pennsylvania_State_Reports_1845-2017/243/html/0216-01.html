In an action to recover damages for a death alleged to have been caused by defendant’s negligence, the burden is upon the plaintiff to produce evidence which would justify a finding that the negligence of the defendant was the sole producing and proximate cause of the death, and in the absence of direct proofs the evidence must be such as reasonably to justify that conclusion alone.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b246-6" data-blocks='[["BL_246.6",246,[267,994,1149,271]]]'>2. Where in such action the only evidence of negligence is circumstantial, and inferences can reasonably be drawn from the testimony that would lead equally as well to the conclusion that the death was due to other causes, the finding of the jury represents nothing more than a guess or conjecture upon the essential point, and a verdict for plaintiff in such case will not be sustained.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b246-7" data-blocks='[["BL_246.7",246,[266,1275,1150,538]]]'>3. The element relied on to justify a finding that loss of life was due to a particular act of negligence, in the absence of direct testimony of eye-witnesses, is the natural instinct which leads men in their sober senses to avoid injury and preserve life. The circumstance that the man who met his death was sober and able to control his actions and presumably did not do anything out of the usual and ordinary course which would be pursued under like surroundings by a man in his sober sense, is the controlling element in determining whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a verdict; but this presumption will not be given effect in the case of a man who admittedly was not in his Sober senses at the time of the accident.</p>

In an action of trespass to recover damages for the death of plaintiff’s husband, it appeared that deceased had been found dead at the foot of a declivity adjacent to a street in defendant borough. Plaintiff alleged that defendant had maintained a defective, unsafe and unguarded sidewalk at the edge of this slope, the condition of which was responsible for her husband’s death. There were no eye-witnesses of the accident and plaintiff relied upon circumstantial evidence to prove her case. It appeared that deceased late in the evening had been seen walking in a badly intoxicated condition on the sidewalk above the spot where his body was subsequently found; there was no expert testimony as ■to the cause of death, but lay witnesses, one of whom was an undertaker and another a railroad man, gave their opinion that <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>death had resulted from a broken neck.

    <p id="b247-11" data-blocks='[["BL_247.20",247,[219,1897,1150,537]]]'>On June 11,1910, between 5 and 6 o’clock in the morning, Lawrence Glancy, the plaintiff’s, husband, was found dead at the foot of a declivity or slope adjacent to Island avenue, a street in the defendant borough. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant maintained a defective, unsafe and unguarded sidewalk on the top and at the edge of this slope, and she recovered a verdict upon the theory that her husband’s death was due to this act of negligence. Judgment was entered accordingly, and the defendant has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b248-3" data-blocks='[["BL_248.3",248,[298,355,1165,2074]],["BL_249.1",249,[241,353,1149,587]]]'>
      <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>There were no eye-witnesses to the event, and the plaintiff depended upon the surrounding circumstances to sustain the finding comprehended in the verdict that her husband’s death was attributable to the negligence of the defendant. When we confine our attention to the' evidence relied upon by the plaintiff, and assume its acceptance by the jury, it shows the following facts, upon which the verdict must stand or fall: Glancy was last seen alive June 10,1910, between 9:30 and Í0 P. M., ‘ on Island avenue, walking toward and about 200 feet distant from the spot where his body was subsequently found; at that time he was badly intoxicated and had been for some hours, although he was able to walk; Island avenue was graded and improved to its full width by a fill of twelve feet above the abutting property; the sidewalk was about nine feet wide, paved with brick and supported by a cribbing of ties; the cribbing made a perpendicular fall from the pavement of over two and one-half feet, from which the embankment sloped fifteen or twenty feet into the property where the body was discovered; this property was unfenced and immediately accessible by at least one other nearby open public way; a shallow box or drain extended along the foot of the slope, and when Glancy was found his head was on the drain and his feet pointed toward the slope; the sidewalk in the immediate vicinity was “wavy,” some of the bricks being loose and others out of place, and there was no guard-rail along the embankment, which condition had existed for a considerable length of time; there were two large electric arc lights, one about 200 and the other 300 feet away from the point in question, and the fires of manufacturing establishments in the neighborhood shed more or less light. There was no expert testimony, but certain lay witnesses, one of whom had had experience with dead bodies as an undertaker, and another as a railroad man, gave the opinion that death was due to a broken neck. Some of the witnesses who found the body stated that it was cold, but one said that it was “a <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>little wee bit warm,” and the only witness who expressed a view as to how long life had been extinct was the one with the undertaker’s experience; he said, “four or five hours.” One of the witnesses who last saw Glancy alive said that he followed him along Island avenue, after the deceased had a start of about three minutes, and got no trace of him; but he further stated, that in the interval Glancy had time to go beyond the point where his body was subsequently found, adding, that he could have gone to another saloon above that point and back again before the witness commenced his observations.</p>
    <p id="b249-3" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[239,961,1150,1140]]]'>It is not clear that the position and condition of the sidewalk at this particular location was such as to make the absence of a guard-rail negligence; but, for the purposes of the present review, we will assume that the jury could have found that the defendant borough was at fault in this respect. We are of opinion, however, that the evidence depended upon is not sufficient to justify or sustain the conclusion that Glancy’s death was properly attributable to this alleged negligence, for even though the proofs be viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, yet, a reasonable mind desiring only to ascertain the actual facts would not necessarily come to the conclusion that the deceased accidentally fell over the unguarded slope or that he was tripped by the defects in the pavement and precipitated down the declivity; so far as the evidence goes, it may as well be that this drunken man started down the incline for some undisclosed purpose, and slipped and fell; or, it may be that he got on the vacant property where his body was found in another way, and stumbled while attempting to ascend the slope.</p>

Willard, <a href="/pa/57/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="57 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1010434" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0374-01">57 Pa. 374</a>, we have repeatedly affirmed verdicts based on circumstantial evidence, where they comprehended a finding that the loss of a life was solely due to a particular act of negligence, yet, in those cases the element most frequently called attention to in order to justify such a finding in the absence of direct testimony by eye-witnesses is, “the natural instinct which leads men in their sober senses to avoid injury and preserve life.” An examination of the authorities in question will show that, in each instance where the facts at all approximate those of the present case, the circumstance that the man who met his death was sober and able to control his actions, and, therefore, presumably did not do anything out of the usual and ordinary course which would be pursued under like surroundings by a man in his “sober senses,” really was the controlling element in determining that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict (see, Scranton v. Dean, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.N.C.%20467" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 W.N.C. 467">2 W. N. C. 467</a>; McManamon v.

In short, the evidence relied upon fails reasonably to connect the defendant’s alleged negligence with the presence of Glancy’s body at the foot of the embankment in such a way as to afford the basis for a fair presumption that it was the cause of his death; hence, the verdict cannot stand.</p>
