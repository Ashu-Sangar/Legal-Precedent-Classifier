The ordinances of the City of Pittsburgh relating to the mat*, ter were also put in evidence, copies of them being annexed to the affidavit of claim. It appeared by the evidence that the amount so retained by the defendant was the correct amount of his fees or compensation for the collection of taxes as provided by these ordinances. The plaintiff having rested its case, upon motion of the defendant a judgment of compulsory nonsuit was entered, which the plaintiff now moves the court to take off.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b484-4" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[287,608,1151,1194]]]'>This case was before this court on a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and upon the discharge of that rule was appealed to the Supreme Court, the case being reported in volume 238, page 567, where the judgment was affirmed upon the opinion of this court. The only difference between the case now presented and that which was before the court upon that rule seems to us to be that in the affidavit of defense an audit by the controller of the City of Pittsburgh was alleged as a defense, which of course does not appear in the evidence here. In that case, however, the court proceeded to discuss the question of the right of the city to claim the money sued for from the defendant without regard to the tribunal by which that right was to be determined, and came to the conclusion “that the provision in the Act of June 20, 1901, and the Act of May 8,1909, empowered the councils of the City of Pittsburgh to fix the compensation of the collector of delinquent taxes by a percentage of the penalty imposed upon delinquents,” and that therefore the ordinances above referred to were valid, and the judgment was affirmed upon the opinion containing this conclusion.</p>
