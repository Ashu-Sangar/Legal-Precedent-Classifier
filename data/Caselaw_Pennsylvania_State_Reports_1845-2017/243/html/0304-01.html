The affidavit and supplemental affidavit are open to the criticism of the plaintiff’s counsel that they are lacking in orderly sequence in construction; they, however, are good in substance though bad in form. They contain allegations of a failure of consideration and of the violation of a contemporaneous parol agreement which induced the execution of the mortgage. It is averred that the mortgage was made for the accommodation of the mortgagee to serve a present use by him; that at the time there were unsettled accounts between the parties, the adjustment of which was necessary to determine what, if any, indebtedness existed; that these accounts were to be subsequently adjusted and interest was not to be paid on the mortgage; that no adjustment <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>of accounts has been made, and that on an adjustment it will be found that the mortgagee is indebted to the mortgagor in a large' amount, the items of which are fully stated. These facts, if true, constituted a defense and judgment was therefore properly refused.</p>
