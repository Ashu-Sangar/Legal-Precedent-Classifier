Before it can be assumed that the notation on the plan is equivalent to a covenant in the deed running with the land or is the equivalent of an irrevocable easement, the intention of the parties in the creation of the covenant or easement and of their several grantees must be reached. The words “Building Line 15 Ft:” of themselves are not conclusive ; granted that the existence of this notation upon the plan indicates a restriction, what is the extent thereof as to time or as to character? The court is asked to construe the notation upon the plan as a solemn covenant running with the land for an indefinite period, and this as being within the intention of the parties at the time.</p>

The source of information was the corporate act of the plaintiff’s grantee, the South Park Land Company; unless it affirmatively "appeared that the original owners of this land created this building restriction with the effect of a covenant and that the dotted line was the complete evidence thereof and that it authorized its incorporation as a covenant in the acknowledgment in the plan, it meant nothing. Whether such investigation would have shown the foregoing acts from which the effect thereof could be construed as a binding covenant or easement does not appear; this investigation certainly would have shown action by the grantee limiting the alleged restriction to ten years.</p>
