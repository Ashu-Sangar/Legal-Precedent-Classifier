Testator by will bequeathed all the residue of his estate, which included certain stock in a limited partnership, to his wife, “absolutely in fee, subject, nevertheless, to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.” This was followed by a provision granting to each of his four brothers and sisters an option to purchase one-fourth of all the shares and interests in the copartnership for a given sum, such option to be exercised by the next of kin of brothers and sisters who should predecease him, and to be paid for in interest-bearing notes, dated as of the date of his death. Upon failure to exercise the option it was provided that the decedent’s interest in the copartnership should “be vested in my said wife, and become her absolute property, with the same force and effect as though such option had not been granted.” The option was exercised by the living brothers and sisters and guardians of the minor children of those who were deceased. The widow refused to accept the notes signed by these parties for their proportionate shares of the. consideration money, and claimed the shares as her property. <em>Held, </em>that the dispository clause raised only a presumption of absolute gift, .which was explained.and modified by the subsequent provisions, and that when the option to purchase was accepted, title to the stock related back to the inception of the will and became as absolute as though there had been a direct bequest in the first instance subject to the payment of a specified sum.- • • ■</p>

The gift was made expressly “subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth”; and then immediately follow the “terms and conditions” of the fourth paragraph, which are the only terms and conditions to which the testator could have had reference. It is conceded that the purpose plainly manifested in the fourth paragraph was to vest in his brothers and sisters or their issue an option to buy specified stocks; but it is insisted that this is a void gift because it deprives the widow of an incident of ownership. It cannot be doubted that if “the terms and conditions” of the fourth paragraph had been a direction for the absolute transfer of this stock, the executrix must have obeyed it; and why not when an “option to purchase” is the subject of gift? Testator might have ordered a public sale of the stock; and why not a private sale? If an option inter vivos had been given, the executrix could have been forced to make transfer; and why not in case of a testamentary option? In either event, election to accept in accordance with the terms and conditions of the will would vest the equitable title in the purchaser with a right to demand transfer of the legal title by the executrix. The “option to purchase” was a bequest, and when accepted, title to the stock related back to the inception of the will and became as absolute as though there had been a direct bequest in the first instance subject to the payment of a specified sum. Because interest on the purchase money notes was made to run from testator’s death, the necessary implication is that title in the stock was to run from the same date. Bayer v. Walsh, <a href="/pa/166/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="166 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="864241" data-case-paths="/pa/166/0038-01">166 Pa. 38</a>, furnishes a clear recognition of the efficacy of such bequests. An absolute devise having been made to the children, Alice, Edward and Joseph, followed by an “option” to Alice to “purchase” the interests of her brothers within <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>five years after testator’s death, the court said that Alice had an “undoubted” right to exercise the option given her by the will, and that having done so, she was as completely invested with the title devised to her brothers as that devised to her in the first instance; and that the transaction was in no sense a purchase, for that would imply consent on the brother’s part, which under the terms of the will was wholly unnecessary. Here, too, the title to the stocks was made contingent upon the exercise of the option to purchase; and when exercised, gave the parties a right by the express terms of the will to demand transfer by the executor as the personal representative of testator. The widow never had any title to • this stock. The will expressly provides that only in the event of refusal to accept the option shall it pass to her. In the meantime the legal title was in the executrix. Administration ordinarily implies conversion by the ■executor. In the absence of inconsistent provision the widow might have elected to take these stocks instead of their value; but here there was an express restriction of her right, to cash. This was one of the “terms and conditions” upon which she took under the will and necessarily excluded any other subject of distribution. She must take cash or nothing. The dispository clause raised only a presumption of absolute gift which was explained and modified by the subsequent provisions: Keown’s Estate, <a href="/pa/238/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="238 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="991611" data-case-paths="/pa/238/0343-01">238 Pa. 343</a>.</p>

Nor has the objection to the validity of acceptance of the “option to purchase” any merit. The alternative bequest, in the event of the death of brother or sister, to the next kin, was without restriction on account of age, and necessarily embraced minors as well as majors; and as under the law, minors were incompetent to act, it must be presumed that Mr. Dilworth had in contemplation action by their guardians. These might have assumed the risk of acceptance; but there was at least implied sanction given by this court to their declared purpose of acceptance through ancillary appointment. <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>There can be no doubt that the facts justified the grant of authority, for they show great advantage to the wards in acceptance; and if there was no precedent authority given, ratification of their acceptance is its equivalent: Hauer’s App., <a href="/watts-serg/5/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 473" data-case-ids="478782" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0473-01">5 W. &amp; S. 473</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b513-4" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[216,632,1153,862]]]'>3. Mere proof of demand made on the executrix for payment of the alleged transfer tax without proof of legislative authority cannot be regarded in this foreign jurisdiction. But assuming such proof made the justice of the claim is more than doubtful. As distribution is made here under the Act of 1905, and the principle of Small’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/151/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="151 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="836645" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0001-01">151 Pa. 1</a>, applies, the parties accepting the stock ought not be subjected to double taxation. The Act of 1905 modified the law of comity and put it in the power of next of kin and legatees to make distribution a purely local question. This court’s adjudication of audit is conclusive as to all persons having claims against the fund in accountant’s hands; and by necessary implication will bar any claim against the Executrix in the domiciliary state: Tilt v.
