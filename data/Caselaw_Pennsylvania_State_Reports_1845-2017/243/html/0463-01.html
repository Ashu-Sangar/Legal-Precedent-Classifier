Some time thereafter it was learned that he was in poor mental and physical condition and one or more of his daughters, plaintiffs herein, went there and remained with him for a time, and he returned to Pittsburgh sometime in May, 1906, where he remáined until iiis death which occurred on July 27, 1906.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b496-6" data-blocks='[["BL_496.6",496,[291,1197,1147,479]]]'>7.

After March, 1902, up to the time of the deáth of John Mooney, no payments of any kind were made by anyone on account of his benefit certificate, the amount of the payments due being $3.78 a month until he should arrive at the age of fifty-five years, and thereafter $7.65 a month, and his age at the time of his death being between sixty and sixty-one years.

The contention of the plaintiffs is, as we understand it, that John Mooney was not suspended from membership in the order for nonpayment of dues from March, 1902, to the time of his death in 1906, because Ellen Mooney, the beneficiary as matters then stood, claimed that he was dead and gave in evidence of it the fact that he had been absent and unheard of for seven years, and thereby procured the society to pay her the amount of the benefit certificate and to accept a surrender of the certificate from her, when the fact was that Mooney was not dead and she had no right to surrender the certificate or receivé the money. In other words, that because Ellen Mooney surrendered the benefit certificate belonging to him, John Mooney was no longer bound to pay his dues but would remain a member indefinitely without payment of dues. We cannot agree to this cointention. While it may be that Ellen Mooney and the society believed John Mooney to be dead, or . at <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>least acted upon the presumption of his death, yet John Mooney whose conduct had led to the existence of such ¿ presumption was under- no such mistake, and was as much bound to pay his dues as any. other member of the order.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b498-2" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[301,594,1152,1084]]]'>■ 2. This bilk was filed March 6, 1911, more than four years after the death of John Mooney. It being a part óf the contract with the member that no suit should be maintained against the order on any cause or claims arising out of any membership or benefit fund, unless brought within three years, the present proceeding cannot be maintained. The plaintiffs cite a number of cases in which a bill was brought by the insured or the beneficiary for the purpose of reforming the policy, and contend that as p¿rt of the relief sought is to have the surrender by Ellen Mooney of the benefit certificate declared void the present case is within the principle, of the cases cited. The cases are not analogous, however. During a contest as to what the terms of a contract are, action upon it must be suspended, but there was no reason for suspending action in this case for want of a copy of the certificate, any more than, if it had been casually lost, as the contention of the plaintiffs was and still is that it was always in force and there was no dispute about its terms.</p>
