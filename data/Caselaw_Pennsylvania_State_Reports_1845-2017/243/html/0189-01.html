In support of their contention that the board of revision of taxes and appeals have no power or authority to alter the assessments returned by the board of city assessors, without an appeal on the part of the party aggrieved, counsel for the plaintiffs cites Hodge v. Board of Appeals, 2 Law Times, 167. It was there held in de<a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>filling the powers of the hoard of revision and appeal created under the Act of March 18,1875, P. L. 15, “The Act of 1875 creating this hoard provides ‘for the purposes of appeal’ the board may be appointed by councils. Hence if there is no appeal, the assessment stands as the true valuation made by competent authority. If, however, an appeal is entered by the person whose real estate is assessed, then jurisdiction attaches, and after a hearing, the decision made by the board is final unless appealed from as provided by law;......but if there is no appeal, then any act on the part of the board such as changing the assessments is void.” This was undoubtedly true in that act which created the board of revision for the sole purpose of hearing appeals from the assessments made by the assessors, and it was so held by Judge Handley, but does not govern this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b228-7" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[277,1191,1149,426]]]'>Another authority relied upon by plaintiffs is Williamson’s Est., <a href="/pa/153/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="153 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="840325" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0508-01">153 Pa. 508</a>, which defines the powers of the board of revision, created by the provisions of the Act of March 14, 1865, P.

Under this act they may in<a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>crease or reduce the assessment, not only for the purpose of revision and equalization', but also for the purpose of altering and changing the <em>assessments; </em>nor are they limited by the words of the act to any particular purpose in exercising their power and authority to alter the valuations returned, and as tending to show that they have authority to raise assessments on their own motion, the act provides that it shall be their duty to give five days’ written or printed notice to every taxable of any increase or addition to the valuation assessed against him by the board of city assessors. We, therefore, hold that an appeal is not necessary in order to give the board of revision of taxes and appeals jurisdiction in revising, equalizing or altering the valuations by increasing or reducing the same.</p>

The contention of plaintiffs that the board of revision of taxes and appeals must adopt the ratio of valuation established by the board of assessors applies only in case of appeals in individual cases to them from the assessment made by the assessors or for the purpose of equalizing the assessment of wards or parts of wards, in order to secure uniformity throughout the entire taxable district, and cause the burden of taxation to fall equally upon all taxables. But where, as in this case, the entire assessment throughout the city has been altered, and in most instances raised by the board of revision and a new standard of valuations adopted, we do not believe that the rules laid down in the case cited, by counsel for plaintiffs, apply, and certainly not where there is no evidence to show that the standard of valuation adopted is not uniform throughout, the district. Uniformity of valuation for tax purposes is a mandate of the fundamental law of the State, and we think that under the Act of 1895, the board of revision of taxes and appeals is charged with the duty of so revising, equalizing or altering the assessments returned by the board of assessors as to accomplish that end. Nothing is shown in the evidence to show us that they have failed to do <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>their duty, and the basis or standard of valuations to be adopted by them for the purpose of securing uniformity lies in their good judgment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[268,484,1145,362]]]'>There is no good reason why they should not, in a proper case, take as the standard of valuation, the higher ratio fixed by the assessors on certain property and increase the assessments on others in order to make all uniform, if in their opinion such action would secure more substantial justice to. the municipality and the taxables.</p>

Nor do we think that the assessment should be set aside for the reason that the same ratio of value has not been applied to land as to buildings and improvements. Even if this were true, which can only be determined by the introduction of evidence covering each particular case, it would not be sufficient reason for setting aside the whole assessment. Such a difference would undoubtedly constitute a good ground for appeal under the provisions of the Constitution and the laws of the State, but would not render null and void the entire assessment. If this were true, very few assessments would be allowed to stand. It is a matter of common knowledge that land values are more fixed and stable than values of buildings and improvements. The latter very often fail to bring anywhere near their real value of cost of construction, while the former sell more readily at near their true value; and we are of the opinion that the assessors were not far from right when they fixed the value of build<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>ings and improvements at forty per cent, of their estimated cost.</p>
