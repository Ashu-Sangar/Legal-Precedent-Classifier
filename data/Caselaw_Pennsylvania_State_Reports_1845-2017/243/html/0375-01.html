Doctor Mathiot was first married in 1886; from this marriage were born two children, a son, Karl, and a daughter, Miriam; he was a physician with an established reputation as a specialist and having a practice estimated worth $25,000.00 a year. At the time of the <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>separation, hereinafter referred to, his then wife was the record owner of what has been described as No. 5912 Walnut street, in the City of Pittsburgh, while he was the record owner of the adjoining property, No. 5914; the two properties constitute one large building, but then completely separated by division walls and made up two separate residences.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b406-4" data-blocks='[["BL_406.4",406,[285,720,1147,483]]]'>2. In 1903, the claimant, then Mrs. Laura H. Taylor began to be Doctor Mathiot’s patient; for a short time statements were rendered to her for professional services; later she became a very constant and frequent visitor at his office; these visits were more personal than professional; she remained after office hours, frequently leaving with him; no statements or bills were rendered after this character of visits began; their relations became very friendly and affectionate and so continued.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b406-5" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[268,1213,1165,1131]]]'>3. About 1907 a permanent estrangement took place between Doctor Mathiot and his then wife, Katherine; he refused to provide for her and his children unless she procured an absolute divorce from him; she moved from this State and took up her residence in Ohio. By arrangement between him and his wife a divorce was to be obtained upon the payment to her of $10,000.00 as alimony and $5,000.00 in settlement of a debt he owed to her father or to her father’s estate. Proceedings for divorce were instituted in Ohio on August 1, 1907, the cause alleged was extreme cruelty and neglect; other grounds discussed by counsel were not by arrangement set forth in the libel. By collusive agreement Doctor Mathiot went to Youngstown in the State of Ohio, and on August 2, 1907, accepted service of the summons; in the meanwhile, to wit: in the early part of 1908, he gave up his house on Walnut street, took rooms at the Hotel Lamont adjoining those of the claimant; their affectionate relationship continued, he giving her many presents and various money transactions took place b'é- ' tween them.</p>

On the 18th of April following, the decedent and the claimant were married.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b407-5" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[207,844,1148,362]]]'>5. From the foregoing facts, their sequence, the relationship of the parties, and the weight of all the testimony, the further fact is found that the claimant knew that the $15,000.00 she gave to the decedent then was to be used in the procurement of the divorce from his first wife in order that she and Doctor Mathiot might be married.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b407-6" data-blocks='[["BL_407.5",407,[205,1229,1150,701]]]'>6. Shortly after their marriage the doctor and the claimant had constant quarrels about money matters; she demanded interest on this money transaction, a check for $375.00 is offered in evidence tending to show such interest was paid; the claimant demands interest from the date when the money was advanced without allowing this credit. Shortly following Doctor Mathiot’s death the claimant, in answer to questions as to his debt, stated she knew of none except current bills; she did not then state that she had this claim or the one subsequently referred to. She did, however, later take up the question of these claims with her present counsel, who in reasonable time gave notice of. the same.</p>

The law favors the continuance of the marriage relation; it does not favor divorce; contracts having for their object the procurement, or facilitating the procurement of divorce, are illegal. Claims against a dead man’s estate based on parol evidence must be rigidly scanned; if they might have been enforced against him while living they are the subject of just suspicion; these principles are so generally stated in text books, in encyclopaedias of law, in adjudicated cases including many in Pennsylvania, that specific reference to a few only need be made in support thereof.</p>
