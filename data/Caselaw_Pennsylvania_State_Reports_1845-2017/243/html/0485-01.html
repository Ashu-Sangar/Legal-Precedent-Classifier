The question then is whether or not such merchandise, received and stored as was the complainant’s malt, was intended, at the time the aforesaid policies were issued, to be covered thereby.

In this case, the defendants and the insurance companies have reduced their contract to writing. They have particularly described the merchandise, against the loss of which the insurance was effected, see Findings of Fact 3. This writing is in no wise ambiguous. Accordingly we ruled at the trial that parol testimony was not admissible to alter, explain or vary the written contract. We can perceive no reason for holding that ruling erroneous.

A large part of it was to receive and store the grain, grain products, etc., of various owners, for compensation. Hence the complainant’s malt, received and stored in the manner stated, was merchandise “incidental to the business” of the defendants. They were not the owners, but they held it as bailees for him, in the capacity of trustees. Thus their relation to the complainant was within the very letter of the policies — the malt was “held by them in trust” for him. In addition, this malt was consigned to the defendants, and they received and stored it as the consignees thereof. It was held by them “on consignment,” a well-understood commercial expression, and one also used in these policies. Thus again the relation of the defendants to the complainant is brought within the letter of the contract. The intention, as disclosed by the language of this writing, is therefore plain. It needs neither interpretation nor construction, and the meaning of the words used is not contrary to the spirit of the contract. The obvious purpose was to cover a stock of merchandise which, from the nature of the defendant’s business, was a shifting one. It was a stock which might be greater at one time <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>and less at another. The contract of insurance shows this. We cannot, therefore, sustain the contention of the defendants, that only those shippers were to be protected, who might make arrangements with them relative to insurance. No such distinction is made in the written instrument. To sustain that contention we would be obliged to resort to testimony contradictory of the writing. This we cannot do. It is not what the parties might have actually meant that must guide us. The inquiry is, what is the legal meaning of the language used in the writing? This is the rule which controls us in the construction of this contract.</p>

If we are correct in this conclusion, then the defendants owed the complainant the duty of including his property in their proofs of loss, or at least of giving him the opportunity of making his claim. Having refused to recognize his rights at all and having settled with the insurance companies without regard to him, the defendants, as his bailees, must account to him.</p>

The descriptive clause in the insurance policies, set out in Findings of Fact 4, embraced grain and grain products held by the defendants as bailees, and operated to extend the protection of the policies to the complainant’s malt.

This is a correct proposition, and we understand the appellee to concede it. But how shall such intention in the case in hand be ascertained? Certainly not, as contended by the appellants, by parol evidence, but by the terms of the contract contained in the policy issued by the insurance company to the appellants. It secures against loss by fire: “On merchandise of every description incidental to the business of the assured, consisting chiefly of grain, grain products, country produce, bailed hay and straw, bags and supplies, their own or held by them in trust or on commission or consignment or sold but not removed, all while contained in the iron-clad building occupied as elevator, situate on West Carson street, Nineteenth <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>Ward, Pittsburgh, Pa.” The property of the plaintiff destroyed by the fire was a carload of malt consigned and shipped to the elevator in Pittsburgh owned and operated by the appellants who were engaged in the business of receivers and shippers of grain, mill feed and hay. There is no ambiguity in the language of the policy and it clearly covers appellee’s property. As said by the learned chancellor: “This malt was a ‘grain product’ and was therefore merchandise ‘incidental to their business,’ which was that of conducting an elevator, ‘where they, customarily held on storage grain and other merchandise, as bailee and in trust for various owners.’ Undoubtedly, the complainant’s malt was merchandise of the kind that was to be covered by the clause in the policies.” The authorities fully sustain this conclusion: Siter v.

The latter case closely resembles the case at bar and is in line with the Pennsylvania cases, the language of the policy being: “their own, or held by them in trust or in which they have an interest or liability.” Mr. Justice Strong, delivering the opinion, said (p. 542): “There is nothing ambiguous in this description of the subject insured. It is as broad as possible. The subject was merchandise stored or contained in a warehouse. It was not merely an interest in that merchandise. The merchandise of the warehouse company, owned by them, was covered, if any they had. So was any merchandise in the warehouse in which they had an interest or liability. And so was any merchandise which they held in trust.”</p>

Conceding this to be true, the appellants contend that the rule applies only to the parties to the contract and their privies and not to third parties who seek to avail themselves of the contract or to repudiate it, and that as a stranger to the contract is not bound by its terms, a party to it contending with him is likewise at liberty to attack it. It, is, therefore, claimed that as the plaintiff here was not a party to the policy he is not bound by the rule excluding parol evidence to contradict or vary it, and that the defendants are, in this controversy with him, likewise relieved from the application of the rule and are free to show that the plaintiff’s goods were not included in the policy of insurance. It is true that the rule applies only between parties to the contract and their privies, and that it has no application to a stranger to the contract. The latter may, however, show that it was entered into for his benefit, and, therefore, he has rights under the instrument. He then claims through one of the parties and both he and his adversary, a party to the contract, are excluded from testifying. The rule as to the rights of strangers to the contract, to vary it by parol, must be limited to rights independent of the instrument. As to rights Avhich originate in the relation established by the instrument the ordinary rule must apply: Browne on Parol Evidence, 28. Where a third person not a party to an instrument claims rights or benefits thereunder and seeks to take advantage thereof, the parol evidence rule applies to him as much as to a party, and he is not entitled to introduce evidence to vary or contradict the writing: 17 Cyc. 752.</p>

When this distinction is observed, the authorities will be found to be in accord. <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>In onr own case of Krider v.

Any rights he may have against the defendants in this action have accrued under their contract with the insurance company, and therefore the rule precludes both parties to this litigation from attacking it by parol evidence.</p>
