The testimony in their behalf made out a clear case of negligence by the driver of the defendant’s taxicab and the case was submitted with instructions to which no exception was taken. The errors assigned are to the refusal of the court to strike out an answer in relation to a physical condition from which the wife was suffering because of her injury; to proof of the expense that would be incurred by the husband by employing a servant to perform household duties that his wife had performed before her injury and which she is now unable to perform and to the refusal to grant a new trial because the verdict was excessive. They are all without merit. The answer objected to was by the wife in reply to a question in relation to the suffering and inconvenience caused by her injury, to be followed by proof that her condition was the direct result of the injury to her nervous system which was alleged in the statement of claim. It was set out in the statement of claim that she had been knocked down, severely wounded and bruised in her limbs, body and face and that her nervous system had received a severe shock and had been permanently <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>injured. It was competent under this statement to prove the results that were the direct consequence of the injury. If the defendant had desired a'more specific statement it should have asked for a bill of particulars: Quigley v.
