A rule was issued to show cause why the prayer of the petition should not be granted.

We do not think this conclusion is sustained either by reason or by the weight of authority. “Residence,” is often used to express different meanings, according to the subject matter: Long v. Ryan, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20Va.%20%2830%20Gratt.%29%20718" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 718">71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 718</a>. It may be said to be the dwelling place of a person and may be his permanent or temporary abode. It may mean the domicil of the person or his temporary presence in the locality. Domicil has been well defined to be the place where á man has his true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment, and to which whenever he is absent he has the intention of returning. It is acquired by- residence with the intention of remaining in the locality. A person may have his domicil in one state and be engaged in business in another and thereby ac-, quire a temporary residence in the latter. He retains his former domicil until he acquires another, that, is, until he removes to another locality with the intention of making it his permanent abode. A man can have but one domicil for one and the same purpose - at any one time, though he may have numerous places of residence. His place of residence may be, and most generally is, his place of domicil, but it obviously is not by any means necessarily so, for no length of residence without the intention of remaining will constitute domicil: Stout v. Leonard, <a href="/njl/37/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="37 N.J.L. 492" data-case-ids="389494" data-case-paths="/njl/37/0492-01">37 N. J. L. 492</a>, 495. It is clear that “residence” and “domicil” are not convertible terms, and that the latter is of more extensive signification. While these principles are well settled, <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>it is also true that as used in many statutes, “domicil” and “residence” have been held to be equivalent terms. The courts have so construed statutes relating to the qualification of voters, to homesteads, to taxation, to the statute of limitations, ito succession, guardianship, and administration, and in those prescribing the jurisdictional prerequisites to the maintenance of actions for divorce or separation: 14 Cyc. 835. It is, therefore, apparent, and the courts have held that “residence” is a word whose statutory meaning depends upon the context and the purpose of the statute, which may as used in one statute be fulfilled by mere business residence, and in another require domicil in the strictest and most technical sense: 34 Cyc. 1647. In ascertaining the meaning of the word “residence” in a particular statute the legislative purpose as well as the context must be kept in view.</p>

It is a process by which to commence a personal action and compel an appearance: Albany City Ins. Co. v. Whitney, <a href="/pa/70/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="70 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1028167" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0248-01">70 Pa. 248</a>. The foundation for the writ is that the defendant is beyond the reach of process and his property within it: Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Pennock, <a href="/pa/51/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="51 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="999817" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0244-01">51 Pa. 244</a>. The purpose of the statute is to compel the constructive presence in court of the defendant who by reason of his absence from its jurisdiction without a dwelling place therein cannot be served with a summons. The law regards it the duty of a debtor to answer the demand of his creditors and permit his indebtedness to be litigated when it is due, and if he is beyond the usual process of the court, they are remediless unless they may invoke the remedy to compel his appearance by seizure of his property. In construing the statute authorizing the issuance of the writ, its object should be kept in view so as to accomplish the intended purpose. If we hold with the defendant that “not residing within the Common<a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>wealth” is the equivalent of and means “not domiciled within the Commonwealth,” the purpose of the statute in most instances will be defeated. A debtor may absent himself from the jurisdiction of the court for years on business or pleasure, and still retain his domicil at his former residence. In the meantime the creditor has been seriously injured financially because he cannot enforce payment of his claim against his debtor. It is no answer to say that he may follow his debtor into the jurisdiction of his residence. No reasonable construction of our statute will require a creditor to leave the jurisdiction of his debtor’s domicil and pursue him into another state, across the continent, or into a foreign country (if the debtor is there subject to the process of the courts) to compel Mm to litigate the claim. It is no hardship for a debtor to answer the claim of Ms creditor in a jurisdiction in which he transacts business by purchasing and holding property; on the other hand, it would be a great hardship and often a denial of justice to require the creditor to follow his debtor into the jurisdiction in which he may reside indefinitely for pleasure or business.</p>

The appellate courts of the several states which have construed statutes similar to the Pennsylvania statute have almost unanimously held that “residence” and “domicil” are not synonymous terms within the meaning of such statutes, that a debtor may have his residence in one state while his domicil is in another, and that a debtor, although his legal domicil is in a state, may reside or remain out of it for so long a time, and under such circumstances, as to acquire, so to speak, an actual nonresidence, within the meaning of the attachment statute. A few of the numerous authorities may be cited. In Garden v. Garden, <a href="/nc/107/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="107 N.C. 214" data-case-ids="11273085" data-case-paths="/nc/107/0214-01">107 N. C. 214</a>, Mr. Justice Shephebd delivering the opinion says: “The prominent idea is, that the debtor must be a nonresident of this state, where the attachment is sued out; not that he must be a resident elsewhere.......The essential charge is, that he is not residing or living in the state, that is, he has no abode or home within it where process may be served so as effectually to reach him. In other words, his property is attachable if his residence is not such as to subject him personally to the jurisdiction of the court, and place him upon equality with other residents in this respect.” In Lawson v. Adlard, <a href="/minn/46/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="46 Minn. 243" data-case-ids="567248" data-case-paths="/minn/46/0243-01">46 Minn. 243</a>, the court speaking by Mr. Justice Collins, says: “It is apparent, from an examination of the most approved authorities, that, in construing statutes relating to attachment of the property of nonresidents, a <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>wide distinction has been recognized between an actual residence and a legal residence, the latter being generally deemed the domicil, and not the residence, contemplated; the word ‘residence’ being construed in its popular sense, as the act of abiding or dwelling in a place for some continuance of time.” In Thomson v. Ogden, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20Ohio%20Cir.%20Ct.%20185" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="23 Ohio Cir. Ct. 185">23 Ohio Cir. Ct. 185</a>, Voorhees, J., delivering the opinion says: “A generally accepted definition of ‘residence,’ when the term is used with reference to the qualification of voters, is synonymous with ‘domicile.’ But when applied to attachment laws, ‘domicile’ and ‘residence’ are not convertible terms, for domicil may be in one place and residence for the time being, in another. 1 Shinn on Attachment, sec. 90, says: The term ‘nonresident’ in the attachment law, therefore, means, one who has an abode in another state.” In Stickney v. Chapman, <a href="/ga/115/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="115 Ga. 759" data-case-ids="412942" data-case-paths="/ga/115/0759-01">115 Ga. 759</a>, it is said by the court: “Evidently the theory of the defendant was, that if he was legally domiciled in Floyd County, then without regard to the fact that for the purposes of business he continually remained out of the state, he was a resident of the state; and further, that the fact that he had acquired no domicil elsewhere determined the question of his residence. This contention, when applied to the construction of laws relating to attachments of the property of nonresident debtors is not sound.” In Weitkamp v. Loehr, 53 N. Y. Superior Ct. 79, 82, it said by O’Gorman, J.: “Generally speaking, domicile and residence mean the same thing. They have, however, at least when used in reference to attachment under the code, different and distinct ineanings. Residence, combined with intention to remain, constitutes domicile.......Residence, in attachment laws, generally implies an established abode," fixed permanently for a time, for business or other purposes, although there may be an intent existing all the while, to return to the true domicile....... In my opinion, actual cessation to dwell within the state for an uncertain period, without definite intention as to any <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>fixed time of returning, even although a general intention to return at some time in the future may exist, constitutes nonresidence, and warrants an issue of an attachment.”</p>

It is true he acquires no new domicil in the country to which he is accredited, but he actually resides there and during such residence he is not amenable to the process of the courts of that country. This is necessary for the protection of his dignity as ambassador of his country and to prevent interference with the proper discharge of his official duties. During his residence abroad he is immune from both civil ánd criminal process in the courts of the country to which he is sent, and if he cannot be sued in the courts of his domicil or where his property may be found, he is beyond the reach of the process of any court to which his creditors may apply to enforce their claims. The consequences of such a doctrine are a sufficient refu<a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>tation of its soundness. A citizen accredited as ambassador to another country may not be sued in the courts of that country, and immunity in the courts of his domicil ought not to be extended so as to delay creditors in the enforcement of their claims until the expiration of a long official term. In the case in hand, the defendant was absent and beyond the reach of the process of the courts of this State for twelve years, which can hardly be considered “the temporary and innocent absence of a resident debtor” referred to in Fuller v.

    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[277,931,1148,1302]]]'>The purpose of foreign attachment being to reach an absent debtor who is beyond the ordinary process of the court, there can be no substantial or controlling reason why an ambassador residing at a foreign court should not be subject to it like any other debtor who by his absence becomes amenable to the writ. He is simply submitting himself to the laws of his country for the adjudication of his rights which every citizen is required to do. It may seem inconvenient to him to respond to the writ, but every debtor whose time is occupied with important official duties or who has large business interests occupying his attention at home or abroad meets with like inconvenience. If, as in this instance, an ambassador has the time to leave the court at which he resides, and engage in business in another foreign country of such importance as is disclosed here, he certainly has sufficient time to respond to the demands of his creditor in a matter arising out of the same transaction. To hold otherwise would be to permit him to absent himself from his official duties and from the court to which he is accredited and engage in business, and protect him against an indebtedness to his creditor arising out of the same transaction. We think such a position is wholly untenable.</p>
