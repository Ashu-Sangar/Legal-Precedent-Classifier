The rule that covenants in oil leases which are to be performed by the lessee and which relate to the right to drill or explore for oil are to be construed most favorably to the lessor is founded upon the presumption that an oil lease is made for the purpose of immediate development unless the contrary appears in the contract. The purpose of the rule is only to spur the lessee to perform his covenant to drill and discover oil; it cannot be invoked to aid the lessor in dispossessing a lessee who has faithfully performed all his covenants, discovered oil in paying quantities and paid the royalties contemplated by the lease.</p>

The owner of several tracts of oil and gas land leased the exclusive right to mine for and produce petroleum and natural gas therefrom for the term of one year and so long thereafter as oil or gas could be produced. Each lessee agreed “To commence the drilling of one well......within thirty days from the date above and prosecute the drilling of same with due diligence to completion and commence the drilling of a second well within sixty days from the completion of the first well, prosecute the drilling of the <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>second well with due diligence to completion, or forfeit all of said land except eight acres around the first well drilled and to commence drilling the third well within sixty days from completion of second well, or forfeit all of said lease, except seventeen acres around the first two wells drilled. A failure of the second party to comply with any of the requirements herein contained to render said lease null and void and to be of no binding force.” The defendant, to whom the leases were all assigned, drilled three wells or more on each of the tracts and produced oil in paying quantities, royalties on which were duly received by the lessor. Certain of the old wells were abandoned and new wells were drilled by defendant which produced oil in paying quantities. On one property leased, all the wells had been abandoned, except one which was destroyed by a flood, and thereafter defendant endeavored to restore the said well but had not succeeded when the bill was filed. Plaintiff sought to enjoin defendant from operating the new wells which it had drilled, alleging that no more than three wells could be drilled on each of the properties leased and that upon the abandonment of the well3 originally drilled defendant was not entitled to drill new wells. The lower court decided that by the discovery of oil in paying quantities in the three wells that each lessee was required to drill, the lessee had become vested with the right to all the oil under the tract on which such wells were drilled, and could drill other holes if it was impossibe to pump all the oil from the holes already drilled; that there was nothing in the evidence to show that defendant had ever surrendered, forfeited or abandoned its right, and dismissed the plaintiff’s bill. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

As oil is fugitive and is not found in all lands, the compensation to the lessor is almost always a royalty. It follows that all covenants to be performed by the lessee which relate to the right to drill or explore for oil are construed most strictly in favor of the lessor. Again, the fact that the lessor usually gets nothing out of his lease except the royalty it yields after oil is discovered by the drill, the presumption always is that a lease is made for the purpose of immediate development unless the contrary appears in the contract of the parties. But this rule that an oil lease is to be construed most favorably to the lessor has its limitations. When the lessee has faithfully performed all his covenants and has discovered oil in paying quantities and the lessor is receiving the royalty that the contract of lease contemplates, he cannot invoke this rule to aid him in dispossessing the lessee. The rule in its purpose is only a spur to compel the lessee to perform his covenant to drill and discover oil. Having fully performed his covenants and having thereby obtained a vested interest in all the oil in the leased premises be<a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>cause of Ms exclusive right to drill, lie holds that interest as security against the lessor, as the grantee in a deed of conveyance holds the land conveyed against the grantor.</p>

The plaintiff’s whole case rests upon the averments of the bill that are admitted in the answer and that were admitted at the hearing by the defendant company’s counsel. Among those admissions on the part of the defendant company we find none that it or its predecessors in title in the respective leases ever did anything or ev,er failed to do anything that under the covenants of the lease would work a forfeiture of its vested interest or be evidence that said interest had been abandoned. Nor was there any evidence offered or any admission made by the defendant company to show that the wells being pumped on the respective leases when the plaintiff’s bill was filed were not producing oil in paying quantities, except in the case of Lease “E,” of which we will speak later on. On the contrary, the plaintiff received the royalty of the oil produced from the pumping wells up to the time the bill was filed and thereby recognized the validity of the defendant’s lease, at least so far as the pumping wells were concerned.</p>

Further, the plaintiff by a contract made with the defendant company on the 21st day of September, 1908, recognized the validity of the defendant’s claim to opr erate said pumping wells.</p>

This claim in our opinion is not tenable. There is a provision in Lease “A” (and a similar provision in the other leases) which reads as follows:</p>

The very fact that the lease provides how the extent of the lease may be reduced from 25 acres to 17 acres or to 8 acres negatives the idea that the extent of the lease can be reduced in any other way and implies that if the lessee drills the three wells in the time named and discovers oil, then the lease shall be valid and binding as to the whole 25 acres so long as oil is produced in paying quantities thereon.
