He paid $10,000 to the brokers and they carried the 500 shares as security for the remainder of the purchase price. Within a few days after the stock was purchased, about the 20th of May, 200 shares of the stock were hypothecated by the plaintiffs, along with other collateral belonging to plaintiffs,, with the Workingmen’s Savings Bank of Allegheny City, for a loan of $50,000 and the remaining 300 shares was hypothecated with the Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh, with other stock belonging to the plaintiffs, for a loan of $250,000.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b623-3" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[198,985,1149,923]]]'>I see no distinction in this case from the case of Sproul &amp; Co. against the same defendant, decided by the Supreme Court of this State at No. 90 October Term, 1912, on May 28,1913. The plaintiffs’ counsel contends that the case at bar differs from the case of Sproul &amp; Co. v. Sloan in that there was no evidence in the latter case of the demand made by the telegrams of Sloan and Heinze &amp; Co. in October of 1907. I am not able to see the distinction which counsel draws. If the hypothecation of this stock in May and June was a conversion of the stock by the plaintiffs, then the defendant had a right to repudiate the transaction as soon as he learned of that conversion, and there is no evidence that lie learned of the conversion until it was developed at the trial of the case. In this view of the case, the verdict for the plaintiffs is wrong and judgment should be entered for the defendant notwithstanding the verdict.</p>
