First he planned to go to Florida; that was abandoned. Then he planned to go to Altoona, and that was abandoned ; and finally on Décémber 3, 191Ó, he was sent to the St. Francis Hospital, Pittsburgh, where he remained until the 23d of December. He was then brought back to Washington and remained for a while at the Siegel Hotel; then was taken to the Washington Hospital in Washington, and about February, 1911, he was taken to his old residence which Was thén occupied by David Hart and his wife, his néphew and niece, who succeeded him in his business and who occupied his old mansion house, and with them he lived until he died. After he came back home his health had somewhat improved, and he appeared to be not so mentally depressed. On May 21,1911, he wrote his will and placed it in his safe in the library of his homé where he then was residing and Where it was found after his. death. He left to survive him a full .sister, Annie E, Ross, a half brother D. M. part, a half sister Elizabeth Dever, and the children of a half brothei’, James P. Hart, who comprised all his heirs at law; His estate, which was turned over to John A. bfowden and Alvan Donnan under the power of attorney, consisted of about $25,000 in personal property, mostly judgments and securities, and a number of pieces of real estate the value of which was estimated at $25,000; find this property remained in their hands up to the time of . his death and comprised his estate.

One of these was that his physical and mental suffering came from syphilis; and it appeared from an examination of his blood that he never had been afflicted with that disease. It appeared also that in investing the money of his wards he had invested it in his own name and that he, in thinking the matter over, had come to the conclusion that by having done so he was guilty of embezzlement and that he was going to get into trouble by reason thereof. He also appeared to have allowed the fact that he had turned his property over to his attorneys-in-fact and had gone out of business, to worry him, and at times had the belief that he was likely to land in the poor house, and that he had not, or would not have, the way things were going, any property left. These thoughts grew on him until he became possessed with the insane' delusion that he was a pauper, and would speak of life, as not being worth much to him any more, that his friends were gone, and that his expenses were going on and that he was not making anything and that he did not have any property, and that the trust funds that he had would be lost and that he would suffer for it. When he was reasoned with and his property and liabilities would be enumerated, he could fully understand and comprehend the property that he possessed and the lia<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>bilities that were upon him and that he was not insolvent; but it would not be long afterwards until he .again would revert to or have the delusion. Neither the physicians nor those who frequently met with him thought him generally insane, but only that he was subject at times to these insane delusions. Dr. Scott was asked this question: “Doctor, on the matter of his financial affairs, I ask you to state whether or not at the time you treated him he was sane or insane?” A. “Well, he was sane; he would be insane on those conditions, you know, now for instance the matter of the syphilis and the matter of coming to want, those were insane conditions.” Q. “Did he at times manifest a knowledge of his estate?” A. “Yes, he would go over that; he could tell you every item; he would name out each one of his liabilities and what his assets were, and seemed to have them the same' always, always remembered them correctly; I presume they were correct; he would always give them about the same, and you would foot them up for him and show him that he had more assets than liabilities, and yet he couldn’t shake that idea off; it would be air right for the time being, you know, when you would show him that, and then he would get out of that by saying that his expenses would be — ” Q. “Now, Doctor, from your knowledge of the disease, is it natural to find patients suffering with melancholia and harboring insane delusions of that kind and yet in other ways have business judgment and business ability?” A. “Yes, many times they do.” Q. “It is common with them?” A. “Yes.” Q. “That is, they have insane delusions along certain lines, while in other respects their mind apparently is sane?” A. “Yes.” A number of witnesses who came in contact with Mr. Hart were examined, but their testimony was substantially such as we have indicated that Dr. Scott’s and Dr. Walker’s was.</p>

To our mind, the intelligence and the apparent purpose of his making this will and the disposition he made of his estate and the manner in which he expressed himself in making that disposition, conclusively show that these delusions of which the witnesses testified were not operating on his mind, but that the will was made in one of those moments in which he had in his mind a clear and distinct purpose that embraced not only a knowledge of the persons to whom he wished his estate to go but the proportion that each should receive of that estate, be it large or small.</p>

In fact the only departure that the will makes from what would be the distinct distributive scheme of the intestate law, is that he gives half brothers, including the children of one who was deceased, and his half sister a share of the real estate as well as the personalty, and to let them share in the real estate was the only occasion and purpose, as we have already said, of making the will at all, his design being that his estate, whatever it might amount to, after the payment of his debts, should be equally divided among his kindred.
