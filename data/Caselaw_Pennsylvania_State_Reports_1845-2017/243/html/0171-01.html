Where a writ of venire had been executed, but due to the use of an old- blank in which the name of a former judge of the court was printed, was improperly attested, although correct in other respects, it was not error for the court to refuse to quash the array of jurors and to allow the writ to be amended after its execution.

The opening of a jury wheel at the proper time and place in the presence of the sheriff and but one commissioner is not ground for quashing the array of jurors. The provision of the Act of April 10, 1867, P.

L. 46, which provides that a new panel may be chosen “if by accident, mistake or neglect of the sheriff or jury commissioners of any county, or either of them, the wheel aforesaid has been opened, unlocked or unsealed, except in the presence of such sheriff and jury commissioners, and a challenge to the array has been sustained for any of the last mentioned causes.” The purpose of the latter act is to provide a method of supplying jurors when a previous array has been quashed.</p>

On a trial for murder it appeared that the defendant and certain others had together committed a series of robberies; that on such occasions defendant was armed with a revolver; and that after one of these robberies defendant had said to one of his associates, that if a policeman should come he would run or shoot. Subsequently the deceased and two other officers came to defendant’s house with warrants for the arrest of two of defendant’s associates on the charge of robbery. The defendant, who was present at the arrest, went upstairs to get the coats of the prisoners, and while there remarked to his room-mate that the policemen had come and “they are going to take me and I think I had better run away.” Defendant then took a revolver, let himself down into the yard and ran away. A few minutes later shots were heard and deceased, who was on guard outside, was found suffering from bullet wounds, one of which caused his death. The deceased said he had been shot by a man in a dark suit and wearing a derby hat, and who ran out towards the front of the house and went down the street. A witness who heard the shots saw a man running away who wore such clothes and was carrying a revolver. The day after, the shooting the defendant gave a revolver to his cousin. The court refused to exclude the evidence of the robberies and of defendant’s participation therein. <em>Held, </em>that a verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree should be sustained.</p>

The error resulted from the use, by the clerk, of an old blank in which the name of Judge Abchbald was printed, and his name was not erased therefrom when the writ went out, nor was the name of the present judge inserted. Subsequently, the court below permitted the writ to be amended in these particulars, but this was not done until the writ had been executed, and after the motion to quash had been made. With the exception noted, the writ was correct in every respect It followed the form prescribed by the act of assembly; was issued in the name of the Common.wealth; signed by the clerk of the court, and sealed with the seal of the court. In Com. v. Smith, 2 S. &amp; R., 300, decided in 1816, in the blank left in the printed form of venire, for the name of the president judge, no name was inserted. Por this reason it was urged that the array of jurors should be quashed. It was held that the venire was superfluous, as the precept of the court was sufficient authority for the drawing of the jury. Defects in the venire were, therefore, immaterial. The Act of April 14, 1834, P. L. 333, prescribes the writ for the first time. But in the decision in Com. v. Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Yeates%20185" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="4 Yeates 185">supra,</a> Chief Justice Tilghman said: “What weighs greatly with the court, is that the errors assigned do not affect •the merits of the case.” So in the present instance the failure of the clerk to substitute the name of Judge Edwards for that of Judge Abchbald, in the attestation of the writ does not in any way affect the merits of the case. The alleged defect was at most a clerical error, and. the writ having been properly executed, was amendable. The venire was only a precept to the sheriff to ■summon the jurors drawn, and having answered its purpose, it cannot now be assailed for any mere irregularity not affecting substantial justice. The general principle is thus stated in, 12 Ency. L. &amp; Pr. 300, where it is said:</p>

    <p id="b207-3" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[222,672,1150,1631]]]'>The Act of April 10,1867, P. L. 62, section 3, provides that the jury commissioners and shériff, “or any two of them,” shall draw from the proper wheel panels of jurors, &amp;c. The terms of this act were met in the present case. But it is contended that the Act of March 18, 1874, P. L. 46, which was a supplement to the Act of 1867, changed the law. The Act of 1874 provided for the selection of a new panel when a challenge to the array of a former panel has been sustained, or the array quashed. In the first section, enumerating the instances in which a new panel may be chosen, it is said: “If by accident, mistake or neglect of the sheriff or jury commissioners of any county, or either of them', the wheel aforesaid has been opened, unlocked or unsealed, except in the presence of such sheriff and jury commissioners, and a challenge to the aiTay has been sustained for any of the last-mentioned causes.” This language, it is suggested, changed the requirements of the Act of 1867, and permits the wheel to be opened only in the presence of the sheriff and two commissioners. We do not see in it any intention to repeal or amend the Act of 1867, in this respect. Its purpose is to provide a method of supplying jurors when a previous array has been quashed. That is not the case here. The jury commissioners may be regarded as a body, and as such, the Act of 1867 authorizes one of them representing the body, and acting with the sheriff, to draw panels of jurors from the wheel. The power to draw from the wheel includes manifestly the right to open it. We are of the opinion that the court below was right in refusing to quash the array of jurors.</p>

An examination of the evidence shows that it was admissible for the purpose of showing, first, that appellant had a revolver; second, a motive for the killing; and that it was wilful and intentional and not accidental. It appeared from the testimony that on January 8,1913, appellant was actively engaged in the robbery at Simpson, and on January 14th he took part in the robbery at Throop. On both occasions he had in his possession and exhibited a revolver. After the Simpson robbery he said to one of his associates in the crime that if the policemen should come, he would run, and if he couldn’t run, he would shoot. On January 16, the officers came to his home with warrants for the arrest of two of his associates, charging them with the robberies. He was present when the arrests were made and offered to go up stairs and get the coats of the prisoners When, he came into his room up-stairs, he said to his room-mate, Funk, who was there, that the policemen had come after Davitt and “they are going to take me and I think I better run away.” He then took a revolver from his trunk and with the aid of a bedspread which Funk held, let himself down from the second-story window into the yard, holding the revolver in his hand. When he reached the ground he ran away. In a minute or less two shots were heard, and immediately afterwards McAndrew called out, and was found in front of the house where he had been on guard, suffering from two bullet wounds, one of which caused his death two days later. He said he had been shot by a man in a dark suit and wearing a derby hat, who had run out towards the front of the house and had gone down the street. A witness who lived across the street from appellant’s home heard the shots and saw a man running away, wearing a derby hat and holding a revolver in his hand. There was also testimony that appellant usually wore a black derby hat. The day after <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>the shooting appellant gave a revolver to his cousin who threw it into the river.</p>
    <p id="b209-3" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[216,456,1159,1515]]]'>If the jury believed this testimony, it was sufficient to justify the conclusion that appellant was alarmed by the presence of the officers, and fearing arrest for the robberies in which he had participated a few days before, attempted to escape. That in pursuance of a previously expressed purpose, he armed himself with a revolver in order to shoot if he could not otherwise get away. Meeting an officer in front of the house, he did shoot. The testimony as to his participation in the robberies was relevant. It tended to show intention to commit, and motive for, the alleged crime. The distinction as to such evidence is thus stated in 2 Wharton on Crim. Ev. (10th Ed. 1912) sec. 920, where it is said: “The well-settled rule that evidence of collateral crimes cannot be introduced on the trial of the homicide charge, is subject to an exception where the collateral crime precedes, or is contemporaneous with, or a part of the charge on trial, and the circumstances surrounding the collateral crime are essential to proof of or to explain the crime charged.” And in 12 Cyc. 410, it is said, on p. 410: “Evidence to show the motive prompting the commission of the crime is relevant and admissiblé notwithstanding it also shows the commission by the accused of another crime of a similar or dissimilar character. Thus it may be shown that the crime was committed for the purpose of concealing another crime, or to prevent the accused from being convicted of another crime.”</p>
    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[213,1993,1153,251]]]'>Under these well established principles, the trial court was clearly right in admitting evidence of appellant’s participation in the robberies.
