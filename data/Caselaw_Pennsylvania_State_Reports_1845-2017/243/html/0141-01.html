He died intestate and left a large estate consisting of personal property and real es- ' tate valued at between one and two million dollars. Letters of administration were issued to M. C. Acheson, Esq., who settled and distributed the personal éstate under the direction of the Orphans’ Court of this county. On distribution the Orphans’ Court decreed the personal estate to Sara McKeown as widow, and to Arthur Mc-Keown, Byron McKeown, John McKeown, Scott A. Mc-Keown and James B. McKeown as sons of John McKeown, who each received and receipted for his and her share. Sara McKeown and the five sons also went into possession of his real estate immediately after John McKeown’s' death, claiming to be the legal owners thereof. On November 27, 1910, Sara McKeown died testate, and Anna Braden, the defendant, and daughter of Sara McKeowfi and John C. King who was her husband before she lived with John McKeown as his wife, was made a beneficiary under her will, there being left ■to her large sums of money and property which are now in the possession of the said Anna Braden as the legatee under the will of her said mother. Before her death, Sara McKeown, by the death of three of her sons intestate, took the property and interest which the said three 'sons took in the éstate of the said John McKeown. John McKeown when he died left two sisters in Ireland to survive him, Catherine Kane and Anna. Bellew. They died some years ago intestate, and the plaintiffs in this suit are their sons and daughters. Shortly after the death of John McKeown, Sara McKeown, his reputed wife, and her son, Arthur, with an attorney, visited the <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>sisters of .John McKeown in Ireland and obtained from them a release and assignment of their interest in the estate of their brother John McKeown. The consideration of the release and assignment was the payment of the sum of $11,000 and the building of a dwelling house for said Anne Bellew, and the $11,000 and the money used in building the house was paid out of the money that came to Mrs. McKeown and her sons out of the estate of John McKeown from the. administrator when he made distribution under the order of the Orphans’ Court of this county.</p>

The reason of it is this: Having perpetrated a- fraud and by means thereof obtained the property of another, equity will not permit him to enjoy the fruits of his fraud, but will hold him to be a trustee for the rightful owxxer. He is not of course a trustee of the title, for that he never acquired, but of the thing which he has in manual possession. Such cases are not technically trusts bxxt are trusts ex maleficio, or trusts resulting from the fraud practiced by the one who has possession of the property. Fraud arises sometimes out of the abuse of a confidence, and that abuse of confidence-is the grounds of decx*eeing a <em>trust </em>ex maleficio,. But nothing of that kind arises in the case at bar, for the reason that no confidential or fiduciary relation existed between Sara McKeown and Catherine Kane and Anne Bellew. On the contrary, they were adverse-claimants to the same estate and dealt with each other at arms length; and this being the case, the fraud that is to be made the basis of .a decree in this case is actual fraud, Such fraud is never to be presumed but must,be pro ven,-.and in averring <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>it in a bill of complaint it is not sufficient to ater tlie legal conclusion that an act was fraudulently doné'or representation fraudulently made, but the facts which constitute the fraud must be clearly and explicitly set out, so that' the court and not the pleader may judge whether the act or representation complained of was fraudulent or otherwise.</p>

For thirty years she had been the common law wife of John McKeown; he had recognized her as such; she had aided him during these years in accumulating the for-: tune that he left, or at least was his helpmate when he was accumulating the fortune. She had borne to him <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>five sons, and tlie relation of husband and wife and father and mother to these children, and the maintenance of a home as husband and wife, together with the fact that John McKeown advertised to the world that she was his wife, gave her a standing to present her claim as a common law wife to a share in his estate, and gave to the sons of her and John McKeown the same right. Again, in presenting that claim she practiced no deceit upon Catherine Kane or Anne Bellew. Under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania they had the same notice that she had that a third party was settling this estate and was about to distribute the same under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The sisters had constructive notice at least that if they wished to contest the right of Sara McKeown and of the five sons who claimed to be lineal heirs, they could do so; the court was open to them; and they having failed to appear either at the original hearing or having failed to appear for five years to ask that the decree made by the court be opened, it strikes us that it would be inequitable for this court to disturb the decree of the Orphans’ Court on the simple allegation, which is in the nature of a conclusion of law, that Sara King fraudulently imposed upon the court when she made the claim that she was the wife of John McKeown and withheld the fact, of which she had knowledge, that her husband John C.

The bill of the plaintiffs is perfectly silent as to how Mrs: McKeown attempted to establish her claim and that of her sons. The complaint of the bill is that she,, knowing what slie did, that is that John C. King was alive, perpetrated a fraud on the court by coming into court with such a claim. This clearly is not a fraud on the court.

The facts further show that these sisters must have known that when Mrs. McKeown and her attorney approached them to obtain a release and assignment of their interest in his estate, she was an adverse claimant; hnd they, certainly knew that John McKeown was dead, and did know or could have known that M. C. Achespn, an outside party, was the administrator of his estate'; and the fact that they acquiesced in the release and as<a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>signment until tlieir death and never during the five years that the law gives them to file a bill of review made any move in that direction, is conclusive evidence that those who might have Successfully contested the claim of Sara McKeown and her sons never did so, and the presumption must prevail that their release and assignment given to Mrs. McKeown and their receipt of the money from her was a compromise between adverse claimants tó an estate and therefore not a nudum pactum but a compromise contract supported by a valuable consideration.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b183-5" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[195,921,1153,1522]],["BL_184.1",184,[291,313,1153,1240]]]'>■ This brings us to another phase of this case, and- that is the question of laches. When this bill was filed by the plaintiffs (who never were the heirs at law of John Mc-Keown) twenty-one years and nine months had passed since the estate of John McKeown came into the hands of those who are now in the possession of it. The real estate of which he died seized was entered upon 'under a claim of title and under a color of title by the Mc: Keowns as heirs at law of John McKeown, and they have held it ever since under that claim adversely to the plaintiffs and their ancestors. Mrs. McKeown and those to whom she bequeathed her personal estate have also held ’the personal property from the time the estate was distributed up to the present time, • over twenty years; This property has changed its character. And even if what the plaintiffs have set up as a fraud was a fraud sufficiently averred, still we have the Act of 1840 and then the Act of 1856, which expressly provide that no trust ex maleficio shall be declared after five years, from the fraudulent act if known, or five years after it is discovered or bught to have been discovered; Catherine Káne and Anne Bellew over twenty years ago were informed of the death of their brother. They knew, or-were supposed to have known, that they as his sisters were entitled to his estate as collateral heirs if. he left no legal wife bf legal' issue. It was their duty to investigate- whether or not they had any rights in his estate. They were put upon notice, and shortly, after his death <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>they were approached by one who by the very request to .purchase their interest in the estate showed that she was an adverse claimant to the estate, and notwithstanding that, they gave the release and assignment and never during their life questioned it, and their children never questioned it until within three months of the time they filed their bill, and why they then questioned it is not made apparent by the pleadings; or, in other words, no satisfactory explanation of the delay is pleaded by them. Again, it was impossible for Sara McKeown to conceal the fact that her former husband, John C. King, was alive. The fact that he was alive would be just as apparent to every person with whom he came in contact as it would be to her, and she therefore did not have knowledge of a fact which Catherine Kane and Anne Bellew could not have discovered from other sources just as well as from her; and further, she was under no obligation to reveal to them the fact that he was alive, as she maintained no confidential relation and owed no duty to them that would require the revealing of such a fact. Clearly théy have delayed so long the time for invoking the aid of a court of equity, that it wofild be inequitable to grant the .relief for which they now pray.</p>
