        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Elkin,\nThe argument of appellant is a challenge to the power of the legislature to create tbe new Municipal Court under tbe provisions of the Act of July 12, A. D. 1913, P. L. 711. Tbe vital and controlling questions raised by this appeal have been decided adversely to tbe contentions of appellant by this court in two recent cases: Gottschall v. Campbell, 234 Pa. 347; Com. v. Hopkins, 241 Pa. 213. Tbe last case cited was an appeal from the Superior Court and the order of that court was affirmed here on tbe opinion of Judge Head. What was decided in these cases must be accepted as settled law if the doctrine of stare decisis is to have any binding force in determining questions involving constitutional construction in our State. Tbe questions raised in the cases cited were not free from doubt or difficulty, and there was and is a difference of opinion as to tbe proper interpretation of tbe constitutional provisions involved. These doubts were resolved in favor of tbe constitutionality of tbe Allegheny County Court Act, and in sustaining that act it was necessary to consider and decide most of tbe questions raised by tbe present appeal. It would serve no useful purpose to travel over the ground again by elaborating the discussion and emphasizing tbe views so well expressed by Brother Potter of our own court in the Gottschall case, and by Judge Head of the Superior Court in the Hopkins case. The basic principle of these decisions was that the Constitution in express language gave the legislature power to create from time to time courts other than those enumerated in the organic law, and this power having been expressly conferred in the first section of the judiciary article, nothing contained in the subsequent sections of the article dealing with the organization, jurisdiction and powers of courts, was sufficient to deprive the legislative branch of government of the power to create courts of a different class or grade from those expressly enumerated. The power to create \u201csuch other courts as the general assembly may from time to time establish\u201d is the same in the constitutions of 1790, 1838 and 1874. Under the earlier constitutions this power was challenged by proceedings in court, as it is now, but this court consistently held the view that the legislature had the power to divest the courts enumerated in the Constitution of some of their jurisdiction and vest it in courts from time to time established, or may vest a limited concurrent jurisdiction in courts thus created: Com. v. Zephon, 8 W. & S. 382; Com. v. Martin, 2 Pa. 244; Com. v. Green, 58 Pa. 226; In re Application of Judges, 64 Pa. 33; Com. v. Hipple, 69 Pa. 9. In passing upon the constitutionality of the Allegheny County Court Act, in the two recent cases above referred to, this court adopted and followed the reasoning of the learned justices who wrote the opinions in the earlier cases. There was a difference of opinion in this court when the earlier cases were decided, and there is now, as to the power of the legislature to divest courts enumerated in the Constitution Of any part of their jurisdiction and vest it in courts established by the legislature from time to time, but these doubts and differences were resolved in favor of sustaining the constitutionality of the earlier acts, just as in the recent cases they were resolved in favor of sustaining the power of the legislature to create courts of a different class or grade from those enumerated in the Constitution, with a limited or concurrent jurisdiction. This court in the recent cases finally decided, although all the justices did not agree,that nothing contained in the present Constitution required a departure from the settled rule of construction under the earlier cases. This is the answer to the main contentions pressed upon us by the learned counsel for appellant in the present case.\nWe need but advert to one more question in order to dispose of the present appeal. It arises under Section 26, of Article V, of the Constitution, which provides: \u201cAll laws relating to courts shall be general, and of uniform operation, and the organization, jurisdiction, and powers of all courts of the same class or grade, so far as regulated by law, and the force and effect of the process and judgments of such courts, shall- be uniform.\u201d It will be observed that the uniformity required by this section applies only to courts of the same class or grade. The learned court below held that the Municipal Court of Philadelphia was not.of the same class or grade as the County Court of Allegheny County, and if the class or grade of a court is to be determined by the jurisdiction and powers with which it is clothed, and no other method of determining this question has been suggested, and we know of none, clearly the conclusion reached by the court below was the proper one. The jurisdiction and powers of the two courts differ in nearly every essential. particular, and this difference is so marked as to warrant the conclusion that the legislature, intended to establish a Municipal Court in Philadelphia of a different class or grade from that created for Allegheny County. That the legislature had the power to create a, court for Allegheny County, and another court of a different class or grade for Philadelphia County, according to their respective needs, was decided in theGottsehall case, and for the purposes of this appeal nothing further need be said.\nThe present bill was filed to restrain the county commissioners from the expenditure of public moneys in providing necessary accommodations for the Municipal Court. If this court was lawfully created and has a legal existence for its primary purposes, the public authorities cannot be enjoined from providing suitable accommodations on the ground that some provisions of the act may contain doubtful grants of power. As was decided in the Gottsehall case, if it be deemed expedient to raise any such question, it can be done in a proper proceeding at a subsequent time by a party directly interested in the litigation in which it arises.\nWithout prolonging the discussion, we have concluded that under the authority of the Gottsehall and Hopkins cases, the Municipal Court of Philadelphia County has been lawfully established by the legislature and that the county commissioners cannot be enjoined from providing it with suitable accommodations.\nDecree affirmed, and it is ordered that the costs of the appellant and the appellee be paid by the County of Philadelphia.",

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker :\nWhile I did not concur in Gottschall v. Campbell, 234 Pa. 347, or in Com. v. Hopkins, 241 Pa. 213, yet, we decided in those cases that a court of the general character of the one under consideration could lawfully be created, that the act then before us was constitutional and that thereunder certain jurisdiction always before that time exercised by the judges of the Common Pleas sitting in the Quarter Sessions could be transferred to and vested exclusively in the new Allegheny County Court, \u2014 thus holding that the judges of the Common Pleas could in this manner be absolutely deprived of powers and jurisdiction, and that the jurisdiction of the Quarter Sessions of that county could be made to differ from that of all other courts of the same grade in the State, notwithstanding Section 26, of Article Y, of the Constitution. In other words, we expressly ruled that for court purposes Allegheny County was in one legislative class and Philadelphia in another, and, in effect, that the jurisdiction of a court need only be uniform with that of other courts of the same grade in the county or counties constituting the class in question; further, that the jurisdiction theretofore vested in the judges of the Common Pleas might be transferred to a new tribunal created by the legislature, without providing for appeal to the former court or to any other court in which Common Pleas judges had power to preside.\nTo my mind, according to the organic law as we have construed it, the provisions of the Constitution here claimed to have been broken, could only be made to apply to the present situation by holding the new Municipal Court to be a tribunal of the same grade as the Court of Common Pleas in the County of Philadelphia, and this c\u00f3urt is practically unanimous in the opinion that that proposition is not tenable; therefore, since the tribunal created by the act before us is not on a grade with any other court within the classified territory in which it is located, the conclusion necessarily follows that it is not required to be \u201cuniform in organization, jurisdiction and powers\u201d with any established standard; hence, the appellant\u2019s principal ground of attack is eliminated from the case.\nIt is settled' in Pennsylvania that the doctrine' of stare decisis applies to and controls constitutional questions so long as the original cases are not formally overruled : Kilpatrick v. Com., 31 Pa. 198, 214, 215; Com. v. Nat. Oil Co., 157 Pa. 516, 523; In re Application of Judges, 64 Pa. 33, 38; Morgan v. Reel, 213 Pa. 81, 86, 88. In its main features the statute in question is . consistent with, and the legislation .simply follows the logic of, our decisions in the Allegheny County Court cases. Although the construction there' placed upon the organic law of the State may not accord with my own view, yet, while those authorities remain they must be read with the Constitution as though part of it, and their binding force and effect cannot properly be questioned by anyone, least of all by a member of the court that announced them; therefore, under the doctrine of stare decisis, and upon that ground alone, I concur in the present judgment.\nMr. Justice Mesteezat and Mr. Justice Stewart, dissent.",

By the Act of July 12, 1913, P.

Section 10 of the act enables a party plaintiff to oust absolutely and without appeal the constitutional jurisdiction of the Common Pleas in certain cases fixed by a pecuniary limit, in violation not only of Section 6, Ar-tide V, but also in violation of Section 26, Article V, of tbe Constitution.\nSection 10 of the act empowers a majority of the judges of any court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia County to transfer any case brought in that court to the said county court and involves a surrender of the right of a majority of said court to exercise the powers vested in the judges of the Common Pleas of Philadelphia County and a divestiture of the rights and powers of the minority judge as distinguished from the court in violation of Section 26, Article V, of the Constitution, by creating a court to exercise the powers vested by the Constitution in the judges of the Court of Common Pleas: Com. v. Green, 58 Pa. 226.\nThe title of the act is defective in that it does not contain any allusion to that part of the act which confers upon the Courts of Common Pleas the right to divest themselves and their colleagues of the jurisdiction and powers and confer the same upon the judges of the Municipal Court, and in that while the act deprives the Court of Quarter Sessions of jurisdiction in certain cases there is nothing in the title having any reference thereto: Ruan Street, 132 Pa. 257; In re Wyoming Street, 137 Pa. 494.\nThe act violates Section 6, Article I, of the Constitution, by attaching burdensome conditions to the exercise of the right of trial by jury: Mansfield\u2019s Case, 22 Pa.

Campbell, 234 Pa. 347.\nAfter the Allegheny court had been established the legislature was not unable to create in Philadelphia County a special court other than one similar to the Allegheny court. The Constitution recognizes that the County of Allegheny may need special courts; that the County of Philadelphia may need special courts and that the residue of the counties may need special courts; but the fact that a special court is needed for Allegheny County does not determine that the same kind of a court is needed for Philadelphia County or for any one of the other counties of the State.\nSections 4, 9 and 11, Paragraph B, of the Act of July 12, 1913, do not violate Section 6, Article III, of the Constitution: Garrett v.
