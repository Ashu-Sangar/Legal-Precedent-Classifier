Reid, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.\nArgued Nov. 6, 1913.\nAppeal, No. 278, Oct. T., 1913, by plaintiffs, from judgment of O. P. Allegheny Co., Jan. T., 1910, No. 617, on judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto in case of Lawrence Darr, Administrator of the Estate of George W. Darr, deceased, Joseph H. Moore and Arthur F. Luke, trading as Darr, Luke and Moore v. Fidelity Title & Trust Company, Committee of John Sloan, a lunatic.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Elkin, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAction to recover alleged balance on an account for stock purchased on margin.\nEvans, J., filed the following opinion sur defendant\u2019s motion for judgment non obstante veredicto:\nThis case comes before the court on a motion for judgment n. o. v. ex parte defendant. The facts as found by the jury are as follows:\nOn May 16, 1907, John Sloan gave an order to the plaintiffs for the purchase of 500 shares of United Copper stock, which was purchased for him at a cost of $30,750. He paid $10,000 to the brokers and they carried the 500 shares as security for the remainder of the purchase price. Within a few days after the stock was purchased, about the 20th of May, 200 shares of the stock were hypothecated by the plaintiffs, along with other collateral belonging to plaintiffs,, with the Workingmen\u2019s Savings Bank of Allegheny City, for a loan of $50,000 and the remaining 300 shares was hypothecated with the Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh, with other stock belonging to the plaintiffs, for a loan of $250,000.\nSometime in October, 1907, the plaintiffs received a telegram signed John Sloan, and one from Heinze & Co., of New York, demanding the production of the 800 shares of stock placed in the hands of the plaintiffs as collateral on the amount due on the purchase price of 500 shares at the place of business of Heinze & Co. on the day following. The stock was redeemed and the plaintiffs presented it at the place of business of Heinze & Co. in New York City, demanding from them the remainder of the purchase price, which not being forthcoming the stock was retained.\nOn June 21,1909, the 800 shares of stock pledged with the plaintiffs was sold by the plaintiffs for $5.00 a share, and this suit is brought to recover the remainder of the purchase price, $19,507.\nI see no distinction in this case from the case of Sproul & Co. against the same defendant, decided by the Supreme Court of this State at No. 90 October Term, 1912, on May 28,1913. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel contends that the case at bar differs from the case of Sproul & Co. v. Sloan in that there was no evidence in the latter case of the demand made by the telegrams of Sloan and Heinze & Co. in October of 1907. I am not able to see the distinction which counsel draws. If the hypothecation of this stock in May and June was a conversion of the stock by the plaintiffs, then the defendant had a right to repudiate the transaction as soon as he learned of that conversion, and there is no evidence that lie learned of the conversion until it was developed at the trial of the case. In this view of the case, the verdict for the plaintiffs is wrong and judgment should be entered for the defendant notwithstanding the verdict.\nAnd now, September 30, 1913, judgment is hereby entered for the defendant in the above entitled case non obstante veredicto.\nFurther facts appear by the report of Sproul v. Sloan, 241 Pa. 284.\nError assigned was in entering judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto.\nJ as. W. Kinnear, of Kinnear, MeCloslcey & Best, for appellants.\nInasmuch as the defendant demanded delivery of his stock-at a certain time and plaintiffs tendered delivery as demanded, which tender was refused to the great injury of the plaintiffs, not because the stock had been hypothecated, but because of over buying, defendant is estopped from setting up the former technical conversion of his stock as a defense to this action, even though he did not know his stock had been technically converted by the plaintiffs: Chapman v. Chapman, 59 Pa. 214; Hill v. Epley, 31 Pa. 331; Putnam v. Tyler, 117 Pa. 570; Miller\u2019s App., 84 Pa. 391; Comm. v. Moltz, 10 Pa. 527; Pickard v. Sears, 6 Adol. & Ellis 469; Dezell v. Odell, 3 Hill 215; Anthony v. Unangst, 174 Pa. 10.\nJohn M. Freeman, of Watson & Freeman, with him Robert Woods Sutton, and Harry F. Stambaugh, for appellee.\nThe demand by Heinze & Company upon the plaintiffs for delivery of this stock did not waive or estop the defendant from raising the question of the plaintiffs\u2019 illegal conversion of the stock: Adams v. Ashman, 203 Pa. 536; Brant v. Virginia Coal & Iron Co., 93 U. S. 326; Freedman v. Fire Association, 168 Pa. 249; Diehl v. Ins. Co., 58 Pa. 443; Pence v. Langdon, 99 U. S. 578; Franklin Nat\u2019l. Bank v. Whitehead, 149 Ind. 560; Burnham v. Lawson, 118 N. Y. App. Div. 389; Stewart v. Harris, 101 N. Y. App. Div. 181.\nJanuary 5, 1914:"
