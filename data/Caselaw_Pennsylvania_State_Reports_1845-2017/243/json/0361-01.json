        "text": "Pee Curiam,\nThe negligence of the defendant in permitting, for many months, the loose ends of a barbed wire fence to extend over a narrow sidewalk of a borough street was not denied at the trial. The main ground of defense was that the plaintiffs were negligent in walking on the sidewalk in the dusk of the evening, with knowledge of the condition of the fence, when a safe and convenient way on another street was open to them. The learned trial judge found that this defense was sustained as to Thomas Mulligan, the father, who had used the street daily, and entered judgment against him non obstante veredicto. His daughter, the other plaintiff, who suffered the entire destruction of an eye by coming into contact with the wire was eleven years and six months of age. The instruction as to her was that she should be held to only the degree of care that was ordinarily to be expected of a child of her age. This instruction was clearly right. The measure of a child\u2019s responsibility in his capacity to see and appreciate danger and while the measure varies with each additional year, the standard is the average capacity of others of his age and intelligence: Kehler v. Schwenk, 144 Pa. 348. We find no merit in the assignments of error.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

Homestead Borough, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Boroughs \u2014 Dangerous sidewalks \u2014 Barbed wire fence \u2014 Infants\u2014Contributory negligence \u2014 Case for jury.\n1. The measure of a child\u2019s responsibility for his own injuries in an accident caused by negligence is his capacity to see and appreciate danger, and while the measure varies with each additional year, the standard is the average capacity of others of his age and intelligence.\n2. In an action against a borough to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff, a girl eleven and a half years old, as the result of coming in contact with the loose ends of a barbed wire fence extending over a narrow sidewalk upon which plaintiff was walking in the dusk of evening, where the negligence of the defendant was admitted, but it was contended that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in using such sidewalk, when a safe and convenient way on another street was opened to her, the court did not err in submitting the case to the jury under an instruction to the effect that the child should be held only to the degree of care that was ordinarily to be expected of a child of her age.\nArgued Oct. 29,1913.\nAppeal, No. 240, Oct. T., 1913, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Allegheny Co., Nov. T., 1911, No. 149, on verdict for plaintiffs in case of Eleanor Mulligan, a minor, by her father and next friend, Thomas F.
