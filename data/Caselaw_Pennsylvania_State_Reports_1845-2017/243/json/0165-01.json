The case was considered with care by the learned judge of the Common Pleas and the bill was dismissed on his finding that a partnership did not exist. Our examination of the testimony le\u00e1ves no doubt of the correctness of the conclusion reached. But if a doubt existed it would not be ground for a reversal of the decree. Nothing but clear error will warrant the setting aside of findings of fact by a chancellor. What was said in the recent case of Eppsteiner v. Isman, 239 Pa. 393: \u201cThe findings of fact by a judge, which involve the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, will be given the effect of a verdict of a jury and they will not be disturbed where there is testimony to support them\u201d was \u00e1 repetition of what before had been repeatedly said on the same subject.\nThe decree is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.",
