    <p id="b409-4" data-blocks='[["BL_409.4",409,[135,523,1149,929]]]'>Defendant petitioned to open and likewise petitioned to strike off a judgment entered by confession in the amount of $232,270.94, by virtue of a warrant of attorney contained in a mortgage note. There was included in the confessed judgment “insurance premiums totaling $1822.56,” an item which was not included in the mortgage note. The lower Court opened but refused to strike the judgment and from its Order refusing to strike the judgment this appeal was taken. The law is well settled that a warrant of attorney authorizing the confession and entry of a judgment — because it is such an oppressive weapon — must be strictly construed and strictly followed according to and with all its terms: <em>Grady v.
