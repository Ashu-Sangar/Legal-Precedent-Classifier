    <p id="b513-4" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[126,494,1147,475]]]'>A number of years ago an assistant city solicitor made an apparently incorrect ruling in reference to the assessment of the Philadelphia Mercantile License Tax.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> That ruling has since been repudiated. Appellant now comes before this Court and claims, solely on the basis of this isolated erroneous ruling, that the assessment in his case was discriminatory and infringed upon his constitutional rights of due process and equal protection of the laws.</p>

Prior error by an administrative official when interpreting a valid tax statute is insufficient, in itself, to constitute a violation of the rights of due process and equal protection of the laws.</p>
