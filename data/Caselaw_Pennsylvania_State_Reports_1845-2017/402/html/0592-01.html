    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[110,482,1154,1303]]]'>Initially, we are confronted with the question of whether equity has jurisdiction of these proceedings, there existing a statutory appeal procedure. Act of June 23, 1931, P. L. 932, as amended, §§2517, 2518, 2521, 53 PS §§37517, 37518, 37521. The crux of this problem is stated as well as can be in <em>Wynnefield United Presbyterian Church v. City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/348/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="348 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="1220345" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0252-01">348 Pa. 252</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.2d%20276" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="35 A.2d 276">35 A. 2d 276</a> (1944) : “A distinction has been taken between the cases in which over-assessment or inadequate exemption has been alleged and the cases in which the property owner denies the power to levy any tax. In the former, it has been held that the remedy is by appeal from the assessment, as the statute provides, and not in equity; in the latter, equity affords the remedy. . . .” Application of this principle to assessment cases has led to the unusual procedure whereby the merits of the controversy are examined before jurisdiction is determined; that is, the court has first reviewed the merits to discover if the taxpayer is totally exempt or only partially so. If it decides that the latter result is proper, it then determines that equity has no jurisdiction and dismisses the complaint. A good example of this procedure is seen in <em>Dougherty v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/314/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="314 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1154722" data-case-paths="/pa/314/0298-01">314 Pa. 298</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.%20583" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="171 A. 583">171 Atl. 583</a> (1934).</p>
    <p id="b615-6" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[107,1795,1149,597]]]'>It takes little study to realize that this procedure is at odds with the general rule laid down in <em>Jacobs v.

The efficacy of the rule that a statutory remedy must be pursued, if one exists, in preference to any other proceeding is hardly questionable; its application to a tax assessment proceeding whereby those most familiar with the intricacies of tax assessments are able to review the controversy thoroughly is unquestionable.</p>

Considering the ample protection of the statutory procedure now afforded a taxpayer and the greater skill of local assessing officers in reviewing these matters prior to court proceedings, it seems unjustifiable to continue upholding equitable jurisdiction where a taxpayer claims its charitable status entitles it to a 100% exemption from taxation while relegating to the statutory proceeding a taxpayer one percent of whose property is admitted or found to be taxable, the other 99% percent being exempt. We conclude, therefore, that, absent a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute or of official action thereunder, equity has no jurisdiction to restrain the collection of taxes and that the present complaint should be dismissed.</p>
