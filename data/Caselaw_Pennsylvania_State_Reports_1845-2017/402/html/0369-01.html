On August 19, 1959, a motion was filed to strike off the discontinuance, the substance of which motion was a claim that it was entered without the knowledge, consent or authority of the plaintiff. After the filing of a responsive answer, depositions were taken and submitted. Following a consideration thereof and argument by counsel, the court below entered an opinion and order dismissing the motion to strike off. From that action, this appeal was filed.</p>
