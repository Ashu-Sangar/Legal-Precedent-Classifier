The Authority answered, denying the validity of the contract and contending that because it was entered into by prior members of the Authority for a proposed term to extend beyond the appointed terms of each of the prior members, it could not bind the succeeding members of the Authority. In addition, the Authority filed a counterclaim for those monies paid to appellee at the rate of $15,000 a year which exceeded the $10,000 rate for which the appellee had previously contracted. The court below, finding the agreement to be fair, just and reasonable, prompted by the necessities of the situation and advantages to the public at the time it was entered into, entered judgment for the appellee. This appeal followed.</p>

L. 458, as amended, 53 PS §341 et seq. Its primary purpose is to promote the public safety, convenience and welfare by providing off-street parking facilities so as to alleviate parking and traffic problems. The Authority has five members appointed by the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia to serve without compensation for staggered five year terms so that the term of one member will expire each year. Under its enabling legislation, Act of June 5, 1947, supra, the Authority is granted “all powers necessary or convenient for the carrying out of the aforesaid purposes” including the power “. . .

His employment commenced sometime in 1950 at a starting salary of $300 a month. As of September, 1953, however, appellee was under written contract with the Authority, dated April 23, 1952, providing for a three year term of employment as managing director at a salary of $10,000 a year. On September 23, 1953, having determined that the $10,000 annual salary was not commensurate with the responsibility the appellee had been obliged to assume, the then members of the Authority unanimously resolved to offer appellee a new contract of employment for a term of three years at an annual salary of $15,000, to be effective September 1, 1953.</p>

Nevertheless, payments at the rate of $15,000 a year were made to appellee until January 27, 1954, after which date the new members of the Authority, questioning the validity of the agreement in issue, reduced the appellee to the basis of Ms $10,-000 salary without prejudice to Ms claim to be paid at the rate of $15,000. Appellee remained as managing director until November 30, 1956, at which time he was discharged. He then instituted suit, claiming damages for some $13,125 which represents, with ap<a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>propriate adjustments, the difference between the two salaries. The Authority’s counterclaim was based on the asserted overpayments between September 1, 1953 and January 27, 1954 (i.e., payments at the $15,000 instead of the $10,000 annual rate).</p>

The executive director had served in that capacity with the Housing Authority on a month-to-month basis for 15 years. Several days after the election of a new governor, the members of the Authority, anticipating their dismissal, entered into a written contract with the executive director engaging him in that capacity for a term of five years at an annual salary of f10,000.

This may be good politics, but it certainly makes for less efficient government and it certainly is not in the public interest! After the majority’s decision and philosophy become known, why would any man of ability and experience accept, or leave a good job to accept an important job or enter into a contract with a State or municipal or other governmental Authority in Pennsylvania (or similar body of which there are hundreds) for a fixed term of two or three or more years when the agreement is meaningless, and in spite of its clear covenants he can be dismissed at will? Isn’t it clear that the decision mid the philosophy expressed in the majority opinion will preclude this and hundreds of similar public bodies from obtaining highly qualified personnel for important positions, and, by eliminating job security and even short term contracts, will not only stultify the purposes and objectives of these public; bodies, but will grievously prejudice their successful operation as well as a sale of their bonds!</p>
