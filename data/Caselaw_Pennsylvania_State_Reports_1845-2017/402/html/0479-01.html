    <p id="b500-6" data-blocks='[["BL_500.8",500,[224,886,1151,324]]]'>This is the case of one of eleven defendants who have been separately tried for the beating to death of a Korean student named In-Ho-Oh in Philadelphia on April 25, 1958. He pleaded not guilty but was convicted of murder in the first degree by a jury, which set the penalty at imprisonment for life.</p>
    <p id="b500-7" data-blocks='[["BL_500.9",500,[223,1220,1152,649]]]'>As we must remand the record for a new trial, we will not narrate the evidence. It should suffice to say that while the defendant on trial did not strike the deceased he was seen going through his pockets and that the wallet of deceased was found in the home of one of the other defendants. The defendant’s several and conflicting statements were offered to the jury to pass upon. The question of whether there was a conspiracy and a robbery and whether defendant had a part in it seems amply suggested by the evidence and hence to warrant submitting the issue of his guilt or innocence to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b500-8" data-blocks='[["BL_500.10",500,[220,1881,1152,485]],["BL_501.1",501,[114,355,1147,540]]]'>Error is alleged in allowing the Commonwealth to use gruesome colored slides of the bruised deceased. Pictures may not be excluded merely because they are horrid, but they should not be overused and they should have a purpose, such as to show the severity of the attack, as in <em>Commonwealth v. Buzard, </em><a href="/pa/365/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="365 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="1225538" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0511-01">365 Pa. 511</a> (1950), <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20394" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="76 A.2d 394">76 A. 2d 394</a>, or the kind of crime it was, as in <em>Commonwealth v.

Here they could have shown bruises that <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>pointed to a forcible robbery and hence a felony murder. Since the case váll be remanded, we are constrained to suggest that the pictures should not, if used, be put before the jury for so long a time. Out of four and a half days of trial, they were on exhibit for half a day, enlarged on a screen. Although they were being subjected to medical explanation, we regard the duration of their view as excessive. Such pictures may be used as a fine point of demonstration but not as a bludgeon for winning the case.</p>

    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[113,1074,1147,1095]]]'>The case was tried before the Act of December 1, 1959, P. L. 1621, 18 PS §4701, and hence the errant evidence was presented to the jury as part of the Commonwealth’s case in general. The juvenile court record was inadmissible under <em>Holmes’ Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/379/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="379 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1253624" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0599-01">379 Pa. 599</a> (1954), <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.2d%20523" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="109 A.2d 523">109 A. 2d 523</a>, where we pointed out that the Juvenile Court is not a criminal court; under <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

L. 1433, §19,11 PS §261. The Act reads: “No order made by any Juvenile Court shall operate to impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by the criminal laws of the Commonwealth, nor shall any child be deemed to be a criminal by reason of any such order or be deemed to have been convicted of crime. The disposition of a child or any evidence given in a Juvenile Court shall not be admissible as evidence against the child in any case or proceeding in any other Court.”</p>

Juvenile Court proceedings are normally informal, and many of the important constitutional and statutory guarantees afforded a defendant in a criminal trial do not apply to a juvenile in a hearing before a Juvenile Court: Holmes’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/379/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="379 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1253624" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0599-01">379 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.2d%20523" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="109 A.2d 523">109 A. 2d 523</a>. For these reasons, it would be unjust and illegal to allow the introduction of juvenile records or evidence given in juvenile cases to be later introduced as competent evidence in criminal cases or proceedings in any other court, in the same manner as criminal convictions or evidence taken in criminal proceedings may in certain instances be competent evidence in other criminal proceedings.”</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[240,1079,1151,648]]]'>As for the psychiatric report, represented by the testimony of Dr. Torney, it was obviously inadmissible.

Those cases involved the assessment of penalty by a three-judge court on a plea of guilty, not by a jury, as here, on an adversary trial. And <em>Commonwealth v.
