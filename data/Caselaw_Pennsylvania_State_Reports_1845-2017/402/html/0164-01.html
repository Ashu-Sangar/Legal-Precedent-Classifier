One was by indictment at the suit of the King, and this became in England and the United States what we <em>recognize </em>as public prosecution. The second was by an appeal of death, which was a private and vindictive process by an interested party and which grew out of the old Germanic custom of “weregild”, or compensation for the death. The third was by inquisition against deodands, which is of no present interest because it involved the forfeiture of personal chattels that had caused death.</p>

Article I, section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall not be deprived of his life, liberty or property “unless by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.” The law of the land, as written, recognized, interpreted and practiced at the time Boy Ladd was charged with injuring Dorothy Pierce, excluded indictment for murder for a death occurring more than a year and a day after the injury allegedly causing her death. To now charge him with murder for a death which occurred beyond the period of limitation which is part of the law of the land is to prosecute him on an ex post facto basis.

May the Commonwealth indict a man for murder when the death occurs ten years after the bloiv has fallen? Twenty years? Thirty years? One may search the Majority Opinion through every paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase and comma, and find no answer to this very serious question. The Majority is content to open a Pandora’s box of interrogation and.let it remain unclosed, to the torment and possible persecution of every person who may have at one time or another injured another.
