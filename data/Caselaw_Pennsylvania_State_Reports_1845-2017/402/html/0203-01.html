    <p id="b224-10" data-blocks='[["BL_224.14",224,[278,1240,1152,543]]]'>This is an action for damages for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff from a fall while in the act of alighting at a regular stop from a bus of the defendant company upon which she had been a passenger. The judge of the court below, to whom the case was tried without a jury, gave a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $13,000. The exceptions filed by the defendant to the verdict were duly dismissed by the court en banc and judgment entered on the verdict, from which the defendant has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b224-11" data-blocks='[["BL_224.15",224,[278,1796,1151,154]]]'>The defendant did not seriously contend below, nor does it do so here, that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding that it was guilty of negligence.</p>

    <p id="b225-4" data-blocks='[["BL_225.4",225,[137,574,1144,153]]]'>The opinion for the court en banc cogently and adequately disposes of both of these <em>contentions; </em>nor does reversible error appear anywhere.</p>
