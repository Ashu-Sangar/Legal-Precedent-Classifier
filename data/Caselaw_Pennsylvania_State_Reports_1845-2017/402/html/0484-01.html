Joinder in this very situation was allowed by the United States Supreme Court in the litigation that firmly established the shipowners’ right to indemnification from the stevedore. <em>Ryan Stevedoring Company v.

We can assume that if joinder were at issue the Supreme Court would have treated the problem as a matter within the discretion of the trial judge. See Rule 20(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
    <p id="b508-4" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[249,757,1150,541]]]'>In view of the fact that the right of indemnification was finally settled only four years ago, that joinder in both diversity and admiralty cases in the federal courts is a discretionary matter, and that the substantive rights of the parties to bring an independent action remain unchanged, it is apparent that the right to implead the stevedore is not, by any means, “deeply rooted in admiralty.” Therefore, we believe that federal law would regard joinder as a matter of procedure to be governed by state rules.</p>
    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[245,1307,1151,487]]]'>The question then becomes whether joinder should be allowed under Rule 2252 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure: “(a) In any action the defendant or any additional defendant may file as of course a praecipe for a writ, or a complaint, to join as an additional defendant any person not a party to the action who may be alone liable or liable over to him on the cause of action declared upon or jointly or severally liable thereon with him.”</p>

The stevedore clearly is not subject to joinder on the basis of sole liability since, as the employer, it is covered under the provisions of Section 5 of the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. 905 (1952), which relates to exclusive remedy under that Act. Section 5 provides as follows : “The <em>liability </em>of an employer prescribed in section 4 shall be exclusive and in place of all other <em>liability </em>of such employer to employee. . . .” (Emphasis <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>supplied). The Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. 901, is identical to the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, Article III, Section 301a, as amended, 77 PS §431, as far as the result on this issue is concerned although its terminology is much stricter than the Pennsylvania Act. It is clear that where either of the Acts is applicable, the employer may not be joined as solely liable since plaintiff has no common law cause of action against his employer. See <em>Swanson v. Marra Brothers, Inc., </em><a href="/us/328/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="328 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="377243" data-case-paths="/us/328/0001-01">328 U. S. 1</a> (1946). The defendant does not dispute this conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b509-3" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[123,1026,1146,700]]]'>The same provision of the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, supra, which forbids the joinder of an employer as an additional defendant on the theory of sole liability has been interpreted by the federal courts as prohibiting any rights by a third party tortfeasor to contribution from a plaintiff’s employer. See <em>Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship C. &amp; R. Corp., </em><a href="/us/342/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="342 U.S. 282" data-case-ids="640953" data-case-paths="/us/342/0282-01">342 U. S. 282</a> (1952).

For a number of years, federal courts wrestled with the problem of the rights of a shipowner against the stevedore in those instances where it appeared that the injuries were in fact the result of a wrongdoing by the stevedore itself. A resolution of the problem was finally made by the Supreme Court of the United States <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>when it firmly established the right of the shipowner to obtain indemnification from the stevedore. <em>Ryan Stevedoring Company v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., </em>supra. Here, the plaintiff was injured because of improper storage by his employer; and the Supreme Court ruled that the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, supra, does not preclude enforcement by the shipowner of the <em>contractual </em>obligation owed to it by the stevedore, to wit: “The shipowner’s action here is not founded upon a tort or upon any duty which the stevedoring contractor owes to its employee. The third-party complaint is grounded upon the contractor’s breach of its purely consensual obligation <em>owing to the shipowner </em>to stow the cargo in a reasonably safe manner. Accordingly, the shipowner’s action for indemnity on that basis is not barred by the Compensation Act.” <a href="/us/350/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="350 U.S. 124" data-case-ids="12031726" data-case-paths="/us/350/0124-01">350 U.

And the contractual nature of the obligation is equally clear even where there is no express promise of indemnification in the stevedore contract since, in the words of the Court: “The shipowner . . . holds petitioner’s uncontroverted agreement to perform all of the shipowner’s stevedoring operations at the time and place where the cargo in question was loaded. That agreement necessarily includes petitioner’s obligation not only to stow . . . but to stow . . . properly and safely. Competency and safety of stowage are inescapable elements of the service undertaken. This obligation is not a quasi-contractual obligation implied in law or arising out of a noncontractual relationship. It is of the essence of petitioner’s stevedoring contract.” <a href="/us/350/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="350 U.S. 124" data-case-ids="12031726" data-case-paths="/us/350/0124-01">350 U.
