See, also, Section 4 of the Act of March 31, 1937, P.

None the less, the appellants argue, in effect, that Bowers’ fixed term of office which, according to the express stipulation of the gubernatorial commission evidencing his appointment, was to expire June 2, 1959, was a mere fiction; that, in reality, what Bowers was appointed to, despite his commission’s specification, was merely an indefinite term which would last no longer than it pleased the Governor that the appointee should continue in office. In short, the appellants interpret the statutory provision that members of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board shall be appointed for fixed terms to mean that such members shall be appointed for only so long, not exceeding six years, as shall please the Governor, and they construe the provision for staggered expiration dates for the terms of the members of the Board as being of no effect whatsoever and, consequently, meaningless.</p>

      <em>Watson v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, </em>supra, was concerned with the attempted removal by the Governor, <em>without cause, </em>of a member of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. We there had occasion to interpret the statutory provision contained in Section 4 of the Act of May 21, 1937, P. L. 774, No. 211, 36 PS §652d, which provided that members of the Turnpike Commission should be appointed to ten-year terms, the expiration dates of which were fixed at staggered intervals. We interpreted the legislative intent evidenced by this arrangement as follows: “The purpose of the foregoing provision as to the terms of office of the Commissioners (i.e., those first to be appointed and <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>thereafter their successors) is patent. It was designed so that, by the prescribed rotation, the terms of three of the four appointed members of the Commission would always be current. The Act expressly provides that three members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum who, for all purposes, shall act unanimously. Were the Commissioners to be held removable at the pleasure of the Governor, the carefully expressed scheme of term rotation would be effectually nullified. If it be countered that the Governor, in appointing to a vacancy created by his dismissal of a Commissioner, would respect the spirit of the Act and appoint a successor for the balance of the unexpired term of the dismissed Commissioner, the answer is that the power so attributed to the Governor would still violate the plain intendment of the Act. He could render all of the offices vacant at one time which, obviously, the Act was specifically designed to make impossible. To urge that such a situation would never be provoked is irrelevant to the question of the power of the Governor in the premises as affected by the Act creating the office and prescribing the tenure therefor. It follows that the attempted removal of the plaintiff from his office was without warrant of law and that he must, therefore, be restored to the position.”</p>

This is especially time with respect to the administration of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act, involving, as it does, technical and delicate questions of labor-management relations. It is plain enough that, in the public interest, such Board members were not to be made amenable to political influence or discipline in the discharge of their official duties. Since we may not properly assume that the legislature intended to enact a meaningless and ineffectual (although carefully worded and clearly expressed) statutory provision, §4(a) of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act must rightly be held to intend that duly confirmed members of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board possess tenure for the fixed terms for which they are appointed and may not be removed by the Governor except <em>for cause.</em>

Thus it is that, when Section 8(a) of the Parking Authority Law <em>pi </em>June 5, 1947, P. L. 458, as amended, 53 PS §348(a), was enacted providing that the powers of a municipal parking authority shall be exercised by a Board composed of five members, that each of such members shall be appointed for a term of five years, and that such terms shall expire at staggered intervals, the legislature expressly included a provision that “Members of the board may be removed at the will of the appointing power.” If the fixed five year terms with staggered expiration dates, provided by the Parking Authority Law, did not imply, as a matter of statutory construe<a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>

President Roosevelt removed Humphrey from the Commission on the ground that “the aims and purposes of the administration with respect to the work of the Commission can be carried out most effectively with personnel of my own selection.” The Supreme Court was unmoved by the argument that a power vested in the President to remove an appointee at his pleasure would be conducive to more responsible and more efficient government. On the contrary, the court found merit in the opposite view. After noting that the Federal Trade Commission is, in part, a quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial body, the Supreme Court declared (pp. 629-630) that “The authority of Congress, in creating quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial agencies, to require <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>them to act in discharge of their duties independently of executive control cannot well be doubted; and that authority includes, as an appropriate incident, power to fix the period during which they shall continue in office, and to forbid their removal except for cause in the meantime. For it is quite evident that one who holds his office only during the pleasure of another, cannot be depended upon to maintain an attitude of independence against the latter’s will.</p>

So much is implied in the very fact of the separation of the powers of these departments by the Constitution; and in the rule which recognizes their essential co-equality. The sound application of a principle that makes one master in his own house precludes him from imposing his control in the house of another who is master there. James Wilson, one of the framers of the Constitution and a former justice of this court, said that the independence of each department required that its proceedings ‘should be free from the remotest influence, direct or indirect, of either of the other two powers.’ Andrews, The Works of James Wilson (1896), vol. 1, p. 367. And Mr. Justice Story in the first volume of his work on the Constitution, 4th ed., §530, citing No. 48 of the Federalist, said that neither of the departments in reference to each other ‘ought to possess, directly or indirectly, an overruling influence in the administration of their respective powers.’ And see O’Donoghue v.

The sole issue was the constitutionality of the statute under which these proceedings were instituted. The school directors argued that they were subject to removal only if convicted of some misbehavior or crime and in the manner prescribed by Article VI, §4, and that the statutory provision providing another method of removal was invalid. The actual ruling in <em>Georges </em>was that the statutory provision in the School Code of 1911 was simply an amendment of a statute which antedated the Constitution of 1874 and was not in conflict therewith. The Court stated: “The constitutional method of removal must be resorted to, where applicable, for it is ‘exclusive and prohibitory of any other mode which the Legislature may deem better or more convenient’: Com. v.

(p. 133), and, referring to appointive officers, the Court recognized that the appointing power had the right to remove at its pleasure those officers — state, county and municipal — which it had appointed. After distinguishing between constitutional officers (those which the Constitution expressly provides shall be chosen) and legislative or non-constitutional officers (those provided by acts of assembly, passed either before or after the Constitution), the Court then indicated there was a difference between such officers in the following respect: “But where no provision has been made by the legislature for the manner of removal of such an officer [that is, a non-constitutional officer] . . . then he must be deposed, if at all, in the way provided by the fundamental law.

Under a statute applicable to Philadelphia, the bureau chief was within its provisions that no classified service officer “shall be removed, discharged or reduced in pay or position except for just cause which shall not be religious or political”.

Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, </em><a href="/pa/386/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="386 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1268292" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0117-01">386 Pa. 117</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=125%20A.2d%20354" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="125 A.2d 354">125 A. 2d 354</a>, was decided by this Court. On May 4, 1952 Watson was appointed by the then Governor, John S. Fine, as a member of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission for a term expiring June 4,1961 and this appointment was duly confirmed by the Senate. On December 6, 1955 Governor Leader, acting in reliance upon the authority he believed vested in him as the appointing power under Article YI, §4, removed Watson from office. Watson then instituted an action of mandamus against the Commission. The Court stated: “The sole question involved is whether the Governor had the power under the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth to remove from office, at his pleasure, a member of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission during the fixed term of office for which he was appointed and confirmed” (p. 120). We held that the Governor did not have the power, at pleasure, to remove Watson as a member of the Turnpike Commission. Relying on <em>Boioman, Milford, Weiss </em>and <em>Marshall, </em>the Court said (p. 123) : “It is therefore established in this State beyond respectable controversy that, where the legislature creates a public office, it <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>may impose such terms and limitations with reference to the tenure or removal of an incumbent as it sees fit. There is nothing in the Constitution prohibiting such action while, on the other hand, Article XII, Section 1, expressly admits of it. Of course, where the legislature^ in creating a public office, imposes no terms or limitations on the duration of an incumbent’s tenure or the mode of his removal, the method of removal prescribed by Article VI, Section 4, of the Constitution applies: [citing Marshall and Beattie].” Further, “The question, then, as to whether the tenure or removal of an appointee of a legislatively created office has been so conditioned by the legislature as to exempt the incumbent from removal by the Governor, at his pleasure, under his constitutional power, is one of intent to be gleaned from the statute creating or regulating the office” (pp.'123, 124). The Court found in the statute creating the Turnpike Commission a legislative intent to condition the tenure of a member of the Commission in the statutory provision that the terms of such a member be rotated or staggered.</p>

However, our prior case law had rejected the implication of any such legislative purpose in both instances: <em>Houseman, </em>supra, <em>Lane, </em><a href="/pa/103/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="103 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="449137" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0481-01">supra,</a> <em>Likeley, </em>supra, <em>Madden, </em>supra, <em>Hiltner, </em>supra, <em>Clark, </em>supra, <em>Lindsay, </em>supra, <em>Kraus, </em>supra, <em>Houlahen, </em>supra, and <em>Randall, </em>supra, permitted the removal of nonconstitutional officers whose terms of office were definitely fixed by legislative enactment; <em>Hoyt, </em>supra, <em>Arthur, </em><a href="/pa/273/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="273 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1070759" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0419-01">supra,</a> <em>Hiltner, </em>supra, <em>Lindsay, </em>supra, <em>Kraus, </em>supra, and <em>Beattie, </em>supra, permitted the summary removal of legislative officers even though the statutes creating such offices provided for removal for cause.</p>

Responsibility for the actions or omissions to act on the part of subordinate government officials in this manner can be more readily fixed on the appointing power. In this connection, the language of our Court in <em>Lindsay, </em>supra, is appropriate (p. 123) : “Article VI, section 4 of the Constitution is an expression of a governmental principle which is supported both by reason and authority. It is a tenet of good government that except in those cases where the public welfare requires that an official charged with important governmental functions should be protected against interference on the part of the executive and in those cases where special classes of public servants, such as policemen and firemen, are placed under civil service protection, the power of removal is correlative with the power of appointment. The liability to summary removal attaches with manifest appropriateness to those subordinates who occupy close confidential relations with their superiors in the public service”.</p>

      <em>Watson, </em>supra, expressed the apprehension that, if the right of the Governor to summarily remove a Turnpike Commissioner were recognized, he might remove all the Commissioners at one time and thus hamper the work of this important governmental body.

The legislature could have provided a method of removal if it intended to thwart any such occurrence as apprehended in <em>Watson. </em>The failure of the legislature to provide for any different method of removal of the Commissioners is eloquently indicative of the legislative purpose that such removal could be <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>accomplished within the aegis of Article VI, §4, particularly in view of the presumption that the legislature acted with knowledge of the law on the subject at the time the statute was passed.</p>

The legislature did not stipulate that a special procedure of removal from office was to be followed. We are therefore unable to hold that [Houlahen] is an exception to the operation of the general rule enunciated in Article VI.

Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, </em><a href="/pa/386/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="386 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1268292" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0117-01">386 Pa. 117</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=125%20A.2d%20354" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="125 A.2d 354">125 A. 2d 354</a> (1956), (also written by Chief Justice Charles Alvin Jones) that this Court held improper an attempted removal of an appointed public officer. This was so throughout the many cases — as summarized in the present dissenting opinion of Justice Benjamin E. Jones — that came before our Court on this subject. <em>Second, </em>the Constitutional Debates are perfectly clear that no restriction on the pleasure of the appointing power to remove was intended. <em>Third, </em>the doctrine that the legislature might restrict the pleasure of the appointing power to remove first arose as <em>dicta </em>and was repeated only in very limited terms in cases dealing solely with <em>elected </em>officers. These cases are discussed below. <em>Fourth, </em>we have many times approved removal of public officers appointed to statutorily-created of<a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>fices under provisions permitting removal only for cause (a much more compelling situation for finding a legislative intent to limit the removal power than a case, as here, presenting nothing but a provision for staggered terms). <em>Fifth, </em>we have previously held in two cases that removals were proper even though the incumbents filled legislatively-created offices on a staggered term basis. <em>Sixth, </em>we have never before applied the federal precedents concerning removal to a ease before us even though several of our cases in which dismissal was upheld deal with agencies exercising some quasi-judicial functions. The length to which the majority opinion goes has contradicted so much history, case law and the needs of responsible public service •that I can only express my complete disagreement with a feeling of hopeless resignation before the magnitude of its error.</p>

And so, I assume that the provisions of Article VI, §4, of our present state Constitution, including the provision for removal of appointed public officers, are as applicable today as they were in 1874. I find nothing in the second sentence of that section limiting its applicability to constitutional officers only, and the debates at the Constitutional Convention of 1873 are absolutely clear that no such limitation was intended. The opinion of the majority ignores these debates, recognizing their lack of support for its position, in appalling fashion. We deal here not with the interpretation of ambiguous statutory language, where we find little help in the Legislative Journal and where, in fact, by our past decisions we are prohibited from referring to the Journal, but with an extensive, full-scale discussion of constitutional language heatedly debated at Constitutional Convention and unambiguously set forth in explicit language — an authority long recog<a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>nized as a proper source of constitutional interpretation.

In my opinion we have done so through a series of judicial glosses, usually irrelevant to the case at hand and never examined with care. The doctrine was first expressed in <em>Bowman’s Case, </em><a href="/citations/?q=225%20Pa.%20384" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="225 Pa. 384">225 Pa. 384</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=74%20A.%20203" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="74 A. 203">74 Atl. 203</a> (1909), where the validity of the removal under a statute of an <em>elected </em>justice of the peace (a constitutional officer) was questioned, the statutory removal method being different and easier than the method provided for <em>elected </em>officers in the third sentence of Article VI, §4. The <em>Bowman </em>Court held the statutory method invalid and, in bad <em>dictum, </em>ventured beyond that precise issue to say that nonconstitutional officers may not be within the constitutional provisions for removal. This <em>dictum, </em>needless to say, is the heart of the present problem; and we might question why <em>Bowman’s </em>Court would even bother to make such a statement under the circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[101,1893,1147,208]],["BL_602.1",602,[263,358,1155,538]]]'>To my mind, it was exactly “the circumstances” of <em>Bowman’s Gase </em>which influenced the Court to say what it did.

I can recall no instance of a removal under this provision; but even if my recollection ■be faulty, it takes little thought to realize that removal under it is a most difficult process. If it were the sole method of removal for nonconstitutional officers, as <em>Bowman’s Case </em>said it is for constitutional ones, hundreds of elected public officers would hold office in •a way hardly consonant with the needs of a democratic society.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a>

Unlike the conflict between a cumbersome constitutional method of removal and statutory attempts to ease the burden where an elected officer is involved, the simple constitutional method for removal of <em>appointed </em>officers is always posed against legislative attempts to make the removal more difficult or impossible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_4" id="ref_footnote_4_4">4</a> Thus, the problem has always been presented in diametrically opposed situations — in the one case, whether the legislature may facilitate an otherwise difficult removal; in the other case, whether it may impede or prevent an <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>otherwise easy removal. Accordingly, whatever illogie may be present in limiting the third sentence to constitutional officers only, while applying the second sentence to all officers — constitutional and statutory alike —it is a highly rational illogie. The needs of republican government are certainly best served when its appointed officials are immediately responsible and responsive to their superiors and not immunized from removal by the latter. Usually, the appointing power is itself lodged in an elected officer, and his mandate to effect policies advocated by him should not be thwarted by subordinates. Elected officers, on the other hand, deserve somewhat greater protections; and both the Constitution and the relevant statutes recognize this. Therefore, while I admit to a superficially inconsistent approach in our judicial analysis of these matters, it is an approach keyed to the best tradition and duty of the judiciary in the field of public law— that of applying our basic document of government in the light of that philosophy of government which gave it birth, wMch sustained it through the years and which has contributed to making our governmental institutions bulwarks of a free democratic society in 1960 as well as in 1874.</p>

However, one case is so important that it must be examined. <em>Milford Township Supervisors’ Removal Case, </em><a href="/pa/291/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="291 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="1107315" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0046-01">291 Pa. 46</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20623" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="139 A. 623">139 Atl. 623</a> (1927), again involved an attempt to remove <em>elected </em>officials, this time nonconstitutional ones. Under the applicable 1917 statute a petition was brought in the local court of quarter sessions to remove township supervisors allegedly guilty of derelictions of duty. The <em>Milford </em>Court upheld this resort to the statutory proceedings; <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>but instead of relying on the necessities of such a holding, as discussed above, it decided that Article XII, §1, of the Constitution impliedly extended a right to the legislature to limit application of Article YI, §4, where a nonconstitutional officer was involved.</p>
    <p id="b604-4" data-blocks='[["BL_604.4",604,[248,638,1154,538]]]'>Now, Article XII, §1, is a perfectly innocuous and reasonable provision.

In fact, the <em>Arthur </em>case can be cited for only two principles, both of which lead to a conclusion completely contrary to its use in <em>the-Milford </em>opinion. First, <em>Arthur </em>recognized the power of the legislature to regulate dismissals of “employees” who properly qualified under statutory civil service provisions. Second, <em>Arthur </em>held that the legislature could <em>not </em>limit the appointor’s power to remove persons appointed by him who qualified as “officers” under the Constitution by including those persons in the civil services. The actual result in the <em>Arthur </em>case was a holding that a bureau chief, an “officer,” could be dismissed at the pleasure of the appointing power notwithstanding the statute in question and that insofar as the statute attempted to restrict his removal, it was unconstitutional. These conclusions, clearly, are exactly the opposite of the expression appearing in <em>Milford.</em>

No obvious answer is discernible although the Court does evince concern over the possibility that thousands of local election officials would be virtually irremovable if the third sentence of Article VI, §4, were held to be the exclusive method of removing elected officers. This conjectured concern has no relevance to the problem of removing <em>appointed </em>officers, and it remains a mystery why the latter was so mistreated.
