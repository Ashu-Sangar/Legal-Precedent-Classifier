    <p id="b661-8" data-blocks='[["BL_661.10",661,[143,954,1145,753]]]'>Two men, McLaughlin and Bissell, were the original owners and developers of 3000 acres of land surrounding two small lakes in Jefferson Township. These men created The Moosic Lakes Club, a corporation of the first class, in 1941 for the purpose of promoting the development of the property, and gave to it as a gift two lakes, a strip of land around them, a commons, and a baseball field. A corporation of the second class, known as Moosic Lakes, Inc. was incorporated in 1947. Hereafter we will refer to them as the Club and the company. By 1958 the company had on its maps 351 unsold lots, and anyone buying land would have to join the Club in order to enjoy the facilities of the lakes.</p>
    <p id="b661-9" data-blocks='[["BL_661.11",661,[143,1727,1146,651]],["BL_662.1",662,[253,359,1150,152]]]'>The Club’s bylaws, passed in 1941, provide voting power as follows: “The voting power in The Moosic Lakes Club shall be determined by the ownership of lots as laid out on the maps of Moosic Lakes and shall be divided between the purchaser members in good standing and the members known as the developers or owners of the unsold land, in the following manner: Each purchaser member in good standing shall be entitled to one vote and the members known as the developers or owners shall be entitled to one vote for each lot owned and unsold as time to time laid out on the maps of Moosic Lakes, and which may also be <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>laid out on the maps of any after acquired land, which maps shall be filed in the office of the said members known as the developers and owners.”</p>
    <p id="b662-4" data-blocks='[["BL_662.4",662,[251,523,1150,256]]]'>“Purchaser members” refers to Club members. “Developers or owners” refers to owners of unsold lots in the development, who were not required to be members of the Club; generally these were company members.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[245,800,1154,592]]]'>Since at the time of hearing in 1959 there were 115 members of the Club and 351 unsold lots, each with a vote, it is plain that the company owners of the lots dominated the enterprise. Since it had been their property in the first place and the Club a promotion device, there was nothing sinister in such domination. Had the sale of lots been brisk, the company’s influence in the development would have decreased with time, and the Club’s increased until the company’s interest vanished, and doubtless this was the original plan.</p>
    <p id="b662-6" data-blocks='[["BL_662.6",662,[241,1405,1153,593]]]'>Article Nine of the bylaws set up the Board of Directors in the following fashion: “The Board of Directors of The Moosic Lakes Club shall consist of three (3) persons one of whom shall be elected by the purchaser members of The Moosic Lakes Club and two of whom shall be appointed by the members known as the owners or developers so long as any lot or lots remain unsold as set forth in Article Eight Section 1 of these By-Laws, and who shall hold office for one year or until their successors are elected and appointed.”</p>
    <p id="b662-7" data-blocks='[["BL_662.7",662,[237,2010,1152,145]]]'>Under this provision it became the practice that the single Board member elected by the purchaser members chose the Club officers.</p>

Since the bylaws provide, contra the practice of naming officers above referred to, that immediately after the annual meeting the Board of Directors shall elect officers from among its members, a meeting held on May 1, 1958, elected three McLaughlins to the posts of President, Vice-President, and Secretary &amp; Treasurer.</p>
    <p id="b663-4" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[125,740,1148,869]]]'>On the same day defendants, members of the Club, sent out notices to the Club membership calling for a meeting on June 1st to change the bylaws by revoking the existing ones and adopting a new set. On this point the bylaws in Article XIX, provide: “Amendments to these By-Laws may be made at the annual meeting or at any meeting called for that purpose, by a majority vote, provided first, that written notice of the proposed amendments shall be submitted to the Board of Directors at a regular or special meeting and the proposed amendments are approved by a majority vote of Board of Directors and provided second, that notice of the proposed amendments, after approval be posted in a conspicuous place in the office at the Club at least ten (10) days before the date of the meeting at which the same is to be submitted.”</p>

The meeting then altered the bylaws by removing the exemption of the company members from the requirement of Club membership, limiting voting rights to Club members, requiring directors to be Club members, and increasing the number ox Club members on the Board of Directors from one out of three to two out of three. The meeting then elected new officers from among the defendants.</p>

L. 289, Art. IY, §401, as amended, 15 PS §2851-401. This Section reads as follows: “The members of a nonprofit corporation shall have the power to make, alter, amend and repeal the by-laws of a nonprofit corporation, but the authority to make, alter, amend and repeal such by-laws may be expressly vested by the articles or by-laws in the board of directors, subject always to the power of the members to change such action. <em>Unless the articles or bylaws othe'i-wise provide, </em>the powers hereby conferred shall be exercised by a majority vote of the members of the board of directors or of the members of the corporation who are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, as the case may be, at any regular - or special meeting duly convened after notice to the members or directors for that purpose.” (Our emphasis)</p>

If such changes are made with the approval of a majority of the stockholders upon notice to all, they affect and bind all; but they <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>should not be made until all have had an opportunity to be heard by receiving notice of what changes will be attempted, unless provision be made for them in the by-laws: Cook on Stock and Stockholders and Corporation Law (2d ed.), sec. 595. No more radical change can be made in the management of the affairs of a corporation than an increase in the number of its directors as fixed by its by-laws. Such increase may result in taking the control of a prosperous business from the hands of those who have successfully conducted it, and committing it to those who, with different notions, may lead it into ruin and disaster; honest management may be followed by a dishonest one; prodigality may take the place of frugality; a sense of security may be succeeded by unrest; and where all was right, everything may be wrong. Such changes, with such possible results to stockholders, ought not to take place before notice given of what the majority may do, and to which the minority must bow, if unable to avert the changes, after having had an opportunity to be heard and to act.”</p>
