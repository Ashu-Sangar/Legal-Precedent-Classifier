In <em>Ryan, </em>the decedent, owner of a restaurant liquor license, died intestate; upon his death, on application of his widow, as administratrix, the license was transferred by the Board to the widow as the surviving spouse under the provisions of the then applicable §408(c) of the Liquor Control Act of 1937, P. L. 1762,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> as amended, which provided, inter alia: “. . .

The Commonwealth contends that <em>Ryan </em>must be restricted to its specific factual situation and is not actually authority for the proposition that neither a liquor license <em>per se </em>nor the right to apply for its transfer is not taxable for inheritance tax purposes.</p>

Carey, </em><a href="/pa/224/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="224 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="963162" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0303-01">224 Pa. 303</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20A.%20435" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="73 A. 435">73 A. 435</a>. In <em>Aschenbach, </em>the decedent’s liquor license was transferred on application of his brother-administrator to himself as an individual. As administrator, the brother charged himself with the license and paid for the transfer and reissuances of the license from estate funds; all moneys received from operation of the business conducted under the license were deposited in the administrator’s account and the eventual sale of the transferred license was under direction of the Orphans’ Court. In <em>Ryan, </em>distinguishing <em>Aschenbach, </em>it was said (p. 46) : “In other words, the administrator in the Aschenbach case purposely treated the license as an asset of the estate and enhanced the value of the estate by the transfer to the purchaser. He never claimed the license to be his own, although it was issued to him. In the case at bar [Ryan] the license was issued to the surviving spouse, who always held it as hers and never accounted for it as an asset of the estate. She sold her license so that it was transferred from place to place, thus not enhancing the value of the estate as in the Aschenbach case. The principal difference between the Aschenbach <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>case and the instant matter is that in the Aschenbach case the individual who held the license used it for the benefit of the estate.

However, the Court went further and stated (p. 46) : “The claim for inheritance tax was allowed by the court below. For the reasons heretofore stated, said license so issued ... to the surviving spouse was her individual property. In addition, it was not ‘property of which the decedent was seized or possessed at the time of his death’ (under the Act of 191.9, 72 PS §2301, as amended) : McCandless Estate, <a href="/pa/374/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="374 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1241434" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0551-01">374 Pa. 551</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.2d%20807" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="97 A.2d 807">97 A. 2d 807</a>. Since the decedent’s license terminated at his death, and was not property of which he was seized or possessed at the time of his death, it is somewhat difficult to understand at what point of time it could have become an asset of his estate.” At least by implication, <em>Ryan </em>thus indicated that a liquor license, terminable upon the holder’s death, is not an asset of a decedent’s estate taxable for inheritance tax <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>purposes and that the value of tbe statutory right to apply for a transfer of tbe license to decedent’s surviving spouse or personal representative or to a decedent-designated person likewise is not taxable.</p>

On tbe other band, if <em>Ryan </em>be construed as bolding that tbe value of a decedent’s liquor license or the value of tbe right to apply for a transfer of tbe license is <em>never </em>subject to taxation for inheritance tax purposes, then the Commonwealth would be precluded from evaluating and taxing the transfer of a right which both common sense and realistic thinking recognize as possessive of a real and tangible value to tbe estate of a decedent.</p>

On the other hand, as Mr. Justice Cbxdset, speaking for the <em>dissenting </em>three justices in <em>Ryan </em>and after an examination of the authorities upon which <em>Pichler </em>was predicated, noted (p. 55) : “. . . all of the above cases<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

However, the valuable incident of the right to apply for a new license which the Board is authorized to grant does pass under the Liquor Control Act ... to the surviving spouse or the personal representative [or to a person designated by him]. Therefore, to the extent of the value of the right to apply for a new license in the name of the surviving spouse or the personal representative [or in the name of the person designated in the will] and the consequent right of sale and transfer, the estate is enhanced.” In <em>Jaffe v. Pacific Brewing &amp; Malting Co. et al., </em>124 p. 1122, 1123 (Wash.) it was said: “The right to conduct the business is personal to the licensee, and does not pass upon his death to his administrators or assigns. But this is true only as between the state or the licensor and the licensee, and as to third persons when the statutes do not permit transfers from one person to another. ‘But where the statute recognizes the right of transfer from one to another, and where the right is a valuable right, capable of being surrendered and reduced to money, a different rule prevails. In such cases the license or right to do business becomes a valuable property right, subject to barter and sale. It is property with value and quality/</p>

However, since, by legislative fiat, upon the death of the licensee, <em>the </em>board is invested with the authority to transfer the license to the licensee’s surviving spouse or personal representative or to a person designated by the licensee, the right to apply for such transfer is a right which possesses value. The legislative intent is evident; the holder of a restaurant liquor license has the right to designate the person who may apply for a transfer of such license after his death and, in the absence of such designation, the surviving spouse or personal representative may do so. The statute insures that the holder of the license, by action or inaction, may pass on the right to apply for a transfer of the license. It is this right — a valuable right— which the decedent has as distinguished from the license itself. Such a construction is not novel. In fact we have held that where a licensee bargains by contract to transfer to another Ms license, an action will lie for specific performance of that contract, a clear recognition that the right to apply for a transfer of the license is a property right: <em>Cochrane v.

The Court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Paxson, said (page 415) : “While it is true, as was said in Eaudenbusch’s Petition, <a href="/pa/120/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="120 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="559860" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0328-01">120 Pa. 328</a>, that ‘neither the petitioner nor any other person in this state has any property in the right to sell liquors,’ yet it is also true that when the state grants a license to a man for that purpose, the latter acquires a privilege to sell liquors for a specified time, for which he has paid the Commonwealth a valuable consideration. <em>The privilege, however, is personal, </em>and is not assignable, <em>nor does it go to the personal representatives in case of death.”</em>

      <em>Ryan Estate </em>and all the prior decisions held that the value of a liquor license and the value of the right to apply for a transfer thereof were not subject to the Pennsylvania inheritance tax. That has been the law of Pennsylvania from 1889 until today, iterated and reiterated many times by this Court. It is now expressly overruled and we believe 7 other decisions of this <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>Court covering a period of 70 years are impliedly overruled.

The majority opinion admits that at least between the Commonwealth and the licensee “the license is simply a personal privilege subject to termination for cause or upon the death of the licensee; by its very nature the license itself does not become an asset of the estate of the deceased licensee.” However, the majority decide that by virtue of legislative fiat “the right to apply for such transfer is a right which possesses value” and therefore it must be subject to inheritance tax. Of course, this is a non sequitur and flies in the teeth of the language of the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Act and the principles governing the interpretation thereof. The Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521, as amended, provides: “Article I. Imposition and Bate of Tax. Section 1. . . . That a tax shall be and is hereby, <em>imposed upon the transfer of any property, </em>real or personal, ... to persons or corporations in the following cases: (a) When the transfer is by will or by the intestate laws of this Commonwealth' <em>from any person dying seized or possessed of the property </em>while a resident of the Commonwealth, whether the property be situated within this Commonwealth or elsewhere.”</p>

We repeat, there is no absolute or vested right in the deceased licensee, nor indeed in his widow or his personal representative, to have the liquor license transferred to the widow or to anyone. The language of the liquor control statute is clear. The Liquor Control Board has a right <em>in its sole discretion to transfer or not transfer the license, and to do it if, as and when it desires </em>and then only for the balance of the yearly term for which it was issued. The instant case aptly illustrates the impossibility of ascertaining and determining (or doing anything except make a wild guess of) <em>the value at time of decedent’s death of this so-called opportunity </em>to have the Liquor Control Board <em>in its sole discretion at some future undeterminate time </em>transfer the license. That point and the impossibility of doing anything but guess as to the value of the “opportunity” at the death of the licensee has been overlooked or glossed over by the majority. Decedent died on January 16, 1859. It was not until March 4, 1959 that the Liquor Control Board authorized a transfer of the decedent’s liquor license to Goldman, an individual. It is, we repeat, clear as crystal that no one could fairly, reasonably or accurately determine as of January 16, 1959 what was the value to decedent’s estate of the liquor license which terminated at decedent’s death and which it could not sell, or the value of the oppoi*tunity which the law gave to a widow or personal representative to have a transfer made or refused at the sole discretion of the Board at an indeterminable future time.</p>

Some of the decisions which were overruled had been handed down within the last three years and some within a period of months.
