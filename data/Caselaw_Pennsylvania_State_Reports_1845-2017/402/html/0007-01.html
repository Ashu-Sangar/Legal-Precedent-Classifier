Both Straits, the appellant, and the Linsenmeyers, appellees, instituted suits for damages for personal injuries sustained in this accident, each party alleging the collision was caused by the negligence of the other. Both actions were consolidated for trial and, after trial, the jury returned verdicts in both actions in favor of the Linsenmeyers and awarded them total verdicts of $11,500. Straits moved for judgment n.o.v. and a new trial; from the refusal of both motions and the subsequent entry of judgment on the verdicts this appeal was taken.</p>

Viewing the present record in this light, it appears that the accident occurred on November 25, 1956 on an ice covered bridge — connecting Washington and Monogahela — , the travelable portion of which was twenty-six feet in width and divided into two lanes. <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>At the time of the accident, the Linsenmeyer vehicle— operated by Bernard Linsenmeyer, Sr., who was accompanied by his wife, Rose Marie, and minor son, Bernard, — entered the bridge travelling in the eastbound lane thereof at a speed of approximately fifteen miles per hour and about thirty feet behind a motor vehicle driven in the same direction by one Wenzel. The Wenzel vehicle started to slide on the icy pavement and finally stopped in such a position that it blocked the eastbound lane. Observing this situation, the driver of the Linsenmeyer vehicle applied his brakes, began to slide and came in slight contact with the rear of the Wenzel vehicle. The Linsenmeyer vehicle then crossed the center lane and came to rest in such a position that its front end occupied approximately three and one-half feet of the thirteen foot westbound lane, leaving approximately nine feet of the lane unobstructed. Approximately eight to ten seconds elapsed from the time that the Linsenmeyer vehicle came to rest until Straits’ automobile — travelling in the westbound lane — crashed into the Linsenmeyer vehicle. During this interval of eight to ten seconds, Straits’ vehicle travelled at least four hundred fifty feet.</p>

This argument for judgment n.o.v. is without merit and overlooks both the facts and the applicable law. A review of this record indicates clearly that the questions of Linsenmeyer’s negligence and contributory negligence were properly submitted to the jury. It was for the jury to reconcile the conflicting testimony and contentions of Linsenmeyer and Straits, and the jury resolved these questions with a verdict for Linsenmeyer in both actions, thus negating any negligence or contributory negligence on Linsenmeyer’s part.</p>

In <em>Kurts, </em>plaintiffs vehicle, travelling north, stalled on the southbound tracks of the defendant’s trolley line. Defendant’s trolley was at that time four hundred feet away and continued without a decrease in speed until it struck plaintiff. In <em>Kurts, </em>the defendant, as in the instant case, sought judgment n.o.v. upon the ground that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent as a matter of law and this Court held that the question of contributory negligence was properly submitted to the jury. <em>Helt v.

In <em>Kelt, </em>plaintiff testified that, as he was travelling south on a four-lane highway across a bridge at a speed of twenty to twenty-five miles per hour, he was about to negotiate a turn to his right and, as he did so, the rear of his vehicle skidded to the left, was then righted and after proceeding straightway about twenty-five feet the front of the vehicle again skidded and ended at right angles to the highway completely blocking the northbound lane in which defendant was travelling. At the time plaintiff had completed his skid and his vehicle had come to rest in defendant’s path, the defendant’s vehicle was then between one hundred and one hundred fifty feet away. The case was submitted to the jury upon the theory that “if, as plaintiff testified, he had come to rest in the path of defendant’s truck at a time when the latter was one hundred to one hundred fifty feet away, the jury might find defendant’s driver was negligent in failing to stop or turn to his left... or in some other way avoid the collision”. The Superior Court affirmed a verdict against the defendant on the theory that the issue was one of credibility to be determined by the jury. In the instant situation the court below very properly refused to enter judgment n.o.v.</p>

With this position we are not in agreement. In support of his position, Straits cites cases<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in which this Court has awarded a new trial where the plaintiff’s version of the accident was contradicted by disinterested witnesses. An examination of these cases reveals that the witnesses therein were “eye witnesses” and that there was under the circumstances no reason to doubt their version. In the present situation, none of the “impartial and disinterested” witnesses saw the actual collision. One of the witnesses was Straits’ father-in-law and three of the witnesses — Mr. and Mrs. Wenzel and their daughter — had just experienced the frightful sensation of sliding and being involved in a collision. Not only did Mr. Wenzel give conflicting testimony on the important time interval involved but there was a grave <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>question as to Ms impartiality. Under these circumstances the credibility and weight of the testimony was clearly for the jury: <em>O’Farrell v.

There was sufficient evidence to sustain these verdicts and the court below did not abuse its discretion in refusing the motion for a new trial on this ground: <em>Kiser v.

The court, in passing upon the motion for a new trial in this respect, stated: “As to the allegation that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, we deem it sufficient to refer only to some of the well recognized rules in connection therewith. <em>The jury having returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, we must view the evidence in a light most favorable to them. . . . </em>There is no question but that the jury resolved the facts and the weight of the testimony in favor of the plaintiffs. <em>They therefore must be given the benefit of every fact and inference of fact pertinent to the issues which may reasonably be inferred from the evidence; that such facts and, inferences of fact must be taken as true; that all testimony and all conflicts of testimony must be resolved in </em>favor of the plaintiffs.” (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Obviously, </em>the court below erred in its application of this rule: <em>Sherman v.

While this study is most interesting and informative, it bears no relevance to the present situation. It is one of the privileges under our system of legal jurisprudence that a jury in one county may give greater damages than a jury in another county for a similar injury. The verdict of a jury is the product of many factors, both objective and subjective. A comparative study of jury verdicts, if it is to acquire any real sig<a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>nificance or relevancy, must emanate from an evaluation, if at all possible, of all these factors.

The trial judge —in a much better position to evaluate the situation than this Court because he saw the prospective jurors and heard their responses on voir dire — found no reason to justify a belief that these jurors by reason of their prior relationship with one or more of Linsenmeyers’ counsel would thereby be unable to fairly try tbe issue between Straits and Linsenmeyer. In this area of the law, wide latitude is given to the discretion of the trial judge and, absent any showing that the trial judge abused his discretion in this respect, his action must be sustained: <em>Commonwealth v.

Straits promptly objected to this statement as being highly prejudicial and requested the court to caution counsel and direct the jury to disregard the statement, although he did not move to withdraw a juror. The court then stated that, since counsel had agreed not to repeat the remark, no further ruling was required and the court did not instruct the jury to disregard the remark. While the trial judge is the one best able to evaluate the effect on the minds of the jury of counsel’s remark, his conclusion will be inquired into if there is an abuse of discretion: <em>Wilbert v.

    <p id="b38-4" data-blocks='[["BL_38.4",38,[228,847,1152,924]]]'>While the conduct of the trial judge in making this public endorsement of a candidate for public office cannot be condoned or justified that does not necessarily mean that such conduct would justify a new trial in this litigation. There is nothing upon the instant record to indicate that any of the jurors had read this political advertisement or that any of the jurors knew that Straits’ counsel was campaign manager for the person whose manner of campaign was stigmatized by the trial judge, or that such political advertisement, directly or indirectly, in any manner prejudiced or affected the outcome of this litigation or Straits’ interest. There is nothing of record to show that this improper conduct outside the courtroom on the part of the trial judge adversely affected the outcome of this litigation and, absent any such proof, we cannot grant a new trial upon this basis.</p>

Three of the jurors had been clients of the law firm representing Linsenmeyers; one juror was an “old friend” <em>presumably </em>of one of Linsenmeyer’s lawyers ; one juror came from the same village as one of Linsenmeyers’ lawyers and knew him. The court labeled the relationship of the latter two jurors as that of “acquaintance” and noted the legal relationship of the other three jurors was “not recent”.</p>

To compound their offense, the advertisement sought to promote the fortunes of an aspirant to a court position, that of district attorney, whose opponent’s campaign manager <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>was counsel for one of the parties actually on trial before one of the signatory judges.</p>

Counsel had no recourse but to keep silent and hope that the jurors were still neutral. It would have been madness to ask them on voir dire if they had seen the advertisement and, in order to identify it to them, read it aloud, or if they felt it applied to him.
