    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.4",630,[247,535,1156,870]]]'>A further examination of the record fails to disclose any indication, averment, or conclusion that there was any agreement between Attorney Nicklas and Recht that counsel would look to the fund for his compensation. The only statement in the record in that regard is the finding and conclusion of the court below that the fee claimed by Attorney Nicklas for his services was just and reasonable. An agreement to look to the fund for compensation is essential to the recognition of a charging lien and this requirement is not satisfied by a finding of the court that the fee or amount claimed is just and reasonable. The record indicates that no such agreement ever existed and this conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Attorney Nicklas submitted a bill to and demanded payment of Recht <em>prior </em>to the creation of the fund secured in the jury trial.</p>
    <p id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[242,1417,1155,428]]]'>Nor are we able to discover in the record any equitable reasons necessitating or justifying the imposition of the charging lien in the present case. It does not appear that Herman Recht is attempting to defraud counsel nor that he is insolvent. There is no adverse or third party attempting to appropriate the fund. Indeed, it does not appear that the right of Attorney Nicklas to collect his fee has been in anywise jeopardized.</p>
