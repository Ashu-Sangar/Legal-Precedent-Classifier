The two surviving judges found Petrillo guilty of murder in the first degree and imposed the death penalty, stating that, prior to the death of the trial judge, the three judges had consulted, considered the evidence, agreed on the degree of guilt and unanimously decided to impose the death penalty. This Court affirmed the conviction and sentence, stating, inter alia (p. 47) : “In determining what the penalty shall be after convictions in criminal cases, courts have a wide latitude in considering facts, whether or not these facts are produced by witnesses whom the members of the court see and hear. In many jurisdictions courts in determining proper sentences consider official records and the reports of probation officers, psychiatrists and others. This court without seeing or hearing any witnesses can determine whether a sentence of death for murder in the first degree should be reduced to life imprisonment: Com. v. Garramone, <a href="/pa/307/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="307 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="1138207" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0507-01">307 Pa. 507</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.%20733" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="161 A. 733">161 A. 733</a>.

However, Judge Milner not only read the testimony upon which the original three-judge court found appellants guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced them to death, and was thoroughly familiar therewith, but he also sat and heard the additional testimony. Furthermore, the action of appellants’ counsel in expressing their satisfaction that Judge Milner review the record of the prior proceedings acted in legal effect as a waiver of the convening of a new three-judge court to fix guilt and sentence.

        <em> </em>A distinction is made between the imposition of the death penalty by the trial court after it finds a defendant guilty of first degree murder and the imposition of the death penalty after a jury finds the defendant guilty of first degree murder.

The reason for that is evident. When a jury finds a defendant guilty of the highest grade of crime possible for a felonious homicide, viz., murder in the first degree, it then becomes its province to fix the penal!y by its verdict, as provided by the statute; and, when it has done that, it has done its legal duty and its action may not properly be called in question. On the other hand, the discretion exercised by a court in fixing the penalty for a conviction of murder in the first degree, founded upon a plea of guilt, is considered reviewable, as the judicial exercise of a legal discretion is ordinarily reviewable”.</p>

    <p id="b78-4" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[226,975,1151,584]]]'>In <em>Commonwealth v. Cater, </em>supra at 180, we reiterated that the reviewing function of this Court is to see “in every capital case whether the trial court abused its discretion by overlooking pertinent facts or disregarding the force of evidence, or erred in its law.” In applying these criteria to the record in that proceeding, we found that the Court en banc had misapplied certain of the evidence in reaching its conclusion as to the sentences to be imposed. It was for that reason that we vacated the judgments of sentence and remitted the records.</p>
    <p id="b78-5" data-blocks='[["BL_78.5",78,[224,1588,1150,759]],["BL_79.1",79,[117,348,1145,1588]]]'>I have once more scrutinized the entire record, for “in such a solemn and drastic proceeding there is no room for a scintilla of error,” and I am constrained to hold that the court en banc has again erred in arriving at its conclusion. The reasoning with which I find fault can best be indicated by quoting the following language from the lower court’s opinion, “Nor can it now be argued that Cater and Rivers were not, in the words of Mr. Justice Cohen, equally responsible with Williams for this homicide. . . . We must interpret the phrase <em>‘equally responsible’ to mean equally contributing to the result. </em>What considerations would impel one to conclude that three men equally responsible for a criminal act are not equally culpable? If <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>there be any such considerations, we conceive that they must arise from differences in the acts or attitudes of the individual participants in the commission of the crime <em>(which, if they exist, would negative equal responsibility), </em>or from differences in the personalities and backgrounds of the participants, aside from the criminal act itself, or from differences in the attitudes of the participants after the commission of the crime which might incline the sentencing authority in the direction of less severity towards one than towards another. We can find nothing in this case to cause us to regard Cater and Elvers as being less responsible than Williams, or less blameworthy.” (Emphasis supplied ). I considered it patently obvious that our reference to the fact that Cater and Eivers “were equally responsible with Williams” (<a href="/pa/396/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="396 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1284915" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0172-01">396 Pa. 172</a>, 176) <em>in the context of discussing the appellants’ guilt of first degree murder under the “felony-murder” rule </em>was not in the slightest way meant to have any bearing on the separate and distinct determination to be made as to the proper punishment to be imposed. Most apparently the court below seized upon this remark and from it derived the notion that this Court meant to indicate that the three participants were equally <em>culpable </em>and should thus receive equal punishment. Nothing could be further from the fact. Quite to the contrary, I had serious doubts (not since allayed) as to the propriety of the imposition of the death sentence under the circumstances surrounding these two boys.</p>

Green, </em>supra at 119-150, “Both the criminal act and the criminal himself must be thoroughly, completely and exhaustively examined before a court can exercise a <em>sound </em>discretion in determining the appropriate penalty. . . . An appropriate exercise of judicial discretion as required by the statute contem<a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>plates that the death penalty be imposed where <em>all </em>the facts surrounding the criminal act and the criminal actor have been exhaustively considered and where, after such consideration, no other conclusion can be justified than the extermination of the convicted criminal by death.” Desiring to give the court below the opportunity to make an independent determination free from error, we remitted the records for re-sentencing; but the studied and flagrant misinterpretation of our opinion in the first <em>Cater </em>case clearly indicates that the court entertained motives that are not consistent with the responsibilities required by a court in such a solemn and drastic proceeding. I would vacate the sentence of death and remit the record with instructions to sentence appellants to imprisonment for life.</p>
