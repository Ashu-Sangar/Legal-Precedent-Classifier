Defendants filed an answer raising questions <em>of </em>law. After a rule to show cause had been issued the lower Court entered an Order which dismissed defendants’ objections, sustained the petition, and granted defendants leave to file an answer on the merits within 20 days from the decree. From this Order defendants took this appeal.</p>

Petitioner alleged that one of the defendants, through its duly authorized agent, was operating a Ford tractor to which was attached a Fruehauf trailer, that the <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>trailer collided with an automobile driven by Ervin L.

    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[240,931,1156,924]]]'>Petitioner, Keystone Insurance Company, sought a declaratory judgment under the Uniform Declaratory 'Judgments Act of June 18, 1923, 12 PS §831, as amended ’and supplemented. There is no controversy as to the construction of the language or terms of the insurance policy, in question — on the contrary, the sole question is a <em>factual </em>determination of whether adequate notice was given to the Insurance Company by the insured, to include the vehicle involved in the accident (the trailer) within-the terms of the policy. The nonresident Administrator of Harbold, who had instituted a wrongful death action against the insured (the defendants) in the United States District Court, was not joined as a party in the present action, nor was he served in Pennsylvania, although he was sent a notice by mail to his residence in Maryland. It is conceded that this notice by mail is inadequate notice.</p>
