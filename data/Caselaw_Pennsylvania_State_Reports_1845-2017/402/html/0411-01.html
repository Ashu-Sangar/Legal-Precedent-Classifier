Causby, </em><a href="/us/328/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="328 U.S. 256" data-case-ids="377275" data-case-paths="/us/328/0256-01">328 U. S. 256</a> (1946). The decision in that case upheld the claimant’s right to damages from the United States for a taking of certain of his property located near an airport because of a substantial interference with his use and enjoyment of it by low flights of U. S. military planes, when taking off from or landing at the airport. In answer to an argument similar to that which the County of Allegheny makes here, the Supreme Court said (at pp. 263-264), “The fact that the path of glide taken by the planes was approved by the Civil Aeronautics Authority does not change the result. The navigable airspace which Congress has placed in the public domain is 'airspace above the minimum safe altitudes of flight prescribed by the Civil Aeronautics Authority.’ 49 U.S.C., sec. 180. If that agency prescribed 83 feet [the height at which the planes passed over Causby’s <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>land] as the minimum safe altitude, then we would have presented the question of the validity of the regulation. But nothing of the sort has been done. The path of glide governs the method of operating — of landing or taking off. The altitude required for that operation is not the minimum safe altitude of flight which is the downward reach of the navigable airspace. The minimum prescribed by the Authority is 500 feet during the day and 1,000 feet at night for air carriers {Civil Air Regulations, Pt. 61, sections 61.7400, 61.7401, Code Fed. Reg. Cum. Supp., Tit. 14, ch. 1), and from 300 feet to 1,000 feet for other aircraft, depending on the type of plane and the character of the terrain. <a href="/us/328/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="328 U.S. 256" data-case-ids="377275" data-case-paths="/us/328/0256-01">Id.</a> Pt. 60, sections 60.350-60.3505, Fed. Reg. Cum. Supp., supra. Hence, the flights in question were not within the navigable airspace which Congress placed within the public domain. If any airspace needed for landing or taking off were included, flights which were so close to the land as to render it uninhabitable would be immune. But the United States concedes, as we have said, that in that event there would be a taking. Thus, it is apparent that the path of glide is not the minimum safe altitude of flight within the meaning of the statute. The Civil Aeronautics Authority has, of course, the power to prescribe air traffic rules. But Congress has defined navigable airspace only in terms of one of them — the minimum safe altitudes of flight.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Griggs testified at the hearing before the viewers that the airplanes of several commercial air lines flew over his land at low altitudes. But, he offered no proof that any of these planes were owned by the County of Allegheny or operated by its agents. Indeed, the viewers found as a fact that “There is no evidence of any control exercised over any aircraft by the County of Allegheny.” That finding, supported as it is by the record, precludes the claimant from recovering against the County in this proceeding.</p>

In that decision we did not decide who were proper defendants.

The County not only owned the Airport, but it also constructed the buildings thereon and the landing fields and the runways to the airport. It also owed a duty to repair and maintain them. It leased the land and facilities for commercial flights to various airlines. Furthermore, the County knew that the approach and the path of glide or the descent path and the airlines themselves were in minute detail regulated, prescribed and directed how, when and where to fly, how, when and where to approach, and land and take off, by independent Governmental Agencies known as the Federal Aviation Agency and the Civil Aeronautics Board.</p>

Moreover, their house was so close to the runways or path of glide that as the spokesman for the members of the Airlines Pilot Association admitted “If we had engine failure we would have no course but to plow into your house.” Moreover, the flights were endangered by plaintiff’s trees and vice versa.: The Viewers found, inter alia, that at the <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>Griggs’ property the surface of the approach area is only 11.88 feet above plaintiff’s residence.

The problems which have arisen in connection with airports and aircraft and air travel were unknown to the Common Law and in reality arose for the first time in the 1920’s, or thereafter. Until the opening of the air age the owner of real property owned from the surface (or below) to the sky- — cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum. That principle has been very substantially modified. It is now held that the owner of land owns from the surface (or lower regions) to the upper reaches and regions of the air to whatever heights may be needed for use and the enjoyment of his property. In considering the problems created by the air age, we are faced with the task of reconciling traditional common law concepts with the realities of modern day life. In our desire for progress we must not overlook or extinguish the inherent and inalienable constitutionally guaranteed rights of private property which is one of the bedrocks of our Federal and State Governments, and indeed one of the two great hallmarks of western civilisation. We must not allow, in the <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>appealing name of progress or general welfare, a property owner to be deprived by the Federal, State .or County Government, or by anyone, of Ms property or any rights accruing therein and therefrom.</p>

The United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Causby, </em><a href="/us/328/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="328 U.S. 256" data-case-ids="377275" data-case-paths="/us/328/0256-01">328 U.S. 256</a>, has rejected these contentions. There, the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas, pertinently said (pages 263-265) : “The fact <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>that the path of glide taken by the planes was that approved by the Civil Aeronautics Authority does not change the result. The navigable airspace which Congress has placed in the public domain is ‘airspace above the minimum safe altitudes of flight prescribed by the Civil Aeronautics Authority.’ <a href="/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7180" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="43 U.S.C. §180">43 U.S.C. §180</a>. If that agency prescribed 83 feet as the minimum safe altitude, then we would have presented the question of the validity of the regulation. But nothing of the sort has been done. <em>The path of glide governs the ■method </em>of <em>operating </em>— of <em>landing or taking </em>off. <em>The altitude required for that operation is not the minimum safe altitude of flight which is the downward reach of the navigable airspace. </em>The minimum prescribed by the Authority is 500 feet during the day and 1,000 feet at night for air carriers (Civil Air Regulations, Pt. 61, §§61.7400, 61.7401, Code Fed. Reg. Cam. Supp., Tit. 14, ch. 1), and from 300 feet to 1,000 feet for other aircraft, depending on the type of plane and the character of the terrain. <a href="/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7180" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="43 U.S.C. §180">Id.,</a> Pt, 60, §§60.350-60.3505, Fed. Reg. Cum. Supp., supra. Hence, the flights in question were not within the navigable airspace which Congress placed within the public domain. If any airspace needed for landing or taking off were included, flights which were so close to the land as to render it uninhabitable would be immune. But the United States concedes, as we have said, that <em>in that event there would be a taking. Thus, it is apparent that the path of glide is not the minimum safe altitude of flight within the meaning of the statute. </em>The Civil Aeronautics Authority has, of course, the power to prescribe air traffic rules. But Congress has defined navigable airspace only in terms of one of them — the minimum safe altitudes of flight.</p>

Otherwise buildings could not be erected, trees could not be planted, and even fences could not be run.

While the owner does not in any physical manner occupy that stratum of airspace or make use of it in the conventional sense, he does use it in somewhat the same sense that space left between buildings for the purpose of light and air is used. <em>The super-adjacent airspace at this low altitude is so close to the lm%d that continuous invasions of it affect the use of the surface of the land itself.

Port of Seattle, </em>supra, the Supreme Court of Washington decided that the Airport owned by the Port of Seattle was liable in damages for a “taking” which resulted from low flights into the Airport in accordance with Federally prescribed regu<a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>lations or orders. Washington has the same Constitutional provision as does the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in regard to compensation for private property taken, injured or destroyed. That Court held specifically that flights in the normal approach area which caused fear, anxiety and apprehension constituted an unreasonable interference with plaintiff’s property and amounted to a “taking” by the Port of Seattle. In the course of its opinions that Court aptly said (329 P. 2d, page 216, 221 and 348 P. 2d, page 671) : « . . if the state first declared certain private lands to be public domain and then built a road thereon, it is quite apparent that there would be a violation of Art. I, §16, amendment 9, of the Washington constitution. We believe this is as true with space in the air as it is with the surface of land. The government simply cannot arbitrarily declare that all of the airspace over a person’s land is public domain and then, cavalierly, claim absolute immunity against property owners’ claims for any and all possible damages. . . .</p>

Causby, </em><a href="/us/328/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="328 U.S. 256" data-case-ids="377275" data-case-paths="/us/328/0256-01">supra,</a> and (3) by the agreement entered into between the United States and the County by which the County obtained enormous federal aid for the construction of this airport. In that agreement the County specifically undertook, inter alia, the following: “(i) Insofar as is within its powers and reasonably possible, <em>the Sponsor will prevent the use of any land either within or outside the boundaries of the Airport in any manner </em>(including the construction, erection, alteration, or growth of any structure or other object thereon) <em>which would create a hazard to the landing, take-off or maneuvering of aircraft at the </em>Airport, <em>or otherwise limit the usefulness of the Airport. This objective will be accomplished </em>either by the adoption and enforcement of a Zoning Ordinance and regulations, <em>or by the acquisition of easements or other interests in land or airspace, </em>or by both such methods.”</p>

The great difficulty which arises because of the complexity of the facts in this case is instantly apparent, and it is virtually a practical impossibility to fix any other date for the taking. We cannot say that the date which the Viewers found constituted a taking was erroneous. Moreover, in view of the conflicting testimony and the inherent difficulty of appraising and fixing the damage which plaintiffs suffered, we cannot say that the Viewers erred in their verdict.</p>
