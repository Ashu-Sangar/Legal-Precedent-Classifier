The defendant-appellee did not contest the issue of liability and the sole question before the jury was the amount of damages. The jury returned a verdict for the appellants for $15,000. The appellants alleged significant errors in the charge concerning the issue of <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>damages, but they did not demonstrate or even attempt to demonstrate that their recovery was adversely affected by the alleged errors. A motion for a new trial was denied and this appeal followed.</p>

A verdict winner complaining of trial errors in order to secure a new trial must convince the trial court that the verdict in his favor did not cure the errors and that the errors produced an unjust result.
