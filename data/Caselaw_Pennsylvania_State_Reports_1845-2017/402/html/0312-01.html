      <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>On September 6, 1957, at approximately 11:10 p.m., Mrs. Warner with Mrs. Ason as a passenger drove her car out of Mrs. Ason’s (rural) driveway onto Route 20. Route 20 was a three lane improved highway. Mrs. Warner intended to drive east and in order to do so had to cross the highway and turn left. The testimony on behalf of Mrs. Warner and Mrs. Ason was that Mrs. Warner as she came out of the driveway stopped and looked both ways for traffic; she allowed one or two cars coming from her right to pass in front of her; she then looked both ways and seeing nothing coming drove out onto the highway. Route 20 curved toward the north, with the result that according to plaintiff Mrs. Warner had a visibility to the east of about 190 feet, and according to defendant a visibility of about 300 feet. According to plaintiffs’ testimony, Mrs. Warner crossed the highway and was traveling in her right-hand lane at least two car lengths before the accident. She did not see defendant, who was approaching from the opposite direction with his headlights on, until he was almost upon her. She attempted to justify this failure by the curve and by the <em>assumed </em>great speed of defendant’s car. According to plaintiffs’ version, defendant must have lost control of his car because he suddenly crashed into her car, which, we repeat, was in her right-hand lane. According to defendant’s testimony, Mrs. Warner suddenly shot out of the Ason driveway and confronted with the sudden emergency he put on his brakes, turned to his left to avoid the collision and ran into her car. Defendant was corroborated in material respects by two children aged 11 and 12. According to defendant this collision resulted from an emergency which was created by Mrs. Warner’s sudden and negligent darting onto the highway.</p>

After 15 minutes of deliberation the jury found the verdict for plaintiff Zella Ason and against Leonhart in the sum of $5500.03. Defendant contends that inconsistent verdicts can be corrected only by the grant of a new trial. We do not agree. There was no contention or suggestion that the Court coerced or unduly influenced the jury in reaching its verdict. We agree with Judge Rossiter, who, speaking for the Court en banc, said: “Having in mind that one of the very purposes in combining trials growing out of the same accident is to prevent inconsistent verdicts the trial judge felt, under the circumstances, the only sensible thing to do was recommit the case to the jury and the verdict finally received, irrespective of a prior inconsistent verbal statement of the foreman, was as above stated.

The purpose of combining trials is two-fold: one to prevent inconsistént verdicts, and another to eliminate trial delays and speed litigation.
