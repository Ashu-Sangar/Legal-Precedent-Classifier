It overlooks the obvious fact that the State and Federal processes are very different. The Federal authorities are not interested in the defendant’s errors, namely, the wrongful setting of the tax jaws by showing cash in bank in both numerator and denominator of the tangible property fraction, or the amount that should have appeared only in the denominator of the gross receipts allocation fraction to show the proportion between business done in Pennsylvania to that done outside. Such matters are of concern to the State only. The Act, in §2, defines net income as “that returned to and ascertained by the Federal Government”, namely, the amount subject to Federal tax: <em>Commonwealth v. Electrolux Corp., </em><a href="/pa/362/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="362 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="477315" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0333-01">362 Pa. 333</a> (1949), <a href="/citations/?q=67%20A.2d%20105" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="67 A.2d 105">67 A. 2d 105</a>. There is no direct relation between the elements in the Federal tax base and those in the fractions, which measure corporate activity within the State and are created by its laws. Thus it may be, quite as appellant contends, that the final ascertainment of the Federal tax may take time, but it does not follow that the correction of appellant’s errors need await the outcome.</p>
