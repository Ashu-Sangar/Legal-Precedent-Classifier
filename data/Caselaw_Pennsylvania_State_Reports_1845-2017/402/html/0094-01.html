At a hearing on the rule for preliminary injunction, the following facts were stipulated by counsel: Appellant is a Pennsylvania corporation; the appellees are all Philadelphia residents and constitute a class represented by the named appellees. Pursuant to an application filed by appellant and after due notice was posted on the premises and protests were filed and heard, the State Liquor Control Board approved a transfer of a restaurant liquor license to the premises in question. The transfer of this license was in accordance with the policy then expressed in the Liquor Code as interpreted by this Court in <em>Obradovich Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/386/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="386 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1268295" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0342-01">386 Pa. 342</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.2d%20435" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="126 A.2d 435">126 A. 2d 435</a> (1956) (since modified by the legislature in the Act of August 25, 1959, P.L. 746, §1, 47 PS §4-404).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The unincorporated associations <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>named as appellees herein (“3200 block of Turner Street Organization” and “Strawberry Mansion Council of Block Organizations”) then appealed the approval of this license transfer to the court of quarter sessions, which appeal was quashed. Appellant’s premises are zoned properly for the use in question, the area being zoned mixed industrial, commercial and residential. Appellant’s operation of the business at that address as a taproom-restaurant began on November 13, 1959. Picketing began on November 17, 1959, and continued daily, except for Sundays, with the number of participating pickets disputed, appellant claiming that as many as seven picketed at one time and appellees claiming a maximum of five; and children acted as pickets. The following signs were carried by the pickets, “Luther King did it why can’t we;” “Please do not patronize excess bar;” “We need classrooms not taprooms;” “Less taprooms, more classrooms, more playrooms;” “We don’t need another taproom;” “This taproom open without court’s approval ;” “.Help Strawberry Mansion approve;” “We can’t be bought please don’t patronize this bar;” “Be fair. Please do not patronize excess bar.” None of the appellees were ever or are now employees of appellant, nor do they represent or act on behalf of any employee of appellant, or any association or labor union with which appellant is affiliated. Finally, no adequate remedy at law is available to appellant. After making these admissions part of the record, the chancellor, upon the request of appellant’s counsel and <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>over objection, took judicial notice of the fact that the picketing was detrimental to appellant’s business and that it was causing some loss, however minimal, to appellant.</p>

By order of the chancellor, December 18, 1959, was fixed as the date for the taking of testimony “on the question of a nuisance in fact, and on such other issues as may be relevant in the case.” Appellees filed an answer to the complaint alleging that the picketing was orderly and lawful, that it was protected by the Federal and State Constitutions as a means of expression, and praying that the complaint be dismissed. Hearings were held on December 18, and 21, 1959, where the appellees presented testimony to prove that the operation of appellant’s business constituted a nuisance in fact. When appellees’ counsel informed the court that he intended to introduce over two hundred additional witnesses as to acts of nuisance, the chancellor fixed January 13, 14, 15, 1960, as further hearing dates. This appeal followed. Subsequently, appellant filed a statement in accordance with our Bule 40 conceding, for the purpose of this appeal only, that the appellees have. presented and are prepared to present by many witnesses considerable testimony upon the basis of which the chancellor could find that the operation of appellant’s business constituted a nuisance in fact.</p>

The appellees rely upon the following words used by the chancellor in his December 7, 1959, Interim Order, “upon consideration of the application for preliminary injunction by the plaintiff [appellant here], the <em>Court reserves decision </em>and enters the following Interim Order.” (Emphasis supplied.) From this the appellees infer that rather than refuse a preliminary injunction, the court merely reserved decision pending the taking of testimony in order to decide whether or not to grant <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>the requested relief. They label this an interlocutory order which is not tantamount to a refusal to grant an injunction. We strongly disagree. Appellant’s complaint alleged property damage and sought immediate injunctive relief. The chancellor, after hearing, refused such relief and instead reduced in number and otherwise regulated the pickets. In his opinion, filed in accordance with our Eule 43, the chancellor expressly states, <em>“We did not prohibit the picketing. </em>At that time we held under advisement whether we would take testimony on the question of the existence of a nuisance in fact. Three days latex*, on December 10, 1959, after studying briefs of counsel, we directed that a hearing be held on such issue and any other relevant issues on December 18, 1959. . . . From the evidence we heard we found the picketing in this case did not have an unlawful object, was not forbidden by law and did not contravene public policy. Accordingly, <em>we refused to issue the injunctive relief for which the plaintiff </em>prayed.” (Emphasis supplied.) Even though couched in terms of an “interim order,” the chancellor’s edict in practical effect denied appellant’s requested relief. The fact that the chancellor retaixied the matter aixd scheduled further hearings on whether appellant was conducting a nuisance (which, if true, would only provide further ground for denial of injunctive ox* other relief) is not significant in view of the court’s order. This situation must be treated on appeal as equivalent to the refusal of a preliminax’y injunction which constitutes an appealable order. Were we to interpret otherwise the effect of such an order we would be encouraging its utilization to prevent appeals by complainants who have sought relief and effectively been denied it, thereby thwarting the will of the legislature as expressed in 12 PS §1102.</p>

They disclose a group of people parading back and forth on the pavement in front of appellant’s establishment holding forth placards which by means of a written plea urge all persons who are within sight not to patronize the liquor establishment at its present location. The record is devoid of evidence indicating rioting, violent conduct or mass picketing; devoid of evidence of any communication, i.e. threats express or implied, between the pickets and potential patrons or suppliers which might indicate intimidation or coercion, either physical or psychological; and devoid of evidence that the picketing-in any way created or contributed to a disturbance. We must assume from this record that persons passed freely without any molestation or interference through the picket line to enter the appellant’s premises. Completely absent are those non-speech elements of picketing which have, in prior cases, been the basis and justification for state interference. Also lacking is that often essential element of a labor-management contest — the <em>union picket line, </em>which, because of union rule's, is particularly effective at convincing members, their families and affiliates not to cross the line and enter the premises.

The appellees’ brief informs us that the organizations which are represented by the appellees were “organized to protect the health and general welfare of the area involved.” Because they believed that the presence of appellant’s taproom in their midst constituted a nuisance by attracting undesirable persons to the area who loudly used vile, profane and vulgar language within the hearing of other persons on the street; that these undesirables had urinated on the sidewalk and in the alleys, had regurgitated on the pavement, had blown their ear horns and had double parked thereby obstructing traffic (all of which was found as fact by the chancellor); and that these occurrences had disrupted and threatened the peace, dignity and morals of the neighborhood and were a corrupting influence upon their children, the appellees began parading in front of appellant’s establishment carrying aloft the aforementioned placards. Their objective was obvious: to convince passersby, by means of persuasion, not to patronize the establishment so that in time its opera<a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>tion would become uneconomical and appellant would therefore transfer the liquor license to another location, or, failing in that, to persuade the appellant to so police his patrons that the most blatant of the evils complained of would cease so that the peacefulness and good character of the neighborhood would not be destroyed.</p>
