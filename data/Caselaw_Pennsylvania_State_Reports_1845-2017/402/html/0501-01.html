The court below, also on September 9, granted the prayer of the complaint and issued a preliminary injunction upon affidavits, enjoining defendants from obstructive conduct and requiring a bond.</p>

It also became moot when the Convention adjourned on September 12, since by its terms it was pitched to the continuation of the Convention and had no life after. See <em>Wortex Mills v.

Appellants want us to solve these questions for them under the theory of <em>Milasinovich v. Serbian Progressive </em>Club, <a href="/pa/369/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="369 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1232341" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0026-01">369 Pa. 26</a> (1951), <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20571" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="84 A.2d 571">84 A. 2d 571</a>, that when equity has taken jurisdiction for one purpose it will complete the job. The court below has properly disposed of tMs and the rest of appellants’ arguments as follows: “Though equity is not the proper forum for tMs cause, it is customary in such situations to transfer the matter to the law side of the court to be tried as a writ of quo warranto (Siranovich case, supra [<a href="/pa/359/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="359 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="473147" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0134-01">359 Pa. 134</a>]). Yet this Court, because of the facts in this case, is unable to do so and must dismiss the second complaint and ‘counterclaim’. The Act which authorizes quo warranto proceedings states that the writ may issue: ‘In case any question shall arise concerning the exercise of any office, in any corporation, created by authority of law, and having the chief place of business within the respective county.’ (Act of 1836, P. L. 621, §2, 12 PS §2022 III.) The Act appears to restrict itself to a corporation with its chief place of business in a particular Pennsylvania County. The Baptist Convention has no chief place of business in tMs County; its annual convention for 1960 was held in Philadelphia and that is all.</p>

One author puts it, "The officers of a corporation can be removed from office for dereliction of duty or other cause only by the courts of the state by which the corporation was created. The courts of another state have no jurisdiction in such cases, as the question is one relating to the internal management of a foreign corporation. In accordance with the same principle, a court will not determine which of the rival claimants are the legal officers of a foreign corporation, or whether a person was regularly elected an officer of a foreign corporation. The courts of a state other than that by which a corporation was created will not undertake to set aside the election (sic) officers by such corporation.’ Fletcher, supra, Vol. 17, §§8442, pp. 473-5 (1960 Rev.

The only contact this state had with it was that its annual convention was held in Philadelphia and service thus was obtained here. This fact does not sufficiently outweigh the principle that we refrain from interfering with the internal affairs of this corporation. No great hardship should result from this conclusion since the courts of the District of Columbia are open. Nor is the plight of the parties worsened from a geographic point of view. Many of the parties and proposed witnesses are not <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>Pennsylvanians and would find it as convenient or inconvenient to travel to Washington as to Philadelphia. Since there is no compelling reason to cause us to exercise our discretion and overlook the ‘internal affairs rule’ and since it would be a vain act to transfer the action to the law side only to have it dismissed there, we now sustain defendants’ preliminary objections and dismiss both complaints and the ‘counterclaim’.”</p>

Thus, <em>Plum v. Tampax, Inc., </em>supra, clearly requires that we remand the cases to the court below.</p>
