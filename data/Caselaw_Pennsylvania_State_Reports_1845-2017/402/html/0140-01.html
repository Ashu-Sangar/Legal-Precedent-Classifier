      <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>The issue which is usually determinative of the problem in this area is the intention of the parties as indicated by the terms of the will, the insurance policy, the assignment and any other pertinent extrinsic evidence. When we apply this test, we find that there is usually no claim against a decedent’s estate under an “insurance policy loan” because, by mutual agreement, the insurance company restricts itself to the proceeds of the policy for repayment of the loan. Thus, there can be no subrogation by the insurance beneficiaries. See <em>Schwartz </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/369/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="369 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="1232334" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0574-01">369 Pa. 574</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20270" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="87 A.2d 270">87 A. 2d 270</a> (1952); <em>Black’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/341/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="341 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1204486" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0264-01">341 Pa. 264</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.2d%20130" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="19 A.2d 130">19 A. 2d 130</a> (1941). Here, however, the problem is somewhat different since the insurance company did not make the loan; the insurance policy is merely collateral for a loan from a bank. The creditor in this case does have a claim against decedent’s estate as well as against the collateral. Nevertheless, the intention of the parties, if ascertainable, must control.</p>

This conclusion was reached on the basis of decedent’s intent as expressed in the terms of the assignment to the bank. In the <em>Wilson </em>case we went on to say, as dicta, that, “Had the creditor bank used decedent-settlor’s insurance collateral to liquidate its loan, the designated insurance beneficiaries could have enforced their claim against the estate of the decedent under their right of subrogation. . . .” In light of our interpretation of decedent’s intent in that case this dicta was a correct statement of the law.</p>

In the eyes of the law but not in the minds or intentions of the parties, the note is the primary obligation. An insured knows at the time he makes the loan, that the loan will be paid out of the proceeds of the policy and the named beneficiary of the policy will be paid what is left. The insured (borrower) knows and every bank and every other lender knows that <em>the parties intend </em>the loan to be paid, we repeat, out of the proceeds of the insurance policy and not out of the insured’s estate where the claim may be contested and may be paid, if there are available funds, one or more years after the insured’s death. To this extent the insured’s original intention has been changed by the assignment, and he intends his named beneficiaries to receive not the face amount of the policy but the balance of the policy after the bank has been paid the amount of the loan. In the instant case, as in most cases, the policy beneficiaries did not pay the premiums nor did they pay or offer to pay the insured-decedent’s debt to the bank; nor did any consideration move from them which would give rise to an equitable right of subrogation or reimbursement; nor did the insured direct by will or otherwise that the policy beneficiaries should be reimbursed by his estate.

That was a complicated and unusual case.

      <em>insurance were exempt from Pennsylvania inheritance tax </em>but added the following dicta (page 551) : “As with any other collateral, when a loan is repaid the collateral is returned to the owner. Had the creditor bank used decedent-settlor’s insurance collateral to liquidate its loan, the designated insurance beneficiaries could have enforced their claim against the estate of the decedent under their right of subrogation, to the same extent as if they had been the original creditor.” This language was used in unraveling a case where— (1) Wilson was (a) the insured, (b) the borrower from and debtor to the bank, (c) the assignor-pledgor of the insurance policy, (d) the settlor in the inter vivos trust, and (e) the testator; and (2) the Girard Trust Company was (a) the lender-creditor, (b) the assignee-pledgee, (c) the inter vivos trustee, (d) the executor, and (e) the testamentary trustee; and (8) the beneficiaries were exactly the same in the insurance policy and under the inter vivos deed of trust and under the testamentary trust.</p>
    <p id="b169-4" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[130,1462,1143,201]]]'>In <em>Wilson Estate, </em>that dicta, whether we consider it sound or unsound as applied to the facts in that case, is obviously not applicable with respect to the highly different facts in the instant case.</p>
    <p id="b169-5" data-blocks='[["BL_169.5",169,[128,1683,1145,699]]]'>To state it another way, a borrower <em>knows and intends </em>that unless he provides otherwise, the amount which will be payable to a policy beneficiary in an ordinary loan which is secured only by one or more policies of insurance is the <em>net </em>amount of the policy proceeds remaining after payment of the bank loan. A borrower likewise knows that if he has any other intention he can provide (differently in the assignment or) in his will that his executor shall reimburse the policy beneficiaries for the amount deducted by the bank for payment of its loan — if that is the borrower’s intention. Absent such a provision, it is clear that that was not his intention.</p>

      <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>That the foregoing represents the <em>insured’s intent </em>is further evident from the fact that since the Wills Act of 1917 (section 18) a devisee of real estate which is subject to a mortgage is not entitled to exoneration by such a devise or by a general testamentary direction by the insured that his debts be paid. In the Wills Act of 1947<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">*</a> the Legislature thus provided: “Section 14. ... (12) Eeal Estate Subject to a Mortgage. The devisee of real estate which is subject to a mortgage shall take subject thereto, and shall <em>not </em>be entitled to exoneration out of the other estate of the testator, real or personal; and this whether the mortgage was created by the testator or by a previous owner or owners, <em>and notwithstanding any general direction by the testator that his debts be paid.” </em>This provision in the Wills Act of 1917 and of 1947 was passed to make clear and certain that the insured-testator’s intent would not be voided in a situation exactly parallel to that in the instant case.</p>
    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.4",170,[242,1418,1154,815]]]'>The foregoing statements lay down the general rule and the reason for the rule. HoAvever, the present case is an exceptional one because, since the Court approved and in effect- ordered the loan for the living expenses of the incompetent-insured, it is difficult (a)' to determine the insured’s intention or (b) to say that his original intent to leave the policy proceeds to the named beneficiaries has been changed when he was incompetent to change it. Eor the latter reason, I would hold that in this case the testator’s original intent had not been voluntarily changed, and the named beneficiaries would be entitled to (exoneration or subrogation or) reimbursement out of the insured’s general estate for the amount of the proceeds of the policy which was used to pay the insured’s bank loan.</p>
