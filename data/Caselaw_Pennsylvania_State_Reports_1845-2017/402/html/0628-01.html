The court en banc granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial on the ground that the aggregate of untoward events happening at trial, including emotional outbursts by the bereaved husband of the homicide victim, the introduction in evidence of bloody color slides and the fact that the jury was drawn from a panel which had previously heard the defendant plead guilty before a three-judge court, “created such an inflammatory atmosphere that the jury’s determination may well have been based upon other than the substantive factual evidence introduced.” The Commonwealth has appealed and ashs us to reverse the order granting the defendant a new trial and to direct that judgment of sentence be entered on the jury’s verdict.</p>

It is only where the question involved is purely one of law that the Commonwealth may appeal from an adverse ruling in a criminal case, for example, where a new trial is granted <em>to </em>a convicted defendant on the sole ground that the introduction of certain evidence at his trial was prejudicial error <em>(Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b650-4" data-blocks='[["BL_650.4",650,[247,472,1153,648]]]'>How an appellate court, with only an inanimate record in cold print before it, could possibly be expected to sense, gauge, and justly appraise the atmosphere prevailing in the court below at the time of trial and thereupon competently determine whether or not attending circumstances at trial were prejudicially inflammatory, it is impossible to perceive. Obviously such an inquiry involves primarily a factual question which lies peculiarly within the province of the trial court to resolve. From that court’s conclusion based, as it necessarily is, on fact as well as law, no right of appeal exists in the Commonwealth.</p>
