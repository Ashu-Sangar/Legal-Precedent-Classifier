The writ was duly issued but never served. It was not until more than two years and eight months after the action had been begun that the plaintiffs filed their complaint.</p>

      <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>The question involved on these appeals is whether the action is barred, to the extent that damages for personal injuries are claimed, by a court promulgated rule fixing a limitation of time within which a plaintiff, after causing a writ of summons to issue which was not served, must act in order to protect the efficacy of the process and thus keep the cause of action alive.</p>
    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[249,736,1155,758]]]'>The accident, which the plaintiffs charge to alleged tortious conduct of the defendant, occurred on December 29, 1950. The husband and wife plaintiffs, who were driver and passenger respectively in one of the cars involved, filed their praecipe for the issuance of a writ of summons in trespass against the defendant, the driver of the other car, on September 29, 1952. As already indicated, the writ was issued but never served. On June 16, 1955, the plaintiffs filed their complaint which, as amended, claims damages for personal injuries to the wife plaintiff, medical expenses incurred and to be incurred by the husband plaintiff therefor, and property damage to the husband’s automobile and consequent loss to him.</p>
    <p id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[241,1506,1155,750]]]'>The defendant’s answer to the complaint alleged, under the heading of New Matter, that the “action is barred by the Statute of Limitations.” On September 20, 1956, the deposition of the defendant was taken in which he stated that he had entered the United States Navy on February 19,1952, spent his entire naval service at Bainbridge, Maryland, and was discharged on December 1, 1953. He further deposed that he had spent the first three months after his discharge at his father’s home in Allentown and that, since sometime in February of 1954, he has resided continuously in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. He was not questioned as to whether he had attempted to conceal his whereabouts.</p>

The plaintiffs filed a reply on October 17, 1957, to the defendant’s answer and new matter wherein they averred, as the defendant’s deposition had disclosed, that he was in the military service of the United States from February 19, 1952, to December 1, 1953; that the plaintiffs were without knowledge of the defendant’s whereabouts between February 12, 1953, and May of 1955, although diligent search for him had been made by them and on their behalf; and that the defendant sought actively to conceal his whereabouts from the plaintiffs both during his period of military service and thereafter. The plaintiffs also averred that, as a consequence of negotiations, an understanding was reached on May 19, 1953, between plaintiffs’ attorney and a person acting as agent for both the defendant and his insurance carrier that no further action was to be taken until the defendant returned from active military service and made his whereabouts known to the plaintiffs.</p>

On May 19, 1959, the court entered judgments on the pleadings for the defendant as to so much of the plaintiffs’ complaint as claimed damages for personal injuries to the wife, leaving standing that part of the complaint which claims damages for property loss to the husband’s automobile. It is those judgments from which the plaintiffs have appealed.</p>

This statutory provision is without direct bearing on the issue here involved since the plaintiffs filed their praecipe for a writ of summons against the defendant on September <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>29, 1952, which was within two years of the happening of the accident. The statutory period of limitation becomes important, however, by analogy and furnishes the basis for the rule decisionally promulgated by this court with respect to the period of time within which a plaintiff must act to protect the efficacy of a writ of summons issued but not served.</p>
    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[248,740,1161,1253]]]'>Prior to the adoption of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, we held on a number of occasions that, when a statute of limitations required an action to be brought within a specified period of time and such an action was instituted by the issuance of a writ of summons against the defendant which was not served, the plaintiff could continue process to keep his cause of action alive by the issuance of an alias writ of summons, but that he had to do so within a period of time which, measured from the issuance of the original writ, was not longer than the time required by the applicable statute of limitations for the bringing of the action, and that subsequent pluries writs of summons had to be issued within the same period of time measured from the issuance of the preceding writ. <em>Mayo v.

Specifically, Rule 1010(b) provides that “A writ may be reissued ... at any time and any number of times.” This Rule is inadequately worded and its language must be construed by reasonable interpretation. The <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>same limitation is to be applied to the time in which a writ of summons may be <em>reissued </em>as was formerly applied for <em>the issuance </em>of an alias or pluries writ, i.e., a writ of summons may be reissued only for a period of time which, measured from the date of original issuance of the writ, or the date of a subsequent re-issuance thereof, is not longer than the period of time required by the applicable statute of limitations for the bringing of the action.

If this contention be correct, then the filing of the appellants’ complaint comes within two years after they had filed their praecipe for the issuance of a writ of summons against the defendant; and, so, the requirements of the rule having thus been satisfied, the cause of action for damages for personal injuries remains viable.</p>

The opinion of the court below discusses at length the testimony whereon this contention is founded and justifiably concludes on the basis of the testimony of the plaintiffs’ own attorney (whom the court specifically accredited) that he had not been misled into not filing the plaintiffs’ complaint within the current two-year period by any talk of possible settlement in his conversations with the defendant’s agent. Brief reference to the facts, as set forth in the opinion of the court below, will readily confirm the correctness of the <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>court’s conclusion in this connection: “On December 5, 1952, one Mr. Gocklin, an adjuster for the defendant’s insurer, met Judge Gardner, then — and now— counsel for plaintiffs,” the possibility of settlement was canvassed by them, the adjuster saying, inter alia, “We will settle. It’s only a question of how much.” The importance of the “how much” to any possible settlement is dramatized by the fact that the plaintiffs were demanding $5,000 and the adjuster offering $200. “Judge Gardner candidly stated that a few days later the adjuster informed him they would not settle and that he then told the adjuster, Well then, I might as well file a complaint.’ ” From this, as well as other confirmatory facts, the court below concluded that since this testimony “. . . comes from so reliable a witness as Judge Gardner and since it is uncontradicted, we assume that plaintiffs have stated their best case . . .”</p>
    <p id="b317-3" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[155,1362,1146,482]]]'>We agree with the reasoning of the court below that the plaintiffs failed to make out a case for the tolling of the decisionally long-established limitation of the time within which a plaintiff must act to continue process in an action once begun and service on the defendant has not been had and that, therefore, the cause of action for damages for personal injuries to the wife plaintiff and consequent loss or damage to her husband, is barred.</p>
