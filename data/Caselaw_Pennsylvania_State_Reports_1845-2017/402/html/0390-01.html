    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.7",412,[255,479,1155,924]]]'>Anthony Gaudio,. truck driver, daily patrolled the Pennsylvania Turnpike looking for disabled automobiles to offer to their drivers the repair or towing facilities of his employer, Louis Rosenberg, individually and trading and doing business as Rosenberg Auto Parts Company. During weekends and holidays, business was brisk because of the strange but unhappily true association between festive day and automobile wrecks, but on other days Gaudio traveled the highway in monotony and loneliness. To overcome the tedium of this solitary vigil, he adopted the practice of taking along as passenger some member of his family. He would also pick up soldiers thumbing a ride home or to camp. Sometimes, and as often as four times a week, friends would accompany him. He explained that by having companions, “you at least had some conversation to keep you occupied.”</p>
    <p id="b412-6" data-blocks='[["BL_412.8",412,[249,1420,1156,430]]]'>On August 27, 1957, he had for his companion of the day his nine-year-old cousin, Jimmy Phillips, who was injured in an accident which is the subject of this litigation. The boy’s parents, in the boy’s behalf and in their own right, brought suit in trespass against Louis Rosenberg. The action resulted in a compulsory non-suit. On refusal of a court en banc to lift the nonsuit, the plaintiffs appealed.</p>

At noontime he took Jimmy to a wayside restaurant and then, having lunched, they set off to look at a disabled Buick which had been abandoned at a point close to the Gateway Interchange in Beaver County. Since this wreck was beyond immediate repair, Gaudio prepared to tow it to his employer’s repair shop. He told Jimmy to get out of the truck and stand close to the wrecked Buick to advise him as he backed toward the front of the car. At the trial Gaudio testified that he instructed Jimmy: “I am going to back up to this Buick there, and you holler out when I am close to the bumper so I won’t have to get in the truck myself two or three times and try to back up and hit the bumper . . . Let me know when this plate touches the bumper.”</p>
    <p id="b413-5" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[124,1177,1147,597]]]'>Jimmy complied with instructions and “hollered” to his “Uncle Tony” to stop at the appropriate time. Gaudio then dismounted from the cab of the truck and got under the front of the Buick to attach the lifting chains which were controlled from the crane in the body of his own truck. While he was doing this, Jimmy got back into the truck and put on a pair of red canvas gloves he found in the cab. He then took up a position beside the tripod from which suspended the pulley through which the steel cable passed during the operation of the lifting apparatus.</p>

He was in full view of Gaudio who, having now attached the chain to the disabled Buick, advanced to the towing truck and pulled the lever which threw the lifting mechanism into gear. The cable at once began to rise rapidly toward the pulley. Jimmy’s hand went with it and jammed into the pulley, and in an instant Jimmy’s thumb was torn from the rest of his hand. He cried out: “Uncle Tony, my thumb!” Gaudio leaped to throw the machine out of gear, but in the meantime the boy had not only lost <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>Ms thumb but suffered other injuries. He was taken to a hospital by ambulance.</p>
    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.4",414,[245,471,1152,751]]]'>The lower court, in entering a compulsory nonsuit, pronounced Jimmy Phillips a trespasser and, therefore, not entitled from Gaudio to the care which otherwise would be the norm expected of any person handling a dangerous instrumentality in the presence of others. But Jimmy’s status, as he rode with Gaudio and then cooperated with him at the scene of the accident, was not so definitely fixed by testimony that the court could declare as a matter of law that he was a trespasser. And even if Jimmy were a trespasser, he would still have the right to press for a verdict if he could show that Gaudio’s conduct Avas such as to come within the rule of responsibility for wilful and wanton misconduct.</p>
    <p id="b414-6" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[237,1242,1157,914]]]'>In the case of <em>Slother v.

This Court reversed the nonsuit and sent the case back for a new trial, Mr. Justice Linn stating: “It may be that plaintiff will produce evidence from which the jury may find that the driver had implied authority to invite plaintiff to ride on the truck. If that shall appear to have been the fact, the defendant’s liability for the driver’s negligence Avill follow on familiar principles. On the other hand if no authority to bind the defendant is shown and the jury finds the plaintiff to have been a trespasser injured by the driver’s wanton misconduct in the management of the truck after plaintiff’s protest, another question Avill arise.”</p>

It is not enough to say, as the trial court said: “In the testimony there is no evidence of authority from defendant to <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>transport others in the track, except those with whom defendant was doing business. There ai»e no circumstances which might warrant an implied authority by acquiescence. We conclude that minor plaintiff was a trespasser as to defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b415-3" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[127,634,1148,651]]]'>It was not necessary, in order to prove that Jimmy was legally on the track, that the defendant had given specific authority to Gaudio to take his cousin on the ride with him. The lonely nature of Gaudio’s work invited companionship. The jury could infer from the circumstances that the defendant knew this. Gaudio freely admitted that he transported relatives, friends and soldiers who asked for a lift. The defendant’s firm was not so large and its operations not so extensive that the practices of his five or six drivers would not become a matter of common knowledge to those handling the affairs of the concern for him.</p>
    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[126,1298,1146,154]]]'>The lower court said: “In that evidence there is no indication that defendant knew or should have known of the presence of the boy.”</p>
    <p id="b415-5" data-blocks='[["BL_415.6",415,[122,1464,1150,474]]]'>But liability would not have to be predicated on actual knowledge by the defendant (we presume the lower court means Louis Rosenberg himself) of Jimmy’s presence on the Gaudio track. Nor would an order given by the defendant firm to its employees not to ride extraneous passengers exclude liability if there is evidence that the order was not adhered to and that by continuing non-fulfillment it actually became a dead letter.</p>
    <p id="b415-6" data-blocks='[["BL_415.7",415,[119,1961,1151,420]]]'>The evidence shows that Gaudio’s immediate superiors in his work were Joe Bushless, the shop foreman of the firm, and Morry Flam, who was in charge of the repair work done on disabled cars. Both these men knew that Gaudio hauled riders. Gaudio testified: “Q. Did Mr. Flam, to your knowledge, ever see any of the people you brought down there in your tow truck? A. He would walk out to the tow truck.”</p>

      <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>Gaudio said further that sometimes when he had “kids” on his truck, Mr. Flam would ask him to take the children to the bus station or train station: “. . . sometimes, if it-was late or they had a few kids and there was nobody there at the garage to take them to the Brodhead Hotel or to the bus station or train station, Mr. Flam would ask us if we would take five minutes and run down that way and then go out to the Turnpike. Q. Mr. Flam would ask you to run them down to the hotel or train station? A. If we weren’t busy and there was nobody in the garage to do it.”</p>

Justice Kepi-iart, writing for the Court, said: “To sustain a recovery, under these circumstances, it should appear that the act of the driver in permitting the boy to ride, was fairly within the scope of his employment. ... If he so acted, the master owed a duty through his agent to see that no negligent act should happen that might injure the invitee. The test is not that when the invitation was given, he was engaged in the course of his employment in his master’s business, but was the invitation or its consequences in furtherance of the master’s business, so that it might be said to be impliedly within Ms authority?”</p>

It will be recalled that G audio testified that if Jimmy were not on the ground telling him when his truck was coming into contact with the front of the Buick, Claudio would have had to get out of Ms truck two or three times.</p>

Super. 545" data-case-ids="735271" data-case-paths="/pa-super/183/0545-01">183 Pa. Superior Ct. 545</a>, a theater usher injured a patron when he struck Mm over the head with a flashlight. In the ensuing suit against the theater owner it was argued on behalf of the defendant that the usher’s act was wholly beyond the scope of his employment and, therefore, there could be no respondeat superior. The Superior Court quoted the general rule that “A master is liable for the tortious acts of his servant done in the course of his employment and within the general scope of his authority,” and then pointed out that “whether the particular act is within the scope of employment ordinarily presents a question of fact for the jury.” The Court held that the litigated case had to be governed by the general rule: “The usher’s conduct in the situation under consideration was not so ‘shocking and a gross abuse of all authority’, his use of force was not ‘so excessive and dangerous, totally without responsibility or rea<a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>son’, . . . that appellant should be relieved of liability as a matter of law.”</p>

In sustaining a verdict returned in their favor, this Court held that although the children were trespassers, they were entitled to be protected from wilful and wanton negligence on the part of the railroad employees. The locomotive engineer involved in the accident has testified that he looked ahead but did not see the boys. This Court, speaking through Justice (later Chief Justice) Steen, said: “The jury did not have to accept Gravely’s statement that he did not see the boys, because it is a well settled principle of law based on ordinary human experience that ‘one cannot be heard to say that he looked and did not see when the facts show he must have seen’ ... In other words, while it is not sufficient to prove that defendant’s employee could have seen had he looked, the inference may be drawn, and is indeed inescapable, that he did in fact see if he admits that he did look and if from the other testimony it appears that looking enabled him to see. As the train in the present case was moving upgrade along the spur track at only five miles an hour, it was for the jury to say whether or not there was time to stop it under the circumstances.”</p>

In the <em>Borzik </em>case, Borzik was hired by defendants as a salesman whose territory covered numerous states. Defendants gave Borzik one of their automobiles to drive in furtherance of their business. He was also allowed to drive it for his personal pleasure. On the evening of the accident Borzik picked up the plaintiff, his girl friend, at the place where she worked and drove to a night club, hoping to sell a car to the owner of the night club. Before arriving at his destination he collided with another automobile. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that Borzik was on his master’s business and that the collision was due to his negligence. Plaintiff further proved that at times she assisted Borzik in delivering the defendants’ cars and that defendants knew plaintiff had ridden with Borzik in the past when he went to see prospective customers, and did not object. Nevertheless the Court held that the presence of Borzik’s friend in defendant’s car at the time of the collision was <em>not in furtherance of the employers’ business, </em>and the evidence was not legally sufficient to impose liability upon Borzik’s employers.</p>

      <em>Borzik v. Miller </em>is a far stronger case for plaintiff than the instant case.

Since plain tiff was a trespasser, it is well settled that defendant would be liable only if Gaudio the driver was guilty of wanton negligence in injuring his young cousin. Gaudio after taking Phillips to lunch went to tow a Buick which had broken down and was on the berm of the Turnpike. He stopped his tow truck about ten feet in front of the Buick. He told Phillips to let him know when his plate touched the bumper. When Phillips hollered “Ho”, Gaudio stopped his truck and got out to put the crane into operation. He then said to Phillips “Get out of the way; I don’t want nothing to happen — stand clear.” Phillips got out of the way and <em>stood on the ground and clear of the truck and the Buick. </em>Gaudio lay down under the Buick and hooked up his chains to the frame of the Buick; this took about 10 to 15 minutes. Phillips was still standing on the ground. Phillips testified that after Gaudio started to hook the truck on to the frame of the Buick, “He told me to get out of the way . . ., so I stepped out. ... I went up to the front and got a pair of gloves, . . . put them on, . . . Then I went around back of the truck, . . . climbed up onto the [back of the] truck, . . . holding on to the cable, . . . to see how he [Gaudio] did it [hooked the Buick]. . . . [I was] about two or three feet away . . . and when the cable started to move my hand got caught in the thing.” From the time Gaudio started hooking the chains on to the frame of the Buick he didn’t see Phillips again until after the accident, although if he had looked up from his work he undoubtedly would have seen him.</p>

      <em>“e. . . </em>wanton misconduct is something different from negligence however gross, — different not merely in degree but in kind, and evincing a different state of mind on the part of the tortfeasor. Negligence consists of inattention or inadvertence, whereas wantonness exists where the danger to the plaintiff, though realized, is so recklessly disregarded that, even though there be no actual intent, there is at least a willingness to inflict injury, a conscious indifference to the perpetration of the wrong:’ Kasanovich, Admrx. v. George, <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>et aL, Trustees, <a href="/citations/?q=348%20Pa.%20193" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="348 Pa. 193">348 Pa. 193</a>, 203, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20A.2d%20523" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="34 A.2d 523">34 A. 2d 523</a>. ‘. . . the cases in which, wanton misconduct was found to exist were those in which the tortfeasor <em>had actual knowledge </em>of a victim’s peril but nevertheless pursued his tortious course with utter indifference to the outcome’: Engle v. Reider, <a href="/pa/366/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="366 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="8845631" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0411-01">366 Pa. 411</a>, 418, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20621" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="77 A.2d 621">77 A. 2d 621</a> (Italics supplied). Therefore there is nothing’ in this ease to bring the plaintiff within the protection of the rule as to wanton misconduct. The most that can be said is that the engineer’s failure to see the truck was the result of careless inattention, thus convicting Mm of negligence. There is no evidence that defendant knew that plaintiff was in a position of danger. There were no proven facts to permit the jury to find that the 'engineer, from the facts known to him, should have realized the imminent danger . . . and, with a conscious disregard of the consequences of his act, he operated Ms train and permitted it’ to collide with the truck: Turek v.
