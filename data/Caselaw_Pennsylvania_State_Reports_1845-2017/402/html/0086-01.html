Murosky as a passenger, was operating his vehicle in an eastwardly direction on II. S. Route 5 at about 10:00 p.m. on a rainy night. . . . Spaulding was operating Ms vehicle, . . . in the opposite or westwardly direction on the same highway. When Junod was at a point approximately 280 feet east of the ‘T’ intersection of Westwood Drive with Route 5, Ms vehicle came into contact with the Spaulding car, damaging it on the left front and left side. Jo nod’s vehicle was damaged on the right side. Junod testified that, as he approached the point of <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>impact, he was traveling about 35 miles an hour because, as he said, it was not safe to travel any faster because visibility was bad. As he approached the scene of the impact a vehicle came over the rise of the road ahead of him and its headlights created a glare which covered his entire windshield. Interpreting the movement of the oncoming car as angling toward his side of the highway, Junod applied his brakes. He testified that his car went into a spin and the accident occurred. Spaulding’s story was that he was traveling westwardly at about 20 to 30 miles an hour. He intended leaving the highway at about the point of impact in order to attend an open air movie theatre which was located to the north of the pavement some distance to the west of the scene of the collision. He testified that he first saw the Junod car on his side of the highway when it was some distance to the west of him. It returned to its own or south side of the highway and then it pulled directly across the road in front of him. Somewhere in the course of its travel across the highway it began to slide sideways and the two cars met on Spaulding’s side of the road. Marlene Graham, Spaulding’s passenger, corroborated his statement that the Junod car was on their side of the road at the moment of impact. One of the questions in the trial was whether there was a deposit of oil on Route 5 at and to the west of the point of impact. It was the theory of Junod that as he applied his brakes upon the sudden apprehension of danger created by the glare of lights on his windshield from a car which he thought was coming over to his side of the road, he went into a skid caused by the presence of oil on the road. This oil, it was claimed, had been tracked out onto the main highway by cars entering said highway from Westwood Drive, which had recently been oiled. The contact between the cars took place at a point 280 feet east of Westwood Drive . . .”</p>

The court’s opinion — written by Judge Laub and joined in by President Judge Evans and Judge Bossiter — stated, inter alia: “From this brief recitation of the facts, it can be seen that liability in either or both defendants was not clear” and that “an even balance, if not a preponderance, of the evidence indicates lack of liability on the part of the defendants”.</p>

Dissenting, Judge Latjb contended: (1) that the majority of the lower court, unsupported by any precedent, would allow the result of the first trial to control the result of the second trial, even though the Superior Court order required a trial de novo; (2) that the majority ignored the view that when a idaintiff appeals from a favorable award and obtains an <em>unrestricted, </em>new trial he “takes his chances on retrial of securing either a larger verdict or none at all”; (3) that the majority view conflicts with <em>Carroll v.

The statement of the Superior Court was made in connection with the question whether on the record the verdict was the result of a compromise on the question of negligence; it was not intended to render the ultimate question of liability the fact that the Superior Court ordered a new trial res adjudicata. That such be true is evident from generally, i.e. on negligence, contributory negligence <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>and damages. To find otherwise would create this unreal and anomalous situation; that even though the Superior Court conclusively found Spaulding and Junod negligent, it directed by its order that the jury at the second trial pass on that issue. The very language of the Court acknowledges that there could be “doubt” however “little” of Spaulding’s and Junod’s liability; the resolution of such “doubt” was within the province of the jury at the second trial and not within the province of the court as the mandate of the Superior Court made clear.</p>
