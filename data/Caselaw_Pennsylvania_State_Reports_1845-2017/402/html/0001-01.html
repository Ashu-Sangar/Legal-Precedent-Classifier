Both vehicles were proceeding westwardly toward Pittsburgh. The weather condition at the time and place of the collision was foggy, and the visibility was between 25 to 35 feet. Marciano testified that he was travelling at about 15 miles per hour when the rear of his vehicle was struck by the Truck Lines’ truck. Mrs. Grippo testified that, just prior to the collision, she heard a horn or motor or something but that she didn’t remember anything after the collision. <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>She did testify that the Marciano vehicle was moving forward when the collision occurred.</p>

While proceeding in this manner, Knipple and his son observed the two red rear lights of the Marciano vehicle which was stopped on the highway about 30 feet ahead. Knipple and his son testified that he brought his vehicle to a stop, 30 feet behind the Marciano vehicle, and then moved it to within fifteen feet of the Marciano vehicle. Knipple was getting out of the truck to see what Marciano had stopped for when he noticed Marciano’s car beginning to drift back toward the truck. Knipple then jumped back into the truck and “laid” on the horn until the collision occurred. On cross-examination, Knipple testified that he stopped his truck (travelling at 20 miles per hour) within 5 to 10 feet.</p>

In support of this position she cites the “Speed and Stopping Distance” chart in the Digest of The Vehicle Code of Pennsylvania (Revised October 1, 1956), compiled by the Department of Revenue which shows that, when a car is travelling 20 miles per hour, its minimum stopping distance, under normal conditions and ordinary circumstances, is 40 feet (22 feet of which are travelled while the driver is thinking to apply brakes). Appellant concludes, therefore, that the testimony of <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>the Truck Lines’ driver, relative to seeing the Marciano vehicle 30 feet ahead of him, and stopping within 5 to 10 feet without striking it, is incredible. While it is true that the driver testified that he first saw the Marciano vehicle 30 feet ahead of him, it is also noted that he testified both on direct and cross-examination that he stopped his vehicle 30 feet behind the Marciano vehicle. This conflict, if it was such, was for the jury to reconcile. Furthermore, while this court has twice approved the chart offered here,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> we do not feel that it is applicable or determinative of the present question under the instant facts and circumstances. First, the instant collision took place on a grade and not on a level road surface. Second, the instant case is not the normal type situation contemplated by the above chart in which the relaxed driver is suddenly confronted by an obstacle or dangerous condition. Indeed, the testimony of the driver shows that he was proceeding with caution and anticipated the very situation which confronted him and in this regard, it must be noted that, at the time he saw the Marciano vehicle, Knipple <em>had his foot already on the brake. </em>Under these circumstances, it is not for us to say that the Truck Lines’ version of the accident was incredible or unbelievable and, under these circumstances, the plausibility of Knipple’s testimony was for the jury.</p>

Both the premise and the conclusion of this contention are without merit. It was not encumbent upon the Truck Lines to proffer any reason or explanation for the conduct of the additional defendant, Marciano. Indeed, any reason or explanation of this conduct was peculiarly within the knowledge of Marciano or Mrs. G-rippo. Furthermore, the record also discloses that Enipple’s version of the collision was related to both Marciano and the investigating police officer at the scene of the collision.</p>
