Shortly before the hearing in Orphans’ Court on this claim plaintiff filed interrogatories, the pertinent ones asking for what consideration the note had been given and in what form, if not for money or its equivalent. The husband defendant answered that the consideration was the amount of money owed to defendant by the deceased; part was cash advanced and part was services rendered by defendant. At the time these interrogatories were asked and answered, plaintiff did not know that there was on record another judgment note, dated December 3, 1952, also for $29,987, given by defendant to decedent; this note had been recorded on January 21, 1953, and satisfied on January 29, 1954.</p>

The settlement was made on April 28, 1958, and approved by the Orphans’ Court.</p>

When the complaint in equity was filed, the orator also filed in Orphans’ Court a motion for a rule to show cause why the decree of that court should not be set aside and settlement of the note for $12,500 be rescinded for fraud. The Orphans’ Court took the position that the process was within the jurisdiction of equity and made an order withholding distribution until the equity proceedings were disposed of. This was error.

To what Judge Gibson has so well said we merely add that the title to the stock in question had passed to a decedent and was in his possession at his death. His executor, who now holds possession, is under the control and supervision of the Orphans’ Court. The title is being attacked as voidable because of material misrepresentations. The action to rescind is therefore exclusively in the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court and not in any court of general equity jurisdiction.”</p>

When judgment was confessed on this note against the husband defendant as its maker, that defendant brought forth the unrecorded note of decedent, as maker, for #29,987 and made claim. The Orphans’ Court allowed the #12,500 note to be settled for #3,000, the judgment on that note satisfied, and the Estate to be released by defendants from any and all claims whatever, ostensibly including the larger note as well. Having thus disposed of two notes, it is hard to see why the Orphans’ Court did not review the settlement after, as it is alleged, the revenue tax authorities turned up the matching note of #29,987 among defendant’s tax records. This was within its jurisdiction and not that of a court of equity.</p>
