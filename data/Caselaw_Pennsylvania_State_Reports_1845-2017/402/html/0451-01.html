L. 872, 18 PS §4701, are felonious. Such felonious killings are inherently malicious and without more qualify, if the supporting facts are believed beyond a reasonable doubt, as murder as a matter of law.</p>

It is unlikely that any trial judge would charge to such effect but would say straight away that these special varieties of killing were murder of the first degree. Putting these categories aside, therefore, there remain wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killings, which can be established as murder in the first degree, as we said, in <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>supra, by facts showing a specific intent to kill, and other killings committed with malice but without a specific intent to kill, which according to their circumstances would fit the definition of murder in the second degree; these various conclusions are reached by facts and inferences, not by any presumption.</p>
    <p id="b475-3" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[123,1139,1148,764]]]'>Charges to the jury about the presumption of second degree are often followed by the statement that the burden is on the defendant to lower the offense to manslaughter. The trial judge in the instant case first correctly said “until the contrary appears in evidence”, but later referred to the defendant’s burden. We disapprove the use hereafter of an instruction that refers to the defendant’s “burden”. A defendant has no burden whatever, and the word “presumption” may impress the jury as establishing the crime at the high level of second degree murder and requiring the defendant to present extenuating evidence; failing which the jury would, be required to convict him. No jury can be required to convict anybody of anything.</p>

Since there was only one degree of murder at common law, a presumption of malice was originally needed to separate an unlawful killing from one that was excusable or justified. But after our amendment to the wording of <em>Drum, </em>the word “felonious” at once required facts to make it op<a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>erate at any level and made any presumption on the subject irrelevant and misleading.</p>

Carluccetti, </em><a href="/pa/369/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="369 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1232336" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0190-01">369 Pa. 190</a> (1952), <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%20391" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="85 A.2d 391">85 A. 2d 391</a>, we said that “malice was directly inferable from the conduct of the perpetrator.” Any of these expressions is preferable to saying that malice is presumed, because of the danger that the word “presumption” will appeal to the jury as establishing guilt at a definite level instead of establishing a fact which, like any other fact, cannot be considered established until it has passed the test of belief beyond a reasonable doubt.

A jury can find an accused guilty of mui'der in the second degree if death was caused by a beating from fists: <em>Commonwealth v.
