      <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>The questions are whether the Workmen’s Compensation Act applies; whether the defendant was negligent and the plaintiff contributorily negligent; and whether the verdict was excessive.</p>
    <p id="b42-4" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[239,585,1152,487]]]'>The plaintiff worked for defendant as a light cleaner. The defendant’s property, on Neville Island, Allegheny County, was traversed by Grand Avenue, a public street, the plant lying south of it and a parking lot, marine ways, and other facilities of the defendant on the north in such a pattern that the parking lot was bounded on three sides by defendant’s property and on the fourth by the street. The accident happened in the parking lot.</p>
    <p id="b42-5" data-blocks='[["BL_42.5",42,[238,1083,1150,762]]]'>Plaintiff worked from 4:30 p. m. to 12:24 a. m. on June 30, 1955, having parked his car in the lot. This lot measured 210 by 420 feet, with a hard slag top, and the parking rows, with passageway between, ran north and south, as did a series of drainage ditches. These ditches began near the north side of the lot without depth and developed to the south. They were 5 to 6 feet wide and had 8-foot lengths of log bordering each side of each ditch: where there was depth in the ditches stringers had been placed across some of them and nailed to the logs, some of which were themselves anchored by spikes driven a foot into the slag on either side. The lot itself was fenced in but could be entered by openings in its eastern and western sides.</p>
    <p id="b42-6" data-blocks='[["BL_42.6",42,[235,1854,1155,486]],["BL_43.1",43,[153,357,1143,418]]]'>Plaintiff parked his car five or six rows in from the western entrance. When he returned after his shift there was enough light for him to see his way into the parking lot and along a passageway to the row in which his car was. From there to his car it got darker and darker as he proceeded, until it was “real dark”, so much so that although he was watching where he was going he couldn’t see one of the logs which had been displaced and was lying alongside his car. He. <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>tripped over it and slid into the ditch, where he sprained his ankle, bruised his shoulder, and acquired such back injuries that a laminectomy had to be done eventually in the hospital. He said that where he fell there were no stringers, and the pictures in evidence taken by him show areas of ditch without stringers and with logs apparently lying loose along the sides of the ditches.</p>
    <p id="b43-3" data-blocks='[["BL_43.4",43,[152,799,1145,430]]]'>There were nine or ten lights placed around the lot, and plaintiff was not sure how many were burning when he fell. A witness said that at the time of the accident there was no light standard within the coniines of the lot. There was only this one lot and on street parking was not allowed. Plaintiff had been using it for about four years, as there was no convenient form of transportation except by automobile.</p>

In <em>Young </em>the defendant’s plant was separated by a public street from the defendant’s parking lot where plaintiff was injured: the case is on all fours. In <em>Eberle </em>plaintiff slipped on a public sidewalk only 15 feet from the entrance of defendant’s plant. The claimant was denied the benefits of the Act in both cases, and in <em>Young </em>the Superior Court said: “In the present case it is obvious that the parking lot was not a part of the operating business; it was distinct therefrom and separated from defendant’s plant by a public thoroughfare. . . . The word ‘premises’ cannot be enlarged in its meaning and application so as to include land or property outside of that used in connection with the actual premises where the <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>employer carries on the business in which the employee is engaged. . . . The use of this facility was optional with each employee.”</p>
    <p id="b44-4" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[255,533,1153,535]]]'>We think that negligence and contributory negligence were for the jury. This is not the case of a foreign substance or a sudden defect of which defendant must have actual or constructive notice. It is rather the case of the adequacy of the defendant’s security provisions. It was admitted that there were no guards or attendants on the lot, and hence the failure to provide adequate light and to keep the logs from wandering either created or allowed a condition in which it was foreseeable that mischance could occur.</p>

But that rule is not applicable to the situation here disclosed. This is not one of the type of cases frequently met with where foreign substances, wholly unconnected with or unrelated to a floor, suddenly appear thereon with risk to passing patrons. Here the irregular ice pocket or ridge in the entrance-way was a likely and foreseeable result of the manner in which the rink and the passageway were being maintained to the knowledge of the defendant or, at least, <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>to the knowledge of responsible employees. Direct proof of the defendant’s knowledge or opportunity to know of the negligent condition was not, therefore, essential to the imposition of liability on the defendant.

      <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>Finally, we do not regard the original verdict as excessive. Special damages, in this case $2133.50, are not necessarily a reliable measure of pain and suffering or loss of earning power. There being no question that the accident caused the back injury, we have a doctor saying this, when asked if plaintiff’s current symptoms were permanent: “It is difficult to say. Often these symptoms will improve over the years and sometimes they will get worse over the years, so it is impossible to prognosticate the exact way that these backs will go. As a rule, a person of this type will have difficulty if he does a lot of heavy bending, lifting, becomes tired, becomes overly tense, that type of thing.” The only cure for such pain would be a spinal fusion, a drastic procedure which the doctor said “we don’t do unless we absolutely have to.” The doctor’s evidence clearly shows the future restriction on plaintiff’s range of activity if he is to escape pain and hence the extent of the loss of his earning power: he is forty-four years old. He has suffered personality changes already and was described as a tense and nervous person. He is therefore in the medical dilemma of doing light work and suffering loss of earning power, or of forcing himself to do the kind of work that will cause him future pain and suffering and risking a drastic operation.</p>
