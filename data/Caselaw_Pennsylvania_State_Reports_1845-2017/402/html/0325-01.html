The members of the crew went on strike, while at Portland, demanding that their term of service be reduced, their wages increased, and more favorable conditions of employment established. To voice their grievances, they picketed the vessel. Six days later they designated the Sailor’s Union of the Pacific, an American union, as their collective bargaining representative. The striking crew, or others acting for them, continued the picketing for almost a month. The day after the crew withdrew its picket line, the Sailors’ Union of the Pacific began picketing the ship.

Nikolos is owned by a Liberian corporation, was time-chartered for this trip by another Liberian corporation, and all members of its crew were aliens working under employment contracts made outside this country. There was no labor dispute between the ship’s employees and the ship. The Nikolos picked up a cargo of salt in Mexico and carried it to the harbor of the port of Tacoma, Washington, for delivery to an American consignee there. After the ship entered the Tacoma harbor it was met by the [American] union’s boat which began to circle around the Nikolos displaying signs marked ‘Picket Boat.’ Later an additional sign was put on the boat reading: ‘AFL-CIO seamen protest loss of their livelihood to foreign flagships with substandard wages or substandard conditions.’ The union threatened to extend its picketing to the consignee of the salt should an attempt be made to berth and unload that cargo.

The Liberian corporation which owned the ships was wholly owned by an American corporation. The Board said, in its ruling, that <em>“. . . </em>the Florida and Southern Cross may not properly be considered for jurisdictional purposes as foreign vessels. To be sure, they are nominally owned by Liberian corporations which pay a tonnage tax upon the ships to the government of Liberia and are registered under the laws of that nation.

This form probably first appeared in the law-merchant. The need for international understandings or agreements affecting trade on the waters of the deep became especially vital and necessary. Hence there gradually evolved the internationally recognized doctrine of freedom of the seas. This doctrine presented, from time to time, problems which were approached or decided differently by different Nations at different times to suit their particular interests at a particular time. If a variety of tests could be adopted with each Nation establishing or applying the test which it momentarily preferred, maritime trade would be stifled, if not paralyzed. Maritime and international trade could not and cannot wait until the stockholders or the holding companies or eventually the owner (as distinguished from the registered or record owner) can be ferreted out and/or determined by Court proceedings in one or in many Nations. Consequently Nations have sought a common sign which would be visible, and easily recognizable and understandable by everyone— the Flag.
