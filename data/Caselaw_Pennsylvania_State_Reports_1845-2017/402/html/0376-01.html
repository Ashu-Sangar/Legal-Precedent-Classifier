I had no indication from her, either from a spoken word or from a nod or headshake or anything like that that she understood what I was saying. . . .

And the only reason for your thinking so was because Mrs. Hahn ivas silent? The Court: No, I will answer it for him; the reference to him as the doctor. By Mr. ITeuges: Q. All right, that and the subsequent silence? A. Well, it was more than silence. There was a very unusual blank expression on her face. She kept turning her head from side to side, and she would look at me and she would look at Mrs. ITeilmann, and it is the type of expression that is commonly described as a blank stare. Q. I guess a lot of us are guilty of blank stares, aren’t we? A. Well, I guess we are, but I think under those circumstances it was an indication to me that she was not aware of what was going on. . . .

The Court : Did you ever go back to her and talk to her when she went to take up her residence with the Lienerts, to ascertain from her the circumstances under which she was living there? Mr. McCarthy: No, I didn’t. I could tell you why, if your Honor would like me to. The Court: Go ahead. Mr. McCarthy : In talking to Mrs. Lienert, Mrs. Lienert told me that she would take care of Mrs. Hahn even if she <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>never got anything for it, and I just assumed from that that I had time to let the situation work itself out and make sure that nobody was wrong in this situation. The Court: You should never delay the preparation of papers for elderly people. Mr. McCarthy : I wasn’t at all convinced — as a matter of fact, <em>I was completely convinced when I left there that Mrs. Hahn didn’t request this </em>be made up. I felt very strongly about it, and I can say honestly to you that the only reason why I didn’t announce on the spot that this can’t be, that evening — I didn’t say it in the presence of Mrs. Heilmann because I actually feared it would have a bad effect on her health, and might actually kill her, because she was a very sick lady. She died two months later, and I knew she was sick, and I knew how much she was looking forward to being relieved of the burden of Mrs. Hahn, and I felt if I just washed the whole thing out there, she might just pass out on the spot.

(2) Assuming,, arguendo, that their claim can in some undisclosed way be supported by the deed to the property, combined with a donative intent on the part of Mrs. Hahn, plus a delivery of the deed to one with instructions to deliver it to the Lienerts, the Lienerts fail to prove by clear, precise and convincing evidence even that kind of a claim. Mrs. Hahn never directed or requested her attorney, Mr. McCarthy, to deliver the deed to the Lienerts or to hold the deed for the Lienerts, either at the time it was executed or at any other time. (3) There was no evidence that Mrs. Hahn knew what she was doing at the time she signed the deed and Mr. McCarthy was convinced that she did not understand what she was doing. The above recited loose testimony of claimants’ witnesses does not satisfy their burden of proof; especially is this inadequate in the face of the clear positive testimony of Mr. McCarthy, corroborated in material respects by Mr. Herold.</p>

Neither the law nor equity (one-third of decedent’s property for two months’ care) support the Lienerts’ present claim. I would remand the case to the Orphans’ Court with directions to open the adjudication and allow the Lienerts to present testimony in support of their claim for bed, board and care.</p>
