        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Chief Justice Jones,\nThe defendant was found guilty of murder in the first degree by a jury\u2019s verdict which fixed the penalty at death. The court en banc granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground that the aggregate of untoward events happening at trial, including emotional outbursts by the bereaved husband of the homicide victim, the introduction in evidence of bloody color slides and the fact that the jury was drawn from a panel which had previously heard the defendant plead guilty before a three-judge court, \u201ccreated such an inflammatory atmosphere that the jury\u2019s determination may well have been based upon other than the substantive factual evidence introduced.\u201d The Commonwealth has appealed and ashs us to reverse the order granting the defendant a new trial and to direct that judgment of sentence be entered on the jury\u2019s verdict.\nThe most important question of law involved is as to the Commonwealth\u2019s right to appeal in the circumstances. It is only where the question involved is purely one of law that the Commonwealth may appeal from an adverse ruling in a criminal case, for example, where a new trial is granted to a convicted defendant on the sole ground that the introduction of certain evidence at his trial was prejudicial error (Commonwealth v. Antonini, 165 Pa. Superior Ct. 501, 69 A. 2d 436); or where an indictment has been quashed or judgment arrested after verdict of guilty (Commonwealth v. Wallace, 114 Pa. 405, 411, 6 Atl. 685); or where the defendant\u2019s demurrer to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence has been sustained (Commonwealth v. Thomas, 382 Pa. 639, 117 A. 2d 204, overruled on other grounds in Commonwealth v. Redline, 391 Pa. 486, 508-509, 137 A. 2d 472). Where, however, the reason for the action of the trial court, whereof the Commonwealth complains, is based upon an admixture of law and fact, the Commonwealth is without any right of appeal therefrom: Commonwealth v. Hartman, 383 Pa. 461, 462-463, 119 A. 2d 211; Commonwealth v. Dolan, 155 Pa. Superior Ct. 453, 455, 38 A. 2d 497.\nHow an appellate court, with only an inanimate record in cold print before it, could possibly be expected to sense, gauge, and justly appraise the atmosphere prevailing in the court below at the time of trial and thereupon competently determine whether or not attending circumstances at trial were prejudicially inflammatory, it is impossible to perceive. Obviously such an inquiry involves primarily a factual question which lies peculiarly within the province of the trial court to resolve. From that court\u2019s conclusion based, as it necessarily is, on fact as well as law, no right of appeal exists in the Commonwealth.\nAppeal dismissed at the cost of the Commonwealth.",
