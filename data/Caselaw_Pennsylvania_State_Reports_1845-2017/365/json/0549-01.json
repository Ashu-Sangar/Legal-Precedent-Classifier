There is no statute empowering a Court of Quarter Sessions to padlock premises because they happen to be occupied or used by persons accused of crime; and no such power inheres in the court otherwise. A writ of prohibition to abate the continuing wrong of the order entered below is appropriate: see McNair\u2019s Petition, 324 Pa. 48, 64, 187 A. 498. The writ will therefore issue as prayed for.",
