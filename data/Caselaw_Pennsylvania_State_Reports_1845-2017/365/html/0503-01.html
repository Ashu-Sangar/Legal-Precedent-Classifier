    <p id="b563-6" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[171,1012,1155,1079]]]'>The facts are as follows: On the morning of October 27, 1945, minor plaintiff, a child of eight years of age, was playing on the sidewalk with several other children, at the corner of Rose Street and Edson Avenue, in Johnstown. Defendant was driving his truck, loaded with coal, in a northwesterly direction along Rose Street towards Edson Avenue, which intersects Edson Avenue at a right angle. According to defendant’s testimony, he stopped at the stop sign on Rose Street and proceeded around the corner in a northeasterly direction into and along Edson Avenue. The minor plaintiff was standing on the sidewalk near the rounded curb line, partly facing the direction from which defendant’s truck was proceeding. He testified that while standing close to the curb he felt a hard blow on his shoulder. The next thing he remembers was that he was lying on the street near the curb and the rear wheels of the truck were coming at him. He was not run over by the wheels but was wedged between the tire of the rear dual wheel and the curb.</p>

Defendant was engaged in turning a corner. The road into which defendant was turning was approximately 24 feet wide. There was uncontradieted testimony that in order to have driven any further away from the sidewalk where the children were playing, it would have been necessary to drive against traffic over the far curb of the street into which the truck was turning, or at least to miss it by a few inches. Defendant was not required to keep his eyes continually and solely on these children, after the front of his truck had passed them and they no longer could be seen from the driver’s seat. Otherwise, the driver would become the insurer of plaintiff’s safety. In the foregoing circumstances, we agree with the learned court below that it committed an error of law. A jury may not speculate how far removed in the highway a vehicle should travel while passing children playing on the sidewalk.</p>
