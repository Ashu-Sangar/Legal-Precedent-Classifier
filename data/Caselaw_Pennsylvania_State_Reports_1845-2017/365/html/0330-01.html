Accepting only those not in dispute, it appears from the averments in the numerous pleadings filed, the exhibits thereto attached, and the testimony taken at the hearing in the court below, that, over the course of several years, employes of the City of Pittsburgh, with the connivance and even by the express direction of certain city officials, have been using for private purposes materials belonging to the city and labor paid for by the city. The first revelation of the existence of such illegal practices resulted from the happening of an accident to a truck in which a city employe, then working on city time and for city pay, was killed while being <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>transported in a neighboring county for the purpose of working on a building there being constructed for a city official, and the truck was carrying a load of cement belonging to the city to be used on private property. This occurred on April 26, 1949, and the attendant facts and circumstances presumably became matters of public knowledge. However, no action was taken by anyone nor was any general interest apparently aroused until April 25, 1950, when the present Attorney General, then a private practitioner, instituted a suit against the corporation which owned the truck and against several individuals to recover damages for the employe’s death on behalf of his widow and children, and also filed a claim against the city for workmen’s compensation. A public agitation thereupon began for an official investigation of the probable extent to which city employes and officials had been criminally appropriating to their own use property of the , city and labor of its employes, in violation of their public trust. The local newspapers published vigorous articles and editorials demanding such a probe and calling on the District Attorney to act through the medium of a grand jury investigation; civic organizations made similar demands, and both they and the newspapers began vehemently to criticize the inaction of the District Attorney and to suggest'that the Attorney General’s office should take matters in hand. At first the District Attorney reputedly said, in substance, that he was not interested and that he did not think a grand jury investigation was necessary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The City Solicitor, under obvious legal handicaps, made an in<a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>vestigation, and the City Controller likewise started one but discontinued it because he could not compel the attendance of witnesses and because in a councilmanic investigation which began on June 13, 1950, and lasted until June 22, 1950, evidence of misuse of city labor and materials was presented against himself. At the conclusion of their investigation Council filed a report on June 30, 1950, which merely recommended the dismissal of two city employes — not their criminal prosecution — and censured two city officials. It may parenthetically be noted that during the course of this councilmanic inquiry a city clerk committed suicide after stating to his wife that, at the direction of his official superior, he had falsified public records bearing on these matters.</p>

However, the court granted the District Attorney’s petition and summoned the grand jury to report on July 10, 1950, for the purpose of the proposed investigation, and the District Attorney then assigned county detectives to assist in obtaining evidence and issued subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses.</p>

To this petition the District Attorney filed an answer; the Attorney General filed a replication, the District Attorney a rejoinder, and the Attorney General a sur-rejoinder. The Court below held a hearing, took some testimony, and entered an order holding that the Attorney General had abused his discretion in superseding the District Attorney; the super-session was accordingly vacated, the Attorney General’s petition for the revocation of the order summoning the grand jury was dismissed, and the District Attorney was directed to proceed forthwith with the grand jury investigation. From this decision the Attorney General now appeals to this Court. It may be added that following the hearing in the court below but before the announcement of its decision the District Attorney filed an amended petition for the summoning of a grand jury in which he now stated that he had acquired definite knowledge from his own investigations and from testimony given at the councilmanic investí<a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>gation that certain employes and <em>elected officials </em>of the City of Pittsburgh committed a series of unlawful acts and conspired to cheat and defraud the city; a summary of that testimony was set forth and averments made to meet the requirements of the decisions of this Court previously referred to.</p>

How did the situation reasonably appear to him as justifying the action which he took? He saw that a grave situation existed in which revelations of criminality on the part of some city employes and officials indicated the possibility, if not the likelihood, of a widespread misuse of public property, and faithlessness in the performance of public duties. He saw that thereby the confidence of the citizenry in the integrity, at least of those in charge of the department of city government in which such criminality had been shown to exist, was being dangerously undermined. He saw that during the year ensuing after the accident of April 26, 1949, no investigation had been made by the agencies of law enforcement as to the reason for the presence at that time and place of the city employe who was the victim of the accident and as to the mission on which he was engaged. He saw that even after the institution of the suit at law and the filing of the claim for workmen’s compensation, when the newspapers and the public generally came to sense the seriousness of the situation, nothing was promptly done in the way of official investigation except by the City Solicitor, limited in her power, by the City Controller, similarly limited and with himself under attack, and by the City Council, a legislative body without power, of course, to enforce the criminal law. He saw that the continuing delay might result in the loss of evidence through departure or death <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>of witnesses (one of whom, as already stated, did commit suicide) and even in the barring of prosecutions by the statute of limitations. He saw that it was not until June 30, 1950, after clamor by citizens and by the public press and after there were intimations that he himself might assume office and intervene, that the District Attorney filed a petition for a grand jury investigation. He saw that that petition referred only to city employes, not to city officials, and that it was legally defective. He saw that, while the District Attorney could not properly request a grand jury investigation until he had obtained reliable evidence of the commission of a general series of crimes, the District Attorney had not attempted on his own behalf to obtain such evidence until the councilmanic inquiry began and had then merely sent county detectives to check on the testimony there given. In view of all these circumstances, which the Attorney General presumably weighed and considered, can it be said that he abused his discretion — that he acted arbitrarily, capriciously, unreasonably- — in concluding that, in the public interest and for the public welfare, it was desirable, proper, and even incumbent upon him to supersede the District Attorney in the investigation which the grand jury was to conduct? The court below was of opinion that his action was unjustified because the District Attorney had already obtained — though on a vulnerable petition — the summoning of a grand jury and thereby the object of the agitation had been accomplished. But this indicates a misconception of the real question, which is whether the District Attorney’s past attitude in regard to the need for a grand jury investigation and his apparent failure to proceed with the alertness, the zeal, the vigor and the aggressiveness which the situation so obviously required, did not fairly support a reasoned belief on the part of the Attorney General that the prosecution of these vitally important in<a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>qnisitorial proceedings should be conducted by the chief law officer of the State, whose function it is to see that the criminal laws of the Commonwealth are enforced, having the advantage of the use of the State police for that purpose. Whether or not the Attorney General’s discretion was <em>wisely </em>exercised is not for us to determine; it is <em>Ms </em>discretion which governs, not that of the court; the court is concerned only with the question whether its exercise was within the limits of the Attorney General’s <em>poioer </em>and was not an abuse of that power. It is our conclusion that it did <em>not </em>constitute such an abuse. Nor is this conclusion based upon the argument of the Attorney General — which we reject — that the District Attorney should be superseded because he belongs to the same political party as that presently in control of the city administration. Such a contention runs counter to the whole theory and spirit of our governmental institutions for it would mistakenly imply that partisan loyalties and subservience to party organizations are commonly paramount to respect for, and devotion to, the supremacy of the law.</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.4",397,[186,1454,1153,536]]]'>The proposition advanced on behalf of the District Attorney that supersedure of a local elected official by a State appointed officer is an infringement on the principle of home rule is wholly without merit. As already stated, the common law vests in the Attorney General that discretionary power. Moreover, the doctrine of home rule applies to the desirability of a municipality’s having freedom in the formulation of its own local legislation,- — ■ not to the enforcement of the criminal law <em>of the Commonwealth.</em>

It is sufficient to say in this regard that not only did the Attorney General withdraw as counsel in that litigation and from all representation of his client at the time he served the order of supersedure but, in any event, there was no conflict of interest involved in the attempt of his client to obtain such redress and the prosecution of city employes and officials for crimes allegedly committed by them. The same is true in regard to the representation at the councilmanic hearing of the widow of the city clerk who committed suicide, especially as the technical relation of attorney and client apparently never came there into existence.</p>

Even a cursory reading of the opinions in those cases will readily disclose that no question as to <em>common law </em>power in the Attorney General to supersede a District Attorney of his own motion was present for decision. Indeed, the matter had never been passed upon at common law for the all-sufficient reason that elected prosecuting officers were unknown to its political institutions. Ever since the creation of the offices of Attorney General and Solicitor General in England several centuries ago, prosecuting attorneys <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>(beyond the two officers just mentioned) have been and still are the Attorney General’s own appointees and, of course, subject to removal or super-session by him at his pleasure. Manifestly, no analogy can rightly be drawn between that system and the system which has obtained in Pennsylvania since the creation of the office of elective District Attorney by the Act of May 3, 1850, P.L. 654, Sec. 1, — an office later, and still, ordained by the Constitution of 1874 (Art. NIY, Secs. 1 and 2). The idea that a mere political appointee, beholden to his appointer and not to the people for his tenure, can, of his own volition, set aside and supersede a duly elected constitutional officer runs counter to even the most limited conception of the republican form of democratic government which this Commonwealth was established to secure and maintain and which the National Government is charged by the Federal Constitution (Art. IY, Sec. 4) to guarantee to every State.</p>

But, a majority of the court see fit to enter an order of reversal which automatically will constitute a <em>decision </em>that the Attorney General does possess such power by virtue of the common law when in his judgment such action is necessary. I shall not, therefore, prolong this opinion by further discussion of the basic legal fallacy in the majority’s action. However, it is not untimely to observe in passing, as did the learned court below, that “. . . the supersedure of a District Attorney by an Attorney General, in the exercise of his common law powers, is without precedent in the history of this Commonwealth.” And, to that, it may be added that <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>the threat thereby to the orderly processes of popular government is serious indeed.</p>

Minerd </em>and the <em>Dauphin County Grand Jury (No. 1) </em>and <em>(No. 8) </em>cases settled the law in this State that the Attorney General possessed common law power to supersede, of his own motion, an elected District Attorney, I submit that such power was completely extinguished by the Act of March 20, 1939, P.L. 8, in its repeal of the Act of July 30, 1938, P.L. 17, the latter being Act No. 3 of the Special Session of that year and entitled “An Act Defining the relative powers of the Attorney General and of district attorneys in investigations or proceedings in the criminal courts . . . .” The Act of 1938 conferred upon the Attorney General power to supersede and set aside, in his absolute discretion, the District Attorney of a County at any stage of an investigation or proceeding pending in the criminal courts of such County. It came before this court for construction in <em>Dauphin County Grand Jury Investigation Proceedings (No. 3), </em>supra, where it was flatly held that the discretion statutorily so conferred was, at most, a legal discretion and, as such, reviewable for an abuse. In other words, the power reposed by the Act was construed to be the same as the power possessed by the Attorney General by virtue of the common law as recognized in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. </em>Minerd, supra. In that connection, Mr. Justice Steen, speaking for this court, said with respect to the Act of 1938, — “It is obvious, then, that Act No. 3 merely confirms in statutory form the possession by the Attorney General of a power which had theretofore been enjoyed by him under the usage and traditions of the common law.” Thus, what had been deemed in the <em>Minerd </em>and <em>Dauphin County Grand Jury </em>cases, supra, as being a common law power of the Attorney General became by legislative adoption a part of the statute law of the State. <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>But, at the very next session of the General Assembly, Act No. 3 of 1938 was “repealed absolutely” by the Act of March 20, 1939, P.L. 8, so that what of the common law had been incorporated in our statute law by the Act of 1938, relating to the public officers named therein, was by positive and unmistakable terms eliminated therefrom by the Act of 1939.</p>

Indeed, the attitude of the law toward revival of prior law by a repeal of another law has been to restrict the rule of revival. For example, the common law rule that the repeal of a repealer revived the prior law was abrogated in England by statute a hundred years ago and many of the States of the Union have similar enactments: Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, §476, p. 679. With us, such legislative declaration is now embodied in Section 97 of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1019, which provides that “The repeal of a repealing law shall not be construed to revive the law originally repealed.” In any event, the scope of the repeal Act of 1939 is simply a question of legislative intent. If the legislature intended thereby to do less than completely obliterate any semblance of power in the Attorney General to supersede at his own discretion a District Attorney, why did it define the extent of the repeal by the most comprehensive term it could have used, namely, “absolutely” and not prescribe a substitute? Or, why did it bother at all to enact the repeal if concomitantly therewith the very same power from the common law would be revived? There is a legal pre<a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>sumption that the legislature did not intend a result so vain and absurd: see Section 52(1) of the Statutory Construction Act of 1937. The plain intent of the legislature by the repeal of 1939 was to make an end, once for all, of the idea that an appointed Attorney General could, of his own motion, supersede and set aside a duly <em>elected </em>constitutional officer. No other construction of that Act is reasonably deducible, especially, in view of the fact that it affects officers of government and their powers which, in this country since the change wrought by the Revolution, have been peculiarly matters of <em>written </em>law beginning with the Constitutions.</p>

The duty of establishing by proof a fact material to an inquiry ordinarily lies upon him who asserts it. Nor can the rule be otherwise where the Attorney General seeks to supersede of his own motion, by virtue of some common law power,' a constitutional officer charged by law primarily with the duty of signing “all bills of indictment, and conducting] in court all criminal or other prosecutions in the name of the commonwealth, or when the state is a party, which arise in the county for which he is elected . . .”: see Act of 1850, supra.</p>

Plainly enough, the first reason was unsubstantial and the learned court below justifiably found it so to be. The petition was amendable (see <em>Dauphin County Grand Jury Investigation Proceedings (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa/332/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="332 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="1186565" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0289-01">332 Pa. 289</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20783" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="2 A.2d 783">2 A. 2d 783</a>) and was actually amended upon leave of the court below. The Attorney General is in no position to complain of that. He had no vested private right in the continued maintenance of what he had asserted to be a defective petition. The other reason was wholly unsupported by any evidence and was left to rest entirely on the contention that because the District Attorney was a member of the same political party as some of the persons to be investigated, he would be recreant to the trust reposed in him by the electorate of the County. The learned court below found that reason to be invalid as does also the majority of this court because the “contention runs counter to the whole the<a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>ory and spirit of our governmental institutions . . . .” The delay charged against the District Attorney because he did not move for the institution of a grand jury proceeding until after the “Councilmanie probe” had been concluded was expressly found by the court below <em>not </em>to have been an improper exercise of judgment.</p>

The only evidence this record lacks is what the Attorney General failed to produce as support for his charge of political bias and bad faith on the part of the District Attorney. Thus, by ignoring the lower court’s competent findings, which are implicit, where not verbally detailed, in its comprehensive treatment of each of the reasons assigned by the Attorney General, the majority of this court usurp the province of the trial court and draw their own ultimate conclusion of fact that the Attorney General’s supersedure of the District Attorney was a valid exercise of his discretion.</p>

In the light of that pronouncement, is it not strange that “motivations” now become immaterial in the opinion of the majority?

What, then, is there left to support the majority’s opinion that the Attorney General’s order of supersedure was a proper exercise of his discretion?

Loss of public confidence, where it exists, is a fact; and who is in better position to determine whether such was the fact in the present instance than the three local judges of the court below who, with becoming judicial firmness, were able to stand steadfast against the “clamor by citizens and by the public press” to which the majority opinion makes reference as support for the Attorney General’s action.</p>

He apparently does not understand that the innermost feeling of any decent <em>elected </em>public officer is that he but enjoys for the time a power reposed in him by the people to be exercised by him with an eye single to the public interest.
