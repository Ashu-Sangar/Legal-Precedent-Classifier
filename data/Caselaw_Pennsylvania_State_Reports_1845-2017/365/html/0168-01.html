The purpose of the proceeding was to determine the validity of a compensation agreement between the insurance carrier, the employer and the widow of a deceased employe, within the terms of The Workmen’s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, as amended, 77 PS 1 et seq.</p>
    <p id="b227-3" data-blocks='[["BL_227.4",227,[178,627,1150,700]]]'>Workmen’s compensation, in essence, is a part of a social insurance plan which also includes old age and unemployment insurance. Its operation has proven of tremendous benefit both to employe and employer. The purpose of the Act is to afford a workman protection against injuries, and to give relief in case of accident by way of accident insurance in place of common law rights. Proceedings for the adjustment of compensation claims when the parties interested agree upon the amount payable, and the enforcement of liability in case of disagreement, are outlined in the Act. The methods adopted, the practice and procedure followed are contrary to the ordinary rules of the common law.</p>

The Workmen’s Compensation Board consists of a chairman and three members, one of whom, the Secretary of Labor and Industry, is an <em>ex officio </em>member who does not vote on orders, decisions or awards. The Act provides that jurisdiction of all cases arising under the compensation law is vested in these Referees and the Board. Such jurisdiction cannot be changed or enlarged by contract or consent.</p>

This petition will then be assigned to the Referee of the proper district and notice served upon the parties. The defendant must then file his answer to the petition with the Referee. After a hearing the Referee files his report Avith the department, and the case is reviewed by the Board which files its report. An appeal may then be taken to the court of Common Pleas. A further appeal may thereafter be taken to the Superior Court, and to the Supreme Court, if specially allowed. Appeals to the Superior Court, in these cases, are <em>regardless of the amount involved.</em>

Such agreements are specifically regulated both as to substance and form by the various statutes, and the agreements must be approved by the Department and filed therein.</p>

An action of mandamus was commenced by the widow in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, seeking to require the Director to approve it. The appellant, the insurance carrier, petitioned and was allowed to intervene in that case. Before a decision was rendered, the Director approved the agreement.
