The policy provides that “the insurance of any employee shall automatically cease upon the occurrence of any of the following (3) events” — one of which was “the cessation of premium payments on account of such employee’s insurance hereunder”. The last premium was paid for the insured on October 7, 1944, thus insuring her until <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>November 30, 1944. No other premium payments were ever made thereafter by or on behalf of the insured. Because of this failure to pay any premium after October 7,1944, the policy by its terms automatically terminated on November 30, 1944.</p>
