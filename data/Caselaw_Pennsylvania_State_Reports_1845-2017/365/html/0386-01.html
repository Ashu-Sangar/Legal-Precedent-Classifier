This Ordinance authorized the City to acquire a. fee simple title to Diamond Market House and the land on which it is erected, known as Diamond Square, and to sell the said property to the highest responsible bidder <em>for private use; </em>and steps were taken to consummate said sale. Plaintiffs filed a bill in equity to enjoin the proposed sale.

This square was laid out in 1784 in the original plan of the Town of Pittsburgh drafted by Colonel George Woods, surveyor, acting for John Penn and John Penn, Jr., the then owners of the land; and lots fronting on Diamond Square were sold pursuant to said plan. When the original plan of the Town of Pittsburgh was laid out, neither the City or Borough of Pittsburgh nor the County of Allegheny were in existence. There is no other specific evidence that this tract of land was dedicated as a public square or otherwise, or that there was a formal acceptance of a dedication ; however, it is agreed by the parties herein that because contemporaneous deeds refer to Diamond Square as a public square and because of the decision of Judge Stowe in <em>Holmes v. City of Pittsburgh, </em>35 P.L. J. 491, in 1888 <em>the law has conclusively presumed a grant from the original proprietor for public square purposes.</em>

Eighty years later the City leased said property, pursuant to a City Ordinance authorizing such action, to a private corporation at an annual rental of $1940. The Court sur a bill in equity by the owner of the fee in the land over which the street was laid out, restrained the City from using the land for other than highway purposes and declared the said lease void. The Court in its opinion said: “In the dedication of the street in question, the owner of the property apparently contemplated no use of the land within its limits, except for highway or other public purposes; at least nothing to the contrary appears in the record. Private property cannot be taken for private purposes and such would be the result in this case had the ordinance of the city authorizing a lease of the property been held valid. <em>Where land is dedicated for street purposes by the owner </em>and accepted by the municipality, such action is equivalent to a taking (10 R.C.L. 89, 91), and <em>the property so taken may not lawfully be applied to another and distinct purpose by the municipality unless it be a public use not inconsistent with its use as a highway. </em>In Sterling’s App., Ill Pa. 35, 40, we said: ‘By appropriating land for the specific purpose of a common highway, <em>the public acquires a mere right of passage </em>with the powers and privileges incident to such right. <em>The fee still remains in the landowner </em>notwithstanding the public have acquired a right to the free and uninterrupted use of the road for the purpose of passing and repassing; he may use the land for his own purpose in any way that is not inconsistent with the public easement.

In other words, the only servitude imposed on the. land is the right of the public to construct and maintain thereon a safe and convenient roadway, Avhich shall at all times be free and open for public use as a highway.’ In Dillon on Municipal Corporations, 5th ed., section 1176, it is said: ‘Not even the legislature can authorize the condemnation of private property for other than a public use; hence the appropriation of a street to a private purpose cannot be justified even by legislative authority’.”</p>
