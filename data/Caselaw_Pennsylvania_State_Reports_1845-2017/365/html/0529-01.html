Echón, Jr. on September 16, 1945, a clear day, about 5 o’clock p.m. entered upon a permissive crossing over appellant’s right-of-way at or near the boundary between the adjacent cities' of Arnold and New Kensington. At this point appellant company maintains two main tracks and two siding tracks running north and south. Decedent who was 46 years of age and in good health, was entering upon the crossing on the western side of the tracks. The eastern terminus of the permissive crossing was Constitution Boulevard at the foot of North Street. When decedent was about to cross the westernmost track, he fell forward upon the track. The cause of the fall is unknown. He remained prostrate. Thereafter<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the engine which had completed moving two cars southwardly over and past the permissive crossing toward a water tower located on the west side of the tracks south of the crossing approximately 200 to 225 feet away, commenced backing northwardly. The engine was moving at approximately 2 to 3 miles per hour and continued over the body of decedent, coming to a stop only after the locomotive had completely passed over the body, and Hawk, one of the brakemen riding the front of the engine noticed something hit the footboard on which he was standing and saw decedent’s body lying between the rails, whereupon he called to the engineer and signaled him to stop. There was no one riding the stirrup on the rear of the engine’s tender nor was there any employe of appellant deployed to determine whether there were any obstructions in the path of the engine as it proceeded to back, or persons who might have been using the permissive crossing at that time. Hawk testified that the bell was sounded “immediately after” the <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>engine started. However, the decedent was then already lying upon the track.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Appellee contends and the court below held that the one-year limitation contained in the Act of 1855 relating to the action for wrongful death is a statute of limitations which must be set up as a defense within the period prescribed by Rule 1045(c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, and, that there is sufficient evidence to sustain the verdicts of the jury.</p>

In that case, Section 315 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, 77 PS §602, provided that all claims for compensation in cases of personal injury should “be forever barred, unless, within one year after the accident, the parties shall have agreed upon the compensation payable under this article; or unless, within one year after the accident, one of the parties shall have filed a petition as provided in article four hereof.” It was there held that the limitation was a condition put by the law upon a substantive right.</p>

Rule 1030 of the Rules of Civil Procedure is made applicable to actions in trespass by Rule 1045(c). Rule 1030 provides: “The defenses of . . . statute of limitations and waiver <em>shall be pleaded </em>in a responsive pleading under the heading ‘New Matter’. Any other affirmative defense may be similarly pleaded.” (Emphasis supplied) Rule 1045(c) relating to actions in trespass provides: “The affirmative defenses enumerated in Rule 1030 <em>must be pleaded” </em>(Emphasis supplied) Rules of procedure are promulgated for the purpose of clarifying and making reasonably certain and expeditious the method of prosecuting a cause of action to final judgment. To achieve this desired end parties to an action must comply therewith. The extent <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>of power in lower courts to permit variances of the strict letter of the rule need not now be determined. It is sufficient in the instant case that in the circumstances presented, refusal to permit the filing of an answer 19 months after the service of a complaint cannot be said to constitute an abuse of discretion.

These two boys were the sole eye witnesses to the accident. They were sitting on a pile of asphalt west of the tracks and south of a public grade crossing of the railroad located about 100 yards north of the point where the permissive crossing led onto the railroad tracks. They first saw decedent when close to the westernmost track and saw him fall forward onto the track. Prior thereto they observed appellant’s switching engine push two cars southwardly over and past the permissive crossing toward a Avater tower. While at the tower the two cars were unhooked and the engine began moving backward toward the crossing. The engine started back <em>after </em>decedent had fallen upon the track. Uncontradicted testimony established the length of a car to be between 40 and 45 feet. The exact distance <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>from the crossing to the water tower was not given. Frickanisce estimated it to be about five car lengths which would make it from 200 to 225 feet. Gordon Buckley testified that when the engine stopped to unhook the cars it was pushing, “It wasn’t quite past the water tower.”, and that the rear end of the tender was then about four car lengths from the crossing. This would make the latter distance from 160 to 180 feet, Gordon Buckley’s testimony thus approximately conforms with Frickanisce’s estimate of the distance from the crossing to the tower since it was established that the over-all length of the engine and tender was 65 feet. At least it placed the engine and tender more than 100 feet from the crossing and beyond the “blind spot” appellant’s witnesses testified was produced by the tender when the engine was moving backward.</p>

The variations and asserted irreconcilable contradictions in the testimony of Gordon Buckley were matters to be considered by the jury and affected his credibility and the accuracy of his recollection. The same is true of the testimony of Norman Buckley who corroborated his brother Gordon as to how the accident happened but did not give or estimate any of the distances involved. Both boys stated that Gordon called and tried to attract the attention of the engineer as the engine was moving toward the crossing. Appellant’s proof of the existence of a “blind spot” 100 feet in length consisted entirely of oral testimony which could have been rejected by the jury. It is uncontradicted that decedent <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>was lying prostrate upon the track before the engine and tender started over the crossing.</p>

This contention ignores testimony that the engine was more than 100 feet away from the point at which he was killed and that it began to back only <em>after </em>decedent had fallen. The argument assumes that the jury believed appellant’s witnesses and disbelieved all others. Such presumption cannot be permitted here in view of the verdicts and any argument based thereon is untenable. Appellant’s further contention that decedent was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law for the reason that he ignored other safe ways of crossing appellant’s tracks and instead chose to use this permissive crossing is equally without foundation. The length of other suggested routes was not clearly established, although they were shown to have been circuitous. Adoption of appellant’s argument would effectively negative its established duty with regard to a permissive crossing <em>(Figard v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, </em>supra; <em>Francis v.
