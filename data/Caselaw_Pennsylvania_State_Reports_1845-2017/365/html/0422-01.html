Appellees filed preliminary objections to the complaint in mandamus asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the complaint established that the intended use of the premises was for religious purposes contrary to the effective rule of the board prohibiting granting of a permit for “any religious or sectarian purposes”.

W. Cramblet, assistant secretary of appellee school board, that it was impossible to grant the request in view of a rule adopted by the school board which provided: “Permits shall not be granted to anyone for any religious or sectarian purpose”; that denial to them and permission to others to have use of the same auditorium for public meetings constituted arbitrary discrimination, denying to appellants the right of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, as well as under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; that the laws of Pennsylvania provide for use <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>of school auditoriums as public meeting and assembly places upon application by responsible citizens and residents of the community where the school is located; that appellants’ request was in compliance with the statutory requirement; that appellees had a legal ministerial duty to issue the requested permit to appellants, but arbitrarily refused to do so; that denial to appellants of the requested permit amounts to an unconstitutional application of the Pennsylvania statute and authorizes said board to permit the use of schools in an unconstitutional manner; and, that appellants have no other adequate and complete remedy. <em>f</em>

This court is not a superboard of school directors in performance of an official duty. The legislature has delegated this power to the school boards, not to the courts.

They contend, however, that permission must be given to all or none, and that exercise of the power cannot be partial, but must be complete.

The complaint does not contain any averment that any group has been accorded use of the premises for religious and sectarian purposes. A finding that any other person or persons similarly situated has been permitted the use which has been denied to appellants could not properly be made. There is nothing in the complaint which would warrant a finding that the exercise of the power by the school board was unreasonable or arbitrary.</p>
