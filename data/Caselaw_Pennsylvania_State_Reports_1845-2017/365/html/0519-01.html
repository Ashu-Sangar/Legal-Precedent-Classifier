The enabling act permitting the sale is the Act of 1937, June 24, P. L. 2017, sec. 305, 62 PS sec. 2255 (c), as amended by the Act of 1949, April 21, P.

Sealed bids were received by them and opened on February 17,1950. The Baton Coal Company, the appellant, submitted a sealed bid of $177,500 which was the highest and best bid. The bid was accompanied by a certified check for $50,000 down money. The bid was accepted by the district. In pursuance to the Act of 1949, supra, the commissioners petitioned the Court of Quarter Sessions to approve the sale. A date for hearing was fixed by the court. Notice was given to all parties as well as by publication. At the hearing testimony was submitted by appellant that the amount of its accepted bid was fair and adequate and in excess of the “top fair market value” of the coal. Two offers were submitted to the court by prospective purchasers which constituted substantial increases above appellant’s bid. The court deferred approval or disapproval of the proposed sale in order that the commissioners should be given an opportunity for further consideration. At a subsequent hearing the commissioners reported that they had received a bid from one Dean D. Sturgis, Trustee, of $195,000 accompanied by a $50,000 deposit; another from Unity Coal Company for $196,-<a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>000 with deposit of $50,000 and had also received an additional deposit of $18,500 from appellant, to be paid to the district in addition to the amount of its bid of $177,500 (if confirmed by the court), or a total of $196,000. The court in banc thereupon refused to approve the proposed sale for the amount of appellant’s sealed bid of $177,500 and directed the Institution District to re-offer the coal lands for sale at a price not less than $196,000 in accordance with the procedure indicated in <em>McKees Rocks Borough School District </em>Petition, <a href="/pa/360/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="360 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="475032" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0285-01">360 Pa. 285</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.2d%2020" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="62 A.2d 20">62 A. 2d 20</a>.</p>

At the argument, appellant contended that unless the amount of its sealed bid was <em>unfair and inadequate </em>such bid must be accepted. This Court remanded the record in order to ascertain “whether or not the highest sealed bid . . . constituted a fair and adequate price for said property . . .” and directed that “. . . for present purposes, no consideration or effect [was to] be given the offers for the property made after the sealed bids were opened [and accepted]... .” In pursuance to such order, further hearings were had in the court below. The court in banc, in a unanimous opinion by President Judge Carr, said “. . . we now find as a fact that the sum of $177,500 did not at the time constitute a fair and adequate price.” With the entire record before us the case was reargued. The sole question is whether the court below properly exercised its discretion in refusing, in the above circumstances, to approve the sale to appellant for the amount of its sealed bid.</p>
