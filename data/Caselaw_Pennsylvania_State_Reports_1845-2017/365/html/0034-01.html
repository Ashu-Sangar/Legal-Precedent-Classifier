    <p id="b94-6" data-blocks='[["BL_94.8",94,[234,558,1149,305]]]'>On July 22,1925, L. Renton Brown and others (grantors), for the consideration of $4,000, conveyed real estate in the Borough of Bangor, Pennsylvania, to a corporation of the first class, not for profit, named Bangor Park Association (grantee). The <em>habendum </em>clause of the deed reads:</p>
    <p id="b94-7" data-blocks='[["BL_94.9",94,[234,883,1147,263]]]'>“For the exclusive use of the grantee hereof, its successors and assigns, of said premises, as and for a public park, for the use and benefit of the inhabitants of the Borough of Bangor, aforesaid, and to and for no other use or purpose whatsoever.”</p>
    <p id="b94-8" data-blocks='[["BL_94.10",94,[232,1159,1146,257]]]'>The stated corporate purpose of the grantee was: “The maintenance of a park and of facilities for skating, boating, and other innocent or athletic sports, to wit: basketball, football, baseball and others including a club for such purpose.”</p>
    <p id="b94-9" data-blocks='[["BL_94.11",94,[229,1429,1149,532]]]'>The grantee borrowed the entire consideration from a bank. Two years later it secured an additional loan of $1,000. The debt was reduced by payments on account. The bank failed and the plaintiffs herein were appointed trustees for the benefit of unsecured depositors and creditors of the bank. Suit was brought by the trustees upon the notes and judgment was obtained for $2,732.64. Execution was issued and the sheriff sold the real estate in question to the attorney on the writ, and the premises were deeded by the sheriff to the trustees.</p>

It is conceded that the original corporate grantee is no longer in existence; also since the date of the sheriff’s sale on <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>April 9,1938, and for several years prior thereto, the real estate has not been used for park purposes. The present proceeding was instituted to remove an alleged cloud upon the trustees’ title to the real estate.</p>
    <p id="b95-5" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[185,505,1148,426]]]'>The heirs and legal representatives of the original grantor were made defendants, who contend that the trustees possessed but a <em>dase fee; </em>that when the real estate ceased to be used as a public park, the base fee terminated and title <em>reverted </em>to the grantors or their heirs and representatives. Upon issue joined, the court below held that the trustees possessed a fee simple title and that there ivas no reverter. This appeal followed.</p>

It has likewise been held that when limitations are relied on to debase a fee they must be created by express terms or clear implication, a result of the policy of the law favoring alienability of land: Methodist Church v.

S. 383</a>, at 397, in construing quite similar title papers, is particularly appropriate: ‘If the grant be viewed as one merely to trustees to hold “for the uses and purposes mentioned in the act of the assembly,” it is clear that <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>the fee was not upon a condition subsequent nor one upon limitation. There are no apt, technical words (such as <em>so that; provided; if it shall happen; </em>etc.: 4 Kent Com., note b, p. 132; 2 Washburn on Real Property, p. 3) contained in the grant, nor is the declaration of the use coupled with any clause of reentry or a provision that the estate conveyed should cease or be void on any contingency. (Ib.) So, also, Ave fail to find in the patent the usual and apt words to create a limitation (such as <em>while; so long as; until; during; </em>&amp;c.: 4 Kent, Ib.), or Avords of similar import. And, for reasons already stated, if we disregard the absence of technical terms or provisions importing a condition or limitation, and examine the deed with a view of eliciting the clear intention of the parties, Ave are driven to the conclusion that it was the intention of the grantors to convey their entire estate in the land.’ See also Restatement, Property, section 44 and comments.

Craig, <a href="/pa/240/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="240 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="993205" data-case-paths="/pa/240/0137-01">240 Pa. 137</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.%20678" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="87 A. 678">87 A. 678</a>, and Slegel v.

Such language clearly imposes a duty upon the grantee to hold and use the property <em>for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Borough of Bangor. </em>These words create a charitable trust.

Comment (e) of Section 351 of the Restatement of Trusts reads as follows: “A charitable trust may be created although the settlor uses words of condition. If the owner of property transfers it inter vivos or by will ‘upon condition’ that it be applied for a charitable purpose, a charitable trust is created if the transferor manifested an intention that the transferee should be subject to a duty so to apply it, rather than that he should be divested of his interest if he should fail so to apply it. In the absence of other evidence a transfer of <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>property 'upon condition’ that it be applied for a charitable purpose indicates an intention to create a charitable trust rather than an intention to make a transfer upon condition.”</p>

It was held that as between the grantor and grantees there was a conveyance of a fee simple and that as between the grantees and the beneficiaries there was charitable trust enforceable under and subject to disposition in accordance with the general laws of the commonwealth.

In the first case the grantor and those claiming under him may enter for condition broken. But in the last they cannot, and the proper remedy for an abuse of the trust is an application to the chancery powers of the Court for an appointment of new trustees, or the means of compelling those already appointed to execute the trust according to the intention of the donors.
