The bids were sought on alternative bases under three numbered schedules, viz., Schedule 1. for the <em>furnishing </em>of the desired materials, Schedule 2. for <em>applying </em>them and Schedule 3. for furnishing <em>and </em>applying the specified materials. In the fore part of the proposal form, it was stated that in considering the “bids and award of contracts, the right is reserved, by the Commonwealth, to determine the awards to the best interests of the Commonwealth for <em>either; </em>Schedule 1, . . . Sched<a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>ule 2 . . . .or Schedule 3 ... or any combination of bids for Schedules 1, <em>2, </em>and 3 . . .” (Emphasis supplied). The proposal form stipulated that bidders under Schedule 1 “. . . shall be liable for car service, track storage, and truck transport layover charges, <em>except </em>in such cases wherein the layover is caused by weather conditions or due to instructions issued by representatives of the Department of Highways” and it further provided that “The successful bidder shall be liable for demurrage <em>only </em>in such cases where demurrage results in the contractor having not complied: with shipping instructions issued by the Department of Highways” (Emphasis supplied). That is to say, — on materials for which bids under Schedule 1 were accepted, the Commonwealth would assume a contingent liability for car service, track storage or truck transport layover and demurrage charges. Under Schedule 2, the proposal declared that “the successful bidder <em>shall not </em>be liable for car service, track storage or., .truck transport layover charges, and demurrage . . .” (Emphasis supplied). Wherefore, the Commonwealth by accepting bids under Schedule 2 would assume all contingent charges of the character specified. On the other, hand, Schedule 3 provided that “the successful bidder [thereunder] <em>shall </em>be liable for all car service, track storage or truck transport layover charges, and demurrage . ...” (Emphasis supplied), so that, for work and material accepted on bids under Schedule 3, the Commonwealth assumed no liability whatsoever for any additional contingent charges such as under Schedules 1 and 2.</p>

The telegrams concluded with “Letter follows.” On March 2, 1950, the Secretary of Property and Supplies, acting by the Assistant Director of Purchases (Highways), sent each of the plaintiffs a letter stating that “Tentative award of contract . . . has been made to your company for furnishing and applying bituminous materials as listed on the attached schedule.” The letter further stated that “This award is in accordance with your bid submitted on Proposal-Index Number H-4619, bid opening date January 30, 1950”, and that “This tentative award is subject to your compliance with the provisions of the proposal form which require that you submit a performance bond and a labor and material bond, each in an amount equal to 50% of <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>the estimated total amount of the award.” On the same day, to wit, March 2,1950, the Department of Property and Supplies returned to the unsuccessful bidders their security bid checks. .</p>

The letter specifically declared that “Contracts, for furnishing and applying bituminous materials for the period April 1, 1950, to March 31, 1951, <em>have been awarded </em>to: [seven named companies]” whereof the plaintiffs were two (Emphasis supplied). The letter further disclosed that all of the contracts had been awarded on the basis of bids under Schedule 3 which, as will be recalled, was the schedule that required the contractor both to furnish the materials and to apply them at the bid price without any liability whatsoever to the Commonwealth for car service, track storage, truck transport layover charges or demurrage.</p>

The learned chancellor, acting for the court en banc in disposing of McIntosh’s exceptions, found that McIntosh “purchased four additional distributor trucks at a cost of approximately $50,000, which trucks were delivered to [it] on or about March 28,1950. . . . [and McIntosh also] entered into written contracts with Atlantic Refining Company, dated March 3, 1950, for a total of 4,745,000 gallons of bituminous materials [out of its total requirement of 6,605,000 gallons under its award] to be applied pursuant to the award. In addition, [McIntosh] called its men back to work and hired twelve additional employees to get ready to perform the contract on April 1, 1950.” The chancellor also found, and the court below approved, that the Dosch-King Company likewise “made preparation for furnishing and supplying the materials included in the awards made to [it] as listed upon the schedule accompanying the letter of March 2, 1950 .... [DoschKing also] entered into contracts with Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and Riley Tan &amp; Chemical Company for bituminous materials to be applied pursuant to the award.”</p>

Six of the latter were among the prior unsuccessful bidders whose bid-guarantee checks had already been returned to them by the Department of Property and Supplies. The chancellor found that the Department of Property and Supplies privately negotiated with the six unsuccessful bidders for the purpose of making the award of March 29th and sought their consent thereto.</p>

At trial, the Deputy Secretary testified that, on March 28, 1950, <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>the day before he wrote the letters of purported recall and “new awards”, he had called on the President of Lake Asphalt at the latter’s office “to see whether he would agree whether he felt that the Commonwealth should go ahead with the awards it had made, whether he felt his position was such he should insist upon his right as low bidder . . . .” And, as a consequence, the Deputy’s letter attempting a recall of the March 1st award and the making of “new awards” went out the succeeding day, viz., March 29th. Thereby Lake Asphalt, which no longer had a bid-security check on deposit with the Department of Property and Supplies, was “awarded” a contract for the total sum of $712,373 for materials to be furnished under Schedule 1.</p>

The only one of the original successful bidders whose award was not diminished (or eliminated) by the Secretary’s attempted action of March 29th was Allegheny Asphalt and Paving Company which had a March 1st contract award for $659,362 worth of materials and work on its bids under Schedule 3.

As to the averment that “. . . the attempted cancellation of prior awards and substitution of new and different awards,- instead of effecting a saving to the Commonwealth . . . would in fact result in a net increase in cost to the Commonwealth of many thousands of dollars”, the defendants concessively answered that “the making of an award as proposed on March 29,1950, may result in an increase in cost in supervising, inspecting, making payments to or otherwse dealing with the larger number of contractors involved.” The defendants further alleged that “. . . the amount of any additional cost would depend upon many conditions, such as efficiency and promptness of particular contractors, weather conditions and many other factors which cannot now be determined or estimated, and . . . that they have no personal knowledge, and have made due inquiry and can obtain none as to whether the proposed award will result in a net increase in cost to the Commonwealth . . . .” The chancellor found in such regard that, “In prior years there had been demurrage paid by the Commonwealth under contracts covering the same type of materials as herein specified, the amount of which demurrage was charged according to the contract provisions and the awards therein made”, but also found that “There <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>was nothing to indicate to the Department of Property and Supplies what would be the amount of the demur-rage under the revised award of March 29, 1950.”</p>

The Proposal on its face specifically introduced the bid-security requirement as “IMPORTANT”. Yet, six of the eleven recipients of the March 29th awards did not then have such security cheeks on deposit with the Secretary of Property and Supplies. The return of their checks to them, as unsuccessful bidders, on March 2, 1950, following the award of contracts on March 1st, was but appropriate compliance with cognate statutory directions: The Administrative Code, Sec. 2409. Any deviation from the legal requirements in the premises in favor of any bidder would not only be discriminatory but it would be culpably violative of the law: see <em>Harris v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/283/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="283 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="1090574" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0496-01">283 Pa. 496</a>, 508, <a href="/citations/?q=129%20A.%20460" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="129 A. 460">129 A. 460</a>. In no sense was the return of the security checks to the unsuccessful bidders a mere “technical irregularity” as the brief for the defendants suggests. Nor could the situation have been altered “by the return of the certified check [to the Secretary of Property and Supplies] or the filing of a new one.” Legal authority for any such procedure has not been cited; and none has come to our attention.</p>

Apparently, the relatively small deficiency in the security deposit was due to the bidder’s inadvertent oversight of one contract item. The bidder was at once given per<a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>mission to, and the same day did, deposit an additional bid-security check for $25,000, which, of course, more than covered the shortage. The city department having charge of the matter was advised by the City Solicitor that the bid could not be considered in the awarding of contracts because of the irregularity in connection with the deposit of the bid security. Thereupon, a taxpayer filed a bill to enjoin the director of the department “from rejecting or refusing to consider the lowest bid because of the irregularity connected with the deposit.” After hearing, the lower court dismissed the bill and this court affirmed with the positive ruling that “. . . the requirement of a deposit is not a mere technical irregularity which is subject to correction after the bids are open, in the discretion of the director, but a mandatory requirement imposed by ordinance which must be fully complied with by the bidder as a condition precedent to a consideration of his bid.” The rationale of the ruling is no less applicable where the requirement is imposed directly by statute. The defendants seek to distinguish the <em>Harris </em>case from the present by saying that “Not only was [the bid-security] requirement [in that case] not complied with, but in addition the particular bidder was shown very definite favoritism and an attempt was made to overlook his default in filing his certified check.” The words thus employed by the defendants in an effort to distinguish peculiarly confirm the present pertinency of the <em>Harris </em>ease.</p>

As already stated, the chancellor found, and the evidence supports the finding, that “The Department of Property and Supplies privately negotiated with six prior unsuccessful bidders for the purpose of making the award referred to <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>in the letter of March 29, 1950, and sought the consent of these bidders in connection with making that award.” On the basis of that finding the learned chancellor correctly drew the following legal conclusions: . . the Secretary of Property and Supplies did not have the power to negotiate privately with the unsuccessful bidders for the purpose of obtaining a total price less than the tentative award. . . . íhe award referred to in the letter of the Secretary of Property and Supplies dated March 29, 1950, and made pursuant to these private negotiations, must be declared to be null and void and of no effect.” Negotiations of such nature were foreign to the purpose and spirit of the law relative to the requirements for bidding and the award of contracts for public work: see <em>Louchheim v. </em>Philadelphia, supra, at p. 103; cf. also <em>Harris v. </em>Philadelphia, supra, pp. 503-504.</p>

The time for the Secretary to be scrupulously alert in the exercise of his discretion for “the best interests of the Commonwealth” is when the bids are opened, as advertised, and he makes his award of contracts accordingly. Thenceforth, he is without further discretion in the matter and cannot vitiate such an award except for fraud, collusion or legally disqualifying error. There is not the faintest intimation in this case that there was any such fault in the original award. In so saying, we are not unmindful of the defendants’ contention that a low bidder was eliminated by the March 1st award. That, we shall consider later.</p>

In holding that the plaintiff had become vested with a right to have the contract signed, the Supreme Court of California aptly quoted from Section 143 of Donnelly on the Law of Public Contracts as follows: “When an award has once been made the public body has no discre<a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>tion but to execute the contract. The rights of the parties then become fixed, and the power to cancel the award or reject the bids does not exist.

Furthermore, the essentiality of the requirement is peculiarly indicated where bids are taken in the <em>alternative, </em>i.e., for all and, also, for parts of the same work and materials. Such circumstances are pregnant with possibilities for reshuffling of bids and favored awarding of contracts.</p>

Estimates of such additional charges were sought from officials in the Highway Department which they proved incapable of furnishing because of the many conditional elements entering into the calculation, such as weather, efficiency and promptness of contractors, etc. “Therefore,” the Deputy concluded, “we had no alternative but to take the low bids of record”, — bids, from the reckoning wherewith, there were thus excluded the almost certain additional charges which, as the chancellor found, the Commonwealth in prior years had paid under contracts covering the same type of materials as here involved.

The Attorney General in his brief for the defendants correctly interprets Section 2409 to mean that, —“This requirement is made expressly applicable to contracts <em>cawarded’ </em>and they must be ‘first approved’, that is, before a contract is awarded.” The Section is not reasonably susceptible of any other construction.

If the additional requirement of the Governor’s approval of the contracts entered into by the Department of Property and Supplies was meant to apply to contracts for materials required by the Highway Department and paid for out of funds allocated to that Department, then, why was the provision not inserted by amendment in the “All contracts” clause of Section 2409? Or, what legislative intent could there have been for requiring the Governor’s approval of a contract awarded by the Secretary of Property and Supplies for the Highway Department when the Governor’s approval of the award of such a contract was already statutorily required? On the other hand, the Attorney General contends that the “All contracts . . .” phrase in Subsection (c) of Section 2403 is all-inclusive and embraces all contracts entered into by the Department of Property and Supplies, whether for its own direct service or in its representative capacity; that the added requirement of contract approval in Subsection (c) of Section 2403 is but cumulative to the contract-award approval required by Section 2409 and must be read in conjunction therewith; and further stresses that the <em>191ft </em>amendment of Subsection (c) was the first time that the Secretary of Property and Supplies was expressly required by statute to <em>sign </em>awarded contracts on behalf of the Commonwealth.

It follows, therefore, that in addition to the Governor’s approval of contract <em>awards </em>pursuant to Section 2409 of The Administrative Code, his approval of the formal <em>contracts </em>is <em>now </em>required by virtue of Subsection (c) of Section 2403, as amended. Any seeming anomaly in the requirement of the added approval is the direct result of the 1947 enactment of Subsection (c) which was a piecemeal amendment of a comprehensive Code apparently without regard for the intent and scheme of the whole. Such approval, however, just as in the case of an award, need not be in writing. There is no statutory requirement that the Governor evidence his approval of either the award or the contract in writing although his signature at the place provided therefor on the contract form affords a facile and desirable means of supplying direct proof of his approval of such contract.</p>

Consequently, the March 1st <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>award is still binding and subsisting and cannot now be lawfully obviated. Its validity necessarily became an issue on these appeals because of the final disposition made thereof by the decree of the court below. We, therefore, declare, as a matter of law, that the award of March 1st was the exercise of a sound discretion by the awarding officials and that it may not any longer be legally assailed. What, then, is the character of the relief to be granted? Involved in the answer to that question are considerations of highest public importance not only on account of the legal requirement that the rules relating to awards of contracts for public work must be pursued meticulously in spirit as well as in letter, but, also, because of the urgency, which the defendants stressed in their answer, that no further delay be permitted to postpone longer the delivery and application of the highway materials for which the contracts were awarded.</p>

L. 177, as amended. Section 2403 (c)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> provides that the Department shall: “. . . To enter into contracts with the lowest responsible bidder for the purchase of . . . materials or supplies requested by the <em>Legislative, and other departments </em>of the State Government, except as otherwise provided by this act. <em>All such contracts shall be approved by the Governor, and signed on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Secretary of Property and Supplies, </em>who shall also, with the approval of the Department of Justice, prescribed rules and regulations for the submission of bids, awards, forms of contracts and other matter related thereto.” (Italics added). Section 2409 states, <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>inter alia: “All contracts awarded shall be severally void unless first approved by the Governor, the Auditor General, and the State Treasurer. . . .” This latter section prescribes the procedure to be followed by the Department of Property &amp; Supplies in obtaining bids, preparing schedules and generally defines the limits of the discretion to be exercised by the Secretary of that department. The former section, on the other hand, sets forth the powers and duties of the Department of Property &amp; Supplies and specifically provides the manner in which contracts are to be-made for the purchase of materials necessary for the legislative and other departments of government. These two sections must, therefore, be read together, and when so read it is quite clear that, before a -contractual obligation on the part of the Commonwealth comes into existence, a contract must be prepared and signed by the Secretary of Property and Supplies on behalf of the Commonwealth and approved by the Governor, the Auditor General and the State Treasurer. In other words, it was the intent of the legislature that it was the final written instrument, and not the preliminary arrangements preparatory thereto, which would create a binding contract on the part of the Commonwealth.</p>

They rely upon a letter, dated March 2, 1950, signed by the Assistant Director of Purchases on behalf of that officer, informing them that a “tentative award of contract” had been made to them and further that “upon receipt of the bonds and approval of the bonds by the Department of Justice, final award will be made . . .” which they contend, and the majority agrees, was a sufficient acceptance to constitute a binding contract. That letter was not intended to create, nor could it create, any such obligations, inasmuch as the provisions of The Administrative Code had not been <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>complied with. That communication was written merely to notify the bidders that their bids were the lowest ones made, and that it was incumbent upon them to file the performance bond and labor and material bond required by Section 2408 (h) of the Code which would meet with the approval of the Department of Justice. However, the letter did not attempt to enumerate the remaining statutory steps required to be taken by the Commonwealth before a contract would result, i.e. a contract accepting their proposals, in written form approved by the Department of Justice, and executed by the Secretary of Property and Supplies with the approval of the Governor, the Auditor General, and the State Treasurer noted thereon. In no way could appellants be justified in concluding, or the majority in holding, that the letter of March 2 satisfied the statutory requirement.</p>

It bases such presumption on the theory that a public official, such as the Secretary of Property and Supplies, complied with the Code, and would not have written his letter of March 2, without obtaining such approval. The majority has fallen into error in this regard also, for obviously no presumption could possibly arise under the circumstances here presented. This Court said, in <em>Hill v. Alexander, </em><a href="/pa/338/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="338 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1199936" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0026-01">338 Pa. 26</a>, 32, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20A.2d%20884" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="11 A.2d 884">11 A. 2d 884</a>: “It is true that honesty of purpose and good faith in the performance of acts in their official capacity will be assumed by the courts on the part of persons holding responsible public positions, until the contrary clearly appears . . . , but manifestly this principle cannot aid appellants’ case, for no amount of good faith and honesty of purpose on the part of the commissioners can render effective action which is abortive for failure to comply with the manda<a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>tory requirements of the law governing such action.” See also 31 C. J. S., Sec. 146 (b), pp. 806-807-808. Moreover, to infer the approval of the Governor, the Auditor General and the State Treasurer from an act of Assistant Director of Purchases, would violate the well established rule that one presumption cannot be based upon another: <em>Neely et al. v. Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/322/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="322 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1167842" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0417-01">322 Pa. 417</a>, 426, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20784" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="185 A. 784">185 A. 784</a>; Henry, Pa. Trial Evidence (3rd Ed.), §384, pp. 574, 577. Such a presumption would permit of an oral approval by the requisite officials. When the Legislature stated “approval”, it obviously meant approval in writing, for that is the only possible means by which a record of such approval could be available to show that the statutory requirement in this regard has been satisfied. “Whenever, either by constitutional or legislative requirement the president of the United States, the governor of a state or the mayor of a city is required to approve an act of congress, or of a legislature, or of a court of common council, the word ‘approve’ means more than the unexpressed mental acquiescence of the individual in the propriety of what has been done; it means that the officer, in his official capacity, as the guardian of the interests of a community, having in view its welfare, and not his personal wish or advantage, shall consider the proposed legislation and determine that it is proper, and make that fact known to all men with absolute certainty, by some visible, unmistakable and enduring mark, to wit, by written declaration attested by his signature. It is not enough that in the future when the question is made — is such an act of congress, of legislature or of common council binding upon the country, state or municipality, that it should depend for decision upon the memory and testimony of an officer as to what was his unexpressed thought, at a former time, concerning it. Such, uncertainty would be unendurable, and, therefore, we must assume it to be outside of the meaning of any constitution or law.”: <em>N. York &amp; N. England R. R. Co. </em>

It must also be said that it is a complete non sequitur to hold that because the checks of the unsuccessful bidders were returned, as required by the Code, that we must presume that the award had been approved.

This leads to the ridiculous proposition that the Governor must approve an already binding obligation that he has previously approved. This Court should not conclude that the Legislature intended such an absurd result. The untenability of the majority’s position in this connection is further emphasized by the order which it has entered. It has directed the Secretary of Property and Supplies to submit the executed contracts to the Governor for his approval. If he refuses to approve, as he has the legal right to do, appellants are then in the unenviable position of having a valid contract which is unenforceable in law.</p>
