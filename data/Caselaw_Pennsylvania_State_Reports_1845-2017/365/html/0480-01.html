The question then resolves itself to the narrow question, What is appropriate under the circumstances?

So in <em>Thornton v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/328/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="328 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1179668" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0011-01">328 Pa. 11</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.%20897" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="194 A. 897">194 A. 897</a> (1937), the deed was to James Pierce and Sadie Thornton Pierce, his wife, but added thereto was the clause, “the purpose of this deed is to vest in the grantees named <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>herein an estate by entireties,” an estate which like the common law joint tenancy had as its most distinguishing feature the right of survivorship. So in <em>Maxwell v. Baylor, </em>supra, there was added to the names of the parties who were not husband and wife, the words “their heirs and assigns, as <em>tenants by the </em>entireties“This,” said Mr. Justice Horace Stern, “was equivalent to stating in so many words that they desired, to establish a right of survivorship.” To which we now add, and therefore sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Act of 1812. The same result was arrived at in <em>Frederick v. Southwick, </em><a href="/pa-super/165/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="165 Pa. Super. 78" data-case-ids="467335" data-case-paths="/pa-super/165/0078-01">165 Pa.

    <p id="b547-3" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[159,1220,1153,870]]]'>In the case before us there is no such indication of intent. Of course it is arguable that the mere use of the words “his wife” of itself would imply an intent to create an entireties estate. And it is true that if such language without more were used to convey to grantees <em>who were in fact husband and wife, </em>an estate by entire-ties would be created. But we cannot carry the implication of intent that far in a case where the parties are <em>not married </em>for they may have been motivated solely by a desire to make a public record conform to the pretended relationship. We cannot safely infer therefore that an estate by entireties was intended by these parties. Hence the clear expression of intent necessary to satisfy the Act of 1812 is lacking. In <em>Maxwell v. Saylor </em>we went as far as we could go and that case must not be extended beyond its facts.</p>
