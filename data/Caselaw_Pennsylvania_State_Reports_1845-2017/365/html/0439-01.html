The evidence was clearly and amply sufficient to sustain the verdict; all controversial questions were left to the jury under proper instructions; and no objections were made to the charge of the trial judge, which was fair and adequate. The errors now complained of relate to the admission of statements or so-called confessions allegedly wrung from defendant in violation of his constitutional rights.</p>

Shupp, 48 years of age, was an accountant and vacuum cleaner salesman. He had been keeping company with Marian Walck, the victim, for approximately a year. On Tuesday evening, September 6, 1949, at about 10:55 p. m., two Allentown police, Hamory and McHugh, discovered defendant slumped over the steering wheel of his Packard sedan in a drunken condition. On the floor in the back of the car they discovered the dead body of Marian Walck. There were three bullet Avounds in her body from a .38 calibre revolver. Defendant, whose trousers were blood <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>stained, had in his pocket a .38 calibre revolver fully loaded and a box of shells from which an undetermined number had been removed. A ballistics expert testified that a bullet found on the floor of the car near the body and two taken from the body had been fired from the revolver found on defendant’s person. <em>Defendant admitted </em>several times before trial and testified <em>at Ms trial </em>that a bullet'from his gun killed Marian at about 6:30 or 7:30 p.m. on September 6th. He admitted several times prior to trial that he deliberately shot and killed his sweetheart because she cheated on him or dared him to shoot her, or that it was the result of a suicide pact; but he contended at the trial that the shooting was accidental or that he was so intoxicated that he could not have had a specific intent to kill. The question of intentional or accidental killing and the degree of intoxication and other questions as to which there was any controversy or conflict were left to the jury under proper instructions from the court; and the jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>

Defendant stated to Hamory that he had shot Miss Walck at about 7:30 p.m. that evening; that he had spent about $840.00' on her; that he “went with her for seven months and then she started to cheat on me, either Harry Beltz or Jim Henritzy. I shot her. It was Jim Henritzy”. ... “I pulled out the gun and she said I haven’t got enough guts to shoot her and I shot her three times”. Defendant also alluded several times to a suicide pact. “When I shot her it was a suicide pact. Said she wanted to make a suicide pact. I shot Marian, but I didn’t shoot myself yet.” Hamory continued to question Shupp in the car for about “a half an hour or- — forty-five minutes”, while other officers were completing their investigation of the area in which defendant and the deceased Avere found.

Upon returning from this trip at about 2:00 a.m. defendant was taken to the morgue and identified the body of the deceased. While there the defendant stated in the presence of various police officials, the Coroner, and the Assistant District Attorney, that he shot her. The defendant was then taken to police headquarters where he was questioned in the presence of Detectives Horner and McCurley, Police Captain Kramer, the District Attorney, Assistant District Attorney and the Coroner. Defendant detailed his activities on the afternoon of September 6th; his drinking <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>at various places, how he went to the Lehighton Fair, had several more drinks and then picked up Miss Walck at about four-thirty where she worked in Lehighton. <em>Defendant repeated his story about acctising Miss Walck of cheating and again described how he secured the gun and after she taunted him with not having the nerve, he shot her three times while she lay on the rear seat of the car. He reloaded his gun to shoot himself fact lost his nerve. </em>It is important to note that there was no objection at the trial to any of his testimony. Moreover, most of his statements were verified from defendant’s own lips at the trial, and all facts in his statements to the officers were verified by defendant’s own testimony with the exception of the shooting which he claimed at the trial was accidental.</p>

He testified, “I was introduced to the defendant and told [him] that I was starting the investigation, and he told me, ‘I’ve told them already I met the girl, shot the girl. I showed them where, I showed them where I drove to, I showed them where I threw the gloves, the shells, and I don’t have to say another God damn thing’.”</p>

These officers together with Officer Talotta of Whitehall Township again took defendant over the route to the scene of the crime. Defendant was given a cup of coffee on their return at about 11 o’clock a.m.</p>

They next went to the parking lot where the defendant was first found. Corporal Swann testified that at the parking lot “I asked him what happened then, after he parked the car. He says he wanted a lawyer. Q. <em>‘I </em>want a lawyer’? A. Wanted a lawyer. Q. All right, then what happened? A. Well, then we went back to the police station. Q. Then what did you do? A.

Defendant was next taken by Brennen and Swann to the Lehigh County prison <em>where he was lawfully committed </em>on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 7, 1949.</p>

At about 4:30 p.m. defendant asked for Mr. Brennen, the Assistant District Attorney, who was called. Defendant was again questioned at about 10:00 p.m. that same night until about 3:30 a.m. of the following morning, Sunday, September 11th. Defendant again repeated his prior admissions about the crime. This was objected to because defendant had been allegedly deprived of counsel. <em>Defendant’s son was present during this entire questioning in the Warden’s office.

The Warden testified that when defendant was admitted to the prison he complained about his nervousness, headaches and stomach trouble; that Dr. Good, the jail physician, prescribed phenobarbital pills about three times a day, the dosage to be two pills of a quarter grain each. He testified that the first six to eight pills given to defendant, when he first entered the prison, were phenobarbital and that thereafter — including September 10th and 11th — he was given only sugar pills. The defendant’s son testified that he was told by the Warden and the Assistant District Attorney that the pills were phenobarbital, that at least eight pills were given and that his father was incoherent.

The defendant on direct examination testified that he had told the District Attorney he wanted “to get in touch with Attorney Garrahan”. On cross examination he admitted that he did not name to the District Attorney any particular attorney; that he had stated in response to the question whether he had a lawyer that he would have one for the preliminary hearing to be held on September 21st. The defendant further responded in cross examination as follows: “Q.

He alleged that he was so drunk he did not realize what he was saying but the jury found against him on this point.</p>
    <p id="b508-4" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[250,560,1152,580]]]'>Considering not only the period of the interrogations, but also all the other factors involved, the defendant’s admissions in our opinion were not coerced. <em>A very important and determining factor in this case is that the defendant never at or prior to the trial complained of this protracted examination or about his treatment by the police or by any official; </em>and his able and experienced counsel objected to these admissions only on the ground (a) defendant was (allegedly) denied counsel and (b) was held incommunicado.</p>
    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[245,1162,1154,425]]]'>Defendant was also examined three days later (September 10th-llth) for 5% hours in the presence of his son. His admissions at this interrogation (which Avere again merely cumulative) were objected to at the trial, <em>not because they were coerced, or the result of a protracted mental ordeal, </em>but because he was allegedly given phenobarbital pills. This was denied and was obviously disbelieved by the jury.</p>
    <p id="b508-6" data-blocks='[["BL_508.6",508,[245,1600,1152,144]]]'>We agree with the court below that defendant’s constitutional rights were not infringed and that he had a fair trial.</p>
    <p id="b508-7" data-blocks='[["BL_508.7",508,[314,1766,411,42]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
