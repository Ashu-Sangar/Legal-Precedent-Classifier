In 1917 Taylor, Trustee, sold and assigned the note and mortgage to Thomas Elliott, plaintiff’s husband, who thereupon took over the control of the premises as mortgagee in possession. Prom 1917 to 1919 he rented the property to a tenant; in 1919 he and plaintiff assumed occupancy and remained until 1923 when they separated and plaintiff left the premises; from 1923 to 1930 Elliott again rented the property to various tenants. In 1930 he was adjudicated a bankrupt and in 1931 his trustee in bankruptcy sold and assigned the mortgage to Edith D. Moffett, one of the defendants, who thereafter occupied the premises as mortgagee in possession until 1946 at which time she delivered possession to William E. Hudson, the other defendant, in accordance with the terms of an agreement to sell him the property. During the years from 1920 to 1943 the property was assessed for tax purposes in the name of Thomas Elliott and since 1944 in the name of Edith D. Moffett, but Elliott did not pay any of the taxes from 1930 on. The property was advertised by the County Treasurer for sale for the 1932 taxes; the sale was not held, however, until 1940, at which time it was purchased by the County Commissioners. In 1942 the County Treasurer executed a deed for the property to the County Commissioners, who in turn, in 1944, ex<a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>ecuted and delivered their deed to the defendant, Edith D. Moffett. In 1946 the latter filed a petition in the court below setting forth her claim of title and obtained a rule upon the heirs of Hiram Davis to show cause why her title should not be decreed valid and indefeasible as against all rights or claims whatsoever. In furtherance of that rule the court ordered plaintiff to bring the present action in ejectment to recover possession. By agreement of the parties the case was tried by the court without a jury. Hearing having been had, the court ordered judgment to be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, and directed defendant Edith D. Moffett to satisfy the mortgage of record and also by deed to quitclaim to plaintiff all her apparent right, title and interest in the premises. From the entry of the judgment thus ordered defendants appeal.</p>

Defendants, on the other hand, contended that the heirs of the mortgagor had lost their equity of redemption by laches, not having requested or demanded an accounting from the mortgagee in possession from 1917 until the present action was commenced, a period of nearly 30 years; they also claimed title by reason of the deed from the County Commissioners to Edith D.

It is true that ejectment proceedings such as the present are regarded in Pennsylvania as an equitable action in the nature of a bill to redeem <em>(Wells v. Van Dyke, </em><a href="/pa/109/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="109 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="542302" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0330-01">109 Pa. 330</a>, 335, 336; <em>Mellon v.

But if the mortgagor permits the mortgagee to hold the <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>possession for twenty years without accounting or without admitting that he possesses a mortgage title only, the mortgagor loses his right of redemption, and the title of the mortgagee becomes as absolute in equity as it previously was in law. In such a case the time begins to run against the mortgagor from the moment the mortgagee takes possession in his character as such; and if it has once begun to run and no subsequent admission is made by the mortgagee, it continues to run against all persons claiming under the mortgagor, whatever may be the disabilities to which they may be subjected.” (See also Glenn on Mortgages, vol. 1, pp. 362 et seq., §55). Under <em>that </em>rule the mortgagor would lose his equity of redemption by failing to demand an accounting within 20 years even if there were no affirmative act or assertion of adverse title by the mortgagee while in possession. However, even under the view thus expressed by Story such a result would not follow if, during the twenty years, the mortgagee admitted that he possessed a mortgage title only. In Glenn on Mortgages, vol. 1, p. 364, §55, it is stated that “any recognition of the equity on the mortgagee’s part, such as . . . a . . . transfer by deed . . . which recited the mortgage as in effect, would stop the running of time and give the mortgagor a fresh start.” It is a well established principle that one claiming under a deed is bound by any recognition it contains of title in another: <em>Olwine v.

When the mortgage here in question was assigned in 1931 by Thomas Elliott’s trustee in bankruptcy to the defendant Edith D. Moffett the deed of assignment contained the following provision: “Subject, nevertheless, to the right of redemption vested in the said Hiram Davis, his heirs and assigns.” It is clear, therefore, that, from any point of view, the facts do not support defendants’ claim of <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>acquisition, through the passing of time, of a valid and indefeasible title.</p>

The testimony, however, showed that the amount of rentals received by Thomas Elliott and Edith D. Moffett during their successive occupancies as mortgagee in possession, together with the fair rental value of the property during the time Thomas Elliott himself lived there, was several times greater than the amount of the principal and interest due on the mortgage, even after allowing for taxes, necessary repairs and other proper charges. The court found as a fact that “The mortgage debt has been fully paid, with interest and all other charges,” and indeed that it had already been so paid when the mortgage was assigned to Edith D. Moffett in 1931. It was not necessary, therefore, to go through the mechanics of a formal accounting: <em>Wells v.
