    <p id="b672-15" data-blocks='[["BL_672.22",672,[250,2114,1148,201]]]'>This matter came before the court below on a petition for a Declaratory Judgment, Answers thereto, and. a stipulation of facts. The essential facts may be summarized as follows:</p>
    <p id="b673-3" data-blocks='[["BL_673.3",673,[176,298,1152,540]]]'>
      <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>James Stewart devised by Par. 6 of Ms will, a 122 acre farm to Ms son John, 72 acres absolutely and the remaining 50 acres for life, and if John died leaving issue, then to such issue in fee. “But should my said son John die without issue living at the time of his death, then said fifty acres is to revert to my three daughters, Maria, Emma and Mary E. to be held by them in equal proportions and in fee simple. If either of my said daughters should at that time be dead, the share of such deceased daughter shall go to her .heirs.”</p>
    <p id="b673-4" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[176,850,1151,694]]]'>All three daughters conveyed by general warranty deeds their respective interests in the 50 acres to John. Two of the daughters died before John and one after him. John executed an oil and gas lease covering the whole farm of 122 acres to the Peoples Natural Gas Co, for a yearly royalty of $400. John then died without issue. His executor sold the 72. acres to Earnest Clyde Varner and the 50 acres to Karl M. Baily, who filed the Declaratory Judgment Petition. The stipulation agreed on the facts as well as questions which the court was asked to decide. These, in the order they were discussed in the opinion and the disposition by the court below were as follows:</p>
    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.5",673,[176,1563,1151,754]],["BL_674.1",674,[262,297,1147,208]]]'>1. What estate did John acquire by. the deeds from his sisters? To this question the court answered that the sisters had no vested interest but only a contingent interest conditioned on their surviving John’s death without him leaving issue. Consequently, as to the sisters, Maria and Emma, who died before John, it was ruled no interest passed under their respective deeds to John and therefore the respective heirs of these two daughters became the owners of <em>2/z </em>of the 50 acres at John’s death without issue. However, as to the <em>Vs </em>interest conveyed to John by Mary, who died <em>after </em>John’s death, John’s estate acquired a fee under the familiar doctrine of title by equitable estoppel, her absolute title which became perfected at John’s <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>death, when it accrued, passed by virtue of her previous deed to her grantee, citing <em>Ciarle v.

    <p id="b674-5" data-blocks='[["BL_674.4",674,[259,517,1151,754]]]'>2. The second question was whether the lease to the gas company was wholly void so far as the 50 acres was concerned because a life tenant may not operate or lease mineral rights where a mine or gas well was not opened before the life estate accrued. The court held John was more than a life tenant; he was in fact a tenant in common who believed himself to be an owner in fee. The lease was therefore not wholly void and the Gas Company were not wilful trespassers. In absence of malice therefore the damages to the <em>% </em>interest of the other tenants in common could be fairly measured by the value of the royalties paid which were the usual customary royalties, citing <em>McIntosh v. Ropp, </em><a href="/pa/233/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="233 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="981033" data-case-paths="/pa/233/0497-01">233 Pa. 497</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.%20949" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="82 A. 949">82 A. 949</a> (1912).</p>
    <p id="b674-6" data-blocks='[["BL_674.5",674,[256,1283,1151,693]]]'>3. The Court was asked to determine the proportion due each party in interest to the accumulated unpaid impounded royalties in the light of the decision of the two foregoing questions, because the lease covered the whole 122 acres but the only well was actually drilled on the 50 acres. The court, citing <em>Wettengel v. Gormley, </em><a href="/pa/184/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="184 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="987981" data-case-paths="/pa/184/0354-01">184 Pa. 354</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.%2057" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="39 A. 57">39 A. 57</a> (1898), ruled that the royalties covered the entire tract regardless of what part the well was actually drilled on, and then apportioned the royalties between the owner of the 72 acres and owners of 50 acres on the basis of awarding the former 72/122 and the latter 50/122 of the royalties.</p>
    <p id="b674-7" data-blocks='[["BL_674.6",674,[254,1992,1149,318]],["BL_675.1",675,[193,297,1151,428]]]'>4. The lease contained a free gas privilege and the court was asked to decide which of the two tracts of land were entitled to this privilege, in view of the fact that there was a dwelling house on the 72 acres and one on the 50 acres, but free gas had never been used in the dwelling house on the 72 acres. The court ruled <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>that assuming the gas had been used in the dwelling house on the 50 acre tract, the parties were bound by John’s election in that regard and therefore the free gas privilege would belong to the present owners of the 50 acre tract. If John had however never used the free gas privilege the cash value thereof, (fixed in the lease at $75.00 per year) would be distributable in the same proportions as the royalty payments.</p>
    <p id="b675-4" data-blocks='[["BL_675.4",675,[194,744,1149,318]]]'>Judge Hook, of the court below, pursuant to his comprehensive well-considered opinion, then entered a formal Declaratory Judgment on May, 19, 1947, adjudicating the rights of the respective parties and making definite awards to each party of the respective proportion due each of the royalties, etc.</p>
    <p id="b675-5" data-blocks='[["BL_675.5",675,[194,1080,1152,1200]]]'>Five days later, viz., May 26, 1947, counsel for the appellants made a written motion for re-argument in which it was averred (1) that the court failed to award the appellants (the owners of the ^ interest in the 50 acres) their respective shares of oil and gas royalties paid by the gas company to John from the date the well was drilled to the date the royalties were impounded, viz., from December 9, 1930, to March 9, 1936. (2) That the court erred in fixing the shares of the owners of the two tracts in the proportion of 72/122 and 50/122. On June 2, 1947, the court granted a rule to show cause why the matters set forth in the motion should not be reargued returnable the first Monday of July, 1947, but no stay of proceedings was asked for in the motion, nor was any granted in the rule. On November 24, 1947, nearly 6 months after the judgment was entered the court granted a reargument limited however to the first ground only, viz., the failure to pass on the rights of the parties to recover their shares of the royalties paid to John prior to his death. The original declaratory judgment was neither vacated nor opened and no stay of proceedings granted.</p>

It granted a reargument only on the question not previously considered, and not involved in the distribution of the impounded fund. It concerned a different .claim and question of the right to recover from the Gas;Company, royalties it had paid to John. The original judgment was not opened but a supplemental judgment was entered and this could not relieve the appellants of their duty to take an appeal within three months from the original declaratory judgment which had been left unaltered. In this aspect the instant case resembles <em>Henry’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/290/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="290 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1104467" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0537-01">290 Pa. 537</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20198" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="139 A. 198">139 A. 198</a> (1927) more closely than that cited by appellant’s counsel..

We cannot agree with their position. The gas well was completed on December 9, 1930. The first quarterly rental of $100.00 was then due. The petition for declaratory judgment herein was filed December 2, 1938. Under the ruling of Trustees of the Proprietors of Kingston v.
