      <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>On January 20,1948, the City Council of the City of Wilkes-Barre passed a resolution placing plaintiffs William Oliver, Faust lorio, John A. Gazey and Edward J. Lenahan on the police force retirement list, effective as of February 1, 1948. Plaintiffs all had served the minimum number of years required by a city ordinance to make them eligible for retirement and did not object to defendants’ action until February 1, 1949 when they filed this complaint. In the interim they received pension checks, which they cashed, and defendants employed and trained new recruits to fill the vacancies occasioned by their retirement.</p>

L. 932. Whether that section conferred such a power on defendants need not be determined here. For defendants further averred that plaintiffs were guilty of laches in not instituting suit at an earlier date and were properly sustained in this contention by the court below which entered judgment accordingly on the pleadings.</p>

Mr. Justice Clark said (p. 371) : ‘This court has lately said that while mandamus is classed as a legal remedy, it is a remedial process which is awarded, not as a matter of right, but in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion and upon equitable principles, Duncan Townsite Co. v.

Public policy requires reasonable diligence upon the plaintiff’s part, which we think the findings in this record do not disclose.’ ”</p>

In view of plaintiffs acceptance of pension benefits and delay of this suit for over a year while defendants made changes in organization and personnel necessitated by this retirement, such a result would be clearly inequitable.
