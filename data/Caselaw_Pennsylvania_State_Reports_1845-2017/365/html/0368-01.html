Corson lived for 35 years with Mrs. Dickinson at her home, 2824 North Mascher Street, Philadelphia. The defendant, who was no relation to Corson, lived with Mrs. Dickinson, his grandmother, from the time he was 6 years old until his marriage in 1941. Corson bequeathed to Mrs. Dickinson, in his will of February 2, 1944, $5,000 and half of his residuary estate. In that will he bequeathed the defendant $100.</p>

      <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>In October 1947, Corson visited Ms attorney, Mr. Troutman, to execute a codicil to Ms 1944 will, to correct the middle initial in the name of Ella Dickinson, and to reduce the legacy given to one of his nieces. On January 6, 1948, ten days after the death of Mrs. Dickinson, Corson again visited Mr. Troutman for the purpose of changing his will. On <em>January </em>7, <em>191/S </em>Corson executed a new will making substantially the same bequests as he had previously made to churches and to his nieces, but <em>increasing his bequest to the defendant from $100 to $200 </em>and leaving his entire residuary estate to Hess (to whom he had previously left half of his residuary estate). Troutman noticed that Corson had failed physically, appeared to be in a daze and did not seem to know what he wanted. His condition was such that Troutman even then had grave doubts as to his testamentary capacity but finally drew the new will because it contained substantially the same bequests as in the earlier will except for the change necessitated by the death of Mrs. Dickinson. One week later, on <em>January 13, 1918, Corson, accompanied by </em>plaintiff, plaintiff’s wife, and by <em>defendant, </em>went to see a new attorney Mr. Gerber for the purpose of having him draw a new will. This will contained substantially the same bequests to churches and to relatives but it increased the bequest to defendant from <em>$200 to $2,000 </em>and left the residuary estate in equal shares <em>to defendant, </em>to May Kees, wife of plaintiff, and to four of Corson’s relatives. It also named plaintiff as executor. At the time of this visit, defendant gave Gerber <em>a memorandum in defendant’s handwriting </em>which provided for a few bequests and ended with the words <em>“Prescott Creen to receive the remainder”. </em>Green then stated to the attorney : “This is exactly how Mr. Corson wants his will drawn”. Mr. Gerber said that that was not the way wills were made in his office. As a consequence, when the parties were leaving, defendant said to Kees, “That <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>fellow Gerber thinks he is pretty smart but I will get my share”. On March 11, 1948 Corson returned to Gerber’s office and had him prepare a codicil (which decedent promptly executed) to his will of January 13, 1948 in which codicil he reduced his bequest to defendant from $2000 to $1000.</p>

The Chancellor found that Corson was no longer happy there and he appealed to his next door neighbors to take him in, saying he could not stand living any longer with defendant and his wife. When these neighbors could not take decedent in, he went to live with Kees for nearly five months. During this time decedent did not visit defendant nor defendant visit him. While at Kees’ home, Corson’s infirmities and senility increased and he was under the constant care of his physician, Dr. Shore. On August 23, 1948, defendant called at Kees’ home and induced Corson to go back “home” (2824 North Mascher Street) with him. That house was home to Corson and the Kees’ house had seemed strange. Corson wanted to live and die in the house where he had lived so long. The Chancellor found that it was the old familiar house Corson longed for and not the society of defendant or his wife. Although Corson needed medical attention, defendant did not call in Corson’s physician, Dr. Shore, but waited until September 20, 1948 and then took Corson to defendant’s own physician, Dr. Vaughn.</p>

He said that is what he did want to do, but he didn’t know anything about the agreement, it was over his head, but if it did what he wanted, namely provide for a disposition of his property after his death, and would keep him from being dragged to lawyers’ offices, that is' what he wanted”.
