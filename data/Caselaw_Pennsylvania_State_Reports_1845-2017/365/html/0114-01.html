Riding with him were his two sisters and a brother and four other children, all of whom he was taking to school in Mount Jackson with the exception of his sister, Marjorie, whom he was taking to her place of employment. The defendant, Robert McAnlis, had an operator’s license and had been taking the children to and from school almost daily since school opened in September, 1946. The visibility was poor because of a heavy fog which had blanketed the district since early morning and had not completely lifted. The car had been used by Robert McAnlis with his father’s knowledge since the opening of school, for the purpose of transporting his brother and sisters, together with other children in the neighborhood, to and from the Mount Jackson school which was about seven miles distant from defendants’ home.</p>

The defendant-driver’s negligence, in running into a standing car is not seriously questioned. While there was a fog, and poor visibility, there was testimony that plaintiff could see 300 feet in each direction. There was also uncontradicted testimony that the visibility was “from two car lengths to 100 feet”. It was testified that after plaintiff stopped his car and was wiping off his windshield, he saw the defendant-driver approaching in his car 82 feet away. It was not contributory negligence <em>as matter of law </em>for the plaintiff to stop his car in such fog and visibility and to stand still for a reasonable time for the purpose of cleaning his windshield. Under the present facts and circumstances defendants’ negligence and plaintiff’s contributory negligence became <em>questions of fact for the jury.</em>
