Tanner, applied to the court below for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he had been indicted and tried for the commission of a crime different from that for which he had been held to await the action of the grand jury. The court below refused the writ, from which order the relator now appeals.</p>

A coroner’s inquest held into the death of the deceased “recommended” that Tanner be held for the grand jury upon a charge of manslaughter. The district attorney prepared a bill of indictment charging murder and voluntary manslaughter; <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>a true bill was found by the grand jury and the relator was tried thereon, convicted and sentenced as above stated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

The finding of a coroner’s jury “is merely advisory to the public authorities charged with the administration of the criminal law. It has been held that a coroner’s verdict ... is merely advisory, . . . notwithstanding the verdict may make it the duty of the coroner to issue a warrant for the arrest of the person suspected . . . .” 13 Am. Jur. 113, §12. Murder and manslaughter are “cognate” to one another and are not “unrelated”, murder being a higher grade of felonious homicide than manslaughter, and both being properly joined as counts in a bill of indictment. If the relator was surprised when he found upon arraignment that he was called upon to answer to the graver charge of murder an application for time to prepare to meet it would undoubtedly have been allowed: <em>Commonwealth v.
