LeDonne in turn entered into an oral contract with plaintiffs to install the plumbing and heating systems in that building. The material and labor were supplied by plaintiffs in accordance with the oral agreement and, when defendants defaulted after part payment, plaintiffs served notice on them of an intent to file a claim for a mechanic’s lien. Defendant Short, following the procedure set forth in section 31, of the Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>, <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>promptly took a rule upon plaintiffs to issue a scire facias and, when they had complied therewith, filed an affidavit of defense, alleging, inter alia, that she had not had sufficient notice of an intention to file a lien as required by section 8 of the Act of 1901, supra, as amended.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Plaintiffs filed a reply traversing certain allegations of the affidavit of defense but did not deny the correctness of the copy of the notice of intention which defendant Short had submitted. Defendant Short then entered a rule for judgment on the whole record, specifying no reason, but at the argument relying on the contention that the notice of intention did not specify the nature of the labor and material furnished in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of section 8 of the Act of 1901, supra. This notice of intention set forth the sum still due, the date when materials and labor was last' furnished and further stated: “That the contract under which the aforesaid work was done (or materials were furnished) was made with Nicholas Le Donne and the nature of the labor (or materials) furnished, as aforesaid was installation of complete plumbing and heating for entire building at 1316-1318 Fifth Avenue, McKeesport, Pennsylvania, including the furnishing of all material, equipment and labor in connection therewith.”</p>

However, this Court has said in <em>Am. Car Co. v. Alexandria Water Co., </em>supra, (p. 525) : <em>“. . . </em>all the cases agree that a substantial compliance is sufficient, and this is shown to exist wherever enough appears, on the face of the statement, to point the way to successful inquiry. Adherence to the terms of that statute is indispensable, but the rule must not be pushed into such niceties as serve but to perplex and embarrass a remedy intended to be simple and summary, without in fact, adding anything to the security of the parties having an interest in the building sought to be encumbered.”</p>
    <p id="b202-4" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[248,952,1160,1014]]]'>In the instant case plaintiffs informed defendant Short that they were filing a claim for a specific sum of money due them for labor and materials used in the installation of all heating and plumbing equipment in the building she had had constructed. This type of labor and material is so readily distinguishable in form, nature and design from any other used in the construction of a building that a requirement of a more detailed description would not only be in conflict with our earlier decisions but would also be of little advantage to the owner. Defendant Short was notified of the cost of the materials and labor for which payment had not been made and was told summarily what comprised these costs. This was sufficient to enable her to determine how much she should withhold from the contractor LeDonne .in order to avoid double payments, thereby serving the purposes of the Act of 1901, supra, and was descriptive enough to substantially comply with the requirements of section 8 of that Act.</p>
