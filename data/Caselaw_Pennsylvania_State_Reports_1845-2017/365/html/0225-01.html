After the probate of Mrs. Isherwood’s will, which was not found for almost two years after her death, a dispute arose between Mrs. Dowler and her co-executor, Earl Isherwood, with respect to this bank account. The latter claimed it was part of the deceased mother’s estate, while Mrs. Dowler claimed it was her own individual property as the surviving joint tenant of her mother. Earl, acting alone as executor of his mother’s will, sued the bank to recover the fund for the decedent’s estate. The bank answered, denying any pecuniary interest in the account, and impleaded as an additional claimant of the money Mrs. Dowler who was ruled to file her claim in the proceeding, which she did. An issue to try title to the account was thereupon framed with Ruth Dowler, the claimant, as plaintiff, and Earl Isherwood, executor of the mother’s will, as defendant. <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>Upon trial of the issue, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Subsequently, the learned court below entered judgment for the defendant n. o. v. and the plaintiff took this appeal. The question involved is whether the evidence adduced by the plaintiff is legally sufficient to sustain the jury’s finding.</p>
    <p id="b285-4" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[199,633,1153,1682]],["BL_286.1",286,[238,302,1146,157]]]'>The documentary evidence of the creation of the account consisted of a deposit slip showing a deposit in the bank’s savings department on September 1, 1934, of $2500 “By Mrs. Jennie Isherwood and Buth Dowler.” The slip had been prepared by the bank clerk on duty at the time who died before this controversy arose. To evidence the deposit, the bank issued a pass book which bore the designation “Mrs. Jennie Isherwood or Ruth Dowler”; Mrs. Isherwood retained possession of the pass book until her death. No signature card was offered in evidence nor was there any evidence that one had ever been signed by either Mrs. Isherwood or Mrs. Dowler. The bank’s ledger sheet containing the account was received in evidence and showed on its face in typewriting, following the printed word “Name”, “Isgerwood, Jennie Mrs. or Ruth Dowler.” Above the typewritten names there was typed in a lighter and different type, —“Payable to either or the survivor as joint tenants and not as tenants in common.” The learned court below in its opinion on the motion for judgment n. o. v. says that “It is not clear from the evidence when these latter words were written on, but there was (evidence that it was done by some bank clerk after the death of Mrs. Isherwood.” Our examination of the record fails to disclose any evidence of sufficient probative force to support a finding to such effect. And, in any event, the jury’s verdict requires that the writing and notations on the bank’s ledger sheet be taken at face value as having been made in the ordinary course of business by someone acting for the bank. There were additional deposits to the account and some withdrawals therefrom made dur<a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>ing Mrs. Isherwood’s lifetime, but there is no evidence as to who made them except for a $50 deposit on March 1, 1935, which was made by Mrs. Isherwood.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[238,473,1152,1839]]]'>In addition to the documentary evidence relating to the account in the Springs-First National Bank, the claimant produced as a witness the cashier of the First National Bank at Edinboro, which was some seven or eight miles distant from Cambridge Springs. That witness testified that in the late morning of September 1, 1934, Mrs. Isherwood, her husband and Mrs. Dowler, the claimant, came to his bank at Edinboro for the purpose of opening a savings account which was done with money furnished by Mrs. Isherwood in the sum of $2500; that Mrs. Isherwood “. . . stated she wanted to open a joint account with the bank and with her daughter . . .”; and that he got a signature card and read it to them. He further testified that Mrs. Isherwood wanted the account so fixed that “in case of her death it would go to the daughter” and that she “understood” that either one of them could draw it. The witness also said that Mrs. Isherwood told him that she had done “the same thing” at the First National Bank in Cambridge Springs. When asked, on cross-examination, what the decedent’s <em>oion </em>words were, he testified as follows: “Q. She simply told you she had opened a like account at Cambridge Springs? A. A joint account. Q. Between her and Ruth Dowler? A. That’s right. Q. That is all she said, was it? A. That is right. . . . Q. Can you give us <em>any specific language that Mrs. Jennie Isherwood used </em>when she told you she had opened a joint account in the Cambridge Bank? A. Nothing any further than she told me that she was opening a joint account in the Cambridge Springs Bank, too, she opened it before she came into the bank at Edinboro.” (Emphasis supplied.) Mrs. Dowler was disqualified as a witness under the Evidence Act of 1887 and Mr. Isherwood had predeceased his wife. The status of the account in the Edinboro bank is not here involved.</p>

In <em>Mardis v.

In the <em>Mader </em>case, a father had a savings account in each of two banks. With respect to the one account, he changed the name of the depositor from himself to himself and a daughter as joint depositors and likewise, he changed the name of the depositor of the other account from himself to himself and another daughter as joint depositors. Stamped on the signature card for the account first above mentioned and signed by both depositors was an agreement conferring upon each the right to draw individually on the account during the lives of the depositors with the right in the survivor to any balance remaining upon the death of the other depositor. In the case of the other account which had been changed on the ledger sheet of the bank from the name of the father to the father and daughter and had been “apparently so entered on a later passbook”, there was no signature card or other written agreement between the depositors conferring on the daughter a present individual right in the account. In an opinion by Mr. Justice Linn for this court it was held that the right of survivorship was an incident of the joint account first above mentioned but not in respect of the other joint account for the reason that, in the latter instance, <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>—“There is no evidence that would support a gift executed ‘by assignment or by other writing which... would indicate a present intention to pass right of possession to the donee’ (Mardis v.

Indisputably, there was no actual delivery of the pass book; Mrs. Isherwood retained possession thereof throughout her lifetime: see <em>Crist’s Estate, </em>supra.
