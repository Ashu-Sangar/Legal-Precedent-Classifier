This administration is subject to the scrutiny of the courts, who restrain or otherwise pass on charges of breach of trust.</p>

The record shows no fraud on the part of the trustees; they acted in good faith; the challenged action is within the provisions of the will. Why then, on the life tenant’s exception, did the learned judge set aside the redemption of the preferred stock shown in the second account? He leaves no doubt on the subject: he states that, “In voting for redemption, Mr. Flagg was duty bound to serve the best interests of the trust, and was also duty bound to serve the best interests of the corporation. He could not do both at once. It is unnecessary to decide which interest he did in fact serve; <em>the existence of the conflict of interests ipso facto disqualified him </em>from acting. . . . Again, it is unnecessary to determine whether he was in fact influenced even to the slightest degree by any selfish motive in voting for redemption; <em>it is the conflict of interests rather than lad faith </em>which is the determinative factor. It seems obvious that Mr. Flagg’s duty of loyalty to the trust was not undivided. . . . This court is bound to conclude, therefore, that when the trustees voted for the redemption of the preferred stock, and then surrendered the stock pursuant to such call for redemption, they were unable to consider solely the best interests of the trust. Consequently, the transaction cannot receive judicial approval.” (italics supplied). The learned judge apparently thought that opportunity to do wrong was, <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>under this will, the equivalent of doing wrong. His conclusion that “the existence of the conflict of interest ipso facto disqualified him from acting” and that “the conflict of interests rather than bad faith ... is the determinative factor,” cannot be allowed to set aside the intention of the testator manifested in his will.</p>
    <p id="b147-5" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[153,627,1152,1032]]]'>The will shows that the testator had the conflict in mind when he made it and left it to be one of the conditions of his testamentary dispositions to be dealt with during administration. He knew the preferred stock was issued subject to redemption (he had the business, theretofore conducted as a partnership composed of himself and his son, incorporated in 1922) and he knew that by his bequest he was giving unrestricted voting powers in the corporation to his son who had been his partner. In the twelfth paragraph of the will he authorized his son to buy all the preferred stock at the redemption price. The conferred right to exercise all these plenary powers of ownership necessarily modified or displaced'the otherwise absolute limitation against self-dealing. This record shows that the conflict of interest did not disqualify the trustees; it shows that they acted in good faith in what they, acting as reasonable men <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> thought was for the best interest of the trust. If they had acted prejudicially the court would have had something to go on.</p>

Griswold Flagg, 3rd. executed various trusts of common stock for the benefit of his children, appointing himself and the Pennsylvania Company trustees. These trusts, the life tenants contend, increased the conflict of interest, but, as we have said, the test in such cases is not in the quantum of possibly conflicting interest, but in the administration which is always subject to the scrutiny of the orphans’ court. Neither need we <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>enlarge on the position of the Pennsylvania Company as testamentary trustee, though, on the question of redemption, it may be noted that soon after the testator’s death, Mr. Sayre, Vice President in charge of trusts, a member of the board of the Flagg company, concluded the trust investment in the preferred stock was too large for prudent investment and began his efforts, ultimately successful, to have it reduced. And there was reason for this as the facts were presented at that time. When testator died in 1934, the dividend on the preferred stock had not been earned and was in arrear $10.50 per share; by 1940 this arrearage had increased to $25.60. It is well known that the incomes of metal working industries such as the Flagg company picked up and increased rapidly and largely with the approach of the war, wiping out red accumulations and changing the balances into black. In the ten year period from 1931 to 1940, the company’s average net profits were $47,181.00 per year against preferred stock dividend requirements approximating $102,-000 per year; only in 1940 did the corporation earn its annual preferred dividend requirements. During the war years 85% of the company’s business was with the United States government.</p>

Another vice president, described as the “chief investment officer” of the Pennsylvania Company testified, “It was a thoroughly and is a thoroughly unsatisfactory investment for a trust fund. If you desire I can go further. The Company is a small company in its industry, the industry is highly competitive, it is the prince-pauper type of industry; in other words a lot of money can be made in good years and very little in bad years. The stock has no market whatever and the amount of the stock which was originally $1,700,000. is now $1,300,000. or $1,000,-000. is too large — depending on others is too large for <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>the size of it. In other words annual dividends are too big a burden for this Company to carry. It is much better $1,000,000 than $1,700,000.”</p>

We do not wish to impair the value of the rule against self dealing when properly applied. Testamentary provisions must be given effect notwithstanding the existence of the self-dealing rule; it is not the abstract conflict but the administration that is decisive and administration is subject to the control of the court.
