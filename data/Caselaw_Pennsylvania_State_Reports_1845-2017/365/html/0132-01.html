Smith, co-defendant, into the front of a restaurant owned by Renee Lanteigne and Madeline M., his wife,' plaintiffs. To recover for the property damage and for personal injuries to the wife-plaintiff, this action in trespass was instituted and resulted in verdicts for <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>plaintiffs against both defendants. Motions for judgment n. o. v. and new trial by defendant Smith were dismissed and judgments were entered in the sum of $5,247.51 against defendants. Smith then filed this appeal, conceding Duffy’s negligence, and raising as the sole question the sufficiency of the evidence to show that Duffy was his agent.</p>

Duffy operated an automobile repair shop adjoining Smith’s showroom and from time to time did repair work on cars owned by Smith. He also had an arrangement with Smith whereby Smith would pay him a commission on any automobiles he, Duffy, might sell. On the morning of the accident Duffy was driving an Oldsmobile owned by Smith and bearing a dealer’s license plate No. A922S which had been issued to “Royal Sales”. He was riding on the wrong side of State Highway Route 309, just north of the Borough of Quakertown, Bucks County, when he collided with a truck going in the opposite direction. Following the collision the car careened, out of control, into the front of plaintiffs’ restaurant, known as “The Pines”, causing personal injuries to the wife-plaintiff and extensive damage to the building.</p>

With that amendment the language of the <em>Morgan </em>case, quoted above, becomes equally applicable to cars driven by employes of the dealer. It can no longer be presumed that an employe driving an automobile with dealer’s tags is acting within the scope of his employment since he might, with equal legality, be using the vehicle for his own personal pleasure.

There was no legislative restriction or limitation that the automobile be used on the owner’s business to support the presumption. As is well known, it is entirely lawful for the owner of a business car to loan it to whomsoever he chooses for such person’s own uses and pleasure.

Its essentiality to the proper protection of life and limb, as Avell as property, under modern automotive uses has been cogently observed: Wig-more on EAddence, 3rd Ed., Vol. IX, § 2510 (a).</p>

Duffy was not a <em>regular </em>employe of Smith and it is only a regular employe who may lawfully drive an employer’s car bearing dealer’s license plates on his own personal pleasure: see Act of 1939, supra. And, there is not a word of evidence in this ease that Duffy was <em>a regular employe </em>of Smith. On the contrary, as the majority opinion discloses, he was an independent contractor who “. . . from time to time did repair work on cars owned by Smith . . . [and] had an arrangement with Smith whereby Smith would pay him a commission on any automobiles he, Duffy, might sell.” The dictum in the <em>Heinel Motors </em>case, supra, upon which the majority rely, did no more than suggest the inapplicability of the presumption when a car with dealer’s license plates is being driven by a member of his family at the time in question as permitted by The Vehicle Code of 1929. By a parity of reasoning, the amendment of 1939 could not be considered to have done anything further with respect to the presumption than render it inadmissible when an automobile equipped with dealer’s license plates is being driven by a regular employe for his own pleasure.</p>

There was direct evidence in the case, by way of admissions of Smith against interest, sufficient to warrant the jury’s finding of Duffy’s temporary agency at the time of the accident. In that situation, I think it is particularly regrettable that the question respecting the validity of the presumption has been injected and that the case is now being sent back for another trial limited to the one issue of the driver’s agency with the presumption attending the dealer’s license plates on the car ex-<a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>eluded from the jury’s consideration.
