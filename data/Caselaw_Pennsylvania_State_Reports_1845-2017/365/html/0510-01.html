Proponents, appellants herein, contend that the deputy register of wills had, in effect, probated the will despite the absence of a <em>formal </em>decree of probate and that the bond accompanying the formal caveat had <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>been filed too late. Appellants filed a petition for mandamus <em>in the Court of Common Pleas </em>seeking to compel tbe register formally to probate tbe will and issue Letters Testamentary. An answer was filed, issue joined and hearing bad. Tbe court filed an opinion entering judgment for tbe register, the appellee. This appeal followed.</p>
