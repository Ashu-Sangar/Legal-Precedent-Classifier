On the evening of September 13,1949, the victim, 52 years of age, a small man of about 5 feet 4 inches, and weighing between 128 and 134 pounds, was met on the street in the Borough of Corsica by defendant, 59 years old, a large husky man, 6 feet tall and weighing about 175 pounds. Defendant asked the victim about the payment of the alleged indebtedness. The victim denied that he owed defendant any money, stating that lumber had been delivered to defendant by the victim in payment of the bill. The defendant then said that he would sue the victim. De<a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>fendant alleges that the victim laughed aloud, whereupon defendant said “If I thought that you were laughing at me I would knock your ears off.” Defendant testified that his feelings were hurt by the laughter. He alleges that the victim, having crossed the street, returned and struck at defendant, knocking his glasses partly off his face. Defendant testified that he then replaced the glasses and struck the victim. (No witness observed this alleged occurrence). The victim fled. Defendant pursued him for about 15 feet. What happened thereafter is stated by Commonwealth witnesses and is summarized by the court below as follows: “William Love: ‘It looked to me like he (the defendant) grabbed him (the deceased) by the neck; threw him down, jumped on top of him and started hitting him on both sides of the head. After Buzard hit him once he sort of went limp. You could hear the blows hit/ and that ‘the defendant struck the deceased’s head five or six times.’</p>

Some witnesses saw three blows, other witnesses saw four, five and six blows, respectively. Some witnesses said that the blows were violent and audible; that the blows continued until the deceased said he had enough and thereafter until William Riggs said, £He has enough, stop.’ ” Other witnesses testified that the defendant struck but two blows and kicked the victim once after defendant was told to stop. After this the defendant arose from the victim’s body and walked away about eight feet. The victim was then unconscious and died immediately thereafter, before he could be removed to a hospital.</p>

The legislature has divided murder into two classifications, murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. All murder perpetrated by poison or lying in wait, or any wilful, deliberate or premeditated murder or any murder which shall be committed in the perpetration of certain felonies, is murder in the first degree. Every other kind of murder is murder in the second degree: Act of 1939, June 24, P. L. 872, sec. 701, 18 PS 4701. As the killing was unlawful, we are required to examine the evidence <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>to ascertain whether the jury could.find, beyond a rea: sonable doubt, that <em>'malice; </em>in its . legal sense, existed. Malice has been defined as not only a particular ill-will, but a hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences and a mind regardless of social duty: <em>Commonwealth v.

However, the Commonwealth may show, and the jury is not precluded from finding, that malice existed even though a deadfy weapon was not used. Malice may be found from the attending circumstances. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

This contention is based upon the fact that deceased’s skull was not fractured, and also because the <em>brain </em>was not examined. It is maintained that there is no evidence from which to conclude that death was caused by the blows on the head. But the doctor who examined the body, and made an autopsy, testified that he examined the face and head externally, and opened the head and examined it. He also opened and examined the lungs and heart and made other examinations of the body. The doctor testified that, in his opinion, death was caused by hemorrhage and shock due to blows on the head and face. The jury could find that the blows by defendant caused the death of Waldo Ditty.</p>

We note that defendant does not contend that his statement was untrue or that he was coerced in making it. He objects because he was not informed before making the statement that Waldo Ditty was dead. Pie does not allege in what manner such knowledge would have affected the <em>truthfulness </em>of his statement. We therefore can see no error in admitting the statement. The prime concern in such a matter is the truthfulness of the statement or confession: <em>Commonwealth v.
