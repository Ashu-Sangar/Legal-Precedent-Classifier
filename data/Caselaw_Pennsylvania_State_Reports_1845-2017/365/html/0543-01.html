The building is located on the south side of U. S. Highway Route 30. The highway running east and west consists of two paved roadways, a dual highway. The southern side is used for traffic moving east <em>from </em>Pittsburgh (outbound) and the other or northern side is used for traffic moving west (inbound) <em>to </em>Pittsburgh. This highway is one of the important ones of the county and is heavily traveled. Between the two paved portions of the highway are two sets of open trolley tracks, built on stone ballast and wooden ties, with no surface paving, upon which the defendant operates its trolley cars. The trial judge, in his opinion for the court en banc, said: “Opposite the skating rink there is a passenger stop for street cars going in both directions, and long platforms have been constructed and maintained by the Company on its right-of-way. The outbound platform is 107 feet long, and the inbound 86 feet long. The westerly ends of the two platforms are about opposite each other, but the outbound platform extends about 21 feet eastwardly towards East Pittsburgh beyond the inbound platform. Between the two platforms are the open tracks of ties, ballast, and four 5-inch T-rails. There <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>is an asphalt crossing or crossover about 10 feet wide which goes over the tracks at grade and joins the two platforms. The center of this asphalt crossing is 25 feet eastwardly from the westerly ends of the platforms. Towards the easterly ends of the platforms there are car stop signs on an overhead wire. On the night of the accident an inbound street car was at the eastern end of the inbound platform taking on passengers. It was stopped in such a manner that the front door was opposite the platform, but the rear of the car extended back beyond the platform.”</p>
    <p id="b604-4" data-blocks='[["BL_604.4",604,[226,881,1153,865]]]'>The young women came out of the skating rink around 11 p.m., and intended to take a trolley car on the inbound tracks to Pittsburgh. The night was clear and cold. As they came out of the building they observed a trolley car, which they desired to take, standing on the inbound track at the platform taking on passengers. They also observed an outbound trolley, approaching from Pittsburgh, about a block or more away. They hurried across the paved roadway (southern part moving east) and reached the outbound platform. Still hurrying they crossed the platform and entered upon the outbound tracks, attempting to cross over the tracks and reach the inbound trolley car still standing taking on passengers at the inbound platform. They were struck on the east bound track by the oncoming trolley car.</p>

After careful consideration of the matters involved, it is our opinion that the trial judge erred in permitting the case to be developed along lines applicable to the principles governing permissive crossings.

While we believe that the doctrine of permissive crossings over street car tracks in rural districts may exist for pedestrians using the way to cross the tracks, here the plaintiff was not a pedestrian as such, but was an intending passenger moving across the tracks to board a street car standing at the lower end of the inbound platform immediately under the overhead street car signs.</blockquote>
