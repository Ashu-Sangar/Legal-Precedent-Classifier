The .court dismissed the petition on the ground that the provision for the widow was unreasonable and grossly inadequate and that the decedent had not made a full and fair disclosure to his fiancee of his worth.</p>

The parties agreed that the actual value of the Doctor’s real estáte at the time was $70,100., so that he made a substantially correct disclosure of his real estate. However, at the time of the ante-nuptial agreement, the bank stocks had an actual value of $86,152.50; Jersey and other stocks $147,379.98; bonds $249,778.23; cash in banks $36,-376.55. In other words the Doctor had disclosed personal property of $132,000., whereas the actual value of his personal property was $519,727. (less liabilities of $10,500). The Doctor had also conveyed under a trust agreement a major portion of his estate to a trustee for the benefit of his descendants, viz, insurance policies which had a cash surrender value of $67,134.
