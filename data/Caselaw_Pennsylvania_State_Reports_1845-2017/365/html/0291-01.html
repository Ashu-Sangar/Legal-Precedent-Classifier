The victim had several beers. He also was securing signatures to a union petition. Morton L. Smith, the business agent for the union to which defendant belonged, was also in the Sternewirt at this time. At about 4 P.M. the victim left the plant in the company of two men, Witt and Am-berg, employed in the same department (the fermenting room of the brewhouse) and he was walking between them. As the victim and his companions were walking on a street adjacent to the brewery the defendant was standing alone behind a pillar near the brewery plant. The defendant came from behind the pillar and followed behind the three men. He overtook them and “started swinging” at the victim and struck him. The victim turned, apparently recognized the defendant, and said, “It’s Gus Dorazio.” In turn the victim started to run down Edward Street back towards the brewery. The defendant followed in close pursuit. As the victim ran up the street he passed Smith, the rival union’s agent, who put his hand out, whether or not to stop the victim is not clear. The victim ran into a brewery building known as the brew house; he ran up a flight of steps and passed through a door into a corridor. The Commonwealth’s witness stated that neither Blomeyer nor defendant fell as they went up the steps and passed through the door immediately fronting on these steps. Immediately thereafter eye-witnesses observed the victim on the floor of the corridor either “in a crouched <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>position” or lying on his left side; <em>the defendant was .standing over Blomeyer punching him, repeatedly in and about the head and body. </em>Witt, one of the men who had been walking with the deceased had followed the flight and sought to pull defendant away from the victim. The defendant beat Witt, knocked him down several times and struck him until and after he said he had enough. The assistant brew master ran up to stop the defendant- and the defendant struck him in the stomach and knocked him across the corridor, down on one knee, momentarily helpless and breathless. Two witnesses testified that defendant struck the victim, while he lay prostrate, at . least ten to fifteen times. After this incident the defendant ran or was pursued a short distance by an increasing crowd of brewery employes to a delicatessen store on Second Street, where he was apprehended and taken into custody by the police.</p>

Under cross-examination the doctor testified that there were various lines of fracture as though the head either hit or was hit by a hard object. He stated “it is seldom that a fist — a blow of a fist can cause a comminuted fracture like that, but I would not exclude that possibility.” The doctor after looking at the defendant’s hands testified he could have caused the injuries; he further stated that he did not <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>believe that tbe kind of fracture deceased sustained could result from tripping and striking bis head on a door, <em>that it was a smash fracture. </em>The doctor stated that it was bis opinion that tbe injuries were tbe result of <em>one powerful blow.</em>

Defendant concedes that under the Commonwealth’s evidence the conviction may be sustained. But he complains that the trial judge erred in charging the jury that even if they believed that defendant struck no blows and that the deceased sustained a skull fracture in a fall, nevertheless, they could find defendant guilty if he was an unprovoked aggressor and caused the decedent to flee, fall and injure himself.</p>

It does not make any difference in this case as to the defendant’s guilt or innocence whether Blomeyer’s skull was fractured by his head hitting the door or was fractured by the blows of this defendant — that is, if that fracture occurred when Blomeyer was running away from an attack by Dorazio, if he had sought to escape Dorazio and was running away and while running away he stumbled and fell on those steps and fractured his <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>skull, this defendant is responsible for it. Let us assume that the defendant started the attack, as the Commonwealth contends. Where a man starts a wilful and wanton attack upon another and that person seeks to escape by running away and in the haste to get away he stumbles and falls and hits his head on a concrete curb, the man who is threatening him and pursuing him is responsible for the consequences of that fall. When a chain of circumstances is put into action by a defendant, he is responsible for the reasonable and probable consequences of that chain of circumstances. Therefore, it is not important whether Blomeyer’s skull was fractured by a fall against the door or by the application of the fists of this defendant. . . .</p>

It is not always necessary that he must have intended a personal injury to such person. But it is necessary that the intent with which he acted shall be equivalent in legal character to a criminal purpose aimed against life. Generally the intent must have been to commit either a specific felony, or at least an act involving all the wickedness of a felony. And if the intent be directly to produce a bodily injury, it must be such an injury as may be expected to involve serious consequences, either peril<a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>ing life or leading to great bodily ham. There is no rule recognized as authority which will allow a conviction of murder where a fatal result was not intended, unless the injury intended was one of a very serious character which might naturally and commonly involve loss of life or grievous mischief. Every assault involves bodily harm. But any doctrine which would hold every assailant as a murderer where death follows his act, would be barbarous and unreasonable. ... In general, it has been held that where the assault is not committed with a deadly weapon, the intent must be clearly felonious, or the death will subject only to the charge of manslaughter. The presumption arising from the character of the instrument of violence, is not conclusive in either way, but where such weapons are used as do not usually kill, the deadly intent ought to be left in no doubt. There are cases on record where death by beating and kicking has been held to warrant a verdict of murder, the murderous intent being found. But where there was no such intent the ruling has been otherwise. . . . The willful use of a deadly weapon, without excuse or provocation, in such a manner as to imperil life, is almost universally recognized as showing a felonious intent. See 2 Bish. Cr. L. §§680, 681. But where the weapon or implement used is not one likely to kill or to maim, the killing is held to be manslaughter, unless there is an actual intent which shows a felonious purpose.”</p>

That illustration does not establish a minimum test of what is required to constitute “serious bodily harm.” It is unnecessary to now detail what constitutes such harm. We agree, however, that it is not necessary that the injury be intended to be permanent or dangerous to life, it is malicious to intend injury such as to seriously interfere with health and comfort: <em>Reg. v.

This is, of course, correct but it overlooks the fact that we have before us a total pattern reflecting on the existence or non-existence of defendant’s malice. The error in appellant’s argument is in assuming that only the events up to the point of the alleged fall may be considered in determining the character of defendant’s act. The events immediately following the pursuit are evidence of the intent and state of mind of the defendant when the pursuit began. These events show a brutal, persistent attack upon a helpless, non-resisting victim; they show a measure of depravity and hardness of heart, a recklessness of consequences and a mind regardless of social <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>duty which imports malice: <em>Com. v.

He instructed the jury upon condition that it find “an unlawful and <em>malicious </em>attack upon Blomeyer.” (Emphasis supplied.) The lengthy portion of the charge, just quoted above, was followed by the sentence, “The important question is, who started the fight and who was the pursuer and continued to fight and under what circumstances was the pursuit conducted and the continuation of the fight conducted.” The trial judge was clearly charging on the basis of the Commonwealth’s evidence in relation to the single fact that thé fatal injury resulted from a fall. There'is no basis for defendant to read into this portion of the charge the other facts which defendant offered. The jury could properly infer that defendant’s malice was a continuing factor from the moment the onslaught began. Bearing in mind that the purpose of the manslaughter and murder distinction is for the purpose of determining the heinous character of the offense and to determine appropriate punishment it would defeat the object of the rule were we to suppose that the character of an attack depends solely on the chronological order in which the nature of the attack manifests itself.</p>
