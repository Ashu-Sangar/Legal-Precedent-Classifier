The defendant company contends that it was vacated as a tannery building — that it was not occupied and operated as such, that therefore this policy is void under this clause in the 7th condition of the policy, the language of which condition is this: “This policy will not cover unoccupied buildings, unless insured as such, and if the premises insured shall be vacated without the consent of this company indorsed hereon, or if the property insured be a manufacturing, establishment or mill running in whole or in part over or extra time, or running at night, or if the same'shall cease to be ope<a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>rated without the consent of the company indorsed hereon, this policy shall cease and determine.”</p>

This point, gentlemen of the jury, we confess, is not free from difficulty in our minds. There are numerous authorities on this point, bat of all the several authorities on the subject there is not one which covers exactly the point in controversy in this case. But it nevertheless becomes our duty to instruct you what we deem the law under this provision or condition of this policy. If you believe the facts as they are proven in this case, the plaintiff,i as far as he himself is concerned, has paid the premium.. You will notice that the condition is, “or shall have neglected to pay the premium.” This is the whole condition on that point. To this point the plaintiff calls Mr. Reed, one of the insurance firm of R. E. Munson &amp; Co., of Philipsburg, and by him they present testimony to show that John Erb the insured came to him and solicited insurance upon this building, and 'that he (Reed) applied to Clifford B. Pease, of Boston, Mass., to have insurance placed upon this building.

But Pease could not have entered into a contract or agency with these parties in this case, and delivered to them this policy without the payment of the premium; if he had done ho, it would have been a violation of the rights of the defendants in this case, and there could be no recovery under such a state of facts.

Upon these several points the plaintiff produces testimony to show what the facts really were in the case. [The first witness called was Mr. Reed, -who testified to you that on the 14th day of August, 1882, he wrote'this letter to the Lebanon Mutual Insurance Company: “Gentlemen — The property insured under policy 20934, special No. 1952, was burned August 10th, 1882. The risk was placed by us through C. B. Pease, of Boston, Mass. Please advise what steps we shall take in the matter, and oblige, yours truly, R. Munson &amp; Co.” Mr. Reed also testified that he thought he had telegraphed to the company' of the loss, but he was not sure. The testimony upoox the subject therefore is, that the first notice the insurance company received of this loss was this letter written on the 14th August, 1882, mailed on that day to the Lebanon Mutual Insurance Company, at Jonestown, Pa. There is no denial that the company received this notice, and this letter is produced by them, as we understand, through a notice served on them by plaintiff’s counsel in the case. This question, then, that we are requested to instruct you upon, we say to you, that if you believe this letter was received by the company, that under ithe first part of this eighth condition of this policy there was such notice given such preliminary notice as is required by that condition of this policy, if you find there was a loss at that time.] (Third assignment of error.)

The title, it is conceded, had been in one Dr. Myer, from whom, on the 25th of April, 1882, it was sold by the sheriff, and purchased by John G. Love. Before the sheriff’s return of the sale, Love agreed to sell the property to <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>John Erb, the plaintiff below, but, by some blunder, the sheriff returned the property as sold to Elizabeth J. Erb, instead of John Erb, and made the deed to her. John Erb testified that he made the'contract with Love for his own benefit, that he paid for it with his own money, and that the letter, which the sheriff says he received, directing the deed to be made in the name of his mother, was not written or authorized by him. Elizabeth J. Erb, his mother, testified that she had no' claim, and never pretended to have any claim to the property ; that she neither paid, nor furnished the money to pay for it, and that she never knew the title was in her name until the fact was disclosed during the trial of the cause. This testimony was wholly uncontradicted, and the learned court correctly instructed the jury that if they believed the facts to be as stated, the title of John Erb, for all the purposes of this case, was sufficient. If the facts alleged are assumed, John Erb was, in equity, the absolute and sole owner of the property; he held in trust for no one, but in his own right, and was entitled, at any time, to a conveyance. The title of his mother was the bare legal title, and was to her utterly and absolutely worthless. It was not essential that John Erb should have been invested with the legal title-if he was the sole, beneficial owner of the property: Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Wilgus, 7 Norris, 107; Penn’a Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 6 Out., 568.</p>
    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[281,1425,1162,987]],["BL_173.1",173,[178,427,1167,904]]]'>The second ground of defense is equally without merit. One of the conditions of the contract is that “ if the assured shall have neglected to pay the premium,” the policy shall be null and void. The original negotiation for this insurance was between! John Erb and R. E. Munson &amp; Co., general insurance agents and brokers, at Phillipsburgh, Penn. The application and survey were forwarded by R. E. Munson &amp; Co. to Clifford B. Pease, an insurance broker of Boston, Mass., who sent them to the home office of the Lebanon Mutual Insurance Company at Jonestown, Penn. Neither Munson &amp; Co., nor Pease, were the general agents of the defendant company, nor until this time pretended to have any authority to act for or in behalf of the company. On the 5th of June, 1882, the policy in suit, containing an acknowledgment of the receipt of $30, the cash premium, was by the company executed and forwarded to Clifford B. Pease, the Boston broker, who was thus intrusted with the delivery. Although not the agent of the company, in any general sense, he thereby became the agent for this particular purpose upon payment of the premium. The agency is necessarily implied from the nature of the transaction itself; the policy was placed in his hands for the very purpose of delivery, and the delivery, by its express terms, was conditioned upon payment of the premium; it is clear, therefore, that the <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>authority of Pease was limited accordingly. The paper was intrusted to him, as was said in Marland <em>v. </em>Royal Ins. Co., P. F. S., 896, “to be handed over if the- premium was paid.” The case at bar is readily distinguishable from Pottsville Co. <em>v. </em>Minnequa Springs Co., 4 Out., 137, in this, that it was there stipulated, the insurance, whether original or continued, should not be considered as binding, until the actual cash payment of the premium “into the office of the company”; and also, that the premium in fact never reached'the person whom the company had authorized to receive it. The <em>company </em>might have retained the policy until the premium was paid, or they might have sent it directly to the insured, with instructions to remit the amount; in either case, the contract would have been ineffective until the conditicfi of the policy had been complied with. But, they chose to send it to Pease, with an acknowledgement of payment, for delivery to the insured, and this act of the company must be taken as an authorization of Pease to receive the money. We find no case, involving the question of insurance, full and clear upon this point, but the principle is one of general application, and it cannot be doubted that it is_ applicable here with like force and effect as in other cases.</p>
    <p id="b173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[223,1330,986,43]]]'>Another condition of the policy provided as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b173-5" data-blocks='[["BL_173.6",173,[176,1373,1164,1072]],["BL_174.1",174,[265,426,1166,256]]]'>“ This policy will not cover unoccupied buildings (unless insured as such) ; and if the premises insured shall be vacated without the consent of this company endorsed hereon: or if the property insured be a manufacturing establishment or mill running in whole or in part over or extra time, or running at night, or if the same shall cease to be operated without consent of the company indorsed hereon, this policy shall cease and determine.” . The buildings, it is conceded, were not unoccupied, and the first part of the clause quoted is therefore wholly-inapplicable to this case- It is contended, however, as the third ground of defense,, that the tannery had ceased to be operated as such, and under the remaining portion of this clause the force of the policy- has ceased and determined. The application is not in evidence, and the policy does not disclose that the insurance was upon an establishment in operation ; it is upon a tannery building with the machinery, boiler, engine, &amp;c. The property at the time of the. fire was occupied and used in precisely the same manner and for the same purposes as when the insurance was effected. Thomas Weston states, however, that he occupied a part of the building as a shoemaker shop, up until the time- of the fire. He further testified that there was some green bark left, and some liquor in the vats that would have gone.to waste, and he bought .some .half dressed stock hides, and tanned and finished -them out, and also some damaged hides that had been left in the vats, and <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>that some of them were left, a half dozen or so, at the time of the fire; that he occupied the finishing room every week more or less-for the purposes stated. Under these circumstances, the court was clearly right in saying to the jury that there was no such non-compliance with the above recited condition of the policy as would defeat the plaintiff’s recovery.</blockquote>
    <p id="b174-4" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[262,676,1164,604]]]'>As to the fourth and fifth grounds of defence little need be said. The eighth condition of the policy provides: “Persons having a claim under this policy shall give immediate notice thereof to the company, and within ten days thereafter render a particular account and proof thereof, signed and sworn to by them, setting forth, &amp;c.” “And until such proofs as above required are produced, and examinations and appeals permitted, the loss shall not be paj^ble.” The fire occurred Thursday, 10th August, 1882, and the property was totally destrojmd. The plaintiff resided'in Phillipsbfcirgh, some twelve miles distant. ' Hearing of the loss on Monday following 14th August, 1882, he employed R. E.
