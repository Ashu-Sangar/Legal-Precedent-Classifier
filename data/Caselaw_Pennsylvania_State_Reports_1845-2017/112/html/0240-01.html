On the trial of the case before Sassaman, J., the following facts appeared: In 1883 the Brooke Don Company invited proposals for the constructioxx of a storage reservoir in Birdsboro’. Among the bids put in was one in the naixxe of a firm, “Denithorne Brothers,” which was accepted. This firm was composed of John Denithorne and James Denithorne, one of the defendants. Isaac Kasson, an engineer’, who prepared the specifications, and subsequently supervised the work for the Brooke Iron Company, and to whom Richard Denithorne (a brother of John and James) was known as a contractor’, did not know of John Denithorne, and of James only by his letter making the bid in the name of “ Denithorne Bx-othei’S,” a firm Kasson supposed to consist of James and Richard. A contract was prepared by Kasson, or under his direction. It was drawn between the Brooke Iron Company and “ Denithorne Brothers,” <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>the individuals composing the firm' not being named. A bond accompanied the contract, in which, following the engineer’s mistake, the name of Richard was inserted as that of one of the partners. The papers were sent to James Denithorne for execution. He notified the engineer of the error, and it was then represented to Richard that as the papers were completely drawn, and as he had agreed to become James’s surety for the proper performance of the contract, his signing them, in their present shape, with James, would answer that purpose, and would make no difference as to his actual relation to the matter. He therefore executed them.</p>

It was a contract to perform á particular piece of work, and was not in itself a contract of partnership <em>inter se. </em>If so at all it was only so inferentially. It was at most the declarations of the defendants from which an inference of a partnership might perhaps be drawn, and was no more than holding themselves out to the world as partners in the absence of an actual partnership relation. In such cases it is settled by abundant authority that before a party can charge the alleged firm, or a person who has been held out to the world as a partner, that the party seeking to charge them has had knowledge of such fact and given credit upon the faith of it. In Burgan <em>v. </em>Cahoon, 1 Pennypacker, 320, it was said by the court below, and affirmed by this court, that “ the evidence from which you would have to find that he has so held himself out and acted as a partner must be his acts in connection with the circumstances that were known to the plaintiffs when they gave him credit, and not only must his acts have been such'as to justify a reasonable belief that he was a partner, but to hold him on that account you must further find, as a matter of fact, that they gave him credit as such, because, if they did not, his holding himself .out as a partner would do them no harm.” This proposition of law is accurately stated and is sustained by abundant authority. The rule is thus given in Collyer on Partnerships, vol. 1, § 19: “No person can be fixed with liability, on the ground that he has been held out as a partner, unless two things occur, viz., First, the alleged act of holding out must have been done either by him, or by his consent; and secondly, it must have been known to the person seeking to avail himself of it.” In Dickinson <em>v. </em>Valpy, 10 B. &amp; C., 140, it was said by Pahkb, J.: “If it could have'been proved that the defendant had held himself out to be a partner, not to the world, for that is a loose expression, but to the plaintiff himself, or <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>under such circumstances of publicity as to satisfy a jury that the plaintiff knew of it and believed him to be a- partner, he would be liable to the plaintiff in all transactions in which he engaged and gave credit to the defendant, upon the faith of his being such a partner.” See also Wood <em>v. </em>Pennell, <a href="/me/51/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="51 Me. 52" data-case-ids="665408" data-case-paths="/me/51/0052-01">51 Me., 52</a>; Vice <em>v. </em>Anson, 7 B. &amp; C., 409; Wright <em>v. </em>Powell, <a href="/ala/8/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Ala. 560" data-case-ids="8497668" data-case-paths="/ala/8/0560-01">8 Ala., 560</a>. It is useless to multiply authorities. We regard this as settled law.</p>
    <p id="b258-6" data-blocks='[["BL_258.5",258,[281,764,1177,464]]]'>Had the offer of this agreement been accompanied by a further offer to show that the plaintiffs knew of its existence at the time they sold the goods in question, and acted upon the faith of it, we are of opinion that it would have been competent. But there was neither allegation nor proof of such a-state of facts, and outside of this paper there was no evidence of the partnership to submit to the jury, while the defendants’ evidence was strong that no such partnership existed in fact, and that the paper was never intended to create one. In this view of the case the remaining assignments of error are not deemed material.</p>
