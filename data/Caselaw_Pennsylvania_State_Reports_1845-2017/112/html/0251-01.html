Both applications were approved on the 5th day of September, 1874, and on the same day two certificates of membership were issued, one in the sum of $2,000.00, and the second in the sum of $8,000.00. At this time he was already well advanced in years and poor. He had a minor son Thomas, and desiring to make some provision for him, it was stipulated in the certificates that the sum of $100 should at his death be paid out of the proceeds of each of the said certificates to said son Thomas. The beneficiary in both of said certificates was John N. Levy, who forthwith assigned his interest in the same to James Ruth. James Ruth paid all fees and costs of obtaining said certificates and all assessments made upon the same during the lifetime of Benjamin Katterman, up to the time of his death. He died on the twentieth day of March, 1882. The amount thus paid by James Ruth to the Society was $1,951.40. Nothing was paid by Benjamin Katterman, his wife, or any of his children. Immediately after the death of Benjamin Katterman there was a protest entered on the part of some of the heirs to the payment by the Aid Society of the proceeds of the two certificates to James Ruth. A compromise was thereupon effected between Frank Katterman, Anna Wise, Agnes Foreman, Tilda Smith and George Wise (being all the heirs except the widow and the minor son) and John Levy, who acted for James Ruth.</p>

It was a settlement (a good one they no doubt thought) in which the administrators and all the heirs had joined. It was after this assignment receipt and settlement had been effected that there appeared the decision in the case of Gilberts. Moose, 8 Outerbridge, 74. It was then that the idea of a suit against James Ruth occurred to these administrators. James Ruth set up as a defence a settlement with all the heirs. Now it has been well settled in Whiteside <em>v. </em>Whiteside, 8 Harris, 473; Dundas Appeal, 23 P. F. S., 474, and numerous other decisions, that ‘‘The Orphans’ Court alone has authority to ascertain the amount of a decedent’s property and order its distribution among those entitled to it.” But here the entire estate of Benjamin Katterman, deceased, for these certificates were substantially all he had, had been assigned to James Ruth, and for a valuable consideration. The heirs, among whom were the administrators themselves, had a perfect right to make such assignment. We have never yet heard that an heir had no right to assign his interest in an estate, or in any particular part of an estate; in fact it frequently happens that heirs assign their interest in estates whether.the same be reduced to á certainty or whether it be contingent.</p>

On the 5th of September, 1874, the United Brethren Mutual Aid Society of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, issued two certificates of membership, or policies, on the life of Benjamin Katterman, the one for two thousand dollars, and the other for three thousand. The beneficiaries therein mentioned were one John Levy and Thomas Katterman, a son of the assured, the latter, however, only to the amount of one hundred dollars in each policy. Eighteen days after the date of these certificates they were assigned bjr Levy to James Ruth, who paid all the costs and fees, together amounting to the sum of nineteen hundred and fifty-one dollars and forty cents. On the 20th of March, 1882, Katterman died. Immediately upon his death his heirs notified the Society of their protest against the payment of the policies to Ruth. Thereupon there appears to have been a compromise <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>between him and four of the heirs, which resulted in an assignment of their several interests to the defendant in consideration of the sum of three hundred and sixty-three dollars. The widow also interposed, and received five hundred dollars from the Society, in full payment of her claim. After deducting these several sums of monej'-, together with the two hundred dollars belonging to Thomas Katterman, a minor heir, there were paid over to Ruth three thousand and ninety-four dollars and sixty.cents. This sum, less assessments and. expenses, paid in the taking out and maintaining the policies, is now claimed by the administrators of the decedent’s estate. The learned judge of the court below held that these policies, as to Levy and Ruth, who had no interest in the decedent’s life, either as near relatives or creditors, were but speculative, and mere wagers on Katterman’s life, and that, under the doctrine of Gilbert <em>v. </em>Moose, 8 Out., 74, and similar cases, the defendant eould hold of their proceeds as against the representatives of Katterman’s estate, only the amount which he had expended in the way of fees and expenses. The position thus assumed by the Common Pleas is one that is too well settled to require discussion, nor can we discover that it was seriously controverted by the learned' counsel for the defence. Complaint, however, is made that the court refused to admit in evidence and submit to the jury the assignments of the four heirs, and the settlement with the widow. But we cannot see what legitimate purpose such admission eould have subserved.’ Had all the heirs, supposing them to have been, <em>sui </em>juris, released to Ruth, together with the widow, this might have operated, under the doctrine of Walworth <em>v. </em>Abel, 2 P. F. S., 870; Weaver <em>v. </em>Roth, 9 Out., 409, and similar cases, as an equitable defence.</p>

Indeed, it would have been impossible so to do, for the expenses of administration not having been ascertained, the amount to which the defendant, by virtue of his assignments,, would be entitled, could not, in this action, be certainly determined., Nor are Ixis rights at all affected by the judgment in this case, for, oxx final settlement of the estate, the Orphans’ Cotfrt has full power to judge between him and the widow and heirs, and award to him that which is justly his due. We must, therefore, dismiss the first and third assignments of error. Nor can we sustain the second. The complaint therein contained we give as follows: “The court erred in rejecting <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>the offer of the defendant, which is as follows: The defendant’s counsel proposed to show, by the witness on the stand,' that, in" settling policies of insurance with policy holders, it is the custom to allow an equated interest upon all moneys paid into the association in the shape of assessments, or, in other words, six per cent, interest on the whole amount for one half the time.” The court could not perceive the relevancy of this offer, hence rejected it. As we are unable to understand this proposition, we cannot say the court did wrong in not adopting it. The offer is not to prove a fact, as that the defendant had to pay something for which, in this suit, he was entitled to a credit, or that the company allowed him a rebate with which he should not have been charged, neither was the court asked to hold that he should be allowed interest on the money which he actually did pay, but that, “in settling policies of insurance with policy holders, it is the custom to allow an equatedinterest upon all moneys paid into the association in the shape of assessments.” Certainly the question concerned not a general custom of insurance companies, or of this particular company, but rather, what was the fact as to this transaction ? If, indeed, he was allowed the rebate here mentioned, it was an easy matter for him to have proved it, and proof of a custom would not have availed him unless he could show that it was applied to his case. It follows that his offer was altogether barren and useless, and the court did well to reject it.</p>
