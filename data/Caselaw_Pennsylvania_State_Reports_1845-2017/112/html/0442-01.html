How it may lessen and qualify the estate, is shown by the instance of a deed to a man and his heirs, <em>habendum </em>to him and the heirs of his body, or <em>vice </em>verm, which in either case carries the fee ; but while in the premises the estate conveyed is a fee simple, yet by the <em>habendum </em>it is qualified and lessened to an estate tail, with' a fee simple expectant thereon: Id.; Co.

Litt., 183 a; Cruise, tit. 32, ch. 21, § 80; Washburn on Real Property, 642. How it may enlarge the estate is shown by the case where an estate is given in the premises to the grantee for life, <em>habendum </em>to him and his heirs, in which case the grantee will take an estate in fee: Co.

Robert Glassey, in erecting buildings on his lot, built over on the ground of Leonard Frailey, fifteen and one half inches at one end of his lot and ten and one half inches at the other end. Glassey died, having devised his. property to the defendant. Frailey might have treated her as a trespasser, but he did not. He accepted her as a tenant. He leased that part of his ground covered by the buildings to the defendant, her heirs and assigns, and reserved a yearly rent to himself, his heirs and assigns, taking her covenant bind<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>ing herself, her heirs and assigns, to pay the rent. All this appears in the deed, which is in the handwriting of Frailey, and shows an intention to convey the fee. • The only part of the deed'whieh conflicts with this intention are the words in a subsequent clause of the deed, “for the term of five years,” and, as they are subsequent to the lease in fee, they cannot stand. Treating them as the habendum, they are repugnant to the premises, and therefore void, and must Ice rejected in construing the deed. Both cannot survive ; the estate conveyed cannot be a fee and also a term for years. It would be contrary to all the rules of construction to permit the <em>habendum </em>for years to override the lease in fee conveyed by the premises. The subsequent acts of the parties show the construction which they put upon the deed — that a fee was intended to be conveyed and not a term for years. When Frailey received the annual rent he described it in the receipts he gave as ground rent, which is a term usually applied to perpetual rents in this city, although it is also applied to rents reserved on long leases: see Cadwalader <em>v. </em>App., <a href="/pa/81/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="81 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="1044126" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0194-01">81 P. S. R., 194</a>; but not to leases from year to year. Eleven years after the date of the deed, when the defendant would have been a tenant from year to year, if the plaintiff’s contention is good, the defendant was called upon by Frailey to pay for surveying the lot. This is a charge usually paid by owners of the fee, and not by tenants from year to year. If we look at the circumstances surrounding the transaction, we. find that the defendant, owning permanent buildings, which by mistake had been erected on the ground in dispute, required a perpetual lease of the ground, to give her continual peace; and not a lease for a short term, which would only postpone the evil day when she would be called upon to take down her buildings. Everything concurs to show that a perpetual lease reserving a perpetual rent was intended; the contemporaneous construction of the parties proves it, and the surrounding circumstances confirm it.</p>

If indeed the inartificial paper should be treated as containing the essential parts of a deed of conveyance of a freehold estate of inheritance, without words which necessarily qualify the grant in fee, the limit in the <em>habendum </em>to an estate for years is void. But the learned judge has well shown “ that when the premises of a deed contain an express grant to a man and his heirs <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>for a te,vm of years, then the limitation for a term will qualify and lessen the grant in fee.”</p>
    <p id="b469-6" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[165,492,1172,259]]]'>The verbose description of the land has precisely the effect as if the most succinct. Two strips of ground are described, concluding with a clause as follows: “The above property situated in Mantua, West Philadelphia, Havourford and Thirty-fifth streets And now occupied by Ohs H Rainier and others.” All that is descriptive of the subject.</p>
    <p id="b469-8" data-blocks='[["BL_469.6",469,[166,753,1173,347]]]'>Aside from the description of the parties and the land, the agreement is brief, and is as follows: “ Leonard Frailey doth lease unto the said Jane Glassey, her heirs and assigns . . .. ; for the term of five years from the first day of December next, for the yearly rent of three dollars, which yearly rent the said Jane Glassey doth for herself, her heirs and assigns, covenant and agree to pay to the said Leonard Frailey, his heirs and assigns, the said rent.”</p>
    <p id="b469-10" data-blocks='[["BL_469.7",469,[168,1099,1174,391]]]'>It is plain that the grant is for a term of years. That the thing granted is described between the word “ assigns ” and the phrase limiting the term of the grant, is immaterial; the sense is the same as if the limiting words immediately followed the word “ assigns ” and preceded the words descriptive of the thing granted. There is no distinct part in the deed defining the estate ; this is done in the premises, and by the settled rule, already noted, a grant to a man and his heirs for a term of years, reserving rent, is a lease for the term.</p>
    <p id="b469-11" data-blocks='[["BL_469.8",469,[172,1490,1172,604]]]'>The intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the entire instrument, not from particular words or phrases without reference to the context; and the instrument shall operate according to the intention, unless it be contrary to law. When the meaning is doubtful, the circumstances at the making of the instrument and the subsequent acts of the parties are to be considered in determining the sense of the words. An estate in fee simple cannot be vested in a man without the word “ heirs,” but that word is often used in mere executory contracts for the sale of land, and in leases for a definite period of time. It is of no consequence what word is used to pass the estate, as if it be “ lease ” the context will show whether it is used to vest an estate for years, or for life, or in fee simple.</p>

The term was to begin on “ the first day of December next,” and it is not at all likely that it would have been so stipulated had it related to the occupancy of Rainier and others. In leases it is common to provide that the term shall begin at a future date. We see nothing in the circumstances or subsequent acts of the parties to show that they understood the agreement as anything more than a lease <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>for years. Certainly the receipts for rent written by unlettered persons are no more significant of the nature of the estate than the form and phrase of the agreement written by the same hand. The form of the deed and redundant words aid little in ascertaining the estate granted. .</p>
