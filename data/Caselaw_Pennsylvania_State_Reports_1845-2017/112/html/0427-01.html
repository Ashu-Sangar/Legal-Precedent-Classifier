In April, 1884, being unable to hold it longer, it was sold, subject to that mortgagefor $2,150, which was the highest attainable price. After deducting taxes, interest, etc., the net proceeds of the sale were $1509.42, which was a loss on the net value of the investment of $1,340.58. The property féalized an average rental of about $500 per annum, the rent, with the exception of a period of about two months, having been regularly paid; but the expenses for repairs and taxes and the interest upon the -first mortgage absorbed the entire, income after February, 1881, which was the date of the last payment to the life tenant.

It is certainly misleading to say that a trustee is safe so long as he exercises over his trust the same care which an ordinarily prudent man of business bestows upon his own. capital. The latter may with the utmost prudence engage in a multitude of enterprises which are forbidden to the former; he may loan his money on. call, he may purchase stock in corporations whose future success is a problem, or he may invest in junior incumbrances. If a trustee should so use his fiduciary funds, he would, in most cases, lay himself open to the accusation of bad faith. The law has recognized the distinction which we are endeavoring to state, and has named certain classes of securities as legal receptacles for trust moneys, leaving other investments to be vindicated by the trustee who selected them.
