In pursuance of this contract Dunkel visited Centre county and made contracts with sundry persons for the delivery of poles along the several lines referred to, subject to the inspection of the Telephone Company, and at prices considerably less than he was to receive from the company. In making these subcontracts Dunkel visited Lemont, among other places, and had a conference with William Thompson, the son of Moses Thompson, in reference to furnishing the poles for the lines from Lemont to the State College, and from Lemont to Boalsburg. The result of the conference was that Thompson agreed to consult his father and meet Dunkel in Bellefonte the next day and give him a definite answer.

A rich man may just as well have a just claim as a poor man, and vice-versa, and are equally entitled to the same consideration at the hands of courts and juries. These are facts not to be taken into consideration at all. All cases are to be tried by the law and evidence governing them. It is your duty to find the facts in the case, and apply the law as we lay it down in our general charge. Of course, if we make a mistake in the law, that can be corrected by reviewing the case in the Supreme Court. It is the duty of courts andjuries to learn and know as much about a case in the trial of it as is possible, and to know nothing about the parties, but to leave them out of their consideration entirely, and determine the case upon the law and evidence alone. In this same line, we. may" as well remark that this defendant, The Central Pennsylvania Telephone and Supply Company, is an artificial person, created by the Legislature of the State for a certain purpose. It is a corporation, it is not a natural person; it is the creation of law, but notwithstanding it being an artificial person, yet according to law it is entitled to the same rights as an individual would be, standing in the same relations, or in the same position. You are not to find a verdict against it, or in favor of it, because it is a corporation, nor are you to find a verdict in favor of the plaintiff because he has sued a corporation, but you are to find a verdict either for or against it upon the evidenee and facts governed by the law as we shall lay it down to you. Corporations being the creatures of law and not nat<a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>ural persons, do not act as natural persons do. Taking these parties in this case, Moses Thompson, being a natural person, makes his own contracts, or he may make them through his agents, but he still acts, when acting-through agents, for himself. But a corporation can only act through its ■ agents. There is no other way for it to transact any kind of business except through its agents, and its agents maybe few or many. [Now, taking this corporation, — we only have the fact that it is a corporation from what is implied by the name of the Central Pennsylvania Telephone and Supply Company, and the admission of the parties during the trial, — the charter of this corporation has not been given in evidence, therefore we have only the name to indicate to us that it is a corporation; nor do we know either what its specific powers are, except what we can gather from the name and the nature of its business. The name itself would indicate what the object and purposes of it are, for which it was incorporated — which would seem to be that it is to supply means for telephonic communication ; all know what that is — to erect and operate telephone lines, to erect lines, put up lines, and furnish such facilities and apparatus that are necessary to afford means for communication from one place to another. We all know what that is in practice. We say the name of the company would seem to indicate that these were the purposes and objects for which its charter was granted. Now, the word supply; what does that mean ? Why, that the company would furnish all the means required to perfect telephonic communication. We all know what is required to do this, and we know that one of the means required is the putting up of poles to stretch the wires on, or rather it is done by stretching the wire from one point to another, and the means of support for the wires are poles, which are put up for this purpose, and are then known as telephone poles.] (Fifth assignment of error.)</p>

Geiger "was agent for the company, but without any definite or' accurate statement of the scope of his authority, and it was. held competent for the' company't'o show what his powers weré, and that he' exceeded them, or.to even deny the agency itself. ‘í Thé extent-of an -agent’s' powers,” says the court-in that cáse; “ depends-, upon the'authority under which he'acts. This in ay be shown 'by his written instructions ór his coursé 'of dealing. It is true the public are not always bound by the private-instructions of the agent, and may;hold the. principal responsible, though the particular acts done are!in,excess of his private instructions. This was asserted in Adams Express Co. <em>v. </em>Schlessinger, 25 P. F. S., 246. It applies to cases' where the agent has been, held out to the world as such by the principal, allowed to exercise, enlarged powers from tinie. to time, and his acts therein have been ratified by his principal. -But this doctrine in no sense conflicts with’ the right of the principal to show that his agent in a given case exu ceeded his authority. The effect of- such evidence, when received, is for the jury.” It was erro.r, therefore, arbitrarily to 'determine the scope" of Malin’s authority from the mere; fact that he'was the “'superintendent,” and after.admitting proof of the manner, in which,, in specific instances, he was held out .to the world, to.exclude :the-evidence of his particular instructions.from-the company.</p>

What was said on this subject was not perhaps, in itself, absolute error, but its tendency, we think, was to mislead the jury. '</p>
    <p id="b148-4" data-blocks='[["BL_148.5",148,[247,721,1177,810]]]'>Nor do we think the learned court was justified in the comments made upon the letter of May 81st, 1883, from Dunkel to Thompson. The letter referred to is written in a style quite common in business communication. There is no room for the suggestion that it was “intended to convey a double meaning,” or that the writer purposed “ to express his meaning vaguely,” nor can it be construed to leave any impression upon the mind “ that there was some one else beside himself engaged in the transaction,” or raise an impression “ that he was acting for the company.” .It may be said, with propriety perhaps, that the letter does not antagonize or deny Dunkel’s agency, but it certainly contains nothing which is inconsistent with the claim of the defendants, that his purchase was on his own account. The exposition which the learned court gave of this paper-was one-sided, conjectural and argumentative. The letter, <em>prima facie, </em>imports a purchase by Dunkel himself, but if it appear by proper evidence, <em>aliunde, </em>that it was in fact written by Dunkel, acting as the agent of the company, it cannot be said to be inconsistent with that view of the case.</p>
    <p id="b148-5" data-blocks='[["BL_148.6",148,[245,1539,1173,816]]]'>The most serious error, however, into which the learned court fell was in giving to the jury binding instructions that, without regard-to the question of Dunkel’s agency, the company werp, in any event, bound for the price of 154 poles, which it is admitted passed the inspection, arid were applied to the use of the company. After the completion of this contract for furnishing poles for the several lines in Centre county, Dunkel made a settlement with the Telephone Company, at which he was paid the full amount of his contract price for poles furnished, less the amount of certain vouchers made out at his request directly to parties from whom he had purchased poles. Among these vouchers was one to Moses Thompson for one hundred and fifty-four poles, at one dollar and ten cents each, amounting to the sum of one hundred and sixty-nine dollars and forty cents ($169.40). This voucher Dunkel took to Bellefonte, and tendered to Mr. Thompson by telephone, who declined to receive it because it was not for a sufficient amount. He then returned the voucher to the office pf the Telephone Company, where it has since remained.</p>

The plaintiff is entitled to recover that amount, even though the jury should believe that there was no contract for the delivery of those poles between the plaintiff and this company, but that the contract was between Moses Thompson and S.. P. Dunkel; for the company has settled with Mr. Dunkel, and retained $169.40 for. Mr. Thompson, and they cannot now retain this $169.40, which they admit belongs to Moses Thompson. We therefore say to you that it is liable to Moses Thompson for that amount, for money had and received for his use. The plaintiff claims this, and as a principle of law we are bound to say to you that the point is well taken. According to their own showing, this money belongs to Moses Thompson.”</p>
    <p id="b149-6" data-blocks='[["BL_149.5",149,[185,1097,1177,554]]]'>Assuming that the company originally stood in no contract relation to Thompson, but received these poles under their agreement with Dunkel, and this in view of' the charge, must be assumed, the instruction of the court, quoted above, is manifestly erroneous. The company, by making a voucher in Thompson’s name, assumed no responsibility to him until that voucher was accepted. It was delivered to Dunkel, who tendered it to Thompson, in discharge of his own debt; the tender having been refused, no liability of the company was thus created. It is unimportant that the voucher was returned, and that the money is still on deposit with the company. Thompson, having declined to accept it, Dunkel might dispose of it as he chose.</p>
    <p id="b149-7" data-blocks='[["BL_149.6",149,[184,1660,1172,215]]]'>It is further contended on part of the company that the poles were to be paid for only when the contract was “ filled, and that the contract had not been completed, or fully .performed by the plaintiff at the time this suit' was brought.” This assignment of error cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b149-8" data-blocks='[["BL_149.7",149,[184,1874,1173,473]]]'>There is some evidence that Thompson, after the receipt of the letter of May 31st, 1883, objected to the size of the poles required. He said he could not furnish poles of that size, but being urged to go on, said he would do the best he could. It is shown that he furnished 154 poles of the required size, which were accepted, and there is some proof that 50 others of a less size, although at first rejected, were afterwards also accepted. If this be so, the contract would appear to have been <em>bona fide, </em>substantially performed. Besides, if this were not so, the parties would appear to have mutually dispensed with full performance.</p>
