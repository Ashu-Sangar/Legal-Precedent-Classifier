The court have the power to double the damages only where the jury have shown by the verdict that they have not exercised the right. It is competent for the court to double the damages in cases in which they are not doubled by the jury; but the jury must find the facts by which it is to be determined whether the defendant be liable to such damages.

It is claimed by the counsel for the plaintiffs here that the note made by the stenographer of an agreement of counsel is sufficient to prove that the jury assessed single damages only. In this view we cannot concur. It does not appear that such fact was brought to the attention of either the jury or the court. Without knowledge of any such agreement the jury could not have been influenced thereby.
