Seitzinger, a claim of $687.00, for services rendered to decedent and his wife, during decedent’s lifetime, continuously from January 1, 1880, to May 81, 1884. The claimant is a young man, unmarried, of about twenty-six years of age, aiid a grandson of. the decedent. At the time said services were performed he lived with his parents in a house on the rear end of testator’s lot. The deceased and his wife were respectively aged, in 1880, 85 and 75 years, and both somewhat enfeebled. They required considerable care and attention. Their children, all having families of their own', could not spare them the time necessary for their comfort, but, being deeply concerned for them and rtheir happiness, they had consultations among themselves respecting the feasibility of employing some suitable person .to .take care of their aged parents. They came <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>eventually to the conclusion that they could themselves attend to their wants and needs during the day-time, and that Henry M. Seitzinger, their grandson, who resided with his parents on the same lot, should remain with them during the nights. In pursuance of this understanding, the young man slept at the residence of his grandparents from January 1, 1880, to May 31, 1884, the time at which decedent’s death occurred, and attended to them. His services were' no doubt often irksome and unpleasant, and, during some months immediately preceding the death of both of said grandparents, were no doubt very burdensome and onerous. But I can gather, nothing from the testimony, except that during a very great portion of the time he stayed with them he had but very little to do except to sleep in the house. It is, however, not to be denied but that young Seitzinger attended kindly and faithfully to the wants and needs of his grandparents. He should be compensated for these services if the policy of the law does not intervene. The law, as a rule on this subject, does not allow compensation or remuneration to children or grandchildren for services rendered to their parents or grandparents, unless the same were rendered as servants. Under all the evidence submitted, I find that the nursing and attendance were not rendered as grandchild, but as servant. Hence claimant is entitled to recover. The claim is, however, excessive. I cannot see that it ever interfered with his regular daily employment, hence cannot have been as onerous as represented. I will therefore allow him for said services rendered to his grandparents the sum of $225.00, and $10 bill of costs for his witnesses.</p>

Seitzinger, the -claimant in this case, was the grandson of Amos Moyer, the decedent, whose estate is now for distribution; his claim is for personal services rendered in the care and nursing of his grandfather and grandmother, who were old and much enfeebled in health. Seitzinger, it is admitted, was a young, unmarried man, whose daily employment was in the boiler shops of the railroad company; he resided at home with his parents, but, from the 1st April, 1880, to 31st May, 1884, he slept in the house of his grandparents, and during the night-time gave them such attention as their condition required. During the greater part of this period he had but little to do, except- to sleep in the house; at times, the service he performed was doubtless unpleasant and burdensome, but it is admitted that he discharged his duty willingly and well.</p>

If' his claim is recoverable at all, it must, of course, be upon the footing of a contract, express or implied. There is no evidence whatever of any previous request, on the part of the grandfather, in pursuance of which the services were performed, nor of any contract by him with his grandson in reference thereto, nor of any express promise upon his part to pay, and unless; under the special facts and circumstances of the case, a promise may be implied, the claimant is not entitled to participate in the fund.</p>

The near relationship of these parties, by consanguinity however, tends strongly to rebut that presumption. In the absence of any family relation, the mere consanguinity of itself is perhaps insufficient for that purpose, but there are other facts and circumstances exhibited in the evidence, which, in view of their relation by blood, afford abundant, indeed irresistible, proof of their intention.</p>
    <p id="b307-7" data-blocks='[["BL_307.6",307,[142,1244,1182,942]]]'>The learned judge of the Orphans’ Court says: “ It is perhaps true that no express contract in so many words existed;” it is equally true that the circumstances under which the services were admittedly performed, as stated by the learned judge, preclude the idea of any promise implied. In his first adjudication he states these circumstances as follows: “The deceased and his wife were respectively aged, in 1880, 85 and 75 years, and both somewhat enfeebled. They required considerable care and attention. Their children, all having families of their own, could not spare them the time necessary for their comfort, but, being deeply concerned for .them and their happiness, they had consultations among themselves respecting the feasibility of employing some suitable person to take-care of their aged parents. They came eventually to the conclusion that they could themselves attend to their wants and needs during the day-time, and that Henry M.
