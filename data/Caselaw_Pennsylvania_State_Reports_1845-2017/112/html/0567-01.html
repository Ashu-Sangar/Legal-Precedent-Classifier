The two mines were entirely distinct and separate and there was no connection between them.

He was employed by them in the last of <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>July, 1882, as a slate-piclcer. Pie was a stout lad, tall for his age, being five feet, one inch in height, weighing about one hundred and ten pounds, and appearing to be fifteen or sixteen years of age. He was afterwards employed to “ sprag ” the cars at the head of the breaker. After that he applied to Gallagher, the inside foreman at the drift, for a place as driver boy, and such place being then vacant, was given to him. He had previously driven in the other mine. He began driving in the mine in which Gallagher was foreman about October 1st, 1882. On November 3d, 1882, he was killed by a fall of a “ slip ” or “ fault ” from the roof of the gangway at the edge of a breast. The negligence complained of was that the gangway — taken in connection with the width of the breasts opening out from it on both sides — was too wide to be safe without artificial supports or “proppings.”</p>

This gangway was eight feet high at the lower side and nine at the upper side. It was a counter-gangway, driven across the upper face of the breasts, opened up from a lower gangway, and from it other breasts had been opened and were being opened on the upper side.</p>

That the gangway in question was in an unsafe and dangerous condition, abundant warning had been given. There had been a fall of roof just previous to the occurrence of the fatal accident. Near the very point where the boy, Simoson, was killed a fall had come down on the track. A clearing away followed, but no props or supports were set up to prevent further falls. Death to an emploj’-é came at an early day afterwards ; and then, for the first time, that gangway was made secure.</p>

Without overruling these cases, which in principle are sustained by many others, we cannot see our way clear to adopt the ruling.of the court below as to the case in hand. The competency of the defendants’ mining boss does not seem to have been questioned; it was but alleged that he was negligent in not having the roof of the gangway properly secured by props or other appliances, which might have prevented the fall of the rock that killed the plaintiffs’ son. But that the employer cannot be made responsible for damages resulting to a servant from the negligence of a fellow servant, is a principle as old as the common law. Moreover, as the defendants had complied strictly with the 8th section of the Act of 3d of March, 1870, in providing a practical and skilful inside overseer, or mining boss, and as the]' had thus fulfilled the duty imposed upon them by the General Assembly, it is not for this or any other court to charge them with an additional obligation. As was said by our brother Paxson, in the ease last cited.: “ It is too plain for argument that if the defendants have not violated said Act they are not responsible.” To this doctrine we must adhere, and the more so that it is just and reasonable. The Act is one of great practical utility to the miner, and lays upon the proprietors of mines all the burthens they ought of right to bear. The]' must provide capable over<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>seers for their works, and they must furnish what, by such overseers, is required for the safety and welfare of the men engaged in those works. More than this they cannot do, for upon the judgment and skill of these practical agents they must depend quite as much as any of the men who are engaged in their mines. Bosses, however well intentioned and skilful, cannot always be on the watch ; occasionally they will fail in judgment, and at times may even be negligent; but of this, the workman is quite as well aware as his employer, and in entering upon the employment of mining he must assume the risks that are ordinarily incident thereto, among which are those accidents that may result from the negligence of co-employés, of whom, as we have seen, the mining boss is one. It follows that the court below should have affirmed without qualification the fifth, ninth and tenth points of the defendants, and as these errors require a radical reversal of the case, we need not notice the remaining assignments.</p>
