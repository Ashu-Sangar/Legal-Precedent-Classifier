Roney, went to Harrisburg as a <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>member of the legislature. Mr. Hooper was put in Roney’s place, and from January 1st, 1874, to 1st of June, 1874, Hooper acted as a receiving clerk, signing the pay roll as such and receiving the increased pay given a receiving clerk. After he began receiving he was required by the trustees to give a bond. He did so. His bond was as follows :</p>

Roney staid just one month, when he resigned and left, and Hooper again took Roney’s books and Roney’s desk, and acted as receiver. He receipted the pay roll as a receiving clerk, and was paid the salary of that position. He continued to receive and receipt for a receiving clerk’s salary from July, 1874, until he subsequently fled, a defaulter. On December 1st, 1874, Roney came back to the gas office, being told that he could do so, and that his resignation had not been accepted. He served during that month, and then on January 1st, 1875, went back to the legislature, and upon the death of one Neilson in April, 1875, Roney was made chief clerk.
