As to all other taxes this question was settled in the negative by the late Judge Woodward in The Township of Cumru <em>v. </em>The Directors of the Poor and House of Employment of Berks County, C. C. P., Berks Co., 183, April Term, 1864, 1 Woodward’s Decisions, p. 175. This would also, in principle, have held the defendant not liable for road taxes, but for the intervention of the Act of Assembly of the 5th day of April, 1848, P. L., p. 338, sec. 13, which says that the real estate belonging to the county of Berks, in the township of Cumru, shall be liable to the payment of road taxes in the said township. This would be definite and final in the determination by its legislative discretion had the matter been left to stand so. This section is a special enactment tacked on to a bill for other purposes, but it made positive law for the time being. The Constitution of 1874 for the State of Pennsylvania, art. 9, sec. 1, declares that all taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws, but the General Assembly may, by general laws, exempt from taxation public property used for public purposes, actual places of religious worship, places of burial, not used or held .for private or corporate profit, and institutions of purely public charity. In pursuance of this, now the fundamental law of the state, the legislature did, on the 14th day of May, 1874, enact that all hospitals.....and institutions of learning, benevolence or charity, with the grounds thereto annexed and necessary for the occupancy and enjoyment of the same, founded, endowed and maintained by public or private charity,.....be and the same are hereby exempted <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>from .all and every county, city, borough, bounty, road, school, and poor tax: Act 14th May, 1874, P. L., 158, sec. 1, Purd. Dig., 1596, pl. 90. This is a generalTaw to carry out a constitutional provision and would supersede and by implication repeal any and every private or special law inconsistent therewith. This law prevails now in this county.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_282.5",282,[289,670,1181,1596]]]'>It is admitted that defendants are a corporation under the Berks County Poor House Act of the 29th day of May, 1824, P. L. 200-6, and that these lands sought to be taxed, the buildings thereon erected, and the institution thereon conducted and maintained for about sixty years, was all done and paid for out of the funds and the treasury of the county of Berks, and that it was the institution for the maintenance and employment of the poor in and for said county. The whole affair required a continuous appropriation for the use of the poor drawn from the body of the people and their property by means of taxes levied upon them by the power of the county —collected and thus contributed. There is no question made that during all this time, and to this day, there was not an hospital, a department for the insane poor and place of employment kept there for the maintenance of the poor found within said county, who had no other means of support and maintenance. It cannot be successfully alleged or maintained that it éver was any source of revenue or profit to the said county. It is notorious that it annually requires a large amount of the public funds of the county to keep up this institution. No one is favored here above another — there are no class distinctions — all of the class of poor found within the county go there and are all kept, protected and maintained in one common home at the common expense of the county, which never has derived any revenue or profit therefrom. This makes it a purely public charity such as* contemplated by the Act of Assembly above referred to, and hence belongs to the class of properties exempted from the payment of taxes, including road tax. Many cases of this class have been before the Supreme Court, and in all of them, where the institutions were not in some way exclusive, but for the public good generally, and in no wise conducted for revenue or profit, they were held to be exempt. The only question is whether the present tax exemption law embraces the objects about which the controversy arises, and if it does, the statute is plain and conclusive. On this point we are clear that it is purely a public charity.</p>

    <p id="b285-6" data-blocks='[["BL_285.8",285,[145,879,1181,1558]]]'>We agree with the learned (judge of the court below that the property in question belongs to a public eharitjq and' as such is not taxable for road purposes by the township of Cumru. Not, indeed, because the Special Act of April 5th, 1848, authorizing real estate of the county of Berks, within the said township, to be taxed for road purposes, has been repealed by the General Act of 1874, but because the property in question does not belong to the county. By the Act of the 24th of March,. 1824, a distinct municipality was erected, whose jurisdiction in pauper cases was commensurate with the territorial limits of the county, and whose franchises were to be administered by three elective officers, designated iñ said Act as “ Directors of the Poor and House of Employment for the county of Berks.” These, by the statute, were constituted a body politic with perpetual succession, and were authorized to take and hold any lands or tenements within the said county, in fee simple or otherwise, “and erect, suitable buildings thereon for the reception, use, and occupation of the poor of the same county.” It certainly does not matter that the money used for the purchase of the land and the erection of the buildings was raised by assessments made by the County Commissioners, for the money thus raised was intended for the use of the poor district, and the municipalty known as “ Berks county ” had no interest in or control over it or the property it was used to purchase. That the taxes were to be assessed and collected by the county officers did not make the money thus raised any more the property of the county than does the assessment and collection of State taxes, by the same instrumentality, invest the county with the right thereto. In the one case these officers are trustees for the poor district, and in the other for the State. We repeat, therefore, the land and. buildings in question were exempt from township taxation, not because of the repeal of the Act of 1848, for we do not believe that the Act of 1874 worked any such result, but because the property belonged to the poor district and not to the county.</p>
