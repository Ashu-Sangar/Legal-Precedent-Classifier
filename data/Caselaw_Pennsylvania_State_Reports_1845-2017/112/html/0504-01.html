The principle is no invasion of the absolute right of property, for that absolute right involves a relation, in that it implies the right of each adjoiner, as against the other, to insist on a separation by a boundary more substantial than a mathematical line. This imaginary line is common, and so ought the real one to be, and it is only in the character of this that the difficulty lies which requires legislation. When it is constructed, the regulation of its enjoyment and repair is as plain as that belonging to any other property held in common. And there is nothing more severe in submitting the question of the sufficiency of walls in the city to the city surveyor, than there is in submitting the sufficiency of fences in the country to fence viewers. The principle is the same, and if the interests involved in the one case are greater than in the other, it is only because of the nature of city property, that it requires more expensive partition walls or fences than are required in the country.

L., 411, but it is equally applicable to Act of 1857 above quoted. The Act of 1849 is not given in Purdon, for the reason probably that the editor regards it as superseded or supplied by the Act of 1857. Both acts were clearly intended to give a summary remedy for settling disputes in regard to <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>party walls. That some such remedy is essential in large cities is self evident. If the erection of buildings is to be delayed' pending ordinary common law or equity proceedings, such delays would be ruinous- and intolerable. The Act of 1857 refers the whole matter to the building inspectors, with an appeal to the board of surveyors as provided by the Act of 1855. It is manifest that this reference to the Act of 1855 is a mistake, however, as that Act does not relate to the taking down of party walls, and there is no provision in it for an appeal to the board of surveyors. Moreover, the title to the Act of 1855 does not correspond with the statement of it in the Act of 1857. The Act of 11th April, 1856, P. L., 320, has a title in exact accord with the description thereof in the Act of 1857, the fourth section of which authorizes the building inspectors to examine and condemn all walls alleged to be dangerous, and provides for an appeal within three days to the board of surveyors. It is probable the reference to the Act of 1855 in the Act of 1857 was a blunder of the draftsman or a mistake in transcribing in substituting the Act of 1855 for that of 1856. If not, then no appeal is given by the Act of 1857 and the reference to this act of 1855 is a nullity.</p>

This view entirely ignores the whole scope and spirit of the Act of 1857, which was intended, as before stated, to give a summary remedy. Under that Act the decision of the building inspectors was final and conclusive, saving only an appeal to the board of surveyors which must be taken within three days. The Act gives no appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, and that court has no jurisdiction to review the case upon the merits.

The decision of the building inspectors is a finality and the Act declares that “ the wall shall be taken down by the last builder,” and if the latter is interfered with in doing so, it is simply an unlawful interference which any Court of Common Pleas may, by virtue of its equitable powers restrain in a summary way by an order or an injunction; or if such interference amounts to a breach of the peace, the Court of Quarter Sessions would have the power to bind the offending parties over to keep the peace.</p>

It has no reference to the question of condemnation of party walls.</p>
    <p id="b524-6" data-blocks='[["BL_524.7",524,[242,1617,1178,172]]]'>The further point was made that the appeal given by the Act of 24th February, 1721 (1 Sm. L., 124), and the Act of 15th April, 1782, 2 Id. 48, has not been taken away by subsequent legislation.</p>
    <p id="b524-7" data-blocks='[["BL_524.8",524,[241,1789,1177,255]]]'>It is a sufficient answer to this to repeat what was said by the court in Evans <em>v. </em>Jayne, (supra) in speaking of the Act of 1849: “ This proceeding was under the Act of 5th April, 1849, and the process there provided is complete in itself without any appeal, and we cannot imply that any was intended; and herein too it resembles the fence laws.”</p>

It was admitted upon the argument that the wall has been taken down and rebuilt. The court below merely enforced the decision of the building inspectors. There is and was no appeal from the latter to that court. There might, perhaps, have been an appeal to the board of surveys, but there was none. It would do no good to reverse the court below for simply enforcing the order of the building inspectors, <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>unless we could at the same time reverse the decision of the building inspectors. This we have no power to do, unless perhaps for an irregularity in condemning the wall, and this has not been shown.</p>
