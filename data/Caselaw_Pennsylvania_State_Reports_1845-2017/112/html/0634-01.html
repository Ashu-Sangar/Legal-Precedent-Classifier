Warren informed Henry Davis, who had married his sister, Mary, that there was some dispute between him and Richard W. Steel, in relation to a lot that was to be sold that night at the Exchange. He requested him to be present at the sale <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>and bid it in, and promised if he would do so be would have the deed made' to bis sister, the wife of Davis, and give it to her.

The money was paid b}' Warren, and at his order the deed was made to Mary Davis. Dayis testified that shortly after the deed was made Warren brought it to his house in Camden, laid it upon the bureau, staid several hours, and as he was about to leave said to bis sister that he would take the deed back with him and take care of the property for-her. Mrs. Davis and her husband soon after departed from Camden for Rio Grande, in New Jersey. He stated to them, and to- others afterwards, that his sister owned the lot, that he was collecting’the rents for her, and that he proposed when the rents had Accumulated to use them in paying for a building on the ground, so that she might have something to fall back upon. He had the property duly registered as hers in the Registry Bureau of the Survey Department of Philadelphia, and there was thus secured to her as owner the advantages created by the several Acts of Assembly relating to that department.</p>

His plan then was, instead of erecting a substantial dwelling for her on thé lot, in the place of the frame building which was there; to avail himself of an opportunity to sell the land and give his sister the money. She was quite aged, being now about eighty-four. He discussed the matter with Mrs. Davis and her husband. The former was averse to a change in the arrangement, and the latter declined to act; but the views of all were in accord by the next morning, upon his assurance that the transaction was to'secure the money for Mrs. Davis; and then she and her husband gave him an instrument which cannot be described, since it was lost by Warren on his reaching his home. It may have been a letter of attorney, authorizing a sale. It was not, according to the plaintiff’s proofs, a-deed to Warren in fee simple, but it gave him some personal power, the words, “heirs and assigns,” having been intentionally omitted. The conjecture that this was a letter of attorney flows from the narration of what occurred on the morning referred to. Warren visited two neighbors of his sister, Samuel and Susan Izzard, before breakfast, and told them, in the course of his conversation, that he had come from Philadelphia to obtain a paper from “ Mary Anne,” that he might sell her lot for $3000.. “ He said that he thought he would come down and get the deed, and sell the property and give her the money that he got; the $8000 <a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>that he got for it; that it would do her more good than the property.” Shortly after his return to Philadelphia he saw Henry Davis there, and told him that the paper was lost. “ Ho hollowed at me,” said Davis : ‘Henry,’ says he, ‘the deed that I had at home for you, and one other deed, were lost.’ Whether it was so, or not, I know not; but that is what he told me. The deed from Mr. Steel and this deed was together in his pocket, and he hung up his coat in the entry, and when he got up in the morning both deeds were gone, and he says to me, ‘ Henrietta has taken them out.’ ”.....Q. Who had taken them out ?..... “ Henrietta, his woman that he lived with.”.....“He said, ‘Never mind, it will not make any odds; it will only make the other deed the better, the stronger.’ ” Nothing of moment occurred after this till Warren’s death.</p>

Richard W. Steel, it is admitted, was in the year 1854 the owner of the ground in question; in that year Steel exposed the lot to sale by auction at the Public Exchange, and William J. Warren became the purchaser thereof, his brother-in-law, Henry Davis, bidding it in for him at the sum of $600 or $650. Warren, it is conceded also, paid the purchase money from his own funds, together with all the expenses of the conveyance, but took the title in the name of his sister, Mary Ann Davis, wife of Henry Davis. The defendants’ contention is, that a trust resulted to William J. Warren as the source and origin of the consideration, and their claim is under him.</p>

The subject matter of the suit was the title and possession of real estate, and the action ejectment. The rule laid down in a large number of cases in this court, and recently declared in Fross’ Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20W.N.C.%20543" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="15 W.N.C. 543">15 W.

Henry Davis was, therefore, not incompetent as a party to the suit, nor upon, the ground of interest, or upon any rule of public policy. He was clearly competent prior to the passage of the Act of 1869, and that Act has not rendered any witness incompetent who was not so before its passage. The fourth, fifth and sixth assignments are therefore not sustained.</p>

To this general principle there are well known exceptions, but the case in hand does not fall within them. It is not claimed that William J. Warren occupied any such relation to Mary Ann Davis, the nominee in the deed, as created any obligation on his part, moral or otherwise, to provide for her; although a sister, she must in this transaction be treated as a stranger: Edwards <em>v. </em>Edwards, 3 Wr., 369.</p>

He says that on the day of the purchase Warren came to his house in Camden, and said to him: “ Henry, there is a lot in dispute between me and Mr. Steel; ” the best of my knowledge, he said that they had a law suit about it and it went to court,-and they could not collect the expenses off the lot; and he says: “ It is to be sold at the Exchange to-night; I want you to .come over and bid it in; if you will, I will give it to your wife and make her a deed for it.” My brother-in-law <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>was a speculator, and I thought he might get me into trouble, and I says to him : “ William, if there is nothing wrongjn it I will do it.” He states that he attended' the sale at the Exchange as requested ; that Warren stood beside him and urged him to bid, and that the property was knocked down to him at the sum stated.</p>

Then he coaxed me to do it without any money or any valuation on it; he tried to coax me to do it. Says I, “William, I won’t do it. It never was-mine; it was my wife’s. It was mine by promise. You promised it to me if I would go and buy it; you promised to give it to my wife ; it was mine by promise and her’n by deed.” And says I, "I shall not sign the deed.” “Well,” he says, “it is good for nothing without you do.” Says I, “I have nothing to do with it; it don’t belong to me; it belongs to my wife.”</p>

The title of Steele was certainly divested as soon as the purchase money was paid and the deed passed to Warren; the title, thereafter was a matter between Warren and Mrs. Davis; she was not bound to accept it, but it is shown that she did, and she now claims, that it is in fact the absolute expression of the intent of the parties.</p>

This is what the court distinctly declared in the answer to the defendants’ fifth point. But if the testimony on this point was not believed, or if the language employed by Warren was such as to render his purpose and meaning uncertain or ambiguous, the fact that afterwards and apparently in pursuance of the promise to convey to his sister, the property was actually conveyed to her, taken with the several declarations of Warren subsequently made, certainly tends to show that this was the settled purpose of his mind at the time. The retention of the deed, the continuity of the possession in Warren, his continued act <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>of ownership and control, are facts of a strongly rebutting character, but their effect was wholly for the jury.</p>
