This parcel of real estate was appraised at $275, the appraisement was confirmed by the Orphans’ Court, and the real estate set apart to her. It was sold at sheriff’s sale on a <em>levari facias, </em>issued on a judgment subsequently obtained on a <em>scire facias </em>on the said mortgage, for a sum less than the judgment on which it was sold.

Pursuant to this notice appraisers were duty and property appointed. On the 11th of February, 1879, the appraisers made their appraisement, and set apart the said lands to the widow, Hannah Conrad. The piece and parcel of land embraced in and bound by the mortgage and the judgments, was appraised at the sum of two hundred and seventy-five dollars. To this appraisement, and setting apart to the widow, of the lands, exceptions were filed by John R. Kauffiban, and by the Building and Loan Association, on the ground that the lands were valued at too low a valuation, and that the widow was not entitled to the exemption in preference to the mortgagee. The court refused to disturb the appraisement for want of sufficient proof, and because the Supreme Court had held in Norpel’s Appeal, 10 Norris, 334, that a widow is not entitled to her exemptions under the 5th section of the Act of 14th April, 1851, out of the proceeds of the real estate of her deceased husband, in preference to his mortgage thereof, and made the following decree, filed 11th April, 1881: “The exceptions are dismissed, to be without prejudice to the Susquehanna Building and Loan Association; and the appraisement is confirmed, subject to the rights or claims of the <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>said Association, if any right, claim, or claims it has, under and by virtue of its mortgage, against Charles J.

If the widow’s estate was superior to his judgment, it must also have been paramount to the subsequent mortgage ; for being subsequent to the lien of this judgment, under the Act of Assembly, it was no more than a mere lien itself. It was not in the nature of a fixed lien, or of a conveyance of the title; and hence was dis<a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>charged from the land, if not <em>bj </em>the proceedings in the Orphans’ Court, setting apart and adjudging the land to his widow, then, indeed, by the sale on this mortgage ; and then, both the judgment and the mortgage came to the fund, in the order of their entry.

But in that case, no question of priority of lien was raised, nor was the contest there between lien-creditors. It was only whether, under the Act of 1851, the widow of a decedent could take and hold land subject to a mortgage by the deceased owner, which was.“prior to all other liens, except other mortgages, ground-rents and purchase money due the Commonwealth,” as against the mortgagee or the sheriff’s vendee upon such prior mortgage. In that ease, the mortgagee was held protected by the Act of the 6th of April, 1830, P. L., 293. But the provisions of that Act d.o not come to the protection of the mortgagee in this case, as they did in that, for the very good and .manifest reason that the mortgage here is preceded by a lien of a judgment; and this casts it without both the letter and spirit, as well of that Act as of the decision of this court, in Nerpel’s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>A judicial proceeding, which will discharge the lien of the prior judgment, must also have the effect of discharging the lien of the subsequent mortgage; and can it be doubted that, the proceedings in the Orphans’ Court, under the wid-„ ow’s election to take of the land of her deceased husband, to the value of $300, under the provisions of the Act of 1851, are of a judicial character?

The confirmation of the appraisement is an adjudication which vests the title to the property taken, in her: Runyan’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/27/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="27 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="979714" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0121-01">27 Pa. St., 121</a>. When the adjudication is of real estate she takes the title of her husband absolutely, and may convey it by deed: Sipes <em>v. </em>Mann, 39 Id., 41. She is entitled to this exemption as against the judgment as well as the general creditors, and will be preferred even as to a judgment creditor in whose favor the decedent had waived the benefit of'the exemption law: Spencer’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/27/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="27 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="979451" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0218-01">27 Pa.

    <p id="b663-13" data-blocks='[["BL_663.13",663,[192,1994,1164,374]]]'>A similar restriction is the only one found in the Debtors’ Exemption Act of 9th April, 1849. In McAuley’s Appeal, 11 Casey, 209, however, it was held that the Act of 1849 was inapplicable to mortgages, whether given for purchase money of real estate or not; that such debts were not within the purview of that statute. In Gangwere’s Appeal, 12 Casey, 466, reasons were assigned, at length, for this interpretation of the statute, and the rule has since been followed in a large number of cases.</p>

This construction was necessarily inferred from the nature of the mortgage contract. “ The mortgage by the decedent,” said this court in the case last cited, “was something more than°a mere lien. For all purposes of security to the mortgagee it was a conveyance of the land. He could have recovered in ejectment the possession of the premises, and held until his principal, with interest, was repaid. Had he resorted to this remedy, and the mortgagor had then died, it is not pretended that his Widow would have any right to the exemption. The proceeding under the Act of Assembly, by <em>scire </em>facias, is but a substitute for a foreclosure in equity, and the sale it provides for does not alter the case. It ought not to be that the election of one remedy, and not the other, should make a difference in the right of the mortgagee.”</p>

And though mortgages are commonly spoken of as mere securities for payment of money, they are such because they are formal pledges of the land. The mortgagee, upon default in performance by the mortgagor of the stipulations in the deed, may, by ejectment, obtain possession of the premises, and the exemption laws do not apply to the impairing of such a security: Gangwere’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/36/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="36 Pa. 466" data-case-ids="992218" data-case-paths="/pa/36/0466-01">36 Pa.

This restriction on the remedies of the general and judgment creditors is plainly expressed in the statute, and is well understood in practice.</p>

The title of the widow was, not only by the express terms of the decree, but by law, subject to the iien of the mortgage, and as the fund for distribution was inadequate for the payment of that lien, the widow was clearly not entitled to any share in it.
