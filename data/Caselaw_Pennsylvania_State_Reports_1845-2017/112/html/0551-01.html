Young Biddle asked this boy, Solnack, permission to get upon the car. He replied : “I can’t let you on ; I don’t own the car; ” and then added, “Well, jump on.” The boys jumped on. The car had gone but a short distance when the driver came to the door of it and finding the boys on the platform ordered them off. The boys did not get off, and a little further'on he came out again, and finding they had disregarded his order, he again ordered them off. Pie came out a third time, and said in a threatening manner, “You boys get off of here!” The boy that was driving said to thp smallest boy, the one that was killed: “Wait, Clarence, I will stop for you;” and he immediately began to tighten the brake, but the driver rushed at him, shoved him away from the brake, and just as he (Clarence) was going off, backward, the speed of the car increased with a jerk, as the brake was released, and flew round; and he was thrown under the wheels — crushed, and died, the speed of the car being such that both wheels passed over the centre of his body before it stopped.

Even the boy Solnack knew better than that, and did what he could to prevent the accident. To discuss, therefore, evidence which throughout shows a reckless carelessness of which no man of ordinary discretion ought to have been guilty, would be to no purpose; hence, we may regard the case as fully disposed of when we have made a brief statement of the law which ought to have governed the court below. It was a mistake to hold that because the child was a trespasser it could therefore be ejected in a manner which endangered its life or limbs. In the case of the Pennsylvania Company <em>v. </em>Toomey, we held, per Mr. Justice Mercur, that such a disposition of a trespassing adult could not be allowed, and that ordinary care must be used to avoid injury even to a trespasser is fully established by the cases of the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Lewis, 29 P. F. S., 33, the Hydraulic Works Co. <em>v. </em>Orr, 2 Norris, 332, and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Hummell, 8 Wr., 375. Moreover, we have two cases which, in point, rule the contention in hand; they are <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>the Pittsburgh, Allegheny &amp; Manchester Passenger Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 24 P. F. S., 421, and. the same company <em>v. </em>Donahue, 20 Id., 119. In the first case a child had been permitted by the' clriver to ride upon the front platform, from which, without his knowledge, it attempted to leave the car whilst in motion, and was injured ; in the second the child was pushed or knocked from the platform by the driver, and in each case the company was held liable for the resulting injuries. Both children here mentioned were trespassers, for although, in the first case, the child was on the car by invitation of the driver, yet as he had no authority to give such invitation, according to the case of Duff <em>v. </em>The Allegheny Railroad Co., 10 Norris, 458, it was but a- trespasser. It is very true, as was held in the Hestonville Passenger Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Connell, 7 Norris, 522, and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Hummell, extra precautions are not required in anticipation of the intrusions of trespassers, even though they be children, but when they do so intrude and are known to be in an improper place, they must not be so wholly neglected as to endanger their lives or limbs. Any other doctrine would so illy accord with Christian civilization as to render its maintenance impossible. It follows from what we have said that the court below, instead of ordering a peremptory nonsuit, ought to have sent the case to the jury.</p>
