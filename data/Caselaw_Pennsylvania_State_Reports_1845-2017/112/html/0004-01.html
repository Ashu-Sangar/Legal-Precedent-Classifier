L., 396, which provided for the election of an additional law judge in the Sixth Judicial District, of which Crawford county then formed a pai-t. That act provides for the old term first and second return days of the 30th and 31st sections of the act of 13th June, 1889, <em>Purd. Dig. </em>44, and leaves it optional with a party plaintiff in suing out a writ for the commencement of an action to use any return day he pleases, and this provision is here invoked by the plaintiff, as permitting him to make his writ of attachment returnable to the regular term, notwithstanding a monthly return day intervened between the <em>teste </em>and return of the writ. However much I dislike to turn a party out of court on what seems to be a technicality, I am constrained by the positive language of the second section of the attachment Act of 1869, above recited, to hold that this writ was not made returnable according to law.</p>
