Does the writing fully and entirely express that contract, or does it not ? In other words, was it a part of the contract and agreement between Walker and France, that Walker guaranteed to France that this mill had a certain capacity for sawing, and that there was 10,000,000 feet óf good white hemlock lumber upon this land? Was that a part of the actual agreement between these parties ? It is not in the writing, but if it existed, as a fact, it may be put <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>there by the kind and description of evidence which we have mentioned.] (Eighth assignment of error.)</p>

It then becomes a part of the contract. Because if a party is induced to sign a contract in consideration of a certain promise connected with the subject matter, made by the other party, then a breach of that promise, or a disregard of it, under 'those circumstances, would constitute a fraud upon him, so as to subject the writing to explanation or qualification, by parol evidence.] (Ninth assignment of error.)</p>

The direct evidence upon that subject, on the part of the defendant, is found in the testimony of the defendant himself, and in the testimony of his wife and two sons. They all testify before you that Mr. Walker made this guaranty just before the execution of the contract. As we understand their testimony, it is that this guaranty was made by Mr. Walker at the house of Mr. France on the morning that the contract was executed. They say to you, in substance, that Mr. France said to Mr. Walker, when his attention was called to the execution of the contract, that he had been informed, or had learned, that what Mr. Walker had told him about the quantity of timber upon the land and the capacity of the mill was not true. And that if he had been correctly informed, he should not sign the contract, and that thereupon the conversation which they detail ensued between the parties. In that conversation, if correctly related by the witnesses, Mr. France decline.d to execute the articles without the insertion of the guaranty, but upon being told by Walker that it should make no difference, and that it should be the same as if it was in the contract, he finally consented to sign it, and did sign it.</p>

Mr. France testifies that while, upon the lot there was a talk about the quantity of hemlock timber upon it, and that it was there represented that there were 10,000,000 feet. Mr. Walker and his brother both testify that no such conversation took place, and that no statement of that kind was made by them, or either of them.

He testifies in substance, as we remember the evidence, that the parties came to his office and requested him to draw the contract, and stated its terms to him fully, and that he reduced the contract to writing, and that it was subsequently read to the parties, and that they agreed that it contained all of the contract, and that nothing was said on the subject of a guaranty of the capacity of the mill, or the water power connected with it, or the quantity of timber upon the tract.</p>

To illustrate; if there was a guaranty that there was 10,000,000 feet of hemlock lumber upon the land, and in fact there was but 1,000,000, or 3,000,000, then the defendant would be entitled, by way of equitable defence to this action, to abate from the purchase money which he had agreed to pay, the value of such deficiency. That is, if there was a guaranty of 10,000,-000 feet, and in fact there were but 3,000,000 feet upon the lot, then the deficiency would be 7,000,000, and the value of that 7,000,000 feet the defendant would be entitled to have deducted from the price which he agreed to pay.] (Tenth assignment of error.)</p>

If it was guaranteed to have a certain capacity, had it less capacity than it was guaranteed to have, and if so, how much less? How would the value of the property be affected by this deficiency in the capacity of the mill, if it existed, and what would be the damage to the defendant, by reason thereof? We stated, in our answer to one of the plaintiff’s points, that we thought perhaps there was some basis in this case upon which the jury might adjust the damages for any deficiency in the capacity of the mill or water power, if there was any such deficiency. That evidence is this. There is evidence in the case to the effect that the value of the mill, and the water privilege used in connection with it, was §lper thousand for the lumber it would saw. For instance, if the mill would saw 10,000 feet per day, then, according to that, the value of its use would be §10. But we think, however, although, it was -not mentioned by the witnesses, that from that would have to be taken into consideration the wear and tear of the mill, and the expenses of maintaining it. But a mill which had the capacity to cut 10,000 feet a day, would certainly be more valuable 'than one which had the capacity to cut only 5,000.] (Eleventh assignment of error.)</p>

Now, as it was admitted that there were not over 3,000,000 of hemlock on this tract, and as it was proved that from dilapidation and want of power the mill could not perform what it was Warranted to do,- it is clear that the defendant could set up this warranty, though in parol, as a defence to the plaintiff’s cláim. Of these representations and. warranty the testimony was clear, positive and abundant, so that the question turned principally on the credibility of the witnesses, and was one, of course, for the jury. So far as the court was concerned it was limited to a proper and formal submission of the evidence, and instructions as to the proper measure of damages. In these particulars the learned counsel for the plaintiff has failed to convict the court of ■ error. That a written agreement may be modified, explained, reformed, or altogether set aside by parol evidence of an oral 'promise or undertaking material to the subject matter of the contract, made-by one of the parties at the’time of the execution of the writing, and which induced, the other party to put his name to it, must now be regarded as a principle of law so well settled as to preclude discussion. All those assignments of error, therefore, which involve the court’s rulings on the principle here stated, or on the evidence admitted to prove the plaintiff’s representations as to the condition of the property and quantity of timber upon it, as well as on the testimony admitted to show that these representations were in fact not true, must be dismissed as having in them,nothing which we can sustain.. This, leaves for our further vconsideration only the 11th and 12th assignments, whichenrbrace the rulings .of- the court on the. question of the damages ,to which the defendant was entitled by wajr of recoupment. In considering the proposition raised by these assignments,, we are not to forget that the plaintiff’s action is an equitable one, and that his right to recover depends- upon the fact that he has substantially performed his part of the contract, His vendee cannot be compelled to pay for that which he cannot give him, neither can he dispossess the defendant, until he has refunded the -purchase money which he received, andr, compensares .him for, his improvements: Richardson <em>v. </em>
      <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>Kuhn, <a href="/watts/6/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Watts 299" data-case-ids="1846035" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0299-01">6 Watts, 299</a>. In the case in hand, France stands on the defensive only; he may defeat Walker, but can recover against him nothing but costs. To this end the defendant had but to show that the plaintiff failed to comply with his part of the contract in some material particular. For, having paid part of the purchase money, and being in lawful possession of the premises, the plaintiff, on a partial performance on his part, could neither force his vendee to pay the balance of the purchase money, nor, as an alternative, compel him to turn out until by re-payment of what he had received,- and a compensation for improvements, if any such there were, he had restored that vendee to the position in which he found him at the time of the execution of the contract. When the matter in hand is looked at in this light, the plaintiff certainly has no ground of complaint as to the instructions of the court, for it held the defendant to a proof of damages equivalent to the whole balance of the purchase mone]’’. The defendant showed the payment of $6,000; that there was a warranty of 10,000,000 of hemlock lumber, and that the mill had power to cut not less than 2000 feet of boards on any and every day in the year, whilst the facts proved were that there were not more than 3,000,000 feet of hemlock lumber on the tract, and that there were some five or six months in the year when the mill could not be run at all for the want of power. Here, then, was enough of itself to defeat the plaintiff’s action ; an agreement to convey 10,000,000 of hemlock lumber, and an offer to perform on conveyance of 3,000,000. Surely this will not do; he cannot thus compel the defendant to a performance of the contract when, in so material a particular, he admits his own inability to perform his part of it. But as a mere matter of recoupment we cannot see how the court could have submitted a better rule for the ascertainment of damages. The principal value of the property was in its timber. Undoubtedly, if we have regard to the weight of evidence, the'hand money fully covered the value of the land as the defendant received it, and so the jury must have found, for the question, as the court put it, was whether or not anything was due the plaintiff, allowing no certified balance to be found for the defendant. Now, the manner proposed for the solution of this question was direct and simple : what was the difference between the value of 3,000,000 feet of hemlock lumber and 10,000,000, and this difference found, was it enough to cover the balance of the purchase money? So with the mill; assuming that its capacity was materially less than that warranted,- what was the difference, and how was this difference to be reduced to a money value ? It was not so situated that it could be rented as a custom mill; it could not be made <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>to fill the warranty by repair or reconstruction, for. the principal defect was in the deficiency of its water power. These means of estimation- could not, therefore, be resorted td; hence, the court and jury had but one method to which they could'have recourse, and that was to ascertain from the evidence what was the customary value of the earnings of such a mill per thousand, after deducting all expenses, and so, by comparison, arrive at the difference of the value of the mill as warranted, and as it was when delivered to the defendant. This was the method adopted by the court, and as we have discovered none better, we can do no less than give it our approval.</p>
