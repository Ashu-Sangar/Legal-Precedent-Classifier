    <p class="summary" id="b353-7" data-blocks='[["BL_353.8",353,[153,1275,1179,732]]]'>The argument is that the taxes imposed by the act under consideration are not uniform upon the same class of subjects, inasmuch as certain kinds of property “ in the hands of individual citizens of the state ” are taxed, whereas the same kinds of property held by corporations are not taxed, and because none of the property made taxable by the Act is taxable when held by a building and loan association, the effect of which, it is claimed, is to exempt property in the hands of corporations, which the constitution in the section quoted above says shall not be exempt. The force of this argument is apparent rather than real. There was no compulsion on the legislature to tax any portion of the subjects mentioned in the first section of the Act at all, and if they had not done so the whole would have been exempt. So much is conceded, but it is argued that when the legislature select any given subject for taxation, say mortgages, all mortgages held within the state, no matter by whom held, must be taxed.</p>

F. S., 494, “persons and things have been and may constitutionally be classified. .....If the taxation is upon all of a class, either of persons or things, it matters not whether those included in it be one or many......The legislature has often exempted certain classes of properties and even certain classes of persons from taxation altogether.” It is true that Durach’s Appeal <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>was decided before the adoption of the new constitution, but in Kitty Roup’s Case, 32 P. F. S., 216, it is stated that the judges of the Supreme Court, whilst they were unable to agree upon the other questions in the ease, were all of one mind, “that the power to classify the subjects of taxation is not taken away by the new constitution.” So in Kittaning <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 29 P. F. S., 104, Agnew, C. J., speaking of the very clause in the new constitution now invoked by the plaintiffs, says: “ Clearly there is nothing in this prohibiting the power to classify. Will it be argued that persons or the owners of property cannot be classified? For example, can it be said that all single freemen cannot be required to pay a uniform tax ? ” See also Banger’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20W.N.C.%20289" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="16 W.N.C. 289">16 W.

    <p class="summary" id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[255,1054,1173,347]]]'>It is thus seen that the power to classify both persons and things for the purposes of taxation is undoubted. But the power to classify, so carefully defended by the Supreme-Court, would be of no avail unless accompanied by the power to discriminate between the classes thus created. The existence of this latter power is expressly recognized, and the absurdity that would result from a denial of it is clearly pointed out in Durach’s Appeal, <em>supra.</em>

    <p class="summary" id="b354-6" data-blocks='[["BL_354.6",354,[256,1401,1174,691]]]'>So in Township <em>v. </em>Berger, 2 Pears., 231, Judge Pearson, whose utterances on all questions relating to taxation are entitled to the greatest respect, concedes that the legislature may impose.“ taxes on one class, from which others should 'be free.” Moreover, the whole tenor of tax legislation, as well since as before the adoption of the new constitution, is in harmony with this idea. Our statute books teem with Acts of Assembly, the constitutionality of which has never been called in question, imposing taxes upon corporations from which not only natural persons, -but other corporations, are exempt. True, the discriminations thus made are against corporations, but the principle is the same. The constitutional rights of corporations are just as sacred as those of individual citizens, and the legislature has no more -power to take the property of the one for public'uses, without compensation, than it has to take, the property of the other.</p>

The Act under consideration declares that certain property “in the hands of individual citizens of the state ” shall be taxable for state purposes. This is but another way of saying that “individual citizens” as distinguished from corporations holding the particular kinds of property named shall pay a tax upon it: Kit<a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>taning <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <em>supra. </em>The distinction between the two forms of expression is unmeaning: Id. Much of the confusion of thought injected into the present case comes from treating the classification made by the legislature as a classification of property rather than as a classification of persons. All, therefore, that the legislature has done has been to divide-the tax-paying element of the state into two classes, taxing the one and exempting the other. " The classification is a very natural one, and one that has been constantly recognized in tax legislation. There is nothing, as has been seen, in such a classification that is unconstitutional. It is not easy to understand why the proviso specially exempting building and loan associations was inserted, but it is enough that such associations constitute a “ class ” by themselves, and being such the legislature had a right to exempt them from the burdens imposed by the Act.</p>

It may be that the Act is oppressive and unjust. Upon that subject I express no opinion; further than to say, that if it is so, the remedy is with the legislature. The courts cannot declare an Act unconstitutional upon any such grounds: Weber <em>v. </em>Reinhard, 23 P. F. S., 370.</p>

The burden of maintaining the state has been, in repeated instances, lifted from the shoulders of favored classes and thrown upon the remainder of the community.

Wherein then is the lack of uniformity, and wherein has the legislature made a discrimination in favor of corporations as against individual citizens ? If there is discrimination at all it is against corporations, as their tax may amount to six mills or more, according to the amount of the dividends declared. The 17th section of the Act of 1879 taxed mortgages and moneys at interest owned by individual citizens at the rate of four mills, and the principal objects of the Act of 1885 would seem to be to reduce the rate to three mills and to provide more efficient machinery for the assessment and collection of this tax.

Were the tax of 1885 on mortgages extended to corporations, the result would be double taxation, which, while not beyond the powers of the legislature, is not to be presumed in the absence uf a clear intent to impose it. The case may be illustrated thus: We will suppose the capital stock of a trust company or other corporation to consist of $1,000,000, and that this amount has been invested in mortgages or other interest bearing securities. The $1,000,000 of capital stock is taxed by the Act of 1879 at three mills, and more if dividends in excess of six per .cent, are earned. If now, the Act of 1885 imposes a tax of three mills upon the $1,000,000 of securities, it is obvious w.e have a ease of double taxation. The capital stock is nothing; a myth; a mere name, excepting in so far as it is represented by investments made with the money paid into the treasury of the corporation on account of such capital stock.

The tax on mortgages imposed by the Act of 1879 had never produced the amount of revenue which it might and ought to have done, for the reason that it was constantly and persistently evaded. Occasionally an honest man would make an honest return and pay an honest tax. But it is well known that full and fair returns were the exception rather than the rule, while many persons possessed of considerable estates liable to this tax escaped it altogether. The machinery provided for its assessment and collection, as before observed, was inadequate. The Act of 1885 provided such inachinery; that it was effective we may fairly infer from the extent and character of the opposition to it. Taxation is never popular, and the Act of 1885 has received its full share of criticism; but. the plain object of this particular provision of the Act was to make people honest and keep them so. It was intended to compel each taxpayer to disclose to the assessor the full extent of his personal estate, and to avoid the unequal burdens which had been laid upon the shoulders of some person by the neglect of others to return the full amount of their property. No legal objection can be made to this. If the state has the right to tax moneys at interest in the hands of her citizens, and this cannot be denied, she has the right to know to what extent each citizen holds such property. In the exercise of this right she has the power, and it is a part of the taxing power, to require each taxpayer to make known to the assessor the extent of his or her property of this description. She has the further right to punish the failure to. make such return by the imposition of a penalty, or otherwise, as may best secure the object to be attained. These powers must be conceded. I have never heard them questioned, and without them the taxing power of the state would be no power at all. It would be a mere privilege. .</p>

Now, what hardship does the Act im-, pose upon them for their default, or what penalty does it inflict' that is unjust? In the first place, the assessor is obliged to make a return for them, from the best information at his command. This means that the assessor shall inquire from such persons as he may reasonably suppose to have information, as to the extent of the defaulting taxpayer’s estate. Surely this is no hardship upon any one but the assessor. Estimating the amount of the property in this manner, the assessor returns such amount to the proper commissioners or returning boards, who are required to add fifty per’ centum thereto, and the amount so increased stands as the assessment. The state imposes this fifty per centum upon the taxpayer as a punishment for his default in not making the return required by law. If no appeal were allowed to the action of the commissioners in adding this penalty, it would be a serious question whether this Act could be sustained. It is one of the fundamental principles of English and American law that no man can be condemned in his person or property without a hearing. But the Act expressly provides that the taxpayer may, on or before the day fixed for appeals, go before the commissioners or board of revision and present his reasons,’under oath, for his failure to make return, which, if satisfactory to the commissioners or board of revision, they shall substitute the taxpayer’s return for that of the assessor, to have the like effect as if no failure had occurred.</p>

    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[272,495,1183,983]]]'>The right of the legislature to provide for such an increase of the assessment in the case of the refusal of a taxpayer to comply with the law in the matter of the return of his property to the assessor, has been recognized in several of our sister states. The latest case to which my attention has been called is that of Newell <em>v. </em>Town of Whittingham, Eastern Reporter, vol. 3, p. 649. This case was decided last January by the Supreme Court of Vermont. The statute of that state directs the “listers,” whose duties correspond with those of our assessors, in all cases where a taxpayer wilfully omits to return, under oath, a complete inventory of his property, to ascertain the amount of the taxpayer’s taxable property, appraise the same, and double the sum so obtained as a basis for the delinquent list. In this case the taxpayer made a .return underneath, “ to the best of his knowledge and belief.” The form of oath was held not to be a compliance with the law, and the assessment Vas sustained. This was an admittedly hard case, as it was conceded the taxpayer had made an honest return, aad refused to take a more positive form of oath by reason of a tender conscience, yet we do not find throughout the case, not even in the opinion of the dissenting judge, so much as a hint that any one doubted the validity of the Act.</p>

The validity of this Act was recognized in Biddle <em>v. </em>Oaks, <a href="/cal/59/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="59 Cal. 94" data-case-ids="2308745" data-case-paths="/cal/59/0094-01">59 Cal., 94</a>, where it was held, under another section of the Code, that property which had escaped assessment one year might be doubly assessed the next year.</p>

St., c. 7, § 40), without which he cannot have the remedies provided for him by law. Section 23 provides, that if any person shall not have brought in such list, the assessors shall ascertain, as nearly as possible, the particulars of his personal and real estate, and make an estimate thereof at its just value, according to their best information and belief, and their estimate, by § 24, shall be conclusive. The effect of the statute, therefore, is, that <em>a </em>person may, at his option, decline giving in his list, and leave the assessors to ascertain the particulars; but-if he does so, he tacitly submits himself to their valuation and assessment, and of necessity waives, all those exceptions which he could take only on condition of having given in a list. He submits himself to what is called, in some of the earlier statutes (Anc. Chart., 70-73), the doom of the assessors.” See also Otis Company <em>v. </em>Inhabitants of Ware, <a href="/mass/74/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="8 Gray 509" data-case-ids="2079297" data-case-paths="/mass/74/0509-01">8 Gray, 509</a>.</p>

Such portions of it as are objectionable upon reasonable grounds, the people can, and probably will, correct through their representatives. After a most careful and patient examination of the Act, we are unable to see such inequality of taxation, such lack of uniformity as would justify us in striking it down as a whole upon constitutional grounds. While we endeavor to hew to the line in every instance of a palpable violation of that instrument, it would require a clear case to justify us in setting aside a revenue law of the Commonwealth, and thus throwing the financial affairs of the state into confusion.</p>
