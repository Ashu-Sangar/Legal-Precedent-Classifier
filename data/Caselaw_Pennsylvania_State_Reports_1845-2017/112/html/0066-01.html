The power to take lands out of a borough may be indirectly given by the 4th section of the Act of 1834, Purd. Digest, page 166, pl. 5, and the Act of 1871, on the same page, pi. 13: the former of these requires the application in writing of two thirds of the taxable inhabitants of any borough to annul or alter a charter, and the latter requires that the petition shall be presented to the court, after public notice given for not less than thirty days. The Act of 1871 does not certainly dispense with the petition of two thirds of the taxable inhabitants. Then came the legislation referred to by the court below. The second and third sections of the Act of 1879 contemplate the addition of outlying, lots to the borough. The first section authorizes the change of limits of any borough incorporated under the Act of 1851, with the concurrence of the grand jury. This did not intend to dispense with a petition from the parties interested ; and as nothing is said about it, the number and character of the petitioners must have been left to previous legislation.</p>

But it is incompetent for the courts to dismember a borough, except as they may be authorized by law; the charter of a municipal corporation grants privileges and immunities which are perpetual, and their privileges and immunities are co-extensive with the corporate limits. Their .responsibility, as public agents, exist mainly in the performance of acts for the public benefit, but they have also a distinctly legal personality; they may make contracts, purchase property, create debts, borrow money, and they have a right, to the extent of the limits fixed by their charter, to corporate existence ; their rights and responsibilities are, in this regard, analogous* to those of private corporations, subject only to the action of -the law making power as we have stated.
