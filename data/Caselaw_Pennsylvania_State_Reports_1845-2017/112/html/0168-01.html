This is resisted by accountant, who asserts that James actually purchased the lot, held it and the proceeds of its sale free of any trust; that the $2,700 was paid, and that said $1,800 promissory note is a renewal of an earlier and larger one, and represents all that is owing of said $2,700.</p>

Counsel for the contesting legatees apparently concedes the strength of said objections if applied to the title to the land itself, but contends that because James Hess sold the land, and because it can be found that he admitted that he held the purchase money and the mortgage in trust for his mother, that said Act of Assembly does not apply, and that his representatives must account for said purchase money.....</p>

It is also, undoubtr edly a fact that the said $1,800 note was all that was owing of said $2,500, and that the claim for the $500 is not sustained.</p>

She was an aged widow of hardly any resources, except the lot of sixty feet frontage, which afforded her a home and perhaps a small income. Her widowed-daughter, and the children of the latter, living with her, were poor and worked for a living. James seems to have been wealthy. It is highly improbable that she would have given, or he accepted, the lot at much less than it was worth. He was a kind son and attentive to his <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>mother. I think it is not only plain that the mortgage belonged to the mother, but also that if James were living he would say so. He repeatedly said so, while living, to his mother and to others interested to know the truth of the matter. His declarations in this reference were not made to strangers to the transaction. It is probable that the reason why the mortgage was not included by him in the inventory was because it did not stand in the mother’s name, and the money had not been realized when the inventory was taken.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b185-5" data-blocks='[["BL_185.6",185,[190,1327,1175,983]]]'>I cannot agree with the learned Auditor that the books are receivable in evidence upon the offer of the party who made them, and to prove the facts sought to be established by them. The learned Auditor concluded that the relation of Mrs. Hess and James was that of principal and agent; that she entrusted her money to him, and that he supplied her with small sums as she needed it, and attended to and paid for matters relating to her property. Upon an examination of the cases cited by the Auditor, I conclude that they do not support his position. Among the strongest is that of Ege’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%2C%20288" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 W., 288">2 W., 288</a>. There it was held that a son, who had been a manager of iron works for his father in his lifetime, and who after his death, became his administrator, on the settlement of his administration account was entitled to credit for a sum in his favor on the cash book. But as the court said those were the books of the employer, the owner of the works, and open to his inspection, and that the presumption was that he did inspect them, and was satisfied with their correctness. So in the case of Haimes <em>v. </em>Barnitz, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%2C%2039" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 W., 39">8 W., 39</a>, also relied on by the Auditor.

The entries offered are in the nature of declarations made by a party in his own favor in the absence of the party to be affected. If the books were received, their principal effect would be to prove that the party who made the entries therein discharged a debt, because he made entries of payments by himself in his own books, which the other party never saw, nor had the opportunity of seeing. This differs widely from Welsh <em>v. </em>Cooper, 8 Barr, 217, also cited by the Auditor, where books of a store, the ownership of which was in dispute, were received to show that the party, whose books they purported to be, was in possession of the store, and the manner in which the business was conducted.</p>

The plaintiff averred that he and the defendant were partners in the business of farming and of buying and selling lands. The defendant had taken the title to the lands in his own name; he invoked the Statute of Frauds. The Master held that, because of the statute, the plaintiff could not enforce the trust as to all the lands, but that in the case of certain lands purchased under the partnership and sold by the defendant, and where the latter subsequently to the sale had acknowledged plaintiff’s right to share in the profits, and had agreed to .pay over his share, the statute did not apply, in that the plaintiff was entitled to an account as to such converted proceeds. This view was adopted by the Common Pleas, and its decree was affirmed by the Supreme Court. Said the latter court: “ The reason for the distinction, as expressed in the report, is, that the testimony of the plaintiff and several of his witnesses establishes <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>declarations and admissions by the defendant, made after the sale was concluded and money paid, recognizing the plaintiff’s interest in the proceeds of the sale, and these, being personalty, may be the subject of a parol contract. This view of this part of the plaintiff’s claim appears to be in-accordance with the authorities,” referring to Maffit <em>v. </em>Rynd, 19 P. F. S., 380. In that case Justice Sharswood, in'the course of the-opinion, says: “ For assuredly it cannot be disputed that if a deed of land be made to A. and B. upon a parol trust, that they will hold for the benefit of the grantor or a third person, which parol trust cannot be enforced against the land in consequence of the fourth section of the Act of April 22d, 1856 (P. L., 533), yet if they sell the land and convert it into money, a parol declaration made by them subsequently to such sale and conversion will be entirely effectual. The statute raises no bar as to the enforcement of a parol declaration of trust in respect to personal estate.”</p>

If James Hess then made payments of interest to his mother on bonds and notes that he owed her, or made other payments to her, it was his duty to take proper vouchers for such payments.</p>

H. Deshler, the consideration money was secured and held <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>by him upon the same trust. The testimony of Mr. Deshler to that effect is so distinct and positive, and so fully corroborated by other facts and circumstances, that there can be no doubt such was the distinct understanding between James Hess and his mother. The existence of the trust, and its recognition by both parties before as well as after the sale and conveyance to Deshler, is clearly and conclusively established. So far as conversion of the land into personalty is concerned, the trust was executed. The appellees are not seeking to enforce it against the land, and hence the provisions of the Act of 1856 cannot stand in their way: Maffit v. Rynd <em>et </em>al., <a href="/pa/69/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="69 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="1026439" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0380-01">69 Pa. St., 380</a>. When the property was conveyed to Deshler, Hess accounted to his mother for the greater part of the hand money, and took a mortgage to secure the deferred payment. Both the learned Auditor and the court below found, in substance, that he held the title, as above stated, in trust for his mother; and after the sale to Deshler declared the mortgage belonged to her, and treated it as her property. If so, it is rather late to do what Hess, in his lifetime, never attempted — repudiate the trust.</p>

For these and other reasons, fully elaborated in the opinion of the learned president of the Orphans’ Court, we think the accountants were rightly surcharged with the sum of $2,187.66. The first three specifications are therefore not sustained. The court was also right in’holding that the books of James Hess were not competent evidence for the purpose for which they were received by the Auditor.</p>
