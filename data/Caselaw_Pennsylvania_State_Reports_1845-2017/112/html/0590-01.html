He also testified that he had agreed to give Butler credit for the rent thus paid as if it had been paid on the purchase money of the property in pursuance of the verbal sale.

Plaintiff does not deny the agreement for the sale of the property and the payments made . under it, but claims that, under the Statute of Frauds, the agreement of sale was not binding because it was not in writing and that he may disavow it, and that the effect of such a disavowal would be to revive the lease under which Butler held. Such a result might possibly follow, or rather the relation of landlord and tenant never was changed, if the agreement was entirely void. But such is not the fact. By the agreement of sale the tenancy came to an end and the tenant acquired a different estate. This estate, so far as its duration was concerned, was only an estate at will; but having acquired such an estate it is efident that the mere disavowal of the vendor cannot have the effect of altering the .nature of the estate, and of changing it- into a tenancy under the original lease.

In Clark <em>v. </em>Eberley, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 226" data-case-ids="483365" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0226-01">8 W. &amp; S., 226</a>, it was held, that in a proceeding under that Act, if it appeared from the evidence that the title was in dispute, and that the alleged lessee refused to pay the rent because he claimed title in himself, the jurisdiction of the magistrate was at an end, and that the remedy to obtain possession must be the common law action of ejectment: this case was followed by Euler <em>v. </em>Johnson, <a href="/pa/25/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="25 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="975826" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0350-01">25 Penn.

St., 497</a>. The rule of all the cases cited is, that the jurisdiction of the magistrates, and of the Common Pleas on appeal, is ousted, in every case where it appears by the evidence that a question of title arises between the party charged as tenant, and the party claiming as landlord.</p>
    <p id="b611-6" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[111,1059,1186,639]]]'>We must be understood, however, as referring only to the practice and proceedings under the Act of 3d April, 1830; the Acts of 21st March, 1772, 16th June, 1836, and 14th December, 1863, provide remedies which are applied under other circumstances and for other purposes, and their provisions are very different: Brown <em>v. </em>Gray, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%2020" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="5 Watts 20">5 Watts, 20</a>; and Cress <em>v. </em>Richter, Ms. Sup. Ct., 7th April, 1853, are cases arising under the Act of 1836; Debozear <em>v. </em>Butler, <a href="/grant/2/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="2 Grant 417" data-case-ids="227717" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0417-01">2 Gr., 417</a>, relied upon by the plaintiff in error, under the Act of 1772, and Koonts <em>v. </em>Hammond, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pa.%20181" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="62 Pa. 181">62 Penn. St., 181</a>, under the Act of 1863. These cases are of undoubted authority. At first blush they might appear to be in conflict with the cases first referred to, and with the ruling of this case, a more careful examination will show, however, that as they apply to different statutes no conflict in fact exists.</p>
    <p id="b611-7" data-blocks='[["BL_611.6",611,[114,1707,1184,561]]]'>It is a general principle, however, that a tenant has no right to attorn to the holder of an adverse title ; his paramount duty is to hold and defend the possession for his landlord, and surrender it to him at the end of the term. The title of a stranger, not claiming by or under the lessor, cannot come in question: (Heritage v. Wilfong, 8 P. F. S. 137); unless the title of the landlord has actually come to an end by his own act, or been divested by the act of the law. For although the defendant is not permitted to show that his lessor never had title to the demised premises, he may, on admitting he once had title, prove that his interest has expired, and become vested in another: Newell <em>v. </em>Gibbs, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 496" data-case-ids="1852545" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0496-01">1 W. &amp;.

It was not necessary that the evidence must fully establish the validity of that title, its validity as between the lessor and the lessee involved an inquiry which the magistrate was not authorized to make, and the powers of the Common Pleas were limited accordingly. From the facts assumed in the point reserved, it appears, that pending the lease, the terms and conditions of which were found by the jury, the parties entered into a parol agreement of sale of the premises in dispute; that the defendant, from the date of that agreement for several .years, and to the time of the institution of these proceedings, has had exclusive possession of the premises under it; that the parties have during all that time treated the lease as at an end, and no claim for rent has been made; that a large number of payments have been applied upon the purchase money, and the whole conduct of the case, during the progress of the trial shows, that the payment of the rent is resisted on these specific grounds.</p>
