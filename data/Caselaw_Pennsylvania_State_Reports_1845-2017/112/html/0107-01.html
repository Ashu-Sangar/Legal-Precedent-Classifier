It is also admitted that Mrs. Follweiler bought the title she now has with notice that Mrs. Lutz .had it by virtue of her deed from the assignees. The law says where a party thus has notice she cannot complain that the deed is not recorded, because the object of putting a deed on record is to give notice to the public that somebody else has a title, and where a party had actual notice of the other deed though not recorded, the law places him or her in the same position as if the deed'had been recorded. In order to simplify this case, the plaintiffs very sensibly admitted that they had notice. They are therefore in the same position as if the deed had been recorded in Lehigh county.

On the top, or somewhere, near the top, the county line runs between these two counties. One of the surveyors, Mr, Stoudt, testified that he run this line, and he described to you how and where he run it, and what land marks he found. He testified that he found the county line to be north of the house in which David Follweiler lived.

This presents a question of some difficulty in the opinion of the dourt. The first impression would be to say that where a house is located on the county line, and the man occupying makes an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, the deed must be recorded in both counties in order to be valid.

Jessé Follweiler was present at the public sale when Mrs. Lutz purchased. Rebecca Fftllweiler, wife of Jesse, purchased at the sheriff’s sale with full notice of Mrs. Lutz’s title from the assignee. We submit that under the authorities Jesse Follweiler, the creditor, misconceived his remedy, and if it be admitted that Mrs. Follweiler had notice of the unrecorded title of Mrs. Lutz, then no title passed to her as purchaser at the sheriff’s sale held by virtue of an execution on this judgment. Jesse Follweiler, as a creditor, had his remedy, whilst the estate was in process of settlement, and whilst the property remained unconverted and undistributed, if he intended honestly and fairly to contest the validity of the assignment by reason of the non-recording thereof. After the conversion and distribution of the estate he was too late to enforce his remedy in the manner he now attempts.</p>

This fact created doubt as to the county in which he actually resided. Evidence was therefore admissible to show by his acts, declarations and intentions in which county he elected to fix and maintain his residence. The evidence given to establish it was sufficient to submit to the jury, and it was so done in a correct charge.</p>
