What then is the effect of the limitation incorporated into the Act? Is the part to which it applies wholly unconstitutional,'and does it render void upon that ground the section which authorizes the proceeding for freeing an inter-county bridge ? Or is the section valid, giving the authority so to free bridges on the line of two counties, and the proviso only void ? In the latter case are the proceedings to fall if an assessment of over $30,000 is finally reached upon appeal ?
