Some of the witnesses say that his speed was continued Until the accident occurred. Others say that he slowed up as he approached the railroad, until he came almost to a stop. There is a gate at the north side of the railway on Seventeenth street, but it was not lowered. The gate-man was at it, and some of the witnesses say he was in the act of lowering it. It was about 15 feet from an upright position at the top when Conway came to the railway. One of the witnesses, a boy 14 years of age, who is since deceased, says that when the decedent came to the railway the gate-man beckoned to him to come on. His testimony was : “ Mr. Conway was coming and he stopped slow. The man at the gate beckoned to him to come on. He drove across the railroad and the engine struck the wagon. When the man beckoned he came right on. He was coming towards home. The engine struck Mr. Conway’s wagon just where the post is that the gate lays on.” On cross-examination he said: “ When the gate-keeper beckoned him Mr. Conway started at once. He went pretty fast when he started.”</p>

But the late case of Lewis <em>v. </em>Holahan, 7 Out., 429, overrules Langdon <em>v. </em>Railroad. One of the points made in that case was that the Act of 4th April, 1868, in so far at least as it limits the amount of damages to be recovered, is avoided by the constitutional provision, article 3, section 21, prohibiting limitation of the amount of damages for injuries to persons or property, or injuries resulting in death. The Supreme Court, in passing on this point, says: “ As to the second proposition, we are of opinion that it is correct. The purpose of the 21st section of the 3d article of the Constitution was to nullify, as far as possible, the then existing limitation limiting the amount to be recovered for injuries resulting in death, or for injuries to persons or property,.....and at the same time prevent all such legislation in the future.”</p>

    <p id="b531-5" data-blocks='[["BL_531.6",531,[163,783,1171,690]]]'>This was intended to raise an interesting question, viz., whether a charter is repealed by the new constitution without legislation providing for such repeal. This is a new question, excepting in so far as it was considered in Hays <em>v. </em>Com., 82 Penn. St. Rep., 518, and Langdon <em>v. </em>Penn. Railroad Company, 92 Id., 21. We decline to discuss it now, however, for the reason that the question is not properly upon the record. It was not proved upon the trial below that the defendant company had accepted the provisions of. the Act of 1868. It is true the paper book contains a copy of what purports' to be resolutions of the company accepting said Act, but the resolutions were not put in evidence and no such point was made upon the trial. That it was brought to the attention of the court upon the argument for a new trial does not help the matter, and even this does not appear properly, as the opinion of the court upon that motion is no part of the record.</p>

Some of the reasoning by which it was supported is not sustained by the late case of Lewis <em>v. </em>Hollohan, 103 Penn. St. Rep., 425, and as my brethren are wiser than myself I cheerfully submit to their views. Moreover, if when the main question comes up again, Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Langdon shall be found to be a mistake, it will afford me pleasure to join in overruling it. But the question has not been here since, until the attempt to raise it in the present case. It is therefore premature to assume that Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Langdon has been overruled. This court has not yet said that the new constitution <em>ipso facto </em>repealed charters.</p>
