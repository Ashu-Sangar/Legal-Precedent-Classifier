The only question which arises is as to the share of the estate to be taken by Thomas E. Hancock, son of the testator’s sister, Jane Hancock. It was probably the intention of the testator to exclude this nephew from any portion of his estate, except one sixth of* the share which he would have taken had there been an entire intestacy; but, unfortunately for this view of the case,,he has, except to the extent of the gift of the stocks in trust and the annuities to his sisters, confined his testamentary disposition to such portion only of his estate as would have gone to his sister, viz., one fifth, leaving the remaining four fifths to pass under the intestate laws. Part of the estate consists of realty, and it is well settled that an heir at law can only be disinherited by express devise or necessary implication, and that in the construction of a will of doubtful meaning every fair intendment is to be made in his favor: Bender •y.'Dietrick, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 284" data-case-ids="481837" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0284-01">7 W. &amp; S., 284</a>; Hitchcock <em>v. </em>Hitchcock, 11 Casey, 393; France’s Appeal, 25 Smith, 220; Rupp <em>v. </em>Ebberly, 29 Id., 141. In Bender <em>v. </em>Dietrick <em>(supra') </em>the testator gave to each of his daughters by his first wife $50 in two equal annual payments, and no more, “to be paid to my executrix hereinafter named, and no more,” and the residue of his estate, both real and personal, to his second wife for life. ■ It was contended that the gift to the daughters with the words “no more,” excluded them from participation in the distribu<a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>tion of the estate at the death of the widow, and manifested' an intention that her children should be the residuary legatees. It was held, however; that while -it was not unlikely that such was the intention, it was not a necessary implication, and nothing less was sufficient to 'exclude an heir.. The implication is not stronger in the present case. ■ It must be confessed that the question is not free from difficulty, and if the estate consisted only of personalty,’ it might be that the legatee would be excluded from coming in as next of kin: Breton <em>v. </em>Vachell, 5 Bro. P. C., 51, 1 P. Wins., 548; though see Tavernor <em>v. </em>Grindlev, 32 L. T. N.. S., 424; Johnson <em>v. . </em>Johnson, 4 Beav., 318 ; Gould <em>v. </em>Gould, 32 Id., 391. But it is clear, under the authorities cited, that there is no exclusion so far as the real estate is concerned, and it can scarcely be that a different rule is to be applied as to personalty where both pass from the same testator or intestate. There will, therefore, be awarded to Thomas E. Haneock, under the will of the testator, one sixth of one fifth of the balances, principal and income in the hands of the accounts as above, and one fifth of the remaining four fifths of. such balances to him as next of kin ; and to the other next of kin of the testator, or-the representative — appointed under the laws, of this Com-, monwealth — of such as have died since his death, according to their respective interests, what is left.</p>

But, it is to be observed, when “the law” gives a share to one heir, it necessarily, and at the same instant, vests the shares of all the others; and this was the idea in the mind of • the testator when he said, “ I give .and bequeath to ..... . <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>the son of my sister Jane ..... only one sixth of such' portion as the law would give and the remaining five sixths to be divided among my other brothers and sisters, or their heirs.” It is as if he had said, “ My estate is to pass to those entitled under the intestate law, but my sister’s son shall have one sixth only of the share which she.would have taken if living, the balance of such share going' to my other brothel’s and sisters.” He has expressed himself elliptically, but'his meaning is clearly implied, and the literal construction of his language leads to a result precisely the opposite of what was intended. Even, however, if it be conceded that no provision is made with regard to the persons who are to take the other four fifths, it is plain the nephew is not to be one of them. His exclusion is not limited to an aliquot part of the estate, and to permit him to take one sixth of one fifth under the will, and one fifth of four fifths under the intestate law, would be directly in the teeth of what the will itself declares, viz., that he shall' have but one sixth “ of such portion as ” (that is, “whatever”) “the law would give.” It is true that an heir, or one taking under the intestate laws, is not to be excluded except by express devise or necessary implication, but it is no less true that an intestacy is not to be permitted, if by any construction of the will it can be avoided ; or, as it is sometimes expressed, “it will be presumed that a testator intended to dispose of his whole estate, unless the contrary appears in clear and unmistakable termsKennard <em>v. </em>Ken-' nard, 2 Eastern Reporter, 38; Clarkson <em>v. </em>Clarkson, <a href="/ky/71/0655-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Bush 655" data-case-ids="4384283" data-case-paths="/ky/71/0655-01">8 Bush., 655</a> ; Byers <em>v. </em>Byers, <a href="/ky/36/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Dana 313" data-case-ids="5549495" data-case-paths="/ky/36/0313-01">6 Dana, 313</a> ; Ferry’s Appeal, 6 Out.,, 207.</p>

But she was dead, and of the portion she would have had, only one sixth is given to Thomas, her son, and the other five sixths are given to the testator’s other sisters and brothers or their heirs. Five sixths of what? ' Five sixths of something of which the other one sixth is given to Thomas.' It is too plain for argument that the fractional parts thus given are parts of the same thing and not of different things. The words are, “ and the <em>remaining </em>five sixths to be divided ” &amp;c. — these words necessarily import the five sixths which remain after the previously mentioned one sixth is deducted.</p>

If by these words, either directly or indirectly, the brothers and sisters take five sixths of the whole residuary estate, it necessarily follows that Thomas takes one fifth of the same estate. If on the other hand Thomas takes one fifth only, of his mother’s portion, as it would have been if she were alive, then by an equal necessity it follows that the brothers and sisters take the remaining five sixths of that portion. And such we are quite clear is the true construction of this paper. By i t Thomas takes one fifth of what would have been his mother’s portion, and the brothers and sisters take the remaining five sixths of that same portion. As to the remainder of his property other than the gifts by the other papers, the testator died intestate, and it must be distributed according to the intestate lu w <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>to the next of kin.

It is argued however that he is excluded by implication because he takes one fifth of Jane’s portion, but if that be so why are not the appellees excluded because they take “ the remaining five sixths ” of the same portion ? The language which is claimed to be exclusive as to the appellant is the only and the same language which gives title to the appellees. If it excludes the one it must for the same reason exclude the others. To hold that the appellant takes one fifth only of Jane’s portion, and none of the residue <em>because </em>he takes that one fifth, and that the appellees take five sixths of Jane’s portion and the whole of the residue <em>because </em>they take that five sixths, is an irreconcilable anomaly to us and we are imable to agree to it. In point of fact the residue was awarded to the appellees by intestacy, and the appellant was excluded from it for a reason which if it excludes him necessarily excludes them also, and if it does not exclude them cannot in our judgment, with any fairness of reasoning, exclude him.</p>

It would at least have prevented the misconception of our meaning which seems to have resulted. To our minds it is a necessary and an inevitable inference- from the words of the will that the testator intended to die intestate as to four fifths of his residuary estate, and to devise only the one fifth part thereof. There is not a moment’s question that such is the <em>literal </em>reading of the will. In Weidman’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Leg.%20Int.%20388" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="42 Leg. Int. 388">42 Leg. Int., 388</a>, we said (Trunkey, J.): “ The question in expounding a will is not what the testator meant, <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>but what is the meaning of his words.” Here the testator expressly devises one portion of his estate, and he expressly omits to devise any other part or portion of it. It is true, he describes it as such portion as the law would give to his sister Jane Hancock. But this mode of .description can serve but one possible purpose, and that is to ascertain the aliquot part of his estate which the testator intended to devise. For in very truth there is not, and there cannot be; any such thing as “Jane’s portion” of his estate. Had she survived him, and had he died intestate, there , would have been a subject matter corresponding to the description, and even if he had not died intestate, .but left the will in question, there would be much force in the contention of the appellees that she personally would have been excluded from the estate, and the devisees of her portion could have taken only so much of the estate as that portion would represent. But, in point of fact, Jane was dead before the testator, even before the will was written, and hence the testator knew when he wrote it that she never had, and never could have, any portion of his estate whatever.</p>
    <p id="b556-6" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[244,1253,1168,985]]]'>If the will is to be literally and strictly construed, there is now no subject matter upon which these words of the will can operate, and hence there would be intestacy even as to this. But it is very plain to us that the testator did mean to give that proportion of his estate which Jane’s portion would have represented if she had survived him and he had died intestate. That portion would necessarily be uncertain, because the testator could not know which or how many of his brothers and sisters or their heirs would survive him. Hence he could not specify a distinct aliquot part of his estate in figures to pass by this clause. . He could only define a method by which the aliquot part could be ascertained. This he did, and as there were a brother and sister, and children of another brother and sister' surviving, the number of shares or portions, had Jane .survived, would have been five, and the part of the estate disposed of by the will is one fifth. Of this one fifth he gives one sixth to the appellant, and the other, or “remaining” five sixths he directs to be divided among his “ other sisters and .brothers or their heirs.” We cannot see any mystery., doubt or uncertainty in the language of the will. The testator, though a man of intelligence, was not a lawyer, and he expressed himself concisely, but, as we think, with sufficient clearness of meaning.</p>

As a matter of course, if the supposed language were, in truth, analogous to the language actually used, there would be an end of the case, and the conclusion reached would be inevitable. Bilt, in our view, the supposed or illustrative language is in no sense analogous to that of the will, and fdr this reason : The words, “ My estate is to pass to those entitled under the intestate law,” are a direct, positive and absolute devise of the <em>entire estate </em>to persons readily ascertained, and in such a case there cannot be any residue or any question as to the legatees. The whole estate would go to the heirs, or next of kin, according to the character of the estate, and if there were five shares, four of them would go 'to the four stocks or their representatives, and the other share would be divided into six parts, one of which would go, by the next succeeding words, to the appellant, and the remaining five to the other four stocks. To treat this language as of equivalent meaning with the real words of the will, and then put the same interpretation upon the real words as must necessarily be put upon the ‘substituted words, is simply begging the whole question. It proves nothing. There are no words in the will which pass the whole estate, and there are none which give, or pretend to give, the residue or any part -of it. The other additional thought contained in the opinion is thus expressed: “Even, however, if it be conceded that no provision is made with regard to <em>the </em>persons who are to take the other four fifths, it is plain the nephew is not to be one of them.” We are altogether unable to see the correctness of this inference. Here are the words of the will: “ I, Thomas S. Ellis, being of sound mind and of my own free will give and bequeath to Thomas ■Hancock, son of my sister Jane Hancock, only one sixth of • such portion as the law would give to said Jane Hancock, .and the remaining five sixths to be divided among, my other sisters and brothers or their heirs,” It is beyond all question that these words bequeath one part of the estate only. That part is to be determined by ascertaining what portion of the estate Jane would have taken if she had lived and the testator had died intestate. As there were five brothers and sisters in all, the portion which the testator manifestly intended to give was one fifth. Of this one fifth he gives one sixth to Thomas and “the remaining, five, sixths” to the others, and then stops, makings no gift of the residue. . j</p>

But the learned judge convinces himself otherwise in the following manner: “His exclusion is not limited to an aliquot part of the estate, and to permit him to take one sixth of one fifth under the will, and one fifth of four fifths under the intestate law, would be directly in the teeth of what the will itself declares, viz., that he shall have but one sixth of such portion as (that is ‘whatever’) the law would give.” We fail to see how this result would be “in the teeth of what the will itself declares,” when the wfill makes no kind of declaration about the residue. A plain person would understand that the testator meant just what he said, that Thomas was to have one sixth of Jane’s portion, and the brothers and sisters were to have “ the remaining five sixths of that same portion.' As to all the rest of the estate the will says nothing, and therefore it must be distributed as though the testator had died intestate. It is not practicable to say that Thomas was intended to be excluded from the four fifths which compose the residue, <em>because </em>he was given only one fifth of <em>Jane's </em>portion, unless we are prepared to say that the others are excluded from the same four fifths for the same reason. For'it is <em>Jane's portion </em>all the time, the gift of a part of which to the appellant is claimed to exclude him from the intestate residue. But <em>Jane's portion </em>means the’ same thing when a part of it is given to one legatee as it means when another part of it is given to other legatees.</p>

The confusion of ideas comes from the mixing of the intestate residue with the testate, <em>Jane's portion. </em>The latter was given by the will, and nothing more was given. Because nothing more of the estate than <em>Jane's portion </em>was given, there was intestacy as to all'the rest. This means real intestacy, not an intestacy to fix the shares of the others, and, at the same time, a testacy to exclude the appellant and give the whole of the residue to the appellees. For, in intestacy, the appellant takes, not as the son of his mother, but as the nephew of the testator. It is the degree of his kinship, not the source through which it comes, which places him in the same category with the appellees. With the consequences ■Which flow from intestacy we have nothing to do in interpreting the will. They are the result of the palpable and, as we think, intentional omission of the will to dispose of the residue. To make a testacy of this residue we must put words into the will which are not there, words which not only designate a residue, but designate also the persons who are to <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>take it. <em>We </em>have no such power, nor the slightest disposition to claim it.</p>

It would not be a sound argument, if it were true, but it is not true. In point of fact the widow took one half the estate, but in testing the meaning of the will upon its face that circumstance need not be regarded, as nothing was given to her. The estate distributed amounts to about §300,000. Of this one fifth, or <em>Jane’s portion, </em>is §60,000, and by the will the appellant, Jane's only child, gets but §10,000, while the remaining §50,000 are given to his aunt, his uncle, and his cousins. His aunt and uncle each get §12,500 of his own mother’s natural portion if she had been living and the testator intestate, and of these amounts the appellant is disinherited by the terms of the will. But the appellees are not satisfied with this, and therefore they contend that we ought to declare judicially that in order to produce equality of distribution the whole remaining four fifths, to wit, §240,000, should be given to the aunt, the uncle, and the cousins. If we do, George D. Ellis, Jane Hancock’s brother, who stands in no better or more favored position than she in natural distribution under the intestate law, would take, if the will were literally carried out, §60,000, and Eliza Shuster, a sister, the same sum, and Jane Hancock’s only child would take nothing. Out of the whole estate, this natural representative of one fifth would get §10,000, and the other two, each, §72,500. Or if the widow and all the legatees, except the appellant and his uncle, were dead before the testator, what is called Jane’s portion would then have been one half, and of this the appellant would have taken one sixth, being §25,000, and the uncle the remaining five sixths, being §125,000; and as, according to the theory contended for, the appellant is excluded from the residue, and the whole of it actually given by the will to the legatees other than the appellant, the uncle would take the whole of it, to wit, §150,000. In this event, therefore, the appellant would have received out of the whole estate §25,000, and the uncle §275,000. And if, instead of the uncle, the only survivor had been one of the cousins, that one cousin would have tak&amp;n the §275,000, and the appellant the §25,000. If this is equality we fail to see it. It is scarcely necessary to add that, as the facts are, each one of the cousins would gefi a share considerably in excess of the appellant under the decree of the court below as it now stands. While even such results must be declared if the language of the will requires it, it must not be done in the name of equality when there is <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>no such language. The election of the widow to take her share reduces the foregoing figures correspondingly, but the proportion remains the same.</p>
    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[291,531,1168,504]]]'>Not a solitary reason can be found in any of the testamentary papers in this case for practically disinheriting the appellant, or for supposing that the testator so desired. To accomplish that result a complicated, not to say sophistical, course of reasoning must be resorted to in order to prove by argument, not by testamentary words, the presence of an intent in the mind of the testator, which, so far as we can discern, never had the slightest existence. Sufficient inequality is produced to satisfy every demand of the words used by reading them according to their plain and natural meaning. More than this is not required, and' therefore should not be permitted.</p>
    <p id="b560-5" data-blocks='[["BL_560.6",560,[289,1045,1168,429]]]'>In preparing the opinion in this case we did not review the authorities, because it was not necessary. Not one was cited for the appellees which would, in the least degree, have justified us in adopting their construction, while many were cited in the elaborate and exhaustive argument for the appellant — notably Bender <em>v. </em>Dietrick, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 284" data-case-ids="481837" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0284-01">7 <em>W. </em>&amp; S., 284</a>, and Hitchcock v. Hitchcock, 11 Cas., 393 — which were highly persuasive by reason of their analogy to the case at bar, we thought it unnecessary to discuss them because the plain words of this will afford a sufficient clue to its meaning.</p>
