It will be recollected that the report of the viewers was made at the January Sessions, 1883, and then approved and confirmed. Exceptions were filed and were pending until the 24th day of December, 1883, when they were dismissed. The application for a review was presented on the 25th day of June and reviewers appointed. The order, however, was revoked and the view confirmed at the succeeding January term. Afterwards a rule to reinstate the application for a review was granted, reviewers appointed, and a report made. This was irregular. It is irregular to appoint reviewers after confirmation of the road: Sellers’ Road, 2 Leg. Opin., 72; Franconia Township Road, 28 P. F. S., 316.</p>

The whole proceedings are <em>in fieri </em>and open to exceptions, until the next term after the approval of the report; after that, an exception comes.too late.

The report of the viewers was filed and confirmed <em>nisi </em>at the January Term, 1883, and if the width had then been fixed by the court, and exceptions had not been filed, or a review ordered, at the April term the road reported would have, without more, become a lawful public highway. At the April Term, however, exceptions were filed, and this suspended the proceedings upon the report of the view. The report had only been confirmed nisi, that is to say, unless before the next term of court exceptions should be filed or a review ordered. The filing of the exceptions, therefore, took off this confirmation, and the report remained subject to the further action of the court.</p>
