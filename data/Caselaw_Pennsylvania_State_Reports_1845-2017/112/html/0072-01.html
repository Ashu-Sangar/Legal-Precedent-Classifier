      <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>The plaintiff, while mining coal for the defendants at Fair-View Mines, was injured by a fall of loose slate and coal from overhead, which in some way became disconnected from the body of the roof, and in regard to which you have heard the testimony, if the evidence is believed, that is what fell; nevertheless, you are the judges of the facts. It is not disputed that his leg was broken, that he was injured and suffered great pain for some weeks, that he was under the surgeon’s treatment for several months, that he was unable'to work.for a still longer time, and that, to the present, he has not-been able to. earn as much as he could have earned had he not been injured; and there is, also, some proof that he will likely be affected by this injury during the balance of his life. If the plaintiff, as a miner, undertook to mine coal for the defend•ants, when he engaged in this employment and entered their mine at Fairview, he assumed the risks that were incident to his employment as a miner. Of course there is more risk in going into a coal-bank to work than there is in the occupation of an agricultural laborer, or in many other employments. The miner goes into the mine with that understanding; he engages in the work subject to such risks as are incident to his employment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-4" data-blocks='[["BL_89.5",89,[155,1347,1168,814]]]'>The defendants, who are the employers, were under an implied contract to exercise reasonable care, and to adopt suitable instruments and means for mining with safety. That is part of the duty of the defendants. The miner takes a certain amount of risk, and the employer must see that due care is exercised on his part. Where the danger is apparent and seen by the miner himself, or is pointed out to him by a co-employee, or some one else in the mine at the same time, who cautions him of the danger, and he, notwithstanding, proceeds with his work and in consequence is hurt, whereas by suspending work he would not have been injured, and you find that, if notified or cautioned, he could with safety have desisted from the work, then his own negligence contributed to the injury, and he cannot recover. The evidence, if believed, shows that the injury resulted from a fall of loose coal and slate from overhead, which existed there as a sort of “ horseback.” The plaintiff alleges that the cause of the fall was negligence in the widening of the room and the narrowing of the pillars, and that this was done by order of the mining boss.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-5" data-blocks='[["BL_89.6",89,[155,2162,1163,255]],["BL_90.1",90,[275,406,1172,129]]]'>If that was so, and the injury did result from that cause, it would probably present a different case; but, if the evidence be believed, the pillars stand intact to-day, as they did at the time they were cut, before the injury, at the time of the injury, and since. There has been no fall of the roof of- the mine, except this loose mass, and that cannot be called the roof. <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>You will readily understand the difference between the coming down of the entire superincumbent mass and the fall of a small kettle-shaped fragment out of the roof.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b90-5" data-blocks='[["BL_90.5",90,[268,535,1178,1035]]]'>The witnesses for the defendants, expert miners, say the fall was independent of the size of the room or the pillars, and that there was a seam or slip apparent, disconnecting this “ horse-back ” from the roof, and that it would have fallen if the room had been much narrower. This evidence is important on the question as to whether the widening of that room caused that overhanging mass to fall. The room has Joeen driven a great distance since, and the roof is intact; and it is in evidence that such slips of “ horse-back ” occur frequently in mining, and that, upon the whole, this was a safe mine. The defendants deny that they ordered the widening of the room or the cutting down of the pillars. If you should' conclude that the widening of the room had nothing to do with the fall, and that is a question for you from the evidence, then the plaintiff further says that it resulted from the defendants’ negligence in not supplying him with proper props or supports where they should have been delivered. I mean that if the question of the widening of the room is out of the way, and no injury resulted from that alone, then the other question arises, whether it resulted from a lack of props. It is in evidence by most of the witnesses that the injury could have been averted in two ways — first, by a prop : second, by pulling down the loose material before starting in to mine ; but it was not pulled down, and no prop was erected.</p>

The Act of Assembly, upon close examination, seems plain enough to us ; it provides : “ In order to better secure the proper ventilation of every coal mine, and promote the.health and safety of the persons employed therein, the owner or agent shall employ a competent and practical inside overseer, to be called, mining boss, who shall keep a careful watch over the ventilating apparatus, air-ways, traveling-ways, pumps, pump-timbers and drainage, and shall see that as the miners advance their excavations all loose coal, slate and rock overhead are carefully, secured against falling in or upon the travelling-ways, and that sufficient timber is furnished of suitable lengths and sizes for the places where they are to be used, and placed in the working places of the miners.”</p>

The evidence in the case is wholly for you; you must determine whether there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. If there was, he cannot recover. If there was no contributory negligence, he can recover. There are cases when the uncontradicted evidence enables the court to charge the jury that the facts proven do or do not constitute contributory negligence, and there have been some points presented in this case asking us substantially to do so ; but there are, in our opinion, facts in evidence affirmed on the part of the defendants’ witnesses and denied by those of the plaintiff, which are for the jury. It does not follow, when we decline to answer a point, as when asked to say that such and such acts constitute contributory negligence, and we refuse to say so, that, therefore, we mean that there was no contributory negligence.

    <p id="b93-11" data-blocks='[["BL_93.19",93,[204,2392,1123,44]],["BL_94.1",94,[261,413,1170,561]]]'>It was plain error to instruct the jury that the defendants <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>below were responsible for the negligence of their mine boss. There was no evidence that he was not competent to perform his duties, and hence no negligence can be imputed to defendants for employing him. It has been repeatedly lield that a mining boss is such a fellow servant as in case of an injury to other emplees through his negligence the master is-not responsible. It is sufficient to refer to Lehigh Yalley Coal Company <em>v. </em>Jones, 86 Penn. St. Rep., 432; Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Carroll, 89 Id., 374; Keystone Bridge Co. <em>v. </em>Newbury, 96 Id., 246. It is to be presumed tbe attention of the court below was not called to these cases, as ours certainly has not been. As the case stands, it is our plain duty to reverse upon the second, third and fourth assignments.</p>
    <p id="b94-5" data-blocks='[["BL_94.5",94,[260,973,1171,552]]]'>We might stop here. A careful examination of the testimony compels us to reverse also upon the fifth and sixth assignments, which respectively called upon the court for a binding instruction in favor of the defendants. This instruction should have been given. There was no proof — not even a scintilla — of the negligence of any one but the plaintiff himself. He was injured by the falling of a portion of the roof of the- mine; the falling could have been prevented by a single prop. It was the duty of the plaintiff to have put that prop there, and there were plenty of props conveniently at hand at the mouth of the mine to have used. None of these facts is disputed. They were proved by bis own witnesses, and they show that he has no case.</p>
