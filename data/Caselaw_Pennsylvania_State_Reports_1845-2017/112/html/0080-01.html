There was no alteration or change of use after the date of the insurance. Perhaps the risk was increased when the house became tenantless, but it was not agreed that the policy should cease when use or occupancy of the premises ceased. When the tenant moved out there was no change made by the carrying on of any trade, business or vocation on the premises. Nor was there any change .as to tenants or occupancy.- No condition or provision is in the policy relative to the premises being occupied. Where the insurance is on an occupied dwelling-house, without more, there is no agreement or promise that it shall remain occupied. “ It is vain to argue that no use at all is a use for other purposes than those for which the building was used when insured.” The policy did not bind the assured to any use, further than that when used it should be only as a dwelling-house and store.

When the act imputes a crime, the inculpatory evidence must be sufficient to overcome the exculpatory evidence and the presumption of innocence, otherwise there is no preponderance to establish the fact. That presumption is due every man in every court, and when it is alleged that he has done a dishonest or criminal act, the presumption weighs in his favor. In the civil issue he is not on trial. The judgment is not evidence that he is guilty of crime. The act affirmed is an incident, a fact, to be proved like other pertinent facts. For instance, in this cáse, had the insured changed the té'nancy or occupancy of the premises, without notice to the assurer, proof of the act would have been competent, and the fact established by preponderance of evidence. If a man, by deceit, fraudulently obtains insurance on a building, by like evidence his act may be established to avoid the policy; if he burns the insured building, the same rule of evidence ought to apply when it is proposed to prove the act for like purpose.</p>

Preponderating evidence is necessary to establish the latter.” But he held that the error was immaterial, for the reason that the evidence would not warrant a finding that John Usaw burned the house. That was not his view of the evidence at the trial, nor of the able counsel for the plaintiff.</p>

The house was insured for $2,300, and rented for $60 per annum. It was unoccupied, was fired by an incendiary, and the fire was first observed a little after midnight on Sunday morning. Usaw was then living at Harrisburg, but came into the neighborhood a few days before the fire. One witness met and conversed with him near the house about nine o’clock on Friday <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>evening, when he said he was going to Morgan’s; he did not go then. Some time after the fire he told the same witness that he did not tell the truth that night, and then spoke of the loss of his pocket-book. Two witnesses saw him at the house on Saturday afternoon ; one^of the two heard some person in the house, and after the fire Usaw tried to persuade him that he had heard no one in the house that afternoon. Between four and five o’clock on Saturday afternoon he passed the toll-gate and inquired of the keeper the way to Johns-town, and went the way as directed. The next morning, Sunday, between seven and eight o’clock, the keeper of the same toll gate saw him pass, going in the same direction as he went on the afternoon before, but he did not speak.</p>
