By this the question is very squarely raised. The Legislature felt bound to take action to regulate nominating conventions and prevent fraud there, and you can readily see if a candidate for nomination should resort to bribery, fraud and corruption to get the nomination, and then between the time of the nomination and election conduct himself properly, and jet escape any liability for the corruption in getting the nomination, then it would not correct the evil that the constitution and the Legislature intended should be corrected in order to purify our elections. The primary elections and nominating conventions have become important elements in the politics of this state and the country, and this Act of 1881, which is referred to here, was for the purpose of con<a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>trolling and regulating those primary elections, the delegate elections as they are called. It provides “ that hereafter if a candidate for any office within this Commonwéalth shall, directly or indirectly, give, offer or promise to give, or procure any other person to give, offer or promise to'give, to any elecfcor'any gift or reward in money, goods or other valuable thing, or any security for the payment or the delivery of money, goods . or other .valuable thing, or any office, emolument or employment on condition, express or implied, that the said elector shall cast, give, retain or withhold his vote, or use his influence at a nominating election or delegate election, or cast, give or substitute another to cast or give, his vote or use his influence at a nominating convention for or against the nomination of any particular candidate for nomination (and so on), is subject to a penalty, and may be sentenced to'pay a fine not exceeding 1300, and be imprisoned for a period' not exceeding three .months.”</p>

It was .a great evil, one which the Legislature felt bound .to interfere with. It very often happened that the party who received the most votes was not returned, and men who never were elected were returned as delegates to a county convention, and so there is a punishment' provided .here for any party who accepts any bribe of that kind. This was found still not to be sufficient, and there was further legislation on the subject which has not been called to your attention, which indicates to my mind very clearly that this must be regarded as a part of the election law of the state. It goes to the very foundation of our political system in making nominations and electing men to office. I repeat, that if a man should by corrupt influence, by promise of reward, or in any other way obtain a nomination over honest men who would not resort to such methods, and then, by simply conducting himself properly after that, hold the office without subjecting’himself to punishment for his fraudulent incipiency of the canvass, there would be a great defect in the law. A subsequent -Act passed by the same legislature provides for the duties of judges, inspectors and clerks and other officers of these delegate elections, meetings or caucuses for the purpose of nominating candidates for office of state, city or county. They are required each one to take an oiitli to properly, impartially and faithfully perform their duties.

The Act of 1817 expressly refers to betting on the success of candidates for public offices, and the penal provisions against betting on the result of elections-, enacted in 1839, are embodied in an Act which- relates exclusively to elections for public officers. The subject respecting which betting is prohibited is unmistakable, and the word. ‘ election ’ cannot be justly construed to apply to other subjects. ‘ We are to look at the words in the first instance, and when they are plain we are to decide on them. If they be doubtful, we have then to have recourse to the subject matter.’ The meaning of the words ‘ any election within this Commonwealth,’ when read with the context, is plain; and when considered with the subject matter there is no footing to conjure a doubt whether they may refer to the election of officers for a private corporation, or of a meeting of citizens.

The object aimed at in the constitutional provision was the purification of our elections. The Act of 1881 is in the direct line of this object. It recognizes the fact that many of the frauds which affect elections, and sometimes thwart the will of the people, are perpetrated in what may be termed the preliminary stages of an election ; in those proceedings by means of which candidates are selected for the people to vote for at the general election. We have already said that it is competent for the law-making power by appropriate legislation to repress and punish such frauds.</p>
    <p id="b638-6" data-blocks='[["BL_638.6",638,[245,1230,1173,168]]]'>It remains to notice the precise language of the 9th section of article VIII.: “ Any person who shall, while a candidate for office, be guilty of bribery, fraud, or wilful violation of any election law,” &amp;c.</p>
    <p id="b638-8" data-blocks='[["BL_638.7",638,[246,1403,1174,301]]]'>Was the defendant a candidate for office at the time the alleged violation of law occurred? It is not denied that he was nominated and elected, and was therefore unquestionably a candidate for office subsequent to his nomination by the convention. I am now considering the question whether he was a candidate-prior to his nomination, and at a time when most of the alleged corrupt offences occurred.</p>
    <p id="b638-9" data-blocks='[["BL_638.8",638,[246,1704,1176,594]]]'>The word “ candidate ” in the Constitution is to be understood in its ordinary popular meaning ; as the people understood it, whose votes at the polls gave that instrument the force and effect of organic law. Webster defines the word to mean : “ One who seeks or aspires to some office or privilege, or who offers himself for the same.” This is the popular meaning of the word “ candidate; ” it is doubtless the meaning which the members of the constitutional convention attached to it, and the sense in which the people regarded it when they came to vote. We therefore say, in every day life, that a man is a candidate for an office when he is seeking such office. It is begging the question to say that he is only a candidate after nomination, for many persons have been elected to office who were never nominated at all.</p>

If, while such candidate, he was guilty of either <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>bribery, fraud, or the wilful violation of any election law. he comes directly within the terms of the constitutional provision. The matters of bribery and fraud may be passed over in this discussion, which relates more particularly to the last of the offences named, viz.: “ the wilful violation of an election law.”</p>
    <p id="b639-6" data-blocks='[["BL_639.5",639,[144,664,1186,809]]]'>What is an election law? Here again we must bring to our aid the common and popular use of words. Our laws are intended for the people, who are presumed to read and understand them. They are not like the edicts of the Roman Emperor Caligula, which, Dio Cassius says, were written in very small characters and hung up so high that the people could not read them. When laws are made by a popular government, that is to say, “ a government of the people, by the people, and for the people,” we may safely assume that words in a statute or a constitution are used in the sense in which the people who made the statute or constitution understood them. So that when the people inserted in their constitution the words, “any election law,” it is fair to assume that they meant any law relating to elections. It is idle to say that a statute which prescribes the hours when the polls shall open .and close is an election law, while a statute which punishes bribery or fraud in an election officer is not an election law. They both relate to .the same subject, and the one is as much an election law as the other.</p>
    <p id="b639-7" data-blocks='[["BL_639.6",639,[159,1480,1181,167]]]'>Conceding all this, it was contended' on behalf of the defendant, that primary elections are not elections at all within, the meaning of the Constitution, and that a statute regulating them is not an election law.</p>

Under our frame of government a vast system of political machinery has grown up by which elections have been for many years practically controlled. It is so far-reaching in its effects that the people have in many instances little to do at the polls beyond the ratification of what had been already done by nominating conventions. Such .conventions have often been controlled by the very influences which the Constitution and the Act of 1881 seek to strike down. The influence which these primary elections have for good or evil upon the politics of the country is overshadowing. In many portions of the state, as is well known, a nomination by a convention of one of the parties is practically the equivalent of an election; in some instances it is the precise equivalent, as in the case where there are two persons to elect, and the elector is allowed by law to vote for but one. The importance of' the relation of the primary to the general election must be apparent to every one who does not shut his <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>'eyes that he may not see, and stop his ears that he may not hear. Primary elections and nominating conventions have now become a part of our great political system, and are welded and riveted into it so firmly as to be difficult of separation. The Act of 1881 recognizes this fact; it treats primary elections as part of a great system ; it declares them to 'be elections to be regulated by law to some extent; and prescribes and punishes certain frauds committed thereat. It concerns elections in a most important sense. How then can we say that it is not an election law, when the legislature has declared that it is? Moreover the relation of nominating conventions to the general election, and the importance of that relation, is recognized by the Constitution itself. This is notably so in Article VII, which prescribes the oath of office, and which requires all senators and representatives, and all judicial, state and county officers to swear that “ I have not paid or contributed, or promised to <em>pay </em>or contribute, either directly •or indirectly, any money or other valuable thing to procure my <em>nomination </em>or election,” &amp;e., &amp;c.</p>
    <p id="b640-6" data-blocks='[["BL_640.5",640,[248,1231,1200,477]]]'>As before observed the Constitution must be construed liberally, so as to carry out and not defeat the purpose for which it was adopted. If we give it the narrow construction claimed for it, a candidate for office might resort to all manner of bribery and fraud in procuring his nomination, yet if he conduct himself properly after his nomination, he could wholly evade the constitutional prohibition. This applies with especial’ force to cases where a nomination is the equivalent to an election. In such instances the nominee may well be an honest man between his nomination and election, for he has no motive to be a rogue.</p>
    <p id="b640-7" data-blocks='[["BL_640.6",640,[255,1706,1184,552]]]'>By the words, “ any election law,” the framers of the Constitution and the people who adopted it, evidently meant to include any Act which the legislature might thereafter enact for the purpose of purifying our elections. The Act of 1881 was passed to give effect to the constitutional provision, and it matters little at what stage of the campaign the fraud is committed. It is as much an election law when it strikes at the fraud at the primary election as when it arrests the fraudulent ballot just as it is ready to be dropped into the box at the general election. We would belittle the Constitution and fritter away one of its best and wisest provisions were we to give it the narrow, technical construction claimed for it by this defendant.</p>
