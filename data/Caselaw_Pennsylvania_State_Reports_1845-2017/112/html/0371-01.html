The agreement of the heirs, that each would pay their proportional -part of the judgment, did not of course, bind Hewett; nor after 'the assignment to Wood, did it oblige him, as the as-sign'ee, to collect the residue from those of the heirs in default. Jt is true that he purchased the judgment for the express protection of the gilds, and said that it should not cost them.a dollar, that the property of the boys'should pay it; but this ,was a.- merely voluntary promise without consideration, and lacks the essential requisites of a contract. .</p>

We do not think so. ! What was .said at this time was expressly referable to the particular transaction then in hand; and it is plain, from the language employed, that the agreement, if any existed, was that, notwithstanding the saving clause written .the deed, the rights of the parties to thé Hewett judgment were to remain as before ; that the clause in question, “should '.liot make any difference,” or “affect her property,” or “make her liable for the Hewett debt;” but she “ was to have- it just as the arrangement had been.” If there had been no previous release of .the defendant’s liability, none would, appear to have been then in contemplation of the parties; for it is admitted -that Mr. Wood told Mrs; Griswold at .the time that .he could mot release her,, assigning as a reason he could not release one ptarty without releasing all; there .is not only an absence of proof to establish any'such intention of the. parties, but to give .the transaction this effect would extend, the release beyond the •consideration upon which its. validity necessarily'depends.</p>

Cash was sold by the sheriff, is such, we think, as required a submission to the jury. Mr. Griswold, in the interest of his wife, and Mrs. Wood, in her own interest, attended that sale; it was arranged that one Kirby, who held a judgment against George P. Cash for some $500 or $600, should bid off the property as low as he could, and that Mrs. Wood and Mrs. Griswold would take it off his hands at $1,000. This arrangement was consummated; Kirby bid the property-off at $500. Wood and Griswold gave their note to the sheriff for the amount of Kirby’s bid, and, although Kirby’s judgment was not reached in the sale, they gave Kirby their note for $500, according to the arrangement.
