The statute under which lie is indicted, or that portion of it which covers this crime, is as follows: “If any person shall maliciously and voluntarily burn, or cause to be. burned, or set fire to or cause or attempt to set fire to, with intent to burn any factory, mill or dwelling-house of another, or any other building by means whereof any dwelling-house shall be burned, then, and in every such case,' the person so offending shall be adjudged guilty of felonious arson.”</p>

Not long after that, plastering came down upon the bed where he, his wife and his little child were sleeping, and after that fire began dropping down upon them —sparks of fire. He and wife were both alarmed, and after some little search for their child through this plastering that had fallen, they got out of the house with the child. On coming out of the house they met the two Pilger boys and Mrs. Pilger, who were coming down from up stairs, where the Pilger family were living. An alarm of fire was given, and the neighbors hurried in and found a portion of the building blown (iff, or blown away, so that at the top there was an aperture of eighteen inches to two feet, extending down to the bottom, where it just hung. This was so far pushed over by the explosion, that the chief of the Fire Department, when he arrived, had it taken down for fear it might fall upon the people. Parties who entered into that building found the upper part of the building burning, mainly in the room over the place where Rodetskie was.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b235-11" data-blocks='[["BL_235.9",235,[123,2102,1178,216]]]'>The question is, whether the defendant was guilty of setting that building on fire, or causing it to be set on fire and burned? The case of the Commonwealth depends upon circumstantial evidence — that is, circumstances, which, taken together, as is claimed, lead to a conviction of the guilt of this defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b235-12" data-blocks='[["BL_235.10",235,[124,2318,1176,131]],["BL_236.1",236,[289,416,1178,1327]]]'>I will detail some of the circumstances which they claim point to the guilt of the defendant. When some of the first witnesses, who entered the building and rushed, up to where <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>the fire was, went up there, they found an oil can, part of it burned off, I do not remember the evidence whether it was the top or the spout; they also found a pile of burned nigs— burning rags; the upper part of the building very much cleared of furniture, nothing there, as they say, but an old bed. Another witness, who entered among the first, found the doors leading to that part of the building fastened, so that he could not get in, and there were no keys in the doors. Rodetskie says that when he came out, forced out as he and his wife and child were in their night clothes, the defendant’s wife and his children came down dressed, had their shoes on, Mrs. Pilger with her dress on; that the little daughter of about nine or ten years old, part of the Pilger family, was not there in the house. All this showing, as they claim, evidences of a preparation for such an event as a wilful setting on fire of the house would be. It may be stated right here, in considering this evidence, that the claim is disputed about Mrs. Pilger being dressed when she came down, or the boys being dressed. It is also disputed that this little child was not there. John Christ has testified that the child was brought into his house that morning; that he received the family in the house ; that the children, I believe, did not have on their shoes, you will remember the evidence; that there was not that completeness in their dress, however little they majr have drawn on, to show that they were dressed and prepared for such a thing as a wilful fire. The Commonwealth also claims that the defendant was there in the neighborhood, that he was seen by witnesses who were here on the stand, and making no effort to put out the fire. The Commonwealth also claims that these people, Mrs. Pilger and the boys, apparently made no effort to put out the fire.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b236-5" data-blocks='[["BL_236.5",236,[286,1753,1173,693]],["BL_237.1",237,[154,414,1170,252]]]'>Now, the Commonwealth contends that this was a wilful firing on the part of the defendant as a result of troubles which had previously existed and culminated in regard to the ownership and the title of this property. There had been an action of ejectment between the Buttermans and Pilger, in which, instead of being declared the whole owner of the property, which was in Pilger’s possession, the Buttermans had been declared to be the owners of five sixths, leaving only the title as to one sixth in the defendant. The verdict of the jury in that case was rendered in October, prior to this fire, and the matter having been taken to the Supreme Court, the decision of this court was affirmed some time in March, 1884, on the 19th of March, if I remember the evidence right, and the judgment of the Supreme Court having been remitted to this court on the 27th of March, three days prior to this fire, a writ to deliver possession of five_ sixths of the property to the Buttermans <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>was issued and executed by the sheriff of this county. The Commonwealth brings this to your notice in connection with the other matters, as showing a motive on the part of this defendant. The Buttermans were just on the eve then, according to that record, of the enjoyment of the property to the extent the law had declared to be theirs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.5",237,[153,674,1178,1257]]]'>Now, unfortunately for this defendant, during the troubles that he had with these parties, he had declared an intention, if he lost the case, that he would blow up or light up this property — this house. Now, those threats are not independent evidence of this crime. Pilger might have been indiscreet enough to make these threats and still not be guilty of' this crime. Fortunately for us, we sometimes say more than we intend or carry out, as has been argued to you by counsel for the defendant. But these threats may be taken as a circumstance connected with the other circumstances in the case, to show the guilt of this defendant. Was this fire the carrying out of those threats ? I need hardly dwell upon the fact whether or not these threats are distinctly proved to have been made; there are several witnesses who testify to them, Rodetskie and his Avife, Mrs. Rodetskie’s mother, and, I think, some others, Frank Pilger and Frank Pilger’s wife.- In regard to Frank Pilger, it is claimed that he with others have conspired to state the evidence wrongly so as to bring this defendant Avithin the toils of the law. John Christ also is brought in, who is alleged to have been present at the time when these threats, or some of them, were made, and he says he did not hear them. Still, at the same time, there is considerable evidence independent of these attempts to answer some of the witnesses or to throw doubt upon the validity of their testimony, to show that the defendant did actually make these threats. If you- are convinced, however, that he did not make these threats, that is a circumstance in his favor; if you are convinced that he did make these threats, that is a circumstance against him.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b238-4" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[249,537,1183,606]]]'>Now, gentlemen, do these circumstances, taken together, convince you of the defendant’s guilt? You are not to take one circumstance and consider that alone, but to take the circumstances together. Do they form such a chain about this defendant as brings you to a conviction of his guilt? If they do not, then you cannot convict this defendant of this crime. If, on the other hand, they do, you have still to consider them in the light of the case as presented to you on the part of the defendant. You cannot consider the case presented on the part of the Commonwealth, or the theories adduced from the evidence on the part of the Commonwealth alone. If the Commonwealth’s theories are not consistent with the evidence, if you are not convinced of that consistency from the evidence, then you cannot convict.</p>

He was partially dressed, as he says; that they then called their mother, or she came out, I forget just what the evidence is, and that they all threw on what clothes they could and rushed down stairs. Does this explain to you tins explosion and fire ? Is it a consistent or an inconsistent story in the light of the other facts in the case? If you believe this to be the true explanation of this explosion and fire, then, of course, there can be no conviction of the defendant. The whole was the result of misfortune and accident, and however this defendant may seem to be beclouded with the other facts in the case, still, if this is the truth, if this is the true explanation of the occurrences of that morning, the defendant is not guilt]', and could not'be convicted of this crime.</p>

The several saloon-keepers where. these parties visited that night are brought here and testify to a similar set of circumstances; that these two parties were there that night; that they know that that was the night, because, as some of them say, they heard the next day of the fire at Pilger’s house.

That the fire originated from his own act, or that of some one of his family, is not a íuatter of doubt or dispute, and the only, question in the court below was, whether this was intentional, or, as described by his son, John Piiger, accidental. This young man’s story, though corroborated by his brother and mother, was not credited by the jury, and we are obliged to say, in view of all the circumstances, that its credibility was more thaffidoubtful. As the theory of the defence was not believed by the jury, there was left for that body one of two conclusions, either of which involved the defendant's guilt. One was that the explosion was produced by the direct act of Charles Piiger himself, and the other that he effected, that result through the agency of one or both of his sons. In either case, from the fact that the family seems to have been prepared for the result which occurred, the older members of that family obviously had knowledge of that which was about to happen. Treating, then,John’s story as false, the conclusion is inevitable that that story was concocted by one or more of the family, and- acqui<a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>esced in by the others in order to shield the father from the consequences of his crime. From this, which cannot be regarded other than as a correct view of the case* we are not prepared to say that the court erred in saying to the jury that if the attempted explanation failed it might be regarded as indicative of the defendant’s guilt. Certainly the court in so saying, but gave expression to a'natural, and necessary result. There was but one theory on which the defendant rested for acquittal, and that depended on a story which was either true or false. But if false, who devised it? Let it be one of the sons, yet as the father adopted and used the falsehood he was as culpable as the one who framed it. Here, then, is not, as in Turner <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 5 Norris, 54, a mere failure to prove a given point in the prisoner’s defence, but a corrupt attempt to manufacture a theory by which, if successful, he might escape from the consequences of his guilt, but which, its fraudulent character being exposed and so failing in the result intended, involved him in an additional crime that must necessarily damage his ease with the jury.</p>
