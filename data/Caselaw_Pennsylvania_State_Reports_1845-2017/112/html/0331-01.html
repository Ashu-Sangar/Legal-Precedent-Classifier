And in answer to the defendant’s sixth point (see ninth assignment), the court instructed the jury that “the measure, of damages in such a case is not always the amount of the execution, but the value of the property subject to levy .and sale, when it does not equal in amount the debt.”</p>

But the Act in question is not merely declaratory of the common law; it goes further aiid fixes a penalty for a failure to perform this duty; and the penalty is the amount of the execution and costs; neither more, neither less. It says, as above stated, that if the constable “does not show sufficient cause why the execution should not issue against him, then the justice shall enter judgment against such constable for the amount of the above mentioned execution, together with costs.” This is explicit; it does not say for such actual damages as the party may have sustained,, but for the full amount of the execution and costs. In a common law action punitive damages may be recovered where the circumstances justify it, but there can be no punitive damages under the Act of-1810 ; the debt and costs is the maximum, as it is also the minimum. The constable must be fixed for the whole amount of the execution or discharged altogether; there is no middle ground.</p>
    <p id="b349-7" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[178,1544,1175,778]]]'>:The most satisfactory discussion of this Act will be found in Amey <em>v. </em>Kennedy, 1 Ashmead, 160, where, the late Judge King, who was admittedly one of the ablest jurists of this state, lays down the principle broadly that “ A constable neglecting to make return of his execution to the justice, on or before the return day'thereof, is absolutely fixed for the debt and costs.” The same principle is recognized in a number of the decisions of this court. Parchment <em>v. </em>Aiken, .<a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%2027" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="3 Watts 27">3 Watts, 27</a>.8; Arbingast <em>v. </em>Hook, <a href="/watts/6/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="6 Watts 229" data-case-ids="1846064" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0229-01">6 Watts,' 229</a>; Hall <em>v. </em>Galbraith, 8 Id., 220; Burkholder <em>v. </em>Keller, 2 Penn.

In the’ last case it was said by the court: “ It will be difficult to keep constables within the line of their duty if they are permitted. to. escape from the consequences of their neglect on such easy terms. The path of duty is plain, and if they do not choose to follow it, on them be the consequences. Something is due to the rights of creditors as well as debtors; nay, it is to the advantage of all to respect the rights of all.”</p>

If the goods levied upon are claimed by <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>some one other than the defendant in the execution, and plaintiff refuses or neglects to indemnify him, he can return the writ, and state such fact, or any other fact which prevents his proceeding with it.</p>
    <p id="b350-5" data-blocks='[["BL_350.6",350,[250,596,1176,1034]]]'>Keller <em>v. </em>Clark, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 534" data-case-ids="480124" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0534-01">6 W. &amp; S., 534</a>, and Corson <em>v. </em>Hunt, 14 Penn. St. Rep., 510, were cited as in conflict with the foregoing views. We do not so understand those cases. In the former, the court below laid down the inflexible rule that if the constable fails to return the writ within twenty days, he is in all cases fixed for the debt. This court reversed the court below, and held that “ the mere omission of a constable to return his execution within twenty days, does not fix him for the amount of the debt if he has sufficient cause for the delay.” So we say now. The delay does not fix him for the debt if he can show sufficient cause for such delay, and it was shown in that case. In Corsin <em>v. </em>Hunt the constable had made a false return. For such false return an action would undoubtedly lie under the Act of 1810, and it was stated, in the history of that case, that the writ was so brought. But the declaration contained three counts, the last of which was for a breach of a common law duty, and was not, and could not have been, sustained under the Act of 1810. I am clear that the remarks of Judge Rogers upon the measure of damages were intended for the latter count. There could have been no recovery on the count for not returning the writ, for there was a return, although a false one. This view is the more reasonable, as all of Justice Rogers’ utterances upon this point, upon previous occasions, were the other way.</p>
    <p id="b350-6" data-blocks='[["BL_350.7",350,[248,1628,1168,388]]]'>The constable may excuse his failure to make return when he comes before the justice. But it is his failure to make the <em>return, </em>not his inability to make the money in the execution^ which is the subject of inquiry. Hence it is entirely irrelevant to show that the defendant had no goods upon which to levy. If such be the fact, he can so return. But be the defendant never so impecunious, it does not condone the neglect of the constable in not returning his writ. The plain object of the Act of 1810 was to compel the performance of this duty.</p>
