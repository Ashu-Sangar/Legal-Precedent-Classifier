The plaintiff, who is the prothonotary of this county, contends that the Act is unconstitutional because of the proviso that the provisions of the. Act'“ shall not extend to officers in counties containing over 'one hundred and fifty thousand or less 'than ten thousand inhabitants.”</p>

As the Act has no application to these counties, there can be no question that it is local in its nature: Davis <em>v. </em>Clark, 10 Out., 384. But all local or special legislation is not prohibited by the constitution. Outside of certain prohibited subjects, the Legislature has as plenary power, under the new constitution, to pass special acts, as it enjoyed under the old. The learned counsel for the plaintiff, recognizing this, argues that the Act under consideration is obnoxious to so much of Article 3, section 7, of the new constitution, as provides that “ the General -Assembly shall not pass any local or special law regulating the 'affairs of counties or prescribing the duties and powers of officers in counties.” Although in nowise loth, in the interest of the very courteous gentleman and excellent officer who is the plaintiff in this case, to become a convert to this theory, I find myself wholly unable to' accept it. I fail to see how an Act, whose sole purpose is to ascertain and appoint the fees to be •received by certain officers, in which the county as such, has hot a particle of interest, can be said to be an Act “ regulating the affairs of coh'nties.” By the “ affairs of counties ” I understand such affairs- as concern counties in their governmental •and corporate capacity.' It is true that prothonotaries are county officers, but this does not make the private fees of these officers á county affair, unless, which is not pretended here, the'fees are reduced so low as-to impair the usefulness of these officers.' At first blush, what is said above would seem be in conflict with McCarthy <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 16 W. N. ;C., 497, but the point under discussion was not there raised, <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>nor could it have been successfully, for the Act of Assembly,.pronounced unconstitutional in that case, whilst, it related fees of county officers, directly affected the coüpties -embraced in the Act by providing that said officers should be “:paid for-their services by fixed and specific salaries which shall, be charge upon the treasury of the county to- which each shall, respectively belongso the school district Act declared be unconstitutional in Montgomery <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 10 Nor., 125, acted directíy upon the district.</p>

It imposes this specific business upon the district which it was not chargeable with, before. It does then relate to the public affairs of the district. It seeks to regulate them by designating the manner in which and the persons by whom these affairs shall be conducted.

This is not enough. “ The party who. wishes us to pronounce a law unconstitutional takes upon himself the burden of proving beyond all doubt that it is so”: Erie <em>v. </em>Casey, 2 Casey, 300, per Black, J.

It was to cut this system up, root and branch, with other evils of like nature, that the clause in question was inserted in the constitution. It was a wise provision, and will be sternlj’- enforced. It is our purpose to adhere rigidly to that instrument, that the people may not be deprived of its benefits. It ought to be unnecessary for this court to make this judicial declaration, but it is proper to do so, in view of the amount of legislation which is periodically placed upon the statute book in entire disregard of the fundamental law. Much of this legislation may remain unchallenged for years, only to be overturned when it reaches this court.

It is only necessary to read the title to this Act to see this. It excludes perpetually from its operation all counties haring a population of over one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants. This makes it a local law. If it can exclude Philadelphia and Pittsburg, it may exclude every other county in the state but the one county seeking such special or local legislation.</p>
    <p id="b343-6" data-blocks='[["BL_343.5",343,[156,695,1175,905]]]'>It was held by the learned judge of the court below, however, that an act regulating the fees of the prothonotary or other county officers was not a law “regulating the affairs of counties,” and he defines the “affairs of counties” to be such “as concern counties in their governmental and corporate eapacitjr.” This will not do. It is too narrow a construction of the constitution. That instrument was intended for the benefit of the people, and must receive a liberal construction. “A constitution is not to receive a technical construction, like a common law instrument or statute. It is to be interpreted so as to carry out the great principles of government, not to defeat them:” Com. <em>v. </em>Clark, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 127" data-case-ids="481758" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0127-01">7 W. &amp; S., 127</a>. When it speaks of the affairs of a county, it means such affairs as affect the people of that county. The prothonotary is a county officer; while his fees, when received by him, are his private property, they are paid by the people of the county, not indeed assessed upon all the taxpayers as a salary would be, but upon all citizens who have business with the office or litigation in the courts. As every citizen of .the county may be affected by such an Act, and most of them surely will be, how can we sa.y that it concerns no one but the officer entitled to the fees?</p>
    <p id="b343-7" data-blocks='[["BL_343.6",343,[158,1603,1183,646]]]'>The word “ affairs ” is one of broad signification, and the convention used it understandingly. Mr. Buckalew, who was a prominent member of that body, thus refers to the subject in his very excellent work on the Constitution, at page 72: “In the Pennsylvania provision the word ‘affairs’ is the important one to be examined. It was obviously borrowed from-the constitutions which were, in 1873, of most recent formation, in which it was made to supply the word ‘business,’ found in the earlier constitutions above mentioned. The substitution of a French for a Saxon word — ‘ affairs ’ for ‘ business’ — was probably made in consequence of judicial opinions which had assigned a somewhat restricted effect to the word business, as found in the earlier constitutions, and was intended to give to the prohibition upon local legislation a more, extended application.”</p>

St. Rep., 258, and Scowden’s Appeal, 15 Norris, 422, it was held by this court that an Act of Assembly which authorized the holding of special sessions of the courts of Crawford County away from the county seat, offended against this clause in our own Constitution.</p>

In point of fact, there is no attempt at classification ; it was a mere exclusion of certain counties. In Com. <em>v. </em>Patton, supra, it was said, referring to the Act of April 18th, 1878, to provide for the holding of courts-in certain cities of this Commonwealth: “ Said Act makes no provision for the future, in which respect it differs from the Act of 1874, which, in express terms, provides for .future cities and the expanding growth of those now in existence. That is not Glassification, which merely designates one county in the Commonwealth and contains no provision by which any other county may, by reason of its increase of population in the future come within the class.”</p>
    <p id="b344-6" data-blocks='[["BL_344.6",344,[245,1186,1181,520]]]'>It is further to be observed that, so far as the compensation to county officers is concerned, the constitution has classified the counties of the state. It provides that “.The compensation of county officers shall be regulated by law, and all county officers who are or may be salaried, shall pay all fees which they may be authorized to receive into the treasury of the county or state as may be decided by law. In counties' containing over one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, all county officers shall be paid by salary, and the salary of any such officer and his clerks, heretofore paid by fees, shall not exceed the aggregate amount of fees earned during his term and collected by or for him.”</p>
    <p id="b344-7" data-blocks='[["BL_344.7",344,[243,1707,1180,347]]]'>This provision affects not only the officer who earns the fees, but also the people who pay them. Hence the people who live in counties where the officers are required to be compensated by salaries have still an interest in, and are affected by any legislation upon the question of fees. For the fees are still collected in such counties, notwithstanding they go into the public treasury, and are, in whole or in part, indirectly returned to the officers in the way of salaries.</p>
