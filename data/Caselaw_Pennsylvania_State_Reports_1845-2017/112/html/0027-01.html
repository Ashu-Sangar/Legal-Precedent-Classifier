The lien created under this Act of 1824, it will be observed, takes effect at the date of the assessment, is indefinite in its duration, and can bp discharged only by payment.

The provision for a lien without limit is certainly inconsistent with that for a lien for one year only, for if by the direction of the 1st section of the Act of 1873 the assessment is declared to be a lien for a year only, that necessarily precludes the existence of the lien for any longer period, or for an indefinite time ; statutory provisions so irreconcilable cannot stand together.

Eyre &amp; Co., after their purchase on 7th March, 1871, used, the property in their, business, as iron founders and machinists, until June, 1883, when they made an assignment for creditors. The mortgage of Anspach &amp; Stanton, when it was given, was the only lien on the land, excepting that of a prior mortgage. In November, 1883, judgment was obtained on this mortgage, by <em>seire </em>facias, and upon a <em>levari facias </em>the property was sold for $500 ; this sum, having been paid into court, and an Auditor appointed to make distribution, claims were presented for taxes, assessed and remaining unpaid, as follows: School, 19th June, 1882, $84.83 ; city, 19th June, 1882, $100 ; countv, 7th March, 1883, $35.35 ; citv, 2d April, 1883, $101; school, 15th June, 1883, $40.40. There was at all times, prior to the sale by the assignee for creditors, abundant personal property on the premises, from which these taxes might have been made. The only claim or formal lien which was afterwards entered was for the city taxes of 1882 (assessed on the 19th June of that year), but as it was not entered until the 27th August, 1883, the lien was lost, and the entry was of no avail. The school and city taxes for 1882 are not, therefore, entitled to participate in the fund for distribution.</p>
    <p id="b47-8" data-blocks='[["BL_47.6",47,[159,1416,1173,820]]]'>The taxes for 1883, however, were at the time of the sheriff’s sale still subsisting liens against the property, and as the sale of the premises was upon the mortgage itself, and the proceeds are sufficient to pay and discharge the taxes, not only the lien of the mortgage but the lien of the taxes also, under the provisions of the Act of 1873, are divested, and are entitled to come upon the fund arising from the sale. It is of no consequence, we think, that there had been personal property on the premises, out of which the collector might have levied the taxes. It was, of course, the duty of the collector, if he desired to be released from responsibility for these several assessments, to be diligent in his endeavors, prior to making his return, to collect the taxes from any personal property which he might know, or by reasonable diligence could have known, to be on the premises, but the lien of the assessment cannot be defeated by the neglect and want of diligence of the collector ; what would be the effect of a return, false in this respect, upon the claim filed thereon, in continuance of the lien, is a question not involved in the case.</p>
