This decree appointing Frick administrator had been made on a petition in which George E. Baldwin had joined.

    <p id="b17-9" data-blocks='[["BL_17.11",17,[196,1635,1175,175]]]'>(1.) It does not appear from appellant’s paper book that the affidavit was made and recognizance entered into as required in appeals. On the contrary, if the docket entries are correctly given, these requisites were not complied with.</p>
    <p id="b17-10" data-blocks='[["BL_17.12",17,[194,1809,1176,214]]]'>(2.) It appears from the errors assigned that this appeal is from the refusal of the court below to set aside a former decree, and such refusal is not the subject of review by appeal to this court.
