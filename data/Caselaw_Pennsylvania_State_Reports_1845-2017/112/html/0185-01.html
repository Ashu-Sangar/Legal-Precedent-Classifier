McCormick against the township of Washington. Henry C. McCormick, the plaintiff in this case, brings suit to recover damages which lie alleges he has sustained by reason of the negligence of the officers of the township of Washington, defendant, in not keeping their public highways in proper repair. He claims that on the 20th of September, 1888, at' about one o’clock in the afternoon, as he was travelling upon the highway of Washington township and attempted to cross South creek upon a bridge which is there erected as a. part of this highway, the bridge broke down. That at the time he was traveling with his steam threshing machine,' which consisted of three different vehicles. The first was the engine and boiler on four wheels, the second containing the water .tank, and the third containing the separator — all hitched together. That these vehicles were being transported by means of a traction engine. That a team .of horses (or rather a horse and mule), were hitched in front for the purpose mainly of guiding the machine. The machine was propelled by the traction engine contained in the first vehicle. That when they got upon this bridge-one of the stringers broke’; the team was precipitated <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>into the stream and the engine and tank followed, and the separator remained hanging on the one side : the horse was injured and the machine was injured; That it cost him a considerable sum of money to have this machine repaired, the items of which he testified to. The injury to the horse was stated to you as equal to the sum of $20, making a total of the items of damage of $349.06. He has brought this action to recover the damages which he sustained at that time. Now, that an.accident occurred at that place at that bridge on the 20th of September, 1883, is not in dispute. That fact you will have, no trouble about. The amount of damage which he sustained is not seriously in dispute. I am not sure that there was any contrariety of opinion as to any of the items. So those questions will not be of difficult solution for you. The real point in this case is, however, whether or not the township is liable for this accident. It does not follow because a man is hurt on a public highway that, therefore, the township must pay the damages. That conclusion does not follow such premises. It requires something more than that. As I have said to you the real question is whether or not this township is liable to this plaintiff under the circumstances of this case, and this is a question partly of law and partly of fact. It is the duty of the court to lay down to you the law governing the case, and it will be your duty to apply that law to the facts as you may find them, and in this way you will arrive at a laAVful and just conclusion of the case. It is proper for me to say in the outse't that you are to be controlled by the evidence in this Case as to your finding of facts, and the law which you are to apply in this case is the law which is given you by the court. If you should apply anything else great injustice might be done. If the court makes a mistake either one of the parties will have the right to have such errors corrected, and hence it is important that you should apply the law as the court gives it to you. You are to be controlled then by the law and the evidence in this case, and nothing else. You are not here to distribute money to anybody who may make a claim against the township of Washington. On the other hand, you are not here to excuse the misconduct or the negligence of township officers. You are to be controlled by the law and evidence in this case, and by nothing outside. Now, then, the question of the liability of this defendant to pay damages is really the important question, and the first thing to look at will be what were the duties of the Supervisors of Washington township in respect to this bridge where this accident occurred. By the sixth section of the Act of Assembly on the 13th of June, 1836, their duties are thus set forth:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="A0s" data-blocks='[["BL_200.5",200,[301,2392,1122,44]],["BL_201.1",201,[162,415,1173,260]]]'>Purd. Dig., p. 1278, pl. 43.

    <p class="summary" id="b201-6" data-blocks='[["BL_201.5",201,[162,675,1174,302]]]'>Purd. Dig., p. 1279, pl. 49. It shall be the duty of the Supervisors aforesaid, in making and repairing the public roads, to make and maintain, within their respective townships, sufficient causeways of stone or timber on marshy or swampy grounds, and also to make and maintain sufficient bridges over all small creeks and rivulets and deep gullies, where the same shall be necessary for the ease and safety of travellers.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b201-7" data-blocks='[["BL_201.6",201,[162,978,1180,1470]],["BL_202.1",202,[268,409,1172,164]]]'>Where a bridge becomes necessary to be built in the con-' struction of a highway, it becomes a part of the highway, and is to be kept in repair just as the highway is to be kept in repair. This statute says that the bridges must be “ <em>sufficient </em>for the-easy and safe travelling by the persons desiring to travel the same.” This word “ sufficient,” as used in this Act of Assembly, does not merely mean that there shall be a sufficient number of bridges. It does not merely mean that they shall be of sufficient width.- It means as well that they shall be of sufficient strength. The word “ sufficient,” as used, means that the bridges shall be equal to the end proposed by their erection ; that they shall be adequate to the wants of the public there; that they shall be competent for the purpose for which they are intended. Thus we find that when bridges form a part of the public highway, they must be of sufficient size and strength to accommodate the public in the usual and ordinary modes of travel, so that they may pass and re-pass over the same with ease and safety. The township, though bound by this law to the duty of the maintenance and sufficient repair of its bridges, is not absolutely bound for the soundness of the structure it erects as a part of the highway. The township is not an insurer against all defects, latent as well as patent, upon its highways, but is liable for negligence. Where a defect in a lawful structure is latent — that is hidden, cannot be seen, or is the work of a wrong-doer, for instance, some person cutting the timber — -express notice of it must be brought home to the township officers, or the defect must be so notorious as to be evidence to all passers, then the township will be charged with constructive notice. What is negligence is a question in each different case, and must depend on the peculiar circumstances of each different ease. When a bridge has stood for the time timbers are expected to last, and it may be reasonable to expect that decay has set in, it is negligence to omit proper precautions to ascertain its condition. In such <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>cases — where it has remained a sufficient time — appearances will not excuse the negligence, but it is the duty of the supervisors to call to their assistance those whose skill will enable them to ascertain the state of the structure.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b202-5" data-blocks='[["BL_202.5",202,[262,583,1177,1859]],["BL_203.1",203,[147,397,1189,2037]],["BL_204.1",204,[278,389,1174,77]]]'>These are the duties of supervisors in respect to the bridges. It is claimed by the township defendant that they ought not to be held liable in this case, because the bridge was not defective, or contained at least no such defect as the law holds them liable for. The plaintiff complains that the' bridge was defective, and that it was such a defect as the law holds the township responsible for. That then is one of the points for you to examine. Another point you will have to pass upon is, the defendants say (whether or not the bridge was defective) the plaintiff was not travelling in the usual and ordinary way in which persons travel in that township and its vicinity. That he was travelling by means of an unusual and extraordinary vehicle; and this will also be a question for you to determine ; whether or not he was using the usual and ordinary modes of travel; the modes of travel for which these highways were constructed and these bridges were intended to be used. It will be necessary for you to consider what sort of a vehicle this was. You will also consider its weight; that it consisted of three different parts which were connected together ; that these parts could be used separately ; that at the time the accident occurred the two horses were in front of the first machine and were upon the bridge. Their weight will come into consideration, together with the weight of so much of the machine as was upon the bridge. You will also take into consideration the fact that it was being propelled by steam, by traction. The engine, the front part of which was upon the bridge, was pulling the two vehicles that were behind. They were coming up the incline approach to the bridge on that side. You will also consider that this machine had been used in this township and vicinity for three seasons; that other machines were used in adjoining townships; and you will ascertain how much of this machine was upon the bridge — what weight there was there. Witnesses have testified as to the weight; you have the way-bill upon which the plaintiff paid his freight, and he explains why that shows more than the real weight. You will also consider that there was water in the boiler and in the tank. From the evidence you will determine whether or not this was an unusual vehicle, and determine whether or not the plaintiff was using the bridge in the usual and ordinary way that it was intended to be used. Then you will look at the bridge. Was there or not a defect in that bridge? This bridge it seems was built in June, 1877. The witnesses are called upon the stand who selected the trees in <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>the woods and superintended their being cut down and made into timber, and their being put into this bridge. The witnesses are called who put it in. They testify as to the condition of the timber.. You will observe how long it remained there until swept away. The evidence is that it went off by a flood in July, 1888, that is, about six years and a month after it was erected. The whole bridge was carried down the stream some distance, .the abutments having been washed away. In August, 1883, the abutments were rebuilt and these same timbers replaced as the chords of the bridge. The witnesses are called who put the timbers back and erected the bridge in 1883. One of the • witnesses testifies that he' observed the unsoundness of the stick which broke, but did not communicate his views to the supervisor. Another witness testifies that he' observed it and told the supervisor. The supervisor is called but has no recollection of any such thing being told to him. Numerous other witnesses are called who were there and assisted' in re-building the bridge, and they testify that the stick was tested and was believed to be sound, and no objection was made by any person there as to its unfitness to be put in. You will also consider in this connection that this bridge was used from the time it was erected and until broken, by the persons who travelled back and forth across it, and that about ten days before this accident a heavy threshing machine, propelled by horse-power, was taken across the bridge, which, with the weight of the horses, would amount to about five tons. That a few days before another machine was transported across there, and the witness says, if the whole apparatus was on the bridge, it would weigh from three to five tons. You have before you a block cut from the chord that was broken. That is a piece of evidence which it will be, your duty to consider. In looking at that block you will remember that it is about two years — nearly two years — since it was broken,'and that that block was kept in a wagon shed —probably exposed to the weather — whether or not is not disclosed by the witness. Part of the time it was used as a chopping block. You will observe whether or not it contains dry rot or' discloses doziness, such as is claimed by the plaintiff. From the evidence you will determine whether or not that bridge was of defective construction at the time of the accident, and whether or not it was of such defective construction as the law will hold the defendants responsible for. If they knew it was defective, then of course the township would be liable for their knowledge and failure to remedy it. If they did not know of the defect, then was it such a defect, and was their means of examining it so imperfect, that they should be held responsible for it. If it was not that kind of <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>a defect then the township would not be liable although it broke.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[274,477,1178,994]]]'>Another point conies into this case-: the defendants claim that the plaintiff did not use ordinary care and caution in going over the bridge. That he was travelling with an unusual and extraordinary'vehicle of great weight, and being propelled by such power as increased the danger to bridges; that lie might have gone by another route; that he might have crossed the fording; that he might have hauled pieces over separately, and that they were arranged for that purpose. To this the plaintiff replies that the fordings were not used ; that he had no reason to suppose anything was wrong with the bridge, and that he was told the other route was unsafe. You will remember that the plaintiff is a resident of the township, and was, in 1879 and 1880, a supervisor of the township, and was probably acquainted with all the roads and bridges, acquainted also with the usual mode of travel in that vicinity, and was aware of the purpose for which the bridges were built. All this is proper for you to consider in determining whether or not the plaintiff neglected to do what an ordinarily prudent man would have done under the circumstances. The .points submitted by counsel are so numerous, and go so extensively over the law in' the ease that to avoid a repetition of what I have to say upon it, I think you will better understand the law by my proceeding to answer them at this place.</p>
