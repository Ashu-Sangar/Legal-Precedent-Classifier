    <p class="summary" id="b599-7" data-blocks='[["BL_599.6",599,[121,1201,1181,261]]]'>This case was tried some months ago, upon an indictment for arson; containing two counts.

In the charge of the court to the jury, the distinction between the two offences, as laid down in the two sections, was carefully explained. The jury, taking a very charitable view of the case, acquitted the defendant on the first count and convicted him on the second count, with a recommendation to the mercy of the court. A motion has been made in arrest, and for a new trial, and seven reasons were filed to sustain the same. It is needless to review these reasons. We think them clearly insufficient to require the granting of anew trial, and shall, therefore, dismiss them without any further remark. But a grave objection to the correctness of the verdict has arisen since the reasons for a new trial were filed. It is now discovered that the second count of the indictment, on which the defendant was convicted, is not drawn on the 138th section of the Code, but that it is drawn on the 137 th section, and is an exact repetition of the first count, except that the offence is not set forth as having been done “feloniously.” The effect of this is, that in the first count the offence is charged as a felony, and in the second the same offence is charged as a simple misdemeanor. But this would be in<a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>congruous. The law makes the offence, as described in the indictment, a felony, and yet the indictment, as framed, would give a license to the jury to disregard the law and convict of a mere misdemeanor, which they would have no right to do. It is evident that the second count is entirely superfluous as charging an offence under the 137th section ; nay, it is worse than that, it is vicious, for if it stood alone and defendant were convicted under it, we should be obliged to arrest the judgment, for the reason that the omission to charge the offence as a felony would vitiate it. It is not necessary to cite authority to show that the omission to charge the act as having been done “feloniously” is fatal, and that there could be no conviction of a felony under it. Can there be a conviction for a misdemeanor ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[269,1013,1175,862]]]'>In the written argument furnished us by the counsel for the Commonwealth, it is said that “the first count was framed to come within the 137th section of the Penal Code; 'the second count to convict upon a misdemeanor for the mere <em>attempt </em>to burn a barn that was a parcel or belonged to a dwelling house, &amp;c.” That is, either to convict of a felony under the statute, or to convict of a misdemeanor at common law, because, at the common law, mere attempts to commit felonies rise to no higher grade of offence than misdemeanor. But this cannot be done in Pennsylvania. Where the statute raises the offence from a lower to a higher grade of crime, the misdemeanor becomes merged, the offence becomes felony, and it must be prosecuted as such. Whar. Cr. Law (old edition), page 34, also page 133; Com. <em>v. </em>Gable, 7 S. and R., 423. If both of these counts could stand together, and the defendant were acquitted upon one and convicted upon the other, how should he be sentenced? Certainly not under the 137th section, for he has been acquitted of that offence. Would we be at liberty to disregard the penalties there set down, and impose punishment according to the course of the common law? Clearly not.</p>

Unfortunately it was not. We must take it as we find it, unless it may be so amended as to be considered as drawn under the 138th section. The thought of the Commonwealth’s counsel, as expressed in his written argument, was that “if the court or jury decided that the barn was not a parcel or belonging to a dwelling house, to so amend the second count, either to strike out the words 'parcel or belonging to a dwelling house,’ or insert the word ‘ not ’ before the words ‘ parcel or belonging to <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>a dwelling house,’ which would have been perfectly proper under our law permitting amendments.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b601-6" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[165,505,1167,509]]]'>But in the first place it may be answered that the question of amendment cannot arise here, because none was asked for. The case was tried on the indictment as it stood. But in the next place, no amendment of this character could have been made even if asked for during the trial. This is regulated by the 13th section of the Criminal Procedure Act of March 31st, 1860, and authorizes the court to amend in various particulars named, when <em>“ </em>there shall appear to be any' variance between the statement of such indictment and the evidence offered in proof thereof.” All the evidence produced by the Commonwealth went to prove the offence as described in the indictment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b601-7" data-blocks='[["BL_601.6",601,[165,1023,1168,218]]]'>The Commonwealth took special care to prove that the stable in question was parcel of or belonging to a dwelling house, and there was no evidence to contradict this.

    <p class="summary" id="b601-8" data-blocks='[["BL_601.7",601,[164,1239,1169,345]]]'>We must, therefore, deal with this count as it stands, and the only question that remains is whether we can throw out, as surplusage, so much of it as describes an offence, under the 137th section, so as to change it into an offence under the 138th section. This question must be determined not by anything extraneous — neither by the evidence in the cause, nor by the charge of the court, nor what we may believe the jury intended by their yerdict.</p>

The language of the count accurately describes and sets forth an offence under the 137th section. They are necessary words to the description of the offence. They must, therefore, be regarded as intended for a charge under that section, and cannot be considered as surplusage. The manner in which the offence is charged follows closély the language of the statute, which is a sufficient description of the offence, and we are not, there' fore, at liberty, arbitrarily, to strike out any part of that description in order to make the count conform to a different section of the Code and a different offence. This would be doing violence to the indictment as found, and would not be carrying out the intention of the prosecution in the drawing of the same. It does not appear that there was. any clerical mistake or omission in the drawing of this second count; on the contrary, it seems to have been intentional to draw the second'count in the way it appears. It is obviously defective, and I do not see how it can be cured. This is not such a case as that of Stager <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20W.N.C.%20200" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 W.N.C. 200">13 W. N.

In the present instance we have nothing within the body of the indictment to warrant us in considering any part of the second count as surplusage. The only way seems to be to consider the whole count as surplusage, and to strike it out altogether.</p>
