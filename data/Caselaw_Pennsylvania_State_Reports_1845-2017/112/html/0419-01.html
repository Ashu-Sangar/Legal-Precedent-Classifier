Together they subsequently called at the office of Mills (the payee of the note). Mills had a device of some sort by which drawings were made by tickets. Eckert bought tickets and gave Mills <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>his checks' for $2,600, and then asked the defendant to give his note for $1,500 to enable Eckert to take up his checks, and thus save, himself (Eckhert) from the disgrace which would attend a public exposure of the matter. The defendant declined to do so and went out. Eckert followed him and begged him to agree to something, and offered to give his note to the defendant for $1,500 payable in sixty days if the defendant would give Eckert his (the defendant’s) note for the same amount payable in seventjr days; and Eckert promised to pay his note when due. The defendant agreed to this and gave the note, and Mills took the note to Chicago, and on August 14th, 1883, sold it to the plaintiff for value without notice.</p>
