    "head_matter": "Walker, Assignee\u2019s Appeal.\n1. A court of equity will not restrain, by injunction, a creditor from levying on land in which he avers that his debtor has an interest.\n2. A sale of the wife\u2019s land by the husband\u2019s creditor may be enjoined, where the title of the wife is clear, inasmuch as a sale would be in violation of a clear and express statutory prohibition.\n3. Reeser v. Johnson, 26 P. F. S., 313, followed.\nApril 21st, 1886.\nBefore Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ.\nAppeal from the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill county, sitting in Equity: Of January Term, 1886, No. 166.\nThis was an appeal by Lewis B. Walker, assignee of Thomas H. Walker, trustee of Thomas H. Schollenberger, from a decree of said court dissolving a preliminary injunction and sustaining a demurrer, and dismissing a bill in equity wherein Lewis B. Walker, assignee of Thomas H. Walker, trustee of Thomas H. Schollenberger, was plaintiff, and Adolph W. Schalck, Elizabeth Heilner and J. Monroe Boyer, sheriff of Schuylkill County, were defendants.\nThe bill alleged substantially:\n1st. That the plaintiff holds title to certain lands which are advertised to be sold as the property of L. F. Whitney, by the sheriff of Schuylkill County, on July 3d, 1885, at the suit of Elizabeth Heilner, which are there described by metes and bounds.\n2d. That said real estate had been held in trust by L. F. Whitney, deceased, for Thomas H. Sehollenberger.\n8d. Thomas H. Sehollenberger assigned his interest to Thomas H. Walker.\n4th. That Thomas H. Walker assigned to Lewis B. Walker, party hereto.\n5th. That L. F. Whitney devised, inter alia, the legal title to this property to Hannah Whitney, his wife.\n6th. That Hannah Whitney conveyed the legal title to Lewis B. Walker in pursuance of a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County, on April 6th, 1885.\n7th. That Elizabeth Heilner obtained a judgment against L. F. Whitney\u2019s estate, and levied upon and is about to sell the aforesaid real estate. That A. W. Schalck, Esq., is acting as her attorney, and is aware of the decree of court referred to in section 6th.\n8th. That L. F. Whitney left other real estate liable to be sold.\n9th. That Hannah Whitney holds real estate acquired from L. F. Whitney for $1.\n10th. That these conveyances were made to Hannah Whitney while L. F. Whitney was indebted to Elizabeth Heilner, and may be sold to pay this judgment.\n11th. That a sheriff\u2019s sale will cast a cloud upon the title, and render the property unsalable.\n12th. That there is no adequate remedy at law.\nThe prayer for relief asks that the defendants be restrained from clouding the title by a sheriff\u2019s sale.\nOn filing this bill the court, June 29th, 1885, granted a preliminary-injunction as prayed for.\nOn the hearing of the motion to continue the preliminary injunction, the following facts appeared :\nCharles Baber and wife, by deed dated December 1st, 1878, conveyed to Lawrence F. Whitney the undivided seventeen twenty-fourths (|-|) of certain lands near Pottsville, containing 45 acres. Consideration, $6,302.90.\nBy another deed, of same date, George B. Strauch conveyed the other seven twenty-fourths (t\u00ed) of the same lands to said Whitney. Consideration, $2,595.30.\nIsaac Lea et al., by deed of December 20th, 1873, eonvejmd the seventeen twenty-fourths (t\u00ed) interest in an adjoining tract, containing 34 acres and 40 perches, to said Whitney. Consideration, $3,396.45.\nBy another deed, of same date, George B. Strauch conveyed the other seven twenty-fourths (^) in said lands to Whitney. Consideration, $1,398.53.\nThese deeds were duly executed and acknowledged at or about the time of their dates, and were duly recorded on the 22d day of January, 1875.\nThe deeds were in fee simple, absolute to Lawrence F. Whitney, his heirs and assigns.\nThe lands were assessed in Whitney\u2019s name,-and so continued until after his death, and he paid the taxes thereon.\nWhitney took the exclusive possession and management of the land, put up improvements, laid out streets, divided the land into town lots, sold off lots and received the purchase money, and executed conveyances therefor, taking all securities for balances due in his own name.\n\u2022 Whitney, at that time, was a prominent broker and banker in Pottsvi\u00edle, a man of reputed wealth, and the title to this' land in him went far to increase and strengthen his credit in the community, so that when he died he left unsecured debts amounting to $25,000 (among them Mrs. Elizabeth Heilner in $5,000), besides a number of secured creditors. His estate proved utterly insolvent.\nWhitney\u2019s alleged declaration of trust is dated April 1st, 1874 (over three months after the execution of said deeds), and was not acknowledged till February 27th, 1875 (a v\u00e9ar later.) The assignment from Schollenberger to Judge Walker is dated May 1st, 1877, two years later still. Neither were recorded until November 21st, 1878, two months and eleven davs after Whitney\u2019s death, which occurred September 10th, 1878.\nThis was the first notice to the world of any trust, or of any interest in Schollenberger or Walker in the premises.\nIn 1881, Lewis B. Walker, Esq., as assignee of Judge Walker, Schollenberger\u2019s first trustee, filed his petition in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Schuylkill County, praying for an order on Mrs. Whitney, the executrix and sole devisee of Lawrence F. Whitney, to convey this land to him. This application was resisted by Mrs. Whitney, and also by the unsecured creditors of Whitney\u2019s estate, who intervened, and the petition was finally dismissed by the Orphans\u2019 Court for want of jurisdiction. On appeal from that decision to the Supreme Court (No. 336, January Term, 1884), the ruling of the court below was affirmed.\nCounsel for creditors attempted to resist the making of the decree sought for by Mr. Walker,, but this interference was strenuously objected to by Schollenberger and Walker' in the court below; and in the Supreme Court, on the hearing Walker\u2019s appeal, the counsel for the creditors asked to be heard, but his paper book and argument were suppressed by the court at the instance of Mr. Walker and his counsel. So, when Mr. Walker filed his bill in equity in the court below (No. 1, January Term, 1884), against Hannah Whitney, as sole executrix, devisee and legatee of L. F. Whitney, deceased, he did not include the creditors of Whitney\u2019s estate, or make them parties, or take any notice of them.\nIn the meantime suit was brought by Mrs. Heilner against Whitney\u2019s estate (No. 347, September Term, 1882), and judgment was duly obtained, October 14th, 1884, for $6,8\u00cd6.66. Execution was issued November 8th, 1884, and the land condemned, and subsequently advertised to be sold by the sheriff.\nThe preliminary injunction was dissolved.\nThe defendants then filed a demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s bill, which on hearing was sustained and the plaintiff\u2019s bill dismissed by Pershing, P. J.\nThe plaintiff thereupon took this appeal, assigning for error the decree of the court dissolving the preliminary injunction, and also the decree of the court sustaining the demurrer and dismissing his bill.\nL. B. Walker (Thomas H. Walker and John W. Ryon with him), for appellant.\n1. It cannot be doubted that under certain circumstances the power of a court of equity to restrain an execution creditor from proceeding to sell may be properly invoked ; but as was said in Winch\u2019s Appeal, 11 P. F. S., 244, it is only where the creditor- is clearly and undeniabty proceeding, against right and justice, to abuse the process of the law to the injury of another, that equity intervenes to stay his hand: Taylor\u2019s Appeal, 12 Nor., 23.\n2. The court erred in dismissing the bill under the pleadings.\nThe Bill avers the ownership to be in Schollenberger\u2019s assignee, by decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County directing a deed for the land to be made by Mrs. Whitney to L. B. Walker, assignee, and that such deed was made. And the reply of the respondents does not deny this ownership by plea, answer or demurrer, and therefore under the pleading it is such a ease where the creditor is clearly and undeniably proceeding against right and justice to abuse the process of the law to an injury of another: Hunters\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wr., 194; Lyon\u2019s Appeal, 11 P. F. S., 15; Winch\u2019s Appeal, 11 Id., 244; Taylor\u2019s Appeal, 8 W. N. C., 192; 12 Nor., 21.\n3. But this case differs from all others in the books in this respect: that the same controversy and claim has been already adjudicated upon and- settled by a court of competent jurisdiction, and Mrs. Heilner was privy to the decree.\nIf Mrs. Heilner is a stranger she is not affected by the decree, but if she is a privy she is bound by it, for \u201c all. persons who are represented by the parties and claim under them, or in privity with them, are equally concluded by the same proceeding\u201d: 1 Greenleaf's Evidence, \u00a7 523; Peterson v. Lothrop, 10 Casey, 223; Giltinan v. Strong, 14 P. F. S., 242; Otterson v. Middleton, 6 Out., 78; Strayer v. Johnson, 43 Leg. Int., 67.\nIs Mrs. Heilner a privy to the decree against Whitney\u2019s estate ? She is a creditor who obtained a judgment against Whitney\u2019s estate after his death. She could only be successful in an action of ejectment through Whitney\u2019s title. Her claim is not adverse to Whitney\u2019s title, but under that title. Her claim has already been adjudicated upon, for Mrs. Whitney as executrix of the decedent is regarded as a trustee for creditors: Hess\u2019s Estate, 19 P. F. S., 272; and Mrs. Whitney\u2019s appearance in her representative character is the appearance of all Whitney\u2019s creditors: Story\u2019s Eq. Plead., \u00a7\u00a7 140, 141, 142, 150, 226; Newland v. Campion, 1 Vesey, Sr., 105; Peacock v. Monk, 1 Id., 127.\nA. W. Schalck, for appellees, was not heard."
