The UM/UIM coverage was later modified by a single-page form prepared by the insurer and signed by the insured. A member of the insured’s family was injured in a car accident, and the insurer provided $100,000 in coverage after stacking the $50,000 UM/UIM coverage. The insured contended the amount of coverage should be $500,000, the same as the bodily injury coverage, because the insurer’s UM/UIM coverage election form did not conform with § 1731.</p>

      <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>In <em>Blood, </em>the insured applied for $500,000 in bodily injury coverage and $35,000 in UM/UIM coverage. The insured later lowered the bodily injury coverage to $300,000, but did not select a different amount of UM/UIM coverage. After an accident, the insured requested payment, and the insurer offered $105,000, representing the $35,000 UM/UIM coverage stacked for three vehicles. The insured claimed $900,000 was due — the amount of bodily injury coverage, $300,000, stacked for three vehicles. The insured alleged the change in bodily injury coverage was akin to a new application for insurance, and, since no UM/UIM coverage was selected and a UM/UIM reduction form was not provided, the UM/UIM coverage should have defaulted back to the bodily injury limits pursuant to § 1734. Finding § 1734 to be plain and unambiguous, we held the insured’s initial application indicating reduced UM/ UIM coverage satisfied § 1734’s writing requirement and remained effective after a reduction in bodily injury coverage.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[262,1240,1152,788]]]'>Consistent with both <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Blood, </em>we reiterate the language of § 1734 is plain and unambiguous. Section 1734 states, “A named insured may request in writing the issuance of coverages under section 1731 (relating to availability, scope, and amount of coverage) in amounts equal to or less than the limits of liability for bodily injury.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1734. Despite the legislature’s detailed requirements for rejecting UM/ UIM coverage in 75 Pa.C.S. § 1731, there are no such requirements in § 1734. Indeed, as we held in <em>Lewis, </em>a § 1734 written request must include “not only the signature of the insured, but also, an express designation of the amount of coverage requested.... ” <em>Lewis, </em>at 153. Clearly, the most effective manner in which to “expressly designate” the amount of coverage requested is by electing a specific dollar amount on an insurance application.</p>

An insurance company is only required to <em>offer </em>UM/UIM coverage in an amount equal to the insured’s bodily injury coverage, which an insured is free to either reject or accept. If the insured desires the coverage, he must then select which level <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>of coverage he desires. If the insured wants UM/UIM coverage in an amount equal to his bodily injury coverage, he can select that option and pay the corresponding premium. If, as in the present case, the insured did not desire UM/UIM coverage identical to bodily injury coverage, he could select a lesser amount and pay a reduced premium.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It is difficult to fathom that an insurance applicant who willingly selects reduced UM/UIM coverage would somehow rescind that selection if merely informed the insurance company had to offer coverage in the same amount as bodily injury coverage. It is not as if the insurance company is hiding free, additional coverage; the cost of premiums could increase significantly, which, presumably, is what the applicant was hoping to avoid by initially requesting the reduced coverage.</p>
    <p id="b439-4" data-blocks='[["BL_439.4",439,[142,1114,1152,690]]]'>Accordingly, we hold the insurance application in question here satisfies § 1734’s writing requirement as it clearly indicated appellants’ desire for reduced UM/UIM coverage, and was signed by the insured. There may be a more detailed way of satisfying the “writing” requirement, but it is unnecessary given the simple language of § 1734 and the manner in which insurance coverage amounts are selected. Though it is laudable for insurance companies to provide additional information regarding UM/UIM insurance beyond what is found in the application, we see no purpose in requiring a separate statement when it is clear from the coverage selected that the insured intended reduced UM/UIM coverage. The decision of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>

Like my colleagues in the Majority, I encourage that continued practice. Such documents detail the requirements of the MVFRL regarding UM/UIM coverage, permit the insured to indicate his or her choice of UM/UIM limits lower than the chosen bodily injury liability limits, and finally, require a signature in close proximity to these choices. <em>See Lewis, </em><a href="/pa/568/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="793 A.2d 143" data-case-ids="163638,9446790" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0105-01,/a2d/793/0143-01">793 A.2d 143</a>; <em>Larrimore, </em><a href="/a2d/987/0732-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="987 A.2d 732" data-case-ids="7292497" data-case-paths="/a2d/987/0732-01">987 A.2d 732</a>; <em>O’Mara, </em><a href="/a2d/907/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="907 A.2d 589" data-case-ids="8933192" data-case-paths="/a2d/907/0589-01">907 A.2d 589</a>; <em>Emig, </em><a href="/pa-super/444/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="664 A.2d 559" data-case-ids="724019,7868053" data-case-paths="/pa-super/444/0524-01,/a2d/664/0559-01">664 A.2d 559</a>; <em>Hughes, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/438/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="438 F.

I agree that the documents, if completed, in all of these cases were sufficient to meet the requirements of Section 1734. I differ from the Majority, however, because I would hold that a document like the application in the case at bar, containing nothing more that the amounts of coverage on page one and the insured’s <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>signature at the policy’s end on page two, does not meet the requirements of a written request for reduction in coverage.</p>
