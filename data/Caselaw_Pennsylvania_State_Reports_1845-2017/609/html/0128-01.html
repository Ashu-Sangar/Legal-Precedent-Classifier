The new sentencing proceeding and its result are the cause of the defendant’s continuing restraint; and that proceeding is sufficiently distinct from the initial sentencing proceeding that collateral review of issues specific to the resentencing is consistent with the plain intent and purpose of the PCRA. But, the calculus is entirely different when the defendant seeks to invoke the new sentencing judgment as a basis to pursue, as of right, issues that do not arise from the resentencing proceeding. And, as explained below, the nature of federal <em>habeas </em>review, and the limited role played by the lower federal courts in “reviewing” final state criminal judgments, corroborates that a limited grant of federal <em>habeas </em>sentencing relief does not give rise to a “right” to full-blown serial PCRA review of a trial whose result (conviction) has long been final.</p>

Thus, in 1996, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”), which included a new and deferential federal <em>habeas </em>standard of review.

      <em>Chambers, </em>however, is distinguishable from the instant case for several reasons. First, the Commonwealth in <em>Chambers </em>did not challenge the propriety of Chambers raising guilt phase claims and this Court did not raise such an inquiry <em>sua sponte; </em>in this case, the Commonwealth does recognize and pursue the jurisdictional issue. Second, the collateral proceedings following the new penalty phase in <em>Chambers </em>were state-court proceedings. Finally, Chambers’ PCRA petition was his first petition for collateral relief and not a serial petition following federal <em>habeas </em>review. Accordingly, we hold that the PCRA court did not have jurisdiction over Lesko’s claims related to guilt-phase errors and we reverse that portion of the PCRA court’s order.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">13</a>

The court based this conclusion on the fact that at the PCRA hearing, both trial counsel and counsel for Travaglia testified that they had never seen the police report. Both counsel opined that the prior statement contained within the Steffee report provided important impeachment evidence, calling into question Montgomery’s implication that Lesko evidenced his intent to kill the officer when he said, “I wanted to.” Additionally, the PCRA court noted that the Commonwealth did not deny that it did not provide the report to the defense. The PCRA court also noted that the Commonwealth’s <em>Brady </em>obligation extended to exculpatory evidence contained in the files of the police agencies of the same government bringing the prosecution, citing to <em>Kyles v. </em>Whitley, <a href="/us/514/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="514 U.S. 419" data-case-ids="1339057" data-case-paths="/us/514/0419-01">514 U.S. 419</a>, 438, <a href="/us/514/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="514 U.S. 419" data-case-ids="1339057" data-case-paths="/us/514/0419-01">115 S.Ct. 1555</a>, <a href="/us/514/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="514 U.S. 419" data-case-ids="1339057" data-case-paths="/us/514/0419-01">131 L.Ed.2d 490</a> (1995) and <em>Commonwealth v.

The PCRA court indicated that these two sources of impeachment would have called into question the testimony of Rutherford and Montgomery, who provided the basis for the jury to find that Lesko “intended” to kill Officer Miller. Additionally the PCRA court concluded that their testimony was not “inconsequential as it went directly to the most essential, and the only contested, element of the crime of murder of the first degree — intent.” <em>Id. </em>at 44-45. The court went on to suggest that it was the cumulative prejudice from the Commonwealth’s failure to reveal multiple pieces of exculpatory evidence, combined with counsel’s failure to interview witnesses and gather relevant impeachment evidence, which undermined the fairness of the proceedings. For these reasons, the court concluded that Lesko was entitled to a “new guilt-stage trial and a new sentencing hearing.”</p>

Brief of Appellant Commonwealth at 27. The Commonwealth points out that there was other very damning evidence of Lesko’s participation in the crimes, which overwhelmingly demonstrated Lesko’s specific intent to kill. The Commonwealth contends that Lesko’s own words “hit him again,” as related by Rutherford at trial, speak most loudly “of Lesko’s full and active participation in the crime.” <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>

The Commonwealth notes that Rutherford had given an incriminating statement prior to being granted a furlough, and even if the furloughs could be offered as proof of a <em>quid pro quo </em>for Rutherford’s trial testimony, the effect of impeaching Rutherford would have made little impact in light of his testimony as an eyewitness and co-conspirator in the killing of Nicholls. The Commonwealth further maintains that it would not have been in Lesko’s self-interest to impeach Rutherford since Rutherford’s testimony “provided critical evidence concerning Travaglia’s drug abuse which would have inured to the benefit of Lesko as well,” <em>id. </em>at 38, presumably by offering the prospect of lessening Lesko’s culpability as an accomplice.</p>

Rather, the PCRA court determined that it was the cumulative prejudice from the Commonwealth’s failure to produce relevant impeachment evidence, combined -with the prejudice arising from counsel’s failure to interview witnesses and gather relevant impeachment information, which resulted in a reasonable probability that “the outcome of the proceedings — that the jury found the Petitioner to have the requisite intent — would have been different, but for these errors.” PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 46.</p>

At the resentencing, the testimony was offered merely as background to establish the circumstances of the crime giving rise to the jury’s penalty phase duty. This background was not used to prove the existence of any aggravating circumstances, but was merely used to put the case in context for the jury.

On further examination by the PCRA court, Dr. Crown opined that he would have expected Dr. Levit to have responded to the red flags and suggested neuropsychological testing as the “prudent thing to do.” In Dr. Crown’s view, such red flags included Lesko’s unusual gait, exhibiting some form of psycho-motor difficulty at an early age; Lesko’s experience in uninhabitable and deplorable housing conditions; the general and continuous neglect of Lesko’s and his siblings’ health; and the fact that he was set on fire by boys in the neighborhood, which resulted in a one-month stay in the hospital. Dr. Crown explained that these childhood circumstances were significant because the combination of “general neglect” and “a young child under stress, we know ... produces difficulties at critical stages in brain development.” N.T., 3/22/01, at 403, 404, 407, and 412, 448-49.</p>

Contrary to the PCRA court’s legal findings, and mindful of the deference due to counsel, we believe that the record shows that trial counsel undertook a reasonable investigation, presenting an extensive psychological and social history in support of specific statutory mitigators, which made “the adversarial testing process work in [this] particular case;” in short, counsel “chose a particular course that had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interests.” <em>Strickland, supra; Puksar, supra.</em>

After Detective Amity read Lesko’s statement into the record, the prosecutor asked the detective what Lesko’s “demeanor” was at the time of this interview. Detective Amity responded, “I couldn’t see where he had any remorse over what he did.” N.T., 2/10/1995, at 62. Trial counsel objected, and the trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury “to disregard the statement.” <em>Id. </em>at 62-63.

This is yet another claim where Lesko takes an issue actually litigated at resentencing and on appeal and claims that prior counsel was incompetent for failing to pose the issue properly. The underlying complaint here, as before, focuses on the Commonwealth’s reliance on the murders of Peter Levato and Marlene Sue Newcomer to establish the aggravating circumstances enumerated in both Section 9711(d)(9) (significant history of prior felony convictions) and Section 9711(d)(10) (defendant was convicted of another federal or state offense for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable) of the capital sentencing statute. Lesko acknowledges that trial counsel raised the same complaint at resentencing and on direct appeal, but he asserts that he was ineffective to the extent his argument failed to incorporate a constitutional component. The constitutional angle that Lesko now asserts is that the Eighth Amendment supposedly “does not permit” the jury to consider the same evidence multiple times in the weighing process. As support for his claim concerning what <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>the Eighth Amendment allegedly prohibits categorically, Lesko cites to no binding authority, but instead cites to a federal capital case arising from Oklahoma the year after his resentencing proceeding, <em>United States v.

The court first explained that in Part 1 of the.verdict slip the jury was to enumerate the aggravating circumstances that the jurors had found that the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the mitigating circumstances as found by any one of them by a preponderance of the evidence. Then, when explaining Part 2 of the verdict slip (relating to recording the jury’s decision to impose a sentence of death), the trial court reiterated that the jury must unanimously agree that there was one or more aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances or one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances “before [it] could sentence the defendant to death.” <em>Id. </em>at 30 (emphasis added).

We have also rejected the alternative argument that Lesko makes regarding whether admitting evidence to prove the significant history aggravator automatically injects future dangerousness into the sentencing proceedings. Even if we were inclined to revisit those decisions, the fact would remain that counsel’s stewardship, in failing to ask for a <em>Simmons </em>charge (the year after the <em>Simmons </em>plurality decision was announced), cannot reasonably be questioned premised upon that changed view of the governing law. Accordingly, as Lesko’s future dangerousness was not placed in issue by the mere fact that the significant history aggravator was argued and proved by the Commonwealth and as he does not point to any other evidence that injected future dangerousness into the proceedings, the PCRA court correctly concluded that counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to request a <em>Simmons </em>charge.</p>

First, Lesko points to language in the trial court’s instruction which directed the jury to consider whether the aggravating or mitigating circumstances made the first-degree murder of Officer Miller “more terrible” or “less terrible.” According to Lesko, the federal constitution micromanages what courts can say on this score as well. Thus, Lesko argues that such instructions unconstitutionally required the jury to find a nexus between the mitigating circumstances and the crime committed, when the U.S. Constitution requires the jury <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>to consider any evidence that warrants a sentence less than death. Lesko does not address the fact that counsel failed to object to the charge at trial; nor does he argue in his brief that trial counsel was ineffective, under the state of the law extant in 1995, in connection with this claim. Like the claim related to the trial court’s failure to permit him to introduce evidence of his co-defendant’s sentence, although Lesko raised this issue in terms of trial counsel ineffectiveness in his PCRA petition, he has failed to present this claim in terms of counsel’s ineffectiveness in his brief before this Court.

At the time of the murder, Lesko was 21. The trial court instructed the jury that Lesko’s age could be considered as a mitigating circumstance, <em>see </em>N.T., 2/17/95, at 26. The trial court, however, refused Lesko’s request to instruct the jury that in considering his age, the jury should consider his psychological and emotional age and level of maturity.

But, instructions are designed to guide the jury’s consideration of relevant evidence, not to reaffirm or approve of either party’s slant on that evidence. Consistently with the death penalty statute, the jury here was instructed to consider Lesko’s age at the time of the crime as potential mitigation. Lesko has not shown any basis in law for an entitlement to a more specific instruction that in considering his age (the relevant factor), the jury was obliged to specifically consider his theory concerning his supposed “emotional or psychological” age.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_32" id="ref_footnote_1_32">31</a> Furthermore, as noted by the PCRA court, Lesko’s supposed “emotional or psychological” age may well have been a circumstance that was considered and accepted by the jury when assessing Lesko’s background and in finding that he acted under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.

Furthermore, according to Lesko, such an instruction negated and created an impermissible barrier to the role of sympathy as a mechanism by which to give effect to the actual mitigating evidence presented.

Rather, the appellant has a duty to frame what is needed. Thus, Rule 1911(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that “[t]he appellant shall request any transcript required under this chapter in the manner and make any necessary payment or deposit therefor in the amount and within the time prescribed by Rules 5000.1 et seq. of the Pennsylvania Rules of Judicial Administration (court reporters).” Of course, if a party is indigent, and is entitled to taxpayer-provided transcripts or portions of the record, he will not be assessed costs. But, that does not absolve the appellant and his lawyer of his obligation to identify and order that which he deems necessary to prosecute his appeal. The plain terms of the Rules contemplate that the parties, who are in the best position to know what they actually need for appeal, are responsible to take affirmative actions to secure transcripts and other parts of the record. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Lesko cannot fault the trial court for his own failures. Instead, it is only when an appellant can show that a request was made and erroneously denied, which is not the case herein, that such a claim would have merit. <em>See Commonwealth v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/590/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="309" data-cite="590 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="3852085" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0202-01">590 Pa. 202</a>, <a href="/pa/590/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="310" data-cite="912 A.2d 268" data-case-ids="3852085,8440502" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0202-01,/a2d/912/0268-01">912 A.2d 268</a>, 284-85 (2006).

And, thus, on a direct appeal, if the facts warranted the assertion, an argument could be forwarded that a portion of the record was missing, through no fault of the appellant, which impeded statutory review; and the appellant could request some court action to secure that which was missing, or to direct creation of an equivalent picture. But, this is not the type of situation Lesko poses. Instead, Lesko’s argument turns the shield of statutory review into a sword. He argues that the absence of <em>voir dire </em>notes should be deemed to have automatically impeded this Court’s statutorily mandated review for passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor, and thereby created a collateral right to automatic relief — even if he never took measures to secure the notes, and never objected to their absence on direct appeal.

King, </em><a href="/pa/554/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="313" data-cite="554 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="765961" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0331-01">554 Pa. 331</a>, <a href="/a2d/721/0763-01" class="citation" data-index="314" data-cite="721 A.2d 763" data-case-ids="11794952,11795060,765961,765969" data-case-paths="/a2d/721/0763-01,/a2d/721/0763-02,/pa/554/0331-01,/pa/554/0330-01">721 A.2d 763</a>, 777 (1998) (potentially improper statements made during <em>voir dire </em>are of “less direct relevance to the jury’s ultimate sentencing decision.”). Instead, like most instances where a portion of the transcript was missing, “to be entitled to relief due to the incompleteness of the trial record the defendant must make some potentially meritorious challenge which cannot be adequately reviewed due to the deficiency in the transcript.” <em>Commonwealth v. Marinelli, </em><a href="/pa/589/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="315" data-cite="589 Pa. 682" data-case-ids="2574600" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0682-01">589 Pa. 682</a>, <a href="/pa/589/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="316" data-cite="910 A.2d 672" data-case-ids="2574600,8448803" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0682-01,/a2d/910/0672-01">910 A.2d 672</a>, 688 (2006). And, in this case, as we have noted that any fault for the “missing” transcripts fell squarely at counsel’s feet, any such meritorious claim has to be raised as a claim of counsel’s ineffectiveness, which requires Lesko to identify and develop the specific, defaulted <em>voir </em>dire-related issue he believes would have won the day on direct appeal.</p>
    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.4",281,[134,1851,1152,526]],["BL_282.1",282,[264,321,1155,1421]]]'>Similarly meritless is Lesko’s argument that this Court should review his claim under the “presumed prejudice” standard announced by the High Court in <em>Cronic. </em>This Court has rejected an identical claim on a prior occasion. <em>See Jones, </em><a href="/pa/590/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="317" data-cite="912 A.2d 268" data-case-ids="3852085,8440502" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0202-01,/a2d/912/0268-01">912 A.2d at 285</a>. Briefly, <em>Cronic </em>stands for the proposition that a court will presume prejudice under certain limited circumstances if the defendant is denied counsel totally or at a critical stage of the proceedings. If Lesko could establish that the circumstances on direct appeal amounted to a total denial of counsel, warranting a presumption of prejudice, he would be <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>entitled to <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

But counsel’s failure to request and secure the transcripts from <em>voir dire </em>did not amount to a constructive denial of counsel on appeal. This Court has held that the filing of an appellate brief, deficient in some aspect or another, which operates to default some claims, does not constitute a complete failure to function as a client’s advocate so as to warrant a presumption of prejudice under <em>Cronic. See Commonwealth v. Reed, </em><a href="/pa/601/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="322" data-cite="601 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="4194847" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0257-01">601 Pa. 257</a>, <a href="/pa/601/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="323" data-cite="971 A.2d 1216" data-case-ids="4194847,7299224" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0257-01,/a2d/971/1216-01">971 A.2d 1216</a>, 1226 (2009). Yet, this is precisely the type of argument Lesko attempts to forward in this collateral appeal. This is not an instance where counsel failed to file a direct appeal at all, or filed an appeal that was doomed because all claims were later defaulted by counsel’s lapse. Instead, counsel filed a direct appeal in which he forwarded numerous claims respecting the new sentence of death, which were decided on their merits. Whether counsel perceived no claims relating to <em>voir dire, </em>elected not to pursue such claims as he perceived, or simply failed to consider looking to <em>voir dire </em>for claims, the fact remains that Lesko had a fully counseled appeal. Whatever issue-specific complaints Lesko has respecting counsel’s appellate performance sound in <em>Strickland, </em>not <em>Cronic.</em>

In a similar vein, Lesko asserts that the trial court failed to inform the first two empaneled jurors that mitigating circumstances could encompass any aspect of Lesko’s background or character, even those not directly connected to the circumstances of the crime.</p>

Moreover, contrary to Lesko’s apparent view that his take on federal constitutional law provides a basis for micromanaging all utterances in a capital trial, nothing in the law obligated trial counsel, engaged in the process of jury selection, to parse the court’s words and offer argumentative alternatives. The court’s engagement with the jury in <em>voir dire </em>is not of the same magnitude as its role and interaction in describing to the selected jurors their actual obligations at the point where they retire to deliberate on the penalty verdict.

Thus, the PCRA court concluded that there was no merit to Lesko’s contention.

The record amply supports the PCRA court’s finding that the inquiries by the two jurors were sufficiently distinct, in the circumstances, that there was no cognizable disparate treatment that counsel was constitutionally obliged to forward as part of his appellate claim. Additionally, as the PCRA court noted, it seems self-evident that prospective jurors will have a divergent range of knowledge and backgrounds and the linchpin in ruling upon challenges for cause must be whether the juror can be “fair and impartial.” <em>See Marshall, <a href="/pa/534/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="342" data-cite="534 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1839680" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0488-01">supra.</a> </em>In this vein, the second juror indicated that her knowledge of the appeals process would not have any bearing on her decision.

We have deemed two claims to be arguably meritorious and disposed of them solely on grounds of lack of prejudice — the <em>Brady </em>claims and the ineffectiveness claim related to remorse, where we assumed arguable merit. The notion of “cumulating” prejudice does not easily flow from our disposition of such disparate claims.

Lark, </em><a href="/pa/560/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="373" data-cite="560 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="95775" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0487-01">560 Pa. 487</a>, 493, <a href="/a2d/746/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="374" data-cite="746 A.2d 585" data-case-ids="11471640,95775" data-case-paths="/a2d/746/0585-01,/pa/560/0487-01">746 A.2d 585</a>, 588 (2000), wherein we held that, “when an appellant’s PCRA appeal is pending before a court, a subsequent PCRA petition cannot be filed until the resolution of review of the pending PCRA petition by the highest state court in which review is sought, or upon the expiration of the time for seeking such review.” <em>Lark </em>is distinguishable because, in that case, the appellant had a pending PCRA petition, not a direct appeal from a resentencing proceeding, which was deemed to require a delay in filing a serial PCRA. In addition, <em>Lark </em>obviously did not constrain appellant's options and <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>decisions in 1995, five years before <em>Lark </em>was decided. And finally, nothing in <em>Lark </em>purports to create an extra-PCRA right to pursue a second post-conviction attack as of right, outside the realm of the PCRA’s serial petition and time-bar restrictions. Appellant’s guilt phase claims are available only to the extent he can satisfy the terms of the PCRA.</p>

The bulk of Lesko’s non <em>-Brady </em>guilt phase claims sound in counsel ineffectiveness and are time-barred for the reasons discussed in the text above. Lesko also raises two questions arising from his prior conviction for the murder of William Nicholls, which he poses as direct appeal counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to raise them on direct appeal, following resentencing. First, he contends that the prosecution for the murder of Officer Miller should have been barred by 18 Pa.C.S. § 110 because of his guilty plea to the murder of Nicholls. According to Lesko, the two events were part of a single criminal episode. <em>See Commonwealth v. McPhail, </em><a href="/pa/547/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="375" data-cite="547 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="468652" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0519-01">547 Pa. 519</a>, <a href="/a2d/692/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="376" data-cite="692 A.2d 139" data-case-ids="11912290,11912368,468652,468719" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/0139-01,/a2d/692/0139-02,/pa/547/0519-01,/pa/547/0518-02">692 A.2d 139</a> (1997) (plurality). Alternatively, Lesko argues that, if the two murders were not part of a single criminal episode, then evidence of the Nicholls murder should not have been admitted at trial or resentencing.</p>

    <p id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[261,651,1150,1232]]]'>In the instant case, the jury found four mitigating factors, relating to two separate mitigating circumstances, namely, that Lesko was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, § 9711(e)(2); and the catch-all provision of Section 9711(e)(8). Testimony that Lesko suffered from organic brain damage would have implicated an additional mitigating circumstance — the inability of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law under Section 9711(e)(3) — that had not already been found by the jury. Furthermore, as the PCRA court recognized, because the jury is instructed to engage in a qualitative rather than a quantitative weighing of mitigating and aggravating circumstances, there is a reasonable probability that uncontroverted testimony such as Dr. Crown’s regarding Lesko’s organic brain damage would have resulted in the jury giving greater weight to the Section 9711(e)(2) mitigator in favor of a life sentence. PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 22. Accordingly, I cannot agree with the Majority’s conclusion that, even if the jury had been presented with evidence of an additional mitigating circumstance under Section 9711(e)(3), Lesko failed to show there was a reasonable probability that at least one jury member would have concluded that the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating circumstances.</p>

Furthermore, I agree with the PCRA court’s determination that, but for counsel’s ineffectiveness in this regard, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the penalty proceeding would have been different. Accordingly, I believe the PCRA court properly held that Lesko is entitled to a new <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>penalty hearing, and I would affirm the PCRA court’s grant of a new penalty hearing on the basis that Lesko was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel. Hence, I dissent from the Majority Opinion to the extent it reverses the PCRA court’s order granting Lesko a new penalty hearing.</p>
