Brief of Appellee at 10. <em>Freundt </em>is distinguishable, PennDOT avers, because its holding that only one suspension is permissible for each criminal episode is limited to suspensions stemming from Section 1532(c), adding that this is appropriate because subsection (c) addresses violations of the Controlled Substances Act, which, it contends, have nothing to do with the safe operation of a vehicle. Brief of Appellee at 11. In contrast, the crimes at issue here, as in <em>Drabic </em>and <em>Reinhart, </em>involve violations of the Motor Vehicle Code, and have a direct impact on driver safety. PennDOT reasons that, if the single criminal episode analysis were applied to moving violations, drivers would have no reason to refrain from committing multiple traffic violations, as only one suspension could be imposed. Finally, with respect to merger, PennDOT asserts Appellant’s violations constitute separate offenses under the Motor Vehicle Code which are not lesser included offenses.

      <em>Freundt's </em>continued longevity means this Court will maintain that the Legislature meant “offense” when it said “offense” in the first of these substantively identical passages, but it meant something entirely different — namely, a criminal episode, or some larger collection of offenses — when it said “offense” in the second passage.

    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[122,682,1153,691]]]'>PennDOT’s approach perhaps reflects a pragmatic recognition that courts often seem to prefer limiting such problematic judicial decisions as closely as possible over outright disavowals of their own previous decisions. <em>See generally </em>Jeff Todd, <em>Undead Precedent: The Curse of a Holding “Limited to Its Facts ”, </em><a href="/citations/?q=40%20Tex.%20Tech%20L.%20Rev.%2067" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="40 Tex.

In terms of the distinctions drawn by the majority, while it indicates that the Legislature did not envision a "volume discount" for traffic offenses, Majority Opinion, at 495, 17 A.3d at 328, no explanation has been provided as to why such a discount was intended for drug offenses. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Legislature shares the majority’s view that drug offenses are remote from roadway safety concerns. <em>See id. </em>at 494-96, 17 A.3d at 328-29 (indicating that "violations of the Controlled Substances Act do not directly relate to traffic <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>safety”). Indeed, the opposite view can be easily maintained, particularly given the pervasiveness of automobiles in our society and the General Assembly's zero-tolerance approach to the presence of Schedule I, II, or III controlled substances in an individual’s blood while driving (with no actual impairment being required). <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 3802(d)(1).</p>

Nevertheless, there should be little doubt that — had Legislature believed "offense” meant "single criminal episode” as <em>Freundt </em>holds — it would have envisioned a suspension commensurate with the most serious offense committed (since the alternative is a magnified volume discount). Thus, I do not share the majority’s uncertainty in this regard. <em>See id. </em>Alternatively, under a <em>Freundt-</em>based rationale, a close parallel easily could be drawn between each individual subpart of Section 1532(b) and Section 1532(c), so that, for example, Appellant would receive only a single 6-month suspension for his two Section 1532(b)(1) offenses deriving from the same criminal episode.</p>
