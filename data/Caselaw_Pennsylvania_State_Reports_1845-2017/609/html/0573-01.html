At the hearing on their petition to set aside the nomination petition, Appellants sought to admit into evidence a report prepared by a private detective that contained affidavits from persons whose signatures had been procured or purportedly procured by the persons circulating the signature pages. Some of the signers affirmed that the circulator of the petition had indicated to them that the petition was to upgrade a neighborhood playground. Other signers affirmed that the circulator had indicated to them that the candidate was an African American, and that the circulator had shown them a photo of an African American male who was supposedly that person. Other purported signers affirmed that the signature contained on the signature page was not their signature. Other signers affirmed that the circulator had told them it was permissible to sign the names of others in their household who were not home at the time, and that the signers did, in fact, sign for those absent household members based on that representation. The court ruled that the report of the detective was inadmissible because “allegations of a pattern of fraud are immaterial in a case involving objections to nomination papers and that such allegations will be disregarded.” <em>In re Nomination of Farnese, </em><a href="/a2d/945/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="945 A.2d 274" data-case-ids="8383271" data-case-paths="/a2d/945/0274-01">945 A.2d 274</a>, 278 n. 10 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008) <em>(Farnese II).</em>

Conversely, Appellants sought to present evidence of the withdrawn pages in support of their claims of fraud, because the circulators of many of the withdrawn pages were also the circulators of the non-withdrawn pages to which individual signature challenges were being raised. Indeed, Appellants raised a “global” challenge and asked the court to dismiss all remaining pages of signatures procured by any circulator of a withdrawn page. In support of this request, Appellants sought to call the circulators as witnesses to probe their awareness of, and adherence to, the elements of Section 909 of the Election Code as affirmed in their circulator affidavits attached to the pages of signatures. The court disallowed this proposed area of inquiry, and ultimately ruled that any evidence relating to the withdrawn pages would have been irrelevant to whether the circulator affidavits or signatures on the non-withdrawn pages were valid. <em>Farnese II, supra </em>at 278.</p>

To state it another way, Appellants conceded that even if they won each of their remaining challenges unrelated to the propriety of the circulator affidavits attached to the signature pages, Appellee would still have had a sufficient number of presumptively valid signatures to remain on the ballot.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The Chief Justice states in his concurring opinion that we stray significantly from the parties' arguments, and suggests that the objectors here presented a "single narrow theory.” (Castille, C.J., concurring, Op. at 592-93, 17 A.3d at 387). The “narrow" question posed, as we see it, is whether the non-withdrawn pages could be invalidated on a broader "false-in-one-false-in-aH” theory. Appellants had hoped to support their "false-in-one-false-in-all" theory by presenting evidence of a pervasive pattern of fraud on the part of the circulators. On the basis that any and all allegations of fraud are irrelevant in determining the propriety of nomination petitions, the trial court did not permit this evidence, or any evidence regarding the circulators' conduct or knowledge of the Election Code, and one of the central allegations on appeal is that the court erred in this ruling. In our discussion of the issues, we do not make any presumption of fraudulent conduct with respect to the withdrawn signatures. Instead, among other things, we point out that at the time the trial court made its ruling, Pennsylvania law clearly supported the proposition that a candidate's fraudulent conduct may nullify a nomination petition, a proposition reiterated by the concurring Opinion in <em>In Re Payton, </em>which was decided by an evenly divided Court ten days after our <em>per curiam </em>order in the present matter. There were serious allegations in this matter concerning the alleged improper <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>conduct of the circulators in procuring signatures for the candidate's nomination petition. The point we make is that had the allegations been more squarely tied to facts tending to show the candidate’s awareness and acceptance of these irregularities, the evidence would have been relevant to the important question of whether the electorate had been deceived and whether the candidate should be on the ballot.</p>

Finally, the objectors expressed their intention to call circulators of withdrawn pages as witnesses at the March 7, 2008, hearing.

Moreover, the lower court’s decision was supported by existing caselaw and the Election Code, and the objectors’ briefing in this Court was conclusory and largely unresponsive to the lower court’s explanation of the reasons for its decision.

But, there was nothing in the governing statute or existing caselaw to put political candidates on notice that otherwise valid signatures, and an otherwise valid nomination petition, could be stricken, and the candidate removed from the ballot, premised on the objectors’ extrapolation theory.

In a separate concurrence, Mr. Justice Eakin questions the necessity of the exchange between the authors of the different expressions in this case, suggesting that it is for the General Assembly to legitimize the "false-in-one, false-in-all” theory as a ground for striking the nomination petitions of electoral candidates. But, as posed, the objectors’ claim is a theory of evidence fully within this Court’s bailiwick. In my view, a proper explanation for our decision requires close attention to the parties’ actual arguments and the evidentiary theory as posed.</p>

    <p id="b637-4" data-blocks='[["BL_637.4",637,[115,1085,1155,569]]]'>First, it should be noted that, in the <em>Nader </em>matter, after the Commonwealth Court completed its review, it determined that the candidate lacked sufficient signatures to obtain ballot access. <em>See Nader, </em><a href="/a2d/865/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="865 A.2d 8" data-case-ids="9032699" data-case-paths="/a2d/865/0008-01">865 A.2d at 18</a>. It was on that basis that the Commonwealth Court adjudicated the case, and this Court elected not to express any opinion concerning the court’s reasoning. Accordingly, no legal issue was presented, either before the Commonwealth Court, or before this Court, concerning whether evidence of fraud imputable to the candidate was germane to a challenge of circulator petitions that might otherwise be deemed valid.</p>
    <p id="b637-5" data-blocks='[["BL_637.5",637,[113,1687,1154,684]],["BL_638.1",638,[265,321,1148,155]]]'>Additionally, there is no indication in <em>Nader </em>that the candidate agreed that a substantial percentage of signatures were not obtained in accordance with law. Accordingly, I cannot agree that <em>Nader </em>supports the principle that, where a candidate agrees that a large percentage of the signatures are invalid, evidence of fraud in the signature-gathering process is relevant beyond the actual signatures being challenged as fraudulent. <em>See </em>OIS, <em>slip op. </em>at 6 (“Where, as here, a candidate for office has agreed that 60.5% of the signatures contained in his nomination petition are invalid, and the objectors to the petition have asserted fraud in the signature procurement process and are prepared to support those allegations with evidence, we cannot say, in light of <em>Nader, ... </em>

    <p id="b638-5" data-blocks='[["BL_638.4",638,[266,517,1149,592]]]'>To me, the primary issue in <em>Nader </em>pertained to whether the term “qualified elector” subsumed a voter registration requirement, because if no such requirement existed, then the candidate would have had enough signatures for ballot access. <em>See Nader, </em><a href="/pa/580/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="580 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="1100664" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0134-01">580 Pa. at 146</a>, <a href="/pa/580/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="860 A.2d 1" data-case-ids="1100664,9145489" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0134-01,/a2d/860/0001-01">860 A.2d at 8</a> (Saylor, J., dissenting). As noted, since the Commonwealth Court’s order was affirmed without an opinion, this Court did not issue a holding on that question. Moreover, review of the tabulated information provided by the Commonwealth Court demonstrates that only a little over one percent of the more than 50,000 signatures obtained were forged. As I stated then:</p>
    <blockquote id="b638-6" data-blocks='[["BL_638.5",638,[307,1143,1111,1021]]]'>In the consolidated findings, opinion and order, the Commonwealth Court also indicated that the signatures under review were primarily the result of widespread, systemic fraudulent conduct on the part the individuals gathering them. <em>See [Nader, </em><a href="/a2d/865/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="865 A.2d 8" data-case-ids="9032699" data-case-paths="/a2d/865/0008-01">865 A.2d at 18</a>] (stating that “this signature gathering process was the most deceitful and fraudulent exercise ever perpetrated upon this Court”). A review of the tables and exhibits attached to the order, however, suggest that the problem was of a more limited scale (for example, 687 signatures out of 51,273 reviewed— or approximately 1.3% of the signatures — were rejected on the basis of having been forged). Moreover, the Commonwealth Court cited no evidence that the candidates were specifically aware of fraud or misrepresentation at the time of their submissions, and the candidates note — and the objectors do not dispute — that when they became aware of any fraudulent conduct connected with specific signatures, they voluntarily withdrew those signatures from consideration.</blockquote>
