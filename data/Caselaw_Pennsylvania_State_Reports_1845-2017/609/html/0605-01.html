Kelly was suspected by these conspirators of having killed Michael Green, Green’s brother, several months earlier. <em>Id. </em>at 248. In accordance with their plan, on the evening of June 22, 1979, Green, who was underage, asked Kelly to buy her some beer at the corner bar. Kelly agreed and entered the bar to purchase the beer. As he exited the bar to return to Green, Rucker closed the door so the patrons inside could not see what was about to transpire. Appellant then emerged from an adjacent alley and shot Kelly from behind. As Kelly attempted to stand, Appellant shot him three more times from approximately three feet away. The incident was witnessed by Betty Harris (Harris), a bystander who was sitting nearby on her front porch.</p>

A ballistics examination established that the bullets that killed Kelly were fired from this gun. Appellant denied involvement in the shooting, and was not charged with murder at that time. He was ultimately acquitted of the gun possession charges. Several years later, Green confessed her role in the murder and implicated Appellant. Appellant was arrested for the murder of Kelly on May 3, 1983.</p>

Then, on October 21, 1982, Harris made a statement to police in which she identified Rucker as the shooter, explaining that she saw the shooter at the movies with a friend well after Kelly’s murder, and the <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>friend identified him as Rucker.

Additionally, the Commonwealth introduced the testimony of Harris, Appellant’s sister, Barbara Smith, as well as various police, ballistics, and forensic witnesses. Harris, who had claimed an inability to identify the shooter when police were investigating the murder, and then identified Rucker, testified that she saw Appellant shoot Kelly. She further testified that she was initially unwilling to identify Appellant as the shooter because she was afraid of him, but, on the eve of trial, she overcame this fear and gave a statement identifying him. Trial counsel attempted to discredit Harris’s testimony with her prior inconsistent statements, arguing that Green and Rucker were the sole perpetrators.</p>

Following a penalty hearing, the jury found two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances, and returned a sentence of death. After post-sentence motions were denied, the trial court formally sentenced Appellant to death on May 6, 1986. The trial court further imposed additional concurrent terms of five to ten years of imprisonment for criminal conspiracy and two-and-one-half to five years of imprisonment for possessing an instrument of a crime.</p>

While the direct appeal was pending before this Court, Appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>“Motion for Withdrawal of Counsel Inter Alia Ineffective Assistance of Counsel,” which this Court treated as an application for appointment of new counsel to represent Appellant in further proceedings under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA). We affirmed the conviction and sentence and remanded Appellant’s case to the court of <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>common pleas for the appointment of new counsel for PCHA proceedings.</p>

On August 20, 1992, Attorney Richard Hoy (Hoy) was appointed to represent Appellant, and, on June 29, 1993, he filed an amended petition on Appellant’s behalf raising two issues. On June 29,1994, the PCRA court directed Hoy to file a statement setting forth the witnesses who would testify at an evidentiary hearing and the substance of their testimony. The court reentered this order following a defense motion for continuance. Following receipt of the witness list, the PCRA court scheduled an evidentiary hearing for March 1,1995. On the day set for the hearing, Hoy neither appeared nor filed anything with the court. The Court continued the evidentiary hearing, and again directed Hoy to file a witness list.</p>

The PCRA case was then transferred to a new PCRA court, which found every claim waived and dismissed all of Appellant’s claims without a hearing. Appellant appealed the dismissal of his PCRA petition, resulting in this Court entering a <em>per curiam </em>order vacating the PCRA court’s order and remanding “for an evidentiary hearing with respect to all disputed, material facts, and appropriate fact-finding.” <em>Commonwealth v.

On February 27, 2009, Appellant’s case was transferred to yet another judge for PCRA proceedings. The new PCRA court reviewed all of Appellant’s claims, and, on May 8, 2009, granted an evidentiary hearing on three claims: whether <em>Atkins </em>barred Appellant’s execution; whether Appellant had been forcibly medicated at the time of trial; and whether trial counsel was ineffective during the penalty phase with regard to the presentation of mitigating evidence. The court determined that Appellant’s remaining claims did not involve contested facts and therefore could be decided without a hearing.</p>
    <p id="b663-5" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[116,1139,1156,990]]]'>On June 19, 2009, defense counsel and the Commonwealth stipulated that Appellant would be granted a new penalty phase hearing based on the ineffectiveness of trial counsel, and the PCRA court ratified this stipulation. Appellant subsequently withdrew the claim that he had been forcibly medicated at trial and the PCRA court held that the <em>Atkins </em>claim was not ripe because of the new penalty phase hearing. This disposed of the three claims on which the PCRA court had granted a hearing. Remaining after this order were Appellant’s claims that the PCRA court did not believe warranted a hearing. In due course, the PCRA court dismissed all of these remaining guilt phase claims without an evidentiary hearing. Appellant has appealed from the dismissal of these guilt phase claims. Thus, despite the length of time since Appellant’s trial, and despite Appellant’s prior appeal to this Court from the denial of his PCRA petition in 2004, the present appeal is his first, appeal during which he has been able to argue the merits of the trial court’s denial of his prayer for collateral relief.</p>

Specifically, central to Appellant’s contentions is his evidentiary proffer as follows, which was gathered from the <em>voir dire </em>record and an affidavit from an attorney who viewed trial counsel’s contemporaneous written observations that purportedly indicate the races of the venirepersons: during jury selection, 35 African Americans and 64 Caucasians were questioned; of these, 47 were excused for cause, hardship, or by agreement, leaving 52 available for peremptory strikes or selection — 16 African Americans and 36 Caucasians; of these, trial counsel struck 8 Caucasians, leaving 16 African Americans and 28 Caucasians for the prosecutor to strike or accept; the prosecutor used 17 peremptory strikes against 14 African Americans and 3 Caucasians, striking 88% of African Americans and 11% of Caucasians, while accepting 13% of African Americans and 89% of Caucasians; and the final jury, including alternates, constituted 2 African Americans and 13 Caucasians. The Commonwealth has stipulated that 12 jurors stricken by the prosecutor were African-American, 3 were Caucasian, and that trial counsel’s notes indicate that 2 other stricken jurors were African American.</p>

Ohio, </em><a href="/us/499/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="499 U.S. 400" data-case-ids="11319062" data-case-paths="/us/499/0400-01">499 U.S. 400</a>, 416, <a href="/us/499/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="499 U.S. 400" data-case-ids="11319062" data-case-paths="/us/499/0400-01">111 S.Ct. 1364</a>, <a href="/us/499/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="499 U.S. 400" data-case-ids="11319062" data-case-paths="/us/499/0400-01">113 L.Ed.2d 411</a> (1991). Appellant further asserts that the prosecutor’s <em>voir dire </em>questioning was perfunctory, and the prosecutor struck certain African Americans with characteristics that would ordinarily be favored by the Commonwealth, making it more likely that the strikes were based on stereotypical assumptions. Finally, Appellant relies on the evidence described above as demonstrating a culture of discrimination in the prosecutor’s office. The Commonwealth responds that Appellant’s claim that the prosecutor violated <em>Batson </em>is waived because counsel did not object to the prosecutor’s use of peremptory strikes during <em>voir dire. </em>The PCRA court rejected Appellant’s claim, holding that Appellant was not entitled to retroactive application of <em>Batson.</em>

As noted above, prior to the decision in <em>Batson, </em>to establish a violation of equal protection in the jury selection process, a defendant was required to establish a pattern or practice of purposeful discrimination on the part of the prosecution occurring across multiple cases. <em>Swain; Basemore, </em>744 A.2d at 728.

The matter has languished in the PCRA court for the better part of two decades. Several attorneys who have represented Appellant on post-conviction did very little or nothing to advance the case. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 619-20, 17 A.3d at 880-81. After the Defender Association of Philadelphia entered their appearance, the PCRA court attempted to dismiss the amended petition in a perfunctory fashion, yielding a remand. <em>See id. </em>at 621, 17 A.3d at 881. Such dismissal was obviously unjustified, as, in the ensuing proceedings — albeit five years later — the Commonwealth stipulated to penalty relief based on deficient performance by Appellant’s trial counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 621-22, 17 A.3d at 882.

In light of the many instances in which my comments have gone unobserved by the Court at large, I have attempted to abide by the majority position that the courts may make some cold-record credibility determinations. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Small, </em><a href="/pa/602/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="342" data-cite="602 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="4195000" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0425-01">602 Pa. 425</a>, 484-85, <a href="/pa/602/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="343" data-cite="980 A.2d 549" data-case-ids="4195000,7294253" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0425-01,/a2d/980/0549-01">980 A.2d 549</a>, 584-85 (2009) (Saylor, J., concurring). To my knowledge, however, no workable standard has been announced to guide the courts in the evenhanded dispensation of such decisions, and the affordance of “considerable discretion” yields far too much room for inconsistent treatment depending on the predilections of individual jurists. <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/602/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="344" data-cite="602 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="4194625" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0360-01">602 Pa. 360</a>, 401, <a href="/pa/602/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="345" data-cite="980 A.2d 510" data-case-ids="4194625,7294178" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0360-01,/a2d/980/0510-01">980 A.2d 510</a>, 535 (2009) (Saylor, J., dissenting) (“The alternative [to a consistent approach on this Court’s part] is that the availability of hearings in post-conviction matters will depend on different judges’ individual thresholds for making credibility assessments without actually hearing the witnesses, and thus, the administration of justice will be uneven.”). Moreover, at some point, as we continue to see the unjust mismanagement, or non-management, of these cases — with twenty years on state post-conviction being simply incomprehensible — there merely comes a breaking point.</p>

For example, in the present case, the majority explains that a recantation declaration provided by eyewitness Betty Harris cannot be after-discovered evidence, because counsel could have learned of the information by interviewing her prior to trial. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>Op. </em>at 628-30, 17 A.3d at 886-87. Nevertheless, in addressing the claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to interview Ms. Harris, the majority reasons that waiting until trial gave Ms. Harris "every opportunity” to provide the information. <em>Id. </em>at 633, 17 A.3d at 889. In addition to the facial tension between these two dispositions, this Court generally recognizes that an adequate pre-trial investigation is a prerequisite to a reasonable strategy. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Malloy, </em><a href="/pa/579/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="347" data-cite="579 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1370995" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0425-01">579 Pa. 425</a>, 454, <a href="/pa/579/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="348" data-cite="856 A.2d 767" data-case-ids="1370926,1370995,9212057,9212126" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0424-01,/pa/579/0425-01,/a2d/856/0767-01,/a2d/856/0767-02">856 A.2d 767</a>, 784 (2004). Moreover, the duty to investigate may include a duty to interview key witnesses. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/600/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="349" data-cite="600 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="4194238" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0329-01">600 Pa. 329</a>, 351, <a href="/pa/600/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="350" data-cite="966 A.2d 523" data-case-ids="4194238,8158876" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0329-01,/a2d/966/0523-01">966 A.2d 523</a>, 535-36 (2009). Therefore, I find it difficult to accept the majority's present proposition that an attorney can curtail a defense guilt-phase, pre-trial investigation merely because he will have the ability to confront key witnesses in the trial proceedings.</p>
      <p id="b721-6" data-blocks='[["BL_721.7",721,[155,2217,1120,156]]]'>The alleged lack of an adequate pre-trial, guilt-phase investigation is also particularly troublesome where, as here, the Commonwealth is stipulating that counsel rendered deficient stewardship relative to the other critical phase of the trial.</p>
