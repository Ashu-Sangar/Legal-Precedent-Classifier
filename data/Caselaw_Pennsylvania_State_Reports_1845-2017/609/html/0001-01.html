Thus, while we agree with the Commonwealth that the law does not require that police be able to identify the object before making a vehicle stop, <em>see </em>Commonwealth’s Brief, at 10, in order to support a suppression court’s finding that an officer possessed reasonable suspicion to believe that a violation of 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 4524(c) has occurred, the officer must <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>articulate at least <em>some </em>fact or facts to support his inference or conclusion that the object materially impaired the driver’s view.</p>

The legislature could have written Section 4524(c) to prohibit a driver from hanging <em>any </em>object from the vehicle’s rearview mirror, or it could have prohibited hanging objects that obstruct a driver’s view to any degree, but it did not; rather, it prohibited only material obstructions. Were this Court to conclude that an officer’s bare testimony that he saw an object hanging from a rearview mirror which obstructed the driver’s view, without any additional testimony or other evidence supporting the officer’s conclusion that the object materially obstructed the driver’s view, was sufficient to demonstrate reasonable suspicion to constitutionally support the intrusion of a vehicle stop, we would obviate the suppression court’s role in ensuring there is an objectively reasonable basis for the vehicle stop, and expose every law-abiding motorist who hangs an object from his or her rearview mirror to a potentially unwarranted intrusion. <em>See Terry.</em>

The dissent, it seems, would write the materiality element out of Section 4524(c) for purposes of a vehicle stop. Although the dissent recognizes that the critical issue in evaluating the legality of a traffic stop is whether the police officer reasonably believes a criminal violation may be afoot, the dissent opines that an officer need not observe a material obstruction; rather, he may observe any obstruction and <em>then </em>"investigate whether vision is blocked to the point of comprising a violation.” Dissenting Opinion at 20, 14 A.3d at 100. Such an approach is contrary to the principles underlying <em>Terry. </em>Further, it would give police officers <em>carte blanche </em>to stop any vehicle with an object hanging from the rearview mirror, as any hanging object would arguably obstruct the driver’s view to some degree.
