She maintains Section 2.0, referring to “Payments,” sets forth only the method of how Bernath was to be paid: namely, appellants were to buy an annuity, which, though not expressly stated in the contract, cost $1.6 million. Appellee believes appellants had no discretion to make payments on their own but were obligated to pay $5.9 million to settle the claims, via a $4.24 million direct payment and a $1.6 million annuity purchase.

She contends appellants’ obligation to fund the annuity purchase was not conditional on Bernath being alive when the first payment was to be made, and argues the language stating no monthly payments would be due on or after her death refers only to the payments under the annuity contract, not appellants’ threshold obligation to pay $5.9 million to settle appellee’s claims. She believes the obligation to pay $5.9 million became effective when the settlement agreement was executed, and was not nullified or reduced by later events. She argues appellants must fulfill their commitment to pay $5.9 million, even if the method of payment has changed due to a changed circumstance; otherwise, Bernath would be denied the benefit of the bargain.</p>

The much-disputed figure is never actually mentioned in the contract, and is achieved by subtracting the two lump sums from the $6.3 million total consideration amount mentioned in Section 1.4. However, as appellants point out, if Bernath were expecting to receive $1.6 million, she would have accumulated that amount simply by living a little more than six years after the agreement’s execution; she may have received much less if she died earlier.</p>
    <p id="b168-5" data-blocks='[["BL_168.5",168,[260,1619,1150,356]]]'>We must therefore conclude the parties’ intent was not that Bernath receive a total of $6.3 million, but that she receive the two lump sums and $20,000 per month for the rest of her life. As she was not expecting to receive a true payment of $6.3 million under the agreement, but more or less depending upon her date of death, her estate is not now entitled to a lump sum of $1.6 million.</p>

However, it must be noted that the benefit of the bargain is whatever the parties are willing to exchange. For example, in <em>Emerson v. Adult Community Total Services, Inc., </em><a href="/f-supp/842/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="842 F. Supp. 152" data-case-ids="3846115" data-case-paths="/f-supp/842/0152-01">842 F.Supp. 152</a>, 154 (E.D.Pa.1994), an 83-year-old man <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>paid a one-time $83,000 entrance fee to a nursing home for lifetime care and then died several months later. The federal court, applying Pennsylvania law, said the contract was valid because the gentleman could have lived much longer and knew the potential existed that he might not outlive the costs initially paid. <em><a href="/f-supp/842/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="842 F. Supp. 152" data-case-ids="3846115" data-case-paths="/f-supp/842/0152-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/f-supp/842/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="842 F. Supp. 152" data-case-ids="3846115" data-case-paths="/f-supp/842/0152-01">at 157</a>. While the annuity contract in the current case was not finalized, we nonetheless find <em>Emerson </em>instructive. The elderly gentleman in <em>Emerson </em>exchanged $83,000 in order to receive care for however long he remained alive — fully knowing that, at the age of 83, his years were approaching an end. To him, $83,000 was a satisfactory amount to pay for that remaining time, and he received the benefit of the bargain despite the fact he only enjoyed that benefit for a short period. Similarly, Bernath was fully aware she was contracting to receive $20,000 per month for the rest of her life, and the payments would cease upon her death. If she had wanted to include a clause allowing for the remainder or full payment of the $1.6 million to her estate in the event of her death, she could have done so. That she chose not to include such a safeguard does not negate the agreement nor rob her of the benefit of the bargain.</p>
    <p id="b169-4" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[123,1438,1155,618]]]'>We conclude appellants had no threshold obligation to pay $5.9 million to Bernath, but to directly pay her $4,239,890 and $20,000 per month, with the option to assign that duty to New York Life by buying an annuity for $1.6 million. That the annuity contract was not executed prior to Bernath’s death is immaterial, as the unambiguous language of the settlement agreement terminated the periodic payments upon death. As Bernath did not agree to receive a $1.6 million lump sum, but rather $20,000 periodic payments to end upon her death, appellants are not now obligated to provide Bernath’s estate with what Bernath herself did not bargain for, and are entitled to recoup the money sent to New York Life.</p>

In making this conclusion, the court apparently relied on the trial court opinion’s statement that ”[a]ppellants offered a written ‘Settlement Agreement and Release’ to Ms. Bemath.” Trial Court Opinion, 12/1/07, at 8. However, "[w]hen the terms of a contract are clear and unambiguous, the intent of the parties is to be ascertained from the document itself.” <em>Insurance Adjustment Bureau, </em>at 468. The trial court found the settlement agreement to be unambiguous, Trial Court Opinion, 11/1/07, at 14, and neither party argues to the contrary. Accordingly, there is no need to construe the language against either party, and our only task is to consider the four corners of the document. <em>Steuart, </em>at 661.</p>

        <em>See </em>Appellee’s Brief, at 17-19. Appellee’s choice of citations is revealing, as she cites commanding language within a provision, but neglects to give the citations context. Read in their entirety, it is clear these sections relate to Bernath’s consent to appellants’ assignment of their periodic payment duty via the purchase of an annuity, and state and define New York Life's responsibilities as assignee of that duty. Settlement Agreement, 12/12/05, at 5-6, 8, § 4.2, 5.0, 6.0, 13.0. The language appellee claims requires appellants to act establishes intent and consent, not obligation and duty; while the contract clearly assumes appellants would exercise their option tó purchase an annuity, no language obligates such an act.</p>
