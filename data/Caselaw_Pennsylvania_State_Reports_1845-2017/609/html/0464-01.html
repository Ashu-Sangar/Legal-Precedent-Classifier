She was taken to Waynesboro Hospital (“Appellee”) in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania. Verdier was admitted to Appellee’s care. Around midnight, on March 23, 2002, Verdier fell from her hospital bed, struck her head on the floor, and subsequently died, after suffering a right orbital fracture and a subdural hematoma — a fractured skull and resulting bleeding of her brain.</p>

Appellee filed preliminary objections, to which Appellant filed an amended complaint. In her amended complaint, Appellant alleged that Verdier died as a result of injuries sustained in a fall from her bed. According to Appellant, Verdier’s injuries were caused by the negligence of Appellee, acting through its agents, by failing to ensure that proper restraints were in place to prevent Verdier from falling from her bed while being transported to her room; leaving Verdier unattended while being transported; failing to use reasonable and necessary safety devices to ensure that Verdi-er would not fall from her bed while being transported; and allowing Verdier to fall from her bed while being transported.

The basis for this pleading was Appellant’s failure to file a certificate of merit as required for actions alleging professional negligence. Pa.R.Civ.P. 1042.3. The trial court granted Appellee’s motion. In response, Appellant filed a Petition to Open and/or Strike the Judgment of Non Pros on the basis she only asserted a claim of simple negligence, did not file a professional liability action, and, thus, was not required to file a certificate of merit. Additionally, Appellant maintained the filing of her amended complaint rendered the original complaint void, and thus, she had 60 days from the filing of the amended complaint in which to file a certificate of merit if so required.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[125,1035,1153,621]]]'>The Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County denied Appellant’s petition. The court first confronted the question of whether Appellant’s action raised a claim of ordinary negligence or of professional negligence. As correctly noted by the trial court, only if Appellant raised the latter type of claim would she be required to file a certificate of merit. According to the trial court, the essential inquiry in determining which type of negligence was at issue was whether the claim pertains to conduct which occurred within the course of a professional relationship, and whether the claim raises questions of medical judgment beyond the realm of common knowledge and experience.</p>
    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[123,1691,1155,683]],["BL_510.1",510,[265,326,1151,514]]]'>Based upon its understanding of the difference between ordinary negligence and professional negligence, the trial court concluded the amended complaint asserted a claim of professional liability. Important to the trial court’s determination, the pleadings averred Appellee did not use the proper restraints to keep Verdier from falling out of bed and that she was left unattended by staff. In Paragraph 11 of the amended complaint, Appellant listed the names of physicians and other agents whom she believed to have acted negligently in connection with this incident. According to the trial court, the amended complaint was carefully drafted to avoid specifying who did what and under what circumstances, but implicated medical evaluation, diagnosis, care and treatment, rather than <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>ordinary slip and fall or premises liability. The trial court distinguished a patient receiving care at a hospital from a delivery person or other non-patient injured while at the hospital, noting that persons in the emergency department must have attended to Verdier and made the decision to have her moved to another room, and also determined that Verdier did not require restraint and decided to leave her unattended. According to the trial court, these actions were an integral part of providing medical treatment and, on some level, implicated medical judgments.</p>
    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[264,863,1153,887]]]'>Moreover, the trial court found that averments in the complaint and amended complaint required an expert’s evaluation in order to provide a basis for the action as a jury would need to be educated as to the risks of transporting a stroke victim from one department to another, which would include an explanation of whether such persons, in the experience of medical personnel, tend to move around on a stretcher or other transport device such that applying restraints of some kind was standard procedure as a safety precaution. Thus, the trial court concluded an expert familiar with stroke victims and hospital procedures would have been necessary because the absence of both restraints and constant supervision during transport was not a matter which was so simple and obvious as to be within the ordinary experience and knowledge of the lay juror. Finding the claim to sound in professional medical malpractice, the trial court held that the failure to file a certificate of merit was fatal to Appellant’s action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

Initially, the court reviewed the elements for medical malpractice and ordinary negligence, and noted that court’s prior case law explaining the distinguishing characteristics regarding a medical malpractice claim was that which occurred within the course of a professional relationship and <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>raised questions of medical judgment beyond the realm of common knowledge and experience. The Superior Court noted Appellant alleged in her amended complaint that Appellee did not properly restrain Verdier during transport and that Appellee’s employee left Verdier unattended before her fall. Related thereto, the court reasoned that someone in the emergency room with medical knowledge made the decision to transport Verdier to a hospital room and to transport Verdier without restraints. According to the Superior Court, these actions were an integral part of providing medical treatment, and on some level, implicated medical judgment.</p>

According to Appellant, the critical fact underlying her complaint and amended complaint is that Ms. Verdier fell out of her hospital bed and sustained injuries as a result of that fall. Appellant asserts a fall from a hospital bed does not involve a deviation from professional standard of care and does not raise an issue of medical judgment beyond the realm of common knowledge and experience. As she alleged only ordinary negligence, Appellant contends she was not required to file a certificate of merit. Moreover, Appellant offers that, in failing to analyze all of the allegations in the complaint and amended complaint, the lower tribunals ignored Pa.R.Civ.P. 1020 which permits causes of action to be pled in the alternative. Indeed, Appel<a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>lant submits, a complaint may allege both professional negligence and ordinary negligence against the same defendant, citing <em>Rostock v. Anzalone, </em><a href="/a2d/904/0943-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="904 A.2d 943" data-case-ids="8474314" data-case-paths="/a2d/904/0943-01">904 A.2d 943</a> (Pa.Super.2006) (holding regarding complaint alleging both professional negligence and ordinary negligence for failure to send copies of diagnostic studies, claims of ordinary negligence would survive even in the absence of a certificate of merit). Thus, Appellant maintains, even if it were to accept the Superior Court’s position that allegations regarding a lack of restraints, leaving the victim unattended, and failing to hire and train a competent medical staff involved the exercise of medical judgment, the court should not have dismissed the entire case; rather, the court should have preserved the claim that Appellee failed to prevent or caused Verdier’s fall.</p>
    <p id="b512-5" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[258,1083,1151,628]]]'>Moreover, Appellant argues that a certificate of merit is required only where medical judgment is beyond the realm of common knowledge and experience; thus, the trial court erred in dismissing the action simply because it believed the complaint and amended complaint involved claims of medical malpractice. According to Appellant, the court was also required to discern whether such claims were beyond the realm of common knowledge and experience. Appellant submits that, under any set of circumstances, it is within the realm of common knowledge and experience that a stroke victim should not be left alone without restraints to fall from a bed, and any jury can make this determination.</p>
    <p id="b512-6" data-blocks='[["BL_512.5",512,[259,1736,1150,631]],["BL_513.1",513,[126,326,1155,961]]]'>Appellee counters that, while a case of first impression, issues regarding the use of restraints, particularly of a stroke patient, require medical judgment. As such, expert testimony is required to support the claim, rendering it a medical professional liability action, requiring the filing of a certificate of merit. Here, according to Appellee, the Superior Court properly found that, although Appellant did not allege that the victim was receiving medical treatment at the time she was being transferred from the emergency room to the hospital room, her claim arose out of a professional relationship, because the conduct at issue constituted an integral part of the process of rendering medical treatment. Moreover, Appellee <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>points out the Superior Court concluded that expert testimony was needed to prove it was negligent for failing to properly restrain the victim and for failing to properly train its staff in the proper procedures in transporting patients. Appellee suggests that, while Pennsylvania courts have not addressed whether expert testimony is necessary to determine if a patient should be restrained, other jurisdictions have concluded that it is a complex medical determination which requires expert testimony. Appellee maintains the types of restraints and monitoring a patient needs will depend upon the medical condition of the patient, and suggests that “a stroke patient who is not completely in charge of her mental and physical capabilities may need restraints and monitoring” but, urges that such a decision must be made by a physician. Appellee’s Brief at 16. Thus, according to Appellee, a medical expert is necessary to render an opinion on whether the failure to restrain and/or monitor the patient was a breach of the applicable duty of medical care.</p>

The rationale espoused by the Superior Court, and now left standing by our Court, in essence deletes the word “professional” from the language of Rule 1042.3, exposing any complaint alleging negligence by an agent or employee of a health care facility, even a claim as legally unexceptional as a patient falling from a bed, to dismissal if it does not contain a certificate of merit. Indeed, not every act by a professional or his or her subordinates involves professional standards or judgments. Some simply require common sense.

    <p id="b522-6" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[266,567,1150,582]]]'>In sum, this Court should address the distinction between ordinary negligence and professional negligence in the health care setting and, in my view, this case presents an excellent opportunity to do so. Here, in light of the purpose of Rule 1042.3, the ambiguity concerning whether a patient fall injury is a claim in ordinary negligence or professional negligence, the liberal interpretation of our rules, and the nature of at least one of the claims asserted, I believe it is patently unfair to dismiss Appellant’s complaint in its entirety due to the failure to file a certificate of merit. For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>

The trial court also determined, <em>inter alia, </em>the period within which the certificate of merit or motion for extension of time must be filed runs from the date of filing of the original complaint. Thus, the trial court concluded Appellee’s preliminary objections did not toll the 60-day filing requirement under Pa.R.Civ.P. 1042.3(a).</p>
