These previously litigated claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel are the following: failure to call witnesses to impeach or rebut the preliminary hearing testimony of Shawn Roussaw, which was read into evidence at trial because he had died by the time of trial; and failure to call alibi witnesses to establish that Appellant did not commit the Panati Playground murders, thereby undermining the motive for killing the victim that had been advanced by the Commonwealth. <em>See Paddy, </em>800 A.2d ht 315-16.

Contrary to Appellant’s assertions, the affidavits do not implicate other individuals in the murder of Ms. Whaley. Merely stating that a family in the neighborhood was concerned because Ms. Whaley was talking to the police does not constitute evidence that some (unnamed) individual in that family murdered her. Any tie between Ms. Whaley’s boyfriend’s family and her murder was — and remains — pure speculation.

Appellant faults trial counsel for failing to object to what Appellant characterizes as the “slovenly, incomplete, and substandard police investigation,” and he suggests that the prosecution relied on “quasi-scientific inferences” and “departed from accepted scientific practices.” Appellant’s Brief at 22. Specifically, Appellant cites the following: (i) allegedly incomplete evaluation of a pair of blood-stained sunglasses with a broken lens recovered from the crime scene; (ii) alleged failure to recover other evidence from the crime scene or to take photographs; (iii) alleged failure to conduct an adequate investigation of the Pontiac Sunbird automobile that was used in Ms. Whaley’s murder; (iv) allegedly sloppy and incomplete recovery of fingerprints from the automobile; (v) no DNA testing of cigarette butts recovered from the automobile; and (vi) alleged failure to challenge the Commonwealth’s fiber expert.

    <p id="b348-4" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[258,711,1153,1050]]]'>In Appellant’s first <em>Brady </em>claim, he contends that the prosecution improperly failed to disclose police reports of a kidnapping and assault in which Ms. Whaley’s boyfriend, Ervin Scutching,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> was a complainant. Notably, the reports were dated two years prior to Ms. Whaley’s murder, they involved an incident that had no connection to her murder, and they did not even mention Ms. Whaley. Appellant focuses only on a statement in the reports to the effect that the police believed the complainants were members of the Junior Black Mafia. Appellant suggests that this statement conveyed the “[knowledge that the police were investigating drug dealers who had close relations to Lashawn Whaley.” Appellant’s Brief at 43. Accordingly, in Appellant’s view, “[disclosure of these reports would have alerted trial counsel to the existence of an alternative theory as to who killed Lashawn Whaley and why.” <em>Id. </em>at 42. Furthermore, Appellant continues, “without these reports, the Commonwealth was able to mislead the jury in a deceptive attempt to eliminate culpability of anyone other than Appellant.” <em>Id. </em>at 43. Appellant’s assertions are nothing short of nonsense.</p>

Appellant’s Brief at 42; N.T., 11/30/95, at 110-11; 12/7/95, at 76-77, 95-96. Appellant’s theory — for which there is no evidence — is that someone in the Scutching enterprise murdered Ms. Whaley because she was cooperating with the police. Even if we were to accept Appellant’s contention that the police reports at issue suggest an active police investigation into drug-related activities of the <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>Scutching family, we fail to see how such information would constitute <em>Brady </em>material. It is well-established that <em>Brady </em>does not require the disclosure of information “that is not exculpatory but might merely form the groundwork for possible arguments or defenses,” <em>Lambert, supra </em>at 856, and does not require the prosecution to disclose “every fruitless lead” considered during the investigation of a crime. <em>Id. </em>at 857.

Appellant insists that “[t]he fact that keys were recovered that did not connect Appellant to any of the vehicles in question was <em>Brady </em>material that should have been turned over to the defense.” <em>Id. </em>at 44. This claim is totally frivolous. Even if all of Appellant’s allegations with regard to the keys were true (which the Commonwealth disputes), this “evidence” would still be immaterial and, as the PCRA court concluded, not exculpatory. PCRA Court Opinion at 7. The Commonwealth’s evidence established that the car used in the murder was driven not by Appellant, but by his co-defendant, Kevin Green, and was abandoned after the murder.

The Ford Mustang, which Appellant was seen driving several days prior to the murder when he evaded police, was shortly thereafter abandoned, and evidence was presented that it had been stolen. N.T., 11/30/95, at 56-61; 12/7/95, at 4-30. The fact that keys to neither of these abandoned vehicles were found in Appellant’s residences is not relevant, much less exculpatory.</p>

Appellant insists that a police report turned over to his co-defendant listed the cigarette butts among the items found in the vehicle, but the police report provided to him did not, allegedly because it was missing a page. Appellant further contends that the Commonwealth offered false testimony at trial when Officer Wilfredo Aponte testified that nothing other than hair fibers was recovered from the vehicle, and did not mention the cigarette butts. Appellant insists that evidence of the cigarette butts could have been used to impeach Officer Aponte’s testimony and thus to undermine his credibility. The Commonwealth disputes Appellant’s contentions, pointing out that page 3 of Commonwealth Exhibit No. 59 (hereinafter “Exhibit C-59”), which included the police report provided to Appellant, describes the cigarette butts found in the car. <em>See </em>Commonwealth’s Brief at 46 and n. 15. We agree with the PCRA court that the cigarette butts were not exculpatory. <em>See </em>PCRA Court Opinion at 8. Furthermore, the record does not support Appellant’s assertion that the presence of the cigarette butts was suppressed by the Commonwealth.</p>

Exhibit C-59 was offered into evidence at trial and was described at that time as a document consisting of a total of four pages (three pages in the investigation report and a single page property receipt). N.T., 12/8/95, at 58. Officer Aponte identified the investigation report at trial and expressly stated that the investigation report consisted of three pages. N.T., 12/8/95, at 59, 82. Page three of the investigation report lists the cigarette butts.

Accordingly, the claims must, inevitably, fail. The advantage of discussing the fatal deficiency in such an argument on the merits is that it reinforces for PCRA petitioners and practitioners alike the necessity that they address all necessary substantive elements of a claim in order to actually obtain relief on it, as opposed to the decidedly Pyrrhic victory that will result when a claim is undeveloped and survives waiver only as a matter of this Court’s grace.

But, treating layered and stand-alone claims “differently” in this instance is appropriate, in my judgment, given this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

In this case, with respect to all stand-alone claims of appellate counsel ineffectiveness, appellant’s brief defaults to claiming that direct appeal counsel was ineffective for failing to “fully develop” claims on direct appeal. Boilerplate arguments such as these, which fail even to address those concerns that are peculiar to appellate advocacy, are properly deemed non-starters.</p>

This observation seems particularly pro<a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>blematic, since a majority of the Court now appears to be suggesting that there effectively can be no state-level redress for such deficient stewardship. <em>See Commonwealth v. Pitts, </em><a href="/pa/603/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="276" data-cite="603 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="4196431" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0001-01">603 Pa. 1</a>, 9-10 n. 4, <a href="/pa/603/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="277" data-cite="981 A.2d 875" data-case-ids="4196431,7293968" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0001-01,/a2d/981/0875-01">981 A.2d 875</a>, 880 n. 4 (2009).</p>

All of Appellant’s claims of ineffectiveness on the part of his appellate counsel tend to be stated in a relatively summary fashion, relying tacitly on the development of the asserted strength and apparentness of the underlying claims to demonstrate deficient stewardship at the appellate level in the failure to appropriately advance them.</p>
      <p id="b394-7" data-blocks='[["BL_394.6",394,[298,1777,1118,587]]]'>For example, the specific development of the reasonable basis prong of the claim of appellate counsel ineffectiveness in each of the claims the majority deems unworthy of merits review is as follows: "[Ajppellate counsel could have had no reasonable basis for his failure to include the claim of trial counsel's ineffectiveness in Appellant's appeal. Appellant was, and is, prepared to prove this at a hearing."; "[A]ppellate counsel could have had no reasonable basis for failing to raise all of the foregoing arguments; Appellant is entitled to a hearing on the question.”; “As these claims are meritorious, counsel could have had no reasonable strategic basis for failing to raise these claims.” Brief for Appellant at 26, 37, 52. These passages are materially identical to the discussion of the reasonable basis prong in the single claim the majority finds supports further merits review. <em>See id. </em>at 85 ("Counsel could have had no reasonable basis for failing to include this claim and for failing to investigate Appellant's background.”).</p>
