After careful review, we conclude that a confession, even if previously and finally adjudicated as voluntary, does not constitute a <em>per se </em>bar to establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case, and the convicted person may, therefore, obtain DNA testing under Section 9543.1 if he or she meets all of this statute’s pertinent requirements. Accordingly, we vacate the Superior Court’s order and remand this case for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>

As the officers entered, one of them saw what appeared to be a bloody fingerprint on the screen door,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and the officers observed that the first floor of the house appeared to have been ransacked, with couch cushions on the floor and furniture drawers open.</p>

Further, all of these individuals sought to have their confessions suppressed as either involuntary or violative of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel. However, in each of the cases, the defendant’s confession was deemed admissible by the trial court, and this finding of admissibility was upheld in post-conviction challenges. All three individuals were convicted after trials at which their confessions were used as a key piece of evidence against them, and their convictions were subsequently affirmed on appellate review.

Consequently, we hereby disapprove <em>Young, </em>and we reverse the panel decision below.

The fundamental scientific principles undergirding DNA tests were derived from the work of Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologists Watson and Crick, who famously determined that an intact human DNA molecule took the shape of a double helix, which resembles a twisted spring or spiral staircase consisting of two entwined strands, each containing the amino acids cytosine, guanine, thymine, and adenine, which are known as bases. These bases are situated in each strand in a linear fashion like linked cars of a train. The two strands are held together by bonds which form across the strands between each of the bases in the individual strands. These bonds obey certain biochemical rules; thus, adenine bonds only with thymine and cytosine <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>with guanine.

Certain portions of the DNA material in chromosomes are called genes, and segments thereof are considered "coding” regions since they direct a cell’s manufacture of proteins and, thus, they determine an individual’s particular physical attributes and characteristics such as eye color, hair color and left or right-handedness. N.T. Trial, 6/3/93, at 50-55; John Butler, <em>Forensic DNA Typing </em>22-23 (Elsevier 2d. ed. 2006). A gene also contains non-coding sequences of base pairs which do not directly control the manufacture of proteins, and other segments of base pairs in the chromosome between genes are non-coding as well. Both the non-coding portion of certain genes and other non-coding areas of chromosomes vary significantly between individuals, and, thus, are utilized as DNA markers for identity testing. The position on a chromosome where a particular DNA marker can be found is known as a locus. The form of DNA marker observed at each chromosomal locus examined in a DNA test is considered an allele. Since chromosomes occur in pairs, with one chromosome inherited from the mother and one from the father, there will be two alleles for a specific chromosomal locus, one derived from each parent. The designation of two alleles at a particular locus is referred to as a genotype. HLA-DQ testing focuses on only one specific locus on human chromosome number six. The base pair sequence at this locus has six known alleles, which can combine to form 21 separate genotypes. N.T.

Amicus, the American Psychological Association ("APA”), contends in its brief there have been many historical instances when innocent people volunteered confessions to crimes they did not commit, including the nearly 200 people who came forward to say that they kidnapped Charles Lindbergh’s baby, and the more recent well-publicized confession of John Mark Karr to the murder of JonBenet Ramsey. Amicus Brief for APA at 8. The APA enumerates a variety of reasons why innocent people might voluntarily confess, such as an individual’s desire for media attention or public notoriety, guilty feelings or delusions of involvement, a belief that they will benefit by the act of confession, or the confessor is motivated by a desire to protect a parent, child, or someone else. <em><a href="/citations/?q=82%20N.C.%20L.%20Rev.%20891" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="82 N.C.

The first factor it cites is interrogation tactics which can lead innocent people to confess in order to end the interrogation process. According to the APA, such tactics can involve: (a) isolating and cutting off the person being interrogated from his or her support structure of family and friends and then confronting the person with strong accusations of guilt which the interrogator claims are supported with evidence, even though some of this evidence may not even exist, resulting in strong feelings of despair; (b) wearing the interrogated person down with lengthy interrogations; (c) the interrogator pretending to minimize the severity of the offense and to provide sympathy or moral justification for the questioned individual's actions; and (d) the interrogator suggesting to the individual that he or she would be treated with leniency if he or she confesses.</blockquote>

The standard juiy instructions trial judges across this Commonwealth frequently utilize to instruct juries on their deliberations further illustrate the clear distinction between the question of the voluntariness of a confession, and the question of whether the confession is truthful and determinative of guilt.

See, e.g., Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Jury Instruction § 3.04 (instructing the jury that they are not to consider a defendant’s statement unless they find the defendant made the statement voluntarily) and § 3.05 (instructing the jury that once they have determined a defendant has made a statement voluntarily they may then consider the statement as evidence and consider the circumstances of its making, as well as all the other evidence in the case, to judge its truthfulness and how much weight it has on the question of the defendant's guilt).</p>
