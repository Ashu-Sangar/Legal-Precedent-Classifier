At the parties’ request, Judge Friedman extended the deadline for submitting stipulations to March 5 and rescheduled the hearing for March 7, 2008, which allowed the parties additional time to negotiate stipulations.</p>

According to the objectors’ stipulations, the candidate was withdrawing twenty-two signature pages (total of 934 signatures) from the nomination petition and the objectors were abandoning two full-page challenges. The objectors also stated that the parties agreed to the validity or invalidity of selected individual signatures on the remaining twenty-seven pages. The objectors stated that they “reserve[d] the <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>right to use” any pages withdrawn by the candidate as evidence to challenge individual pages and the entire nomination petition.

According to the objectors, all of the circulators’ affidavits notarized by Jonathan J. Oriole — and the signature pages to which they were attached — had to be stricken because Mr. Oriole had falsely notarized a page (page 33) of the nomination petition. Page 33 was one of the twenty-two pages withdrawn by the candidate; it had been challenged as falsely notarized because someone other than the circulator signed the circulator’s name on the affidavit, indeed misspelling the name. Similarly, the objectors also argued for striking all of the affidavits — and the signature pages to which they were attached — of circulators whose pages were withdrawn by the candidate after being challenged on grounds they contained numerous invalid signatures. The objectors sought to call the circulators of the "withdrawn pages as witnesses at the March 7th hearing. According to the objectors, given the pervasive irregularities on some signature pages, the circulators of those pages “lied under oath” and, therefore, all the affidavits they signed and the attached signature pages should be deemed invalid. Objectors’ Brief, 3/5/08, at 1-2, 5. The objectors conceded that the outcome of their challenge to the candidate’s nomination petition would depend on Judge Friedman’s rulings on their “false-in-one, false-in-all” theory.

In the motion to strike, the candidate objected to two types of challenges the objectors raised to individual signatures: the “invalid signature” category on grounds of specificity, and the “circulator lives out of district” category on constitutional grounds. Candidate’s Motion to Strike, 3/6/08, at 2-6. Via the motions <em>in limine, </em>the <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>candidate sought to preclude the objectors from introducing any evidence related to notary Jonathan J. Oriole, from introducing any withdrawn signature pages into evidence, and from calling individual circulators as witnesses. The candidate argued that the withdrawn pages were no longer part of the nomination petition, should not be accepted into evidence, and were irrelevant to show the invalidity of otherwise presumptively valid signatures involving the same notary public or the same circulators. The candidate also sought to prevent individual circulators from testifying, on grounds of relevancy. He claimed that the only reason the objectors sought to introduce the circulators’ testimony was to impeach them with prior bad acts (the irregularities on the withdrawn signature pages), which was impermissible under the Pennsylvania rules of evidence. Candidate’s Motion <em>in Limine </em>(Notary), 3/6/08, at 1-4; Candidate’s Motion <em>in Limine </em>(Circulators), 3/6/08, at 2-5.</p>
    <p id="b593-5" data-blocks='[["BL_593.4",593,[117,1249,1153,356]]]'>At the March 7th hearing, the parties reviewed the competing stipulations and of the original 1,778 signatures, 934 were withdrawn by the candidate. In addition, the parties agreed that another 143 signatures were invalid.

If a circulator testified that s/he was aware and understood the legal criteria of Section 909, then the objectors wished to impeach his/her credibility with evidence of the allegedly “fraudulent or false affidavits concerning the [signature pages] that were withdrawn.” N.T., 3/7/08, at 9. The objectors argued that the affidavits were false, <em>inter alia, </em>because the nomination petition listed residences that did not exist but were vacant lots, listed group residences/homeless shelters that were not in operation, and listed signatures of persons who filed affidavits stating that they never signed the nomination petition and/or had no reason to provide a particular shelter as his/her residence. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. The objectors contended that the withdrawn signature pages showed that those circulators were not familiar with their “requirements and obligations;” and if there was fraud or false affidavits with regard to the withdrawn signature pages, then the circulators’ other pages “should also be withdrawn, because one should not benefit by fraudulent conduct in the past and then present other [pages] during the same time period.” The objectors argued that the validity of the circulators’ affidavits could not be taken lightly, especially given the criminal penalties attached to making false statements in nomination petitions. <em>Id. </em>at 13. Finally, as an alternative to their “false-in-one, false-in-all” argument, the objectors sought to strike 324<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> signatures based on individual signature, challenges. <em>Id. </em>at 65.</p>

According to the candidate, signature pages were withdrawn after review by his attorneys, who concluded that for those pages, the circulators did not “review or personally oversee” signatures. The candidate stated that his attorneys applied a <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>strict interpretation of this Court’s decision in <em>In re Nomination Petition of Flaherty, </em><a href="/pa/564/0671-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="564 Pa. 671" data-case-ids="1276821" data-case-paths="/pa/564/0671-01">564 Pa. 671</a>, <a href="/a2d/770/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="770 A.2d 327" data-case-ids="11100830,1276821" data-case-paths="/a2d/770/0327-01,/pa/564/0671-01">770 A.2d 327</a> (2001), to withdraw the pages solely for the purpose of the proceeding and did not thereby acknowledge any “fraud.” According to the candidate, under <em>Flaherty, </em>signatures that were affixed without review or oversight by the circulator-affiant were technically invalid. But, the candidate argued, <em>Flaherty </em>clearly instructed that whole pages could not be excised simply because they contained some invalid signatures; instead, any valid signatures had to be counted. N.T., 3/7/08, at 27-28. Further, the candidate reiterated the relevancy and the prior bad acts arguments from his motions <em>in limine </em>in favor of excluding references to notary Jonathan J. Oriole and any withdrawn signature pages, and prohibiting the objectors from calling individual circulators as witnesses in pursuit of the objectors’ “false-in-one, false-in-all” theory.</p>
    <p id="b595-5" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[122,1188,1156,735]]]'>Judge Friedman granted the candidate’s motions <em>in limine. </em>The objectors asked for clarification of the decision, renewing their argument that, if a circulator was called and admitted that s/he did not know the requirements then, regardless of whether a page contained otherwise valid signatures, the entire signature page had to be stricken. <em>Id. </em>at 38-61. The court ultimately permitted the objectors to call individual circulators but only to question them about individual signatures <em>(i.e., </em>did you circulate this signature page, did you get this signature, and did you get this page notarized). The court denied the objectors’ request to question the circulators’ knowledge of the legal reqüirements of an affidavit, Section 909, or their knowledge that some affidavits were false.

The objectors responded that they were contesting an additional 293 signatures, but conceded that over half of those challenges were unlikely to be successful and indicated that they would not prevail in striking the nomination petition on this ground. <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>N.T., 3/7/08, at 66. Thus, the objectors chose not to proceed on the individual challenges. <em>Id. </em>at 74-75. The candidate noted for the record that he would have established the validity of 629 signatures. <em>Id. </em>at 80. The court accepted the objectors’ concession and dismissed their petition. The court also denied the candidate’s motion to strike certain challenges for insufficient specificity. On March 10, 2008, the court issued an order denying the objectors’ petition, directing the Secretary of the Commonwealth to place the candidate on the April 2008 Democratic Party primary ballot, and ordering the objectors to pay the costs of litigation.</p>

Muir, </em><a href="/pa/511/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="511 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="1798713" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0535-01">511 Pa. 535</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="511 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="1798713" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0535-01">515 A.2d 855</a>, 859 (1986) (applicant for counsel fees from common fund has burden of proving his/her entitlement to those fees). As discussed, <em>supra, </em>the candidate requested costs on the ground that he was a prevailing party and on the ground that the objectors withdrew their line-by-line challenges. We have deemed both grounds insufficient to justify awarding costs. We see no basis to remand; and we note that the candidate has not requested such an alternative disposition.</p>

I write separately to observe and emphasize that the objective factors here, including that the candidate conceded that 1077 of the 1778 signatures contained in his nomination petition were invalid, would support an inference that the appellant objectors acted in good faith in initiating and pursuing their challenge to the authenticity of the signatures contained in the petition. On this relevant fact alone, I believe, the court’s award of costs to the candidate should be considered an abuse of discretion. Under the circumstances, the candidate should have expected that litigation would likely ensue, and I can see no just reason to support a judicial shifting of costs to the objectors where the candidate admitted that more than 60% of the signatures contained in his petition were invalid.</p>

In our disposition of the appeal from the trial court’s denial of the objectors’ petition to set aside the nomination petition in this case, we expressed our concern that a candidate for office “should not be permitted to submit a nomination petition that contains mostly illegitimate signatures without doubt being cast upon the propriety of the candidate’s signature procurement process.” <em>In re Nomination Petition of Farnese, </em><a href="/pa/609/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="17 A.3d 375" data-case-ids="4201308,7281919" data-case-paths="/pa/609/0573-01,/a3d/17/0375-01">17 A.3d. 375</a>, 377 (Pa.2011). The circumstances here cast doubt upon the candidate’s method of procuring signatures and support a colorable allegation of fraudulent conduct.

It will not suffice to submit an invoice with neither explanation of why the award of costs would be “just,” nor reference to 25 P.S. § 2937; likewise, an award without reference to § 2937’s requirement that the award be “just” is insufficient for review purposes.</p>

The applicable standard is whether the lower court abused its discretion, <em>see </em>Majority Op., at 563, 17 A.3d at 369, and where, as here, the record is silent concerning the lower court’s analysis, we cannot determine whether such discretion was properly exercised. Candidate should not be thrown completely out of court simply because the trial court was quick to grant relief but failed to provide its analysis. As long as the record provides some reason to suggest § 2937’s standard for an award of fees may be met, remand for further elucidation is the better course. <em>See Borough of Beaver v. Steckman, <a href="/a2d/728/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="728 A.2d 418" data-case-ids="11621142" data-case-paths="/a2d/728/0418-01">728 </a></em><a href="/a2d/728/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="728 A.2d 418" data-case-ids="11621142" data-case-paths="/a2d/728/0418-01">A.2d 418</a>, 420-21 (Pa.Cmwlth.1999) (distinguishing reversal of award of attorney’s fees without remand in <em>Township of South Strabane v.

Similarly, while the trial court here provided no analysis of the applicable standard, the record does not indicate the standard cannot be met, so the award of costs may still be appropriate. Candidate’s entitlement to costs cannot be ignored because the trial court originally acted too quickly and without articulation — the shortcoming seems the court’s, not the litigant’s, and the litigant’s request should thus be given proper consideration. Accordingly, I would <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>remand for the trial court to articulate such reasons it may have to deem the award just.</p>
