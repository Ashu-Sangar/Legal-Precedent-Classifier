At approximately 8:40 p.m. on the evening in question, Appellee and a second man known only as Darryl arrived at Mr. Snyder’s residence. As was his custom, Appellee knocked on Mr. Snyder’s window to gain access to the inside of the apartment. When Mr. Snyder opened the door to allow Appellee inside, Darryl, who had been hidden from view, followed Appellee into the apartment. Darryl then approached Mr. Snyder and said, “Come on, let’s go. We’re going to the ATM machine.” Notes of Testimony (N.T.), Oct. 11, 2006, at 19. Darryl then lifted the front of his jacket to reveal an automatic firearm in his waistband.</p>

Darryl withdrew $400 (in two different transactions of $100 and $300, respectively) from Mr. Snyder’s bank account. Immediately thereafter, Darryl’s brother arrived in a silver SUV, and Darryl entered the vehicle, leaving the scene. Appellee did not follow Darryl, but instead walked a short distance with Mr. Snyder, before suddenly fleeing the area on foot.</p>

After his arrest, Appellee voluntarily told Detective Valentino that he took a man known as “D” to Mr. Snyder’s apartment. Apparently, Appellee owed “D” money, and, coincidentally, Mr. Snyder owed Appellee money. Accordingly to Appellee, upon entering the home, “D” showed Mr. Snyder the firearm, looked through Mr. Snyder’s wallet, and then the three men left the apartment for an ATM machine. After “D” withdrew the $400, he entered the silver SUV and fled the area. No evidence, however, suggested that Appellee himself visibly possessed a firearm.</p>

Appellee had no prior convictions, and the sentencing guidelines suggested twenty-two to thirty-six months of minimum incarceration, plus or minus twelve months. As robbery is a felony of the first degree, the most Appellee could have been sentenced to serve was twenty years of incarceration. 18 Pa.C.S. § 1103(1). At the hearing, defense counsel, the prosecuting attorney, and the trial court all acknowledged that, under the accepted reading of Section 9712(a) at the time of sentencing, imposition of a minimum term of imprisonment of five years was mandatory, based upon Appellee’s conviction <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>for robbery, and Darryl’s possession of a firearm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
      <em>See e.g., </em>N.T., Nov. 30, 2006, at 4 (“THE COURT: It is a five-year mandatory.”). Accordingly, the court sentenced Appellee to a term of imprisonment of five to ten years.

However, the court also considered this Commonwealth’s longstanding jurisprudence that a challenge to the legality of one’s sentence can never be waived. <em>See e.g. Dickson, </em><a href="/pa/591/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="918 A.2d 95" data-case-ids="3015420,8325559" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0364-01,/a2d/918/0095-01">918 A.2d at 99</a>.

Indeed, on two occasions, <em>Commonwealth v. Vasquez, </em><a href="/pa/560/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="560 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="95828" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0381-01">560 Pa. 381</a>, <a href="/a2d/744/1280-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="744 A.2d 1280" data-case-ids="11495579,95828" data-case-paths="/a2d/744/1280-01,/pa/560/0381-01">744 A.2d 1280</a> (2000), and <em>Commonwealth v.

For example, in <em>Vasquez, </em>the Commonwealth had sought a mandatory fine against a defendant for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Although the Commonwealth provided the required notice of intent to seek the mandatory fine with the trial court and defendant, the trial court, at sentencing, failed to impose the fíne.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The Commonwealth failed to preserve the issue through a timely lodged objection or post-sentence motion. On appeal, the defendant argued that the mandatory fine could no longer be imposed because the Commonwealth had waived any contentions in this regard by failing to object or file a post-sentence motion. This Court unanimously disagreed, finding “because the initial sentence lacked the mandatory fíne, it was illegal from its inception and always susceptible to correction.” <em>Vasquez, </em><a href="/a2d/744/1280-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="744 A.2d 1280" data-case-ids="11495579,95828" data-case-paths="/a2d/744/1280-01,/pa/560/0381-01">744 A.2d at 1284</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Thus, the Commonwealth’s sentencing challenge was nonwaivable.</p>

There, we examined whether a New York statute prohibiting driving while one’s ability is impaired (DWAI), was equivalent to Pennsylvania’s prohibition against driving under the influence (DUI), for purposes of a recidivist-based mandatory minimum sentence. The sentencing court found the New York DWAI statute equivalent to Pennsylvania’s DUI statute, thus impheating the third-time mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(e)(1)(iii) (repealed) (mandating a sentence of not less than ninety days of imprisonment for persons with three DUI or DUI-equivalent convictions), rather than the second-time mandatory sentence provisions of subsection (e)(1)(h) (repealed) (mandating a sentence of not less than thirty days of imprisonment for persons with two DUI or DUI-equivalent convictions).

The sentencing court’s belief in this regard led this Court at the outset of our analysis to state that the sentencing question raised by Shaw “implicate[d] the legality of his sentence, and not its discretionary aspects, since the sentencing court had no discretion in calculating the number of [Shaw’s] prior DUI convictions for purposes of determining his mandatory minimum sentence____” <em>Shaw, </em>744 A.2d at 742.

R.A.P. 2119(f). A challenge to the legality of sentence, however, need not be preserved and is never waivable. <em>In re M.W., </em><a href="/pa/555/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="555 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1701999" data-case-paths="/pa/555/0505-01">555 Pa. 505</a>, <a href="/a2d/725/0729-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="725 A.2d 729" data-case-ids="11639758,1701999" data-case-paths="/a2d/725/0729-01,/pa/555/0505-01">725 A.2d 729</a> (1999).</p>

The violation of Section 6106 constituted a felony of the third degree, with a maximum sentence of seven years.

Notwithstanding that the sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, <em>cf.

The concurrence by the Chief Justice contends that the proper resolution of this appeal revolves around the retroactive application of the <em>Dickson </em>decision, rather than issues surrounding legality of sentencing. While retroactivity was not briefed or argued by the parties (indeed, the Commonwealth has conceded the applicability of <em>Dickson </em>to Appellee, assuming, of course, the challenge has not been waived for all the reasons discussed herein, <em>see </em>Reply Brief of Commonwealth at 4 n. 2.), nor was it included within our grant of allocatur, the concurrence argues that we should decide the instant appeal because, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) <em>Dickson </em>overruled over twenty years of Superior Court precedent, which had applied Section 9712(a) to unarmed co-conspirators; and (2) <em>Dickson </em>involved this Court's initial interpretation of an enactment of the General Assembly.</p>

On appeal, the plurality does not admit its own reliance on Section 9781, but it implicitly adopts the Superior Court’s approach and perpetuates the discretion/legality dichotomy. In its analysis, the Lead Opinion betrays no recognition of the distinction between what is required by this Court’s authority governing issue preservation at trial, and Section 9781’s distinct requirements respecting presentation of sentencing issues on appeal. Then, the plurality redefines sentence illegality as non-discretion in sentencing. The Lead Opinion concludes that, because sentencing courts have no discretion to sentence below the mandatory minimum threshold when Section 9712(a) applies, <em>ipso facto, </em>a claim under that Section implicates the legality of the sentence, and cannot be waived. OAJC Op. at 344-45. In response to this concurrence, the plurality cites several cases which have assumed that, if a claim involves an “illegal” sentence, it was not subject to procedural restrictions at the trial level or on appeal. <em>See </em>OAJC Op. at 343-44. But, those cases state that claims of illegality were unwaivable; the same cases did not purport to redefine what amounts to an illegal sentence, let alone expand illegality to encompass all non-discretionary sentencing decisions, as the Lead Opinion does. <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>Those cases also did not involve predicate questions of retro-activity, which increases the complexity of the present matter. As I noted at the outset, the plurality’s failure to account for the fact that the powering issue here is retroactivity, and its consequent redefinition of the concept of illegal sentence to reach its result, calls for a more principled examination of the precepts the plurality accepts as inflexible command. Other considerations supporting a closer examination of the paradigm include the difficulty that this Court and the Superior Court have had, in prior cases, in determining which claims implicate sentencing “legality,” and the fact that there are expressions in cases, not accounted for by the plurality, which have noted that there is a need for more precision in determining both what is an illegal sentence, and what procedural consequences should follow from a finding that a sentence is illegal.</p>

First, the statute, notably entitled “appellate review of sentence,” does not purport to address trial level issue preservation doctrines, and the statute certainly does not purport to address retroactivity concerns arising from new decisional law. The statute exists merely to regulate the manner in which sentencing issues are approached on direct appeal. Section 9781(a) permits review “as of right” (for the defendant or the Commonwealth) if the question posed implicates “the legality of the sentence,” a phrase not further defined. Section 9781(b) governs appeals (by the defendant or the Commonwealth) of the “discretionary aspects of a sentence,” also not further defined, and sets forth a procedure by which such claims are screened by the direct review court in a manner similar to allocatur review. Review of discretionary aspects of sentence is allowed only where there is a substantial question that the sentence imposed is not appropriate under the Sentencing Code. Under this Court’s Rules, the screening process is invoked by including in the appellate brief the preliminary statement required by Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f).

Under prevailing law, there are at least three common types of sentencing complaints, two of which can easily be squared with Section 9781’s illegal sentence/discretionary sentence labeling, and one of which cannot be labeled as easily. The classic claim of an illegal sentence is where the sentence exceeded the statutory maximum for the offense(s). <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Review of a docket and the relevant governing statute establishes the claim. But, many other non-discretionary sentencing claims are not so obvious or indisputable. The claim here is an example. The applicability, or inapplicability, of the Section 9712(a) firearms mandatory sentence is not obvious from the conviction and a consultation of the statute; it depends, intensely, upon the facts. Those facts can be disputed at trial. Obviously, then, this is the sort of claim that the defendant (or the Commonwealth, as the case may be) should dispute, both timely and on the record.

But, neither is the statute purely procedural. And, at least in a case like this one, where the length of the minimum sentence imposed was wholly a function of the statute (the standard range of the Guidelines called for a minimum sentence of twenty-two to thirty-six months, and the court gave no indication that it believed an upward deviation would otherwise have been warranted), its effect is to prevent the court from fashioning an individualized sentence that <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>otherwise complies with the norms set forth in the Sentencing Code and the Sentencing Guidelines. In short, for the admittedly narrower purpose of sentencing, the statute can have as fundamental an effect as a statute defining criminal conduct. For my part, I do not question the power of the General Assembly to remove sentencing discretion in firearm possession cases via mandatory minimum sentencing statutes like Section 9712(a). But, in assessing whether to employ a judicial procedural default doctrine to preclude retroactive application of a decision construing a sentencing statute, I believe that the fact that the decision recognizes and restores a discretionary power in sentencing weighs in favor of excusing the default.</p>

The effect of a mandatory sentencing statute in a case where there is no argument that a sentence greater than the mandatory is warranted is to make sentencing a rote exercise. Applying <em>Dickson </em>and remanding will not dictate that any particular sentence be imposed, but instead, will require discretionary, individualized resentencing by a judicial officer, according to default sentencing norms, just like in the vast majority of criminal cases. On the other hand, refusing to apply <em>Dickson </em>consigns appellee to serve a non-discretionary, mandatory sentence even though, under this Court’s prevailing interpretation in <em>Dickson, </em>the General Assembly did not intend to remove judicial discretion in this instance.

My discussion in text is confined to the question of issue preservation at the trial court level, and not the distinct question of compliance with Section 9781(b) and Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) on appeal. Given the obvious inadequacy of the illegal/discretionary construct in Section 9781, careful practitioners over the years have always included a prefatory Rule 2119(f) statement, even if they had a colorable argument that their claims implicated the legality of a sentence, or as here, that their claims did not implicate a discretionary sentencing determination. Appellee would have been wise to follow this practice. But, on the other hand, the question of whether his merits issue was reviewable as of right under Section 9781(a) was one of first impression; appellee did not hide the ball, but indeed, raised his <em>Dickson </em>argument immediately; the <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>Superior Court denied his pre-briefing motion without prejudice to raise the claim on appeal; and the merits issue of retroactive application of <em>Dickson </em>obviously raised a substantial question of first impression, such that discretionary review would have been appropriate. On this record, and consistently with my discussion below, I would not deem appellee’s claim to be waived under the judicial default rule embodied in Appellate Rule 2119(f).</p>

The plurality demurs from addressing the issue of retroactivity, because it has not been argued by the parties and because, the Lead Opinion says, "the Commonwealth has conceded the applicability of <em>Dickson </em>” to appellee if the issue of waiver were resolved in favor of appellee. OAJC Op. at 345 n. 21. Accordingly, the plurality addresses the issue of waiver only. The Lead Opinion also expresses concern with my "conclusion that 'as the creator of this issue preservation/waiver doctrine, this Court is certainly empowered to modify or excuse it whenever greater jurisprudential values are at stake.’ Concurring Op. at 536, 17 A.3d at 352 (Castille, C[.]J., concurring).” OAJC Op. at 346 n. 21.

      <p id="b581-11" data-blocks='[["BL_581.11",581,[156,1711,1124,666]]]'>But the plurality’s condemnation of my position derives from its own misperception of my global position. This Court obviously may adjust its procedural rules respecting issue preservation. The plurality may have rendered a simple and definitive rule, as it says, but it is an <em>ad hoc </em>rule that, in my respectful judgment, fails to see the bigger picture, and will cause collateral confusion. As I have explained, this sentence was legal when imposed and appellee failed to challenge it. <em>Dickson </em>was then decided four months later, and appellee sought application of <em>Dickson </em>to reduce his sentence. Under these circumstances, both the doctrines of retroactivity and waiver are implicated. I am decidedly in favor of properly assessing issues and values, irrespective of the parties' arguments, rather than restricting our review. In this preference, I have solid company. <em>See Freed v.
