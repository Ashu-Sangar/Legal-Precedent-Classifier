The girls began to climb the steps to SEPTA’s Fern Rock Station. Appellant and another individual blocked the girls’ path, and Appellant demanded that Williams give him her earrings. The girls turned and fled; however, Appellant caught Williams in the street. Appellant ripped Williams’ earrings from her ears, and, then, drew a handgun and shot her in the neck, killing her.</p>

The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County sentenced Appellant to death.</p>

Initially, we note that, as a general proposition, we review a denial of PCRA relief to determine whether the findings of the PCRA court are supported by the record and free of legal error. <em>Commonwealth v. Clark, </em><a href="/pa/599/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="599 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="3441003" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0204-01">599 Pa. 204</a>, 212, <a href="/pa/599/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="961 A.2d 80" data-case-ids="3441003,8189638" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0204-01,/a2d/961/0080-01">961 A.2d 80</a>, 84 (2008). Moreover, relevant for purposes of this appeal, in order to qualify for PCRA relief, the petitioner must prove by the preponderance of the evidence that his statutory conviction or sentence resulted from, <em>inter alia, </em>a violation of the Pennsylvania Constitution or the federal Constitution, or ineffective assistance of counsel, which so undermined the truth determining process that no reliable <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543(a)(2)(i), (ii).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.4",492,[260,457,1153,1051]]]'>The first issue raised in this matter involves a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In reviewing a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel for failing to investigate, we must keep in mind the well established substantive standards. We begin with the presumption that counsel rendered effective assistance. <em>Commonwealth v. Basemore, </em><a href="/pa/560/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="560 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="95802" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0258-01">560 Pa. 258</a>, 277 n. 10, <a href="/a2d/744/0717-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="744 A.2d 717" data-case-ids="11490920,95802" data-case-paths="/a2d/744/0717-01,/pa/560/0258-01">744 A.2d 717</a>, 728 n. 10 (2000). To obtain relief on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must rebut that presumption and demonstrate that counsel’s performance was deficient, and that such performance prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em><a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">466 U.S. 668</a>, 687-91, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">104 S.Ct. 2052</a>, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">80 L.Ed.2d 674</a> (1984). In our Commonwealth, we have rearticulated the <em>Strickland </em>Court’s performance and prejudice inquiry as a three-prong test. Specifically, a petitioner must show: (1) the underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) no reasonable basis existed for counsel’s action or inaction; and (3) counsel’s error caused prejudice such that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different absent such error. <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>,158-59, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a>, 975 (1987).</p>

Thus, a petitioner may be entitled to relief on this type of claim by asserting a layered claim of appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness. In <em>Commonwealth v. McGill, </em><a href="/pa/574/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="574 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="588049" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0574-01">574 Pa. 574</a>, <a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">832 A.2d 1014</a> (2003), our Court clarified the standards regarding allegations of constitutional ineffec<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>tiveness when the assertion involves the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel for failure to raise a claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness. In sum, we held, as to each layer of allegedly ineffective counsel, a petitioner must plead and prove each of the three prongs under <em>Pierce. </em>Thus, where appellate counsel did not raise an issue of trial counsel ineffectiveness, a petitioner must plead in his petition that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to allege that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to act in some fashion, and develop each prong of the <em>Pierce </em>test as to appellate counsel’s representation. A petitioner has then preserved a layered claim of ineffectiveness for the court to review. At that point, the court proceeds to determine whether the petitioner has proved his layered claim. <em>McGill, </em><a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">832 A.2d at 1022</a>. The arguable merit prong concerning appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness is satisfied by pleading and proving the three prongs of the <em>Pierce </em>standard regarding the underlying allegation of trial counsel ineffectiveness. In such a scenario, the failure to establish any of the <em>Pierce </em>prongs with respect to trial counsel ineffectiveness ends the inquiry and the petitioner’s ability to obtain relief on the basis of appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness.</p>

The factual background for this claim is as follows. Bane testified at the PCRA hearing that, on the date of the murder, she completed her classes at Temple University at 1:00 pm, and immediately caught the subway to the Fern Rock Station. She then rode a bus, to her home where she arrived at approximately 1:30-1:40 pm. She indicated that she remembered that day because she arrived at the Fern Rock Station just after “something had happened,” which was the shooting of Chedell Williams, and it upset her. Bane further testified that, once she arrived at her home, she changed her clothes, spoke with her mother, ate, and spoke with Appellant twice on the telephone.</p>
    <p id="b494-5" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[265,1342,1151,733]]]'>Specifically, Bane alleged that she spoke with Appellant while she was at her home, and that Appellant was at his father’s house. Bane did not recall if she first called Appellant or if he initiated the call. Based upon her normal after-school routine, Bane testified that she knew these calls took place between 1:30 and 1:45 pm. During the conversation, they discussed the murder at the Fern Rock Station. Bane claimed to know Appellant was at his father’s home, as she heard Appellant’s father’s voice in the background and he picked up the telephone during her conversation with Appellant to tell Appellant that he needed to use the telephone. She also testified that she knew it was Appellant’s father’s number as Appellant’s father’s name and telephone number appeared on her caller <a href="/pa/599/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="961 A.2d 80" data-case-ids="3441003,8189638" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0204-01,/a2d/961/0080-01">ID.</a></p>

Bane claimed that she and Appellant spoke several times while he was incarcerated, <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>but that it was not until the second or third conversation that Bane made the connection between the time of the murder and her telephone calls with Appellant. Additionally, Bane asserted that she did not remember who gave her the telephone number of Appellant’s trial counsel, Lee Mandell, but that she attempted to contact trial counsel several times once she understood the import of the timing of these conversations. Bane claimed that she attempted to call him in a three-way telephone conversation along with Appellant; left voice-mails; and left messages with trial counsel’s secretary. Furthermore, she testified that someone who identified himself as an investigator came to her home, stayed for a brief period, asked her some questions, and gave her his card and told her that he would be in touch. Bane also testified that she came to the court house on at least two occasions, but did not enter the court room, remaining in the hall outside the courtroom for a few hours, pacing back and forth. Bane offered she told Appellant’s family members that she had been speaking with Appellant on the telephone at the time of Williams’ murder.</p>

Specifically, Appellant asserts Bane’s testimony would have placed Appellant at his father’s home at or around the time of the murder. According to Appellant, it would have corroborated Appellant’s father’s trial testimony. As Appellant’s defense rested only on alibi testimony, Appellant contends the absence of Bane’s testimony undermines the confidence in the verdict. Moreover, Appellant maintains Bane testified unequivocally that she attempted to reach trial counsel on numerous occasions and in numerous ways, and trial counsel did not dispute Bane may have attempted to contact him. Appellant stresses trial counsel’s investigator testified that he had no recollection of Bane, and that trial counsel never spoke with Bane or contacted her about her alibi testimony, even though counsel’s theory was to pursue an alibi defense.</p>

Finally, Appellant objects to the PCRA court’s finding that he failed to establish that Bane was willing to testify on his behalf because she failed or refused to provide information to the investigator, remained outside the courtroom, and failed to notify trial counsel that she had information that was helpful to Appellant. According to Appellant, the failure of trial counsel and his investigator to follow up does not translate to a finding that Bane would have been unwilling to testify. Appellant argues that trial counsel’s failure to interview and call Bane as a witness was not based on reasonable trial strategy.

Moreover, the Commonwealth urges that Bane’s claim that she spoke to Appellant on the telephone at the time of Williams’ murder is undermined by the lack of any evidence that Appellant told trial counsel about the alleged telephone conversations. Specifically, the Commonwealth offers that Bane testified she reminded Appellant about their telephone conversations prior to trial, and that she and Appellant (from <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>prison) made three-way telephone calls to trial counsel to tell him of these conversations, but Appellant never testified that he informed trial counsel that Bane was an alibi witness. Moreover, the Commonwealth emphasizes that neither Appellant nor Appellant’s father mentioned Bane or the alleged telephone conversations in their trial testimony, although both testified that they were together at Appellant’s father’s house until shortly before 1:50 p.m. on the day of the murder. Finally, the Commonwealth submits Appellant never testified the alleged telephone call occurred. According to the Commonwealth, it is inconceivable the calls occurred, that Bane reminded Appellant about them before trial, but that neither Appellant nor his father testified about these conversations at trial or any time thereafter. Additionally, the Commonwealth adds that, while Bane testified that she was “like family” with Appellant’s family and that Appellant was “like my big brother,” Commonwealth’s Brief at 21 (citing N.T., 1/30/09, 19, 34), Bane did not know Appellant’s mother’s name, his sister’s name, or his father’s name.

Accordingly, the PCRA court regarded Bane’s testimony to be incredible. The PCRA court determined the testimony failed to establish that Bane was an alibi witness.

Additionally, while Bane testified that she and Appellant spoke on several occasions after his incarceration, and it was not until the second or third conversation that Bane made the connection between the time of the murder and her telephone calls with Appellant, evidently, Appellant never told trial counsel about such alibi testimony and did not testify at trial or thereafter regarding these alleged conversations. Furthermore, Bane’s testimony that she knew Appellant’s family was contradicted by her own testimony that she did not know their names, and did not know Appellant’s father’s address or the section of the city in which Appellant’s father lived.

This, according to Appellant, entitles him to a new trial. Specifically, Appellant offers Howard was one of three witnesses presented by the Commonwealth at trial. According to Appellant, all three witnesses described a shooter substantially taller, darker, and heavier than Appellant. Appellant maintains, of the three witnesses, Howard interacted with the perpetrators for an extended period of time, beginning before the assault began, and was in the closest proximity; thus, her testimony carried a weight distinct from other witnesses. Appellant notes, on the day of the crime, police questioned <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>Howard as to whether she had seen the men before and whether she recognized them from school. Howard answered these questions in the negative. Yet, two days later, as reflected in the activity sheet which is at issue in this claim, and which was prepared by detectives who interviewed Williams’ aunt and uncle, Diane and Mannasett Pugh, Howard told the Pughs that she did recognize the perpetrators from Olney High School where she and Williams were students.

According to Appellant, this information could have led to new investigative avenues and tipped the balance of reasonable doubt based solely on mistaken identification, and could have led counsel to alter his investigative strategy.

Appellant reasons the impeachment evidence is material under this standard because Howard’s testimony played a significant role at trial and she hesitated in her identification, both at the photo array and the line up. Likewise, Appellant argues that the other two eyewitnesses, who had “much more limited views,” also gave descriptions that were inconsistent with the appearance of Appellant. Appellant’s Brief at 22.

First, according to the PCRA court, Howard testified at the PCRA hearing that she did not know Appellant from Olney High School, nor had she ever seen him prior to the murder. Moreover, she did not remember Quinton being present at the time of the murder and did not know anyone named Kim. Howard testified she did not tell Diane Pugh that she knew Appellant from high school, and Diane Pugh stated at the hearing that she did not recall telling anyone that <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>Howard recognized Appellant from Olney High School.

The court opined this was especially true as the Commonwealth’s case did not rely solely on Howard’s testimony, and the court noted the Commonwealth presented two additional eyewitnesses, Thomas Bertha, who stepped in front of Appellant, but backed away when Appellant raised his gun, and James Cameron, a SEPTA cashier, who watched the shooting from close range. Both eyewitnesses identified Appellant from a photo array, a lineup, and in court. Thus, the PCRA court concluded Appellant’s claim under <em>Brady </em>failed.</p>

Specifically, as noted by the court, Howard was extensively cross-examined by defense counsel in an attempt to impeach her testimony during trial, and, as noted by the Commonwealth, this included Howard’s identification of the shooter. Importantly, and contrary to Appellant’s assertions, there were two eyewitnesses other than Howard who observed the shooting at close range. Moreover, these witnesses positively identified Appellant as the shooter in a photo array, in a line up, and at trial. The disclosure of the activity sheet would have had no impact upon these eyewitnesses’ testimony. This is especially true here, where, as we noted in <em>Dennis </em>III, these witnesses had “prolonged, unobstructed views of Appellant during and immediately after the shooting.” <em>Dennis III, </em><a href="/pa/597/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="597 Pa. 159" data-case-ids="3924369" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0159-01">597 Pa. at 167</a>, <a href="/pa/597/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="950 A.2d 945" data-case-ids="3924369,8231444" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0159-01,/a2d/950/0945-01">950 A.2d at 949</a>; <em>see also Weiss, </em><a href="/pa/604/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="604 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="4197032" data-case-paths="/pa/604/0573-01">604 Pa. at 587</a>, <a href="/pa/604/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="986 A.2d 808" data-case-ids="4197032,7292994" data-case-paths="/pa/604/0573-01,/a2d/986/0808-01">986 A.2d at 816</a> (stressing relevance of testimony of witness being “completely <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>unaffected” by disclosure of the impeachment evidence casting doubt on the reliability of other witnesses). Based upon the above, we do not find that a different result was reasonably probable with the use of the police activity sheet, and hold that Appellant still received a fair trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. Thus, we conclude that the PCRA court properly rejected Appellant’s <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>
