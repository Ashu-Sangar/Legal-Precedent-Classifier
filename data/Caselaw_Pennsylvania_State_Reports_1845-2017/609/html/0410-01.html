Indeed, appellant remarkably does not discuss <em>Lord </em>and its progeny at all. Rather, appellant focuses on the Commonwealth’s request that, because no Rule 1925(b) statement was filed, her federal counsel should be removed from continuing to represent her in state court. In the context of that rebuttal, appellant contends that counsel’s removal is unwarranted because, even though counsel never filed a Rule 1925(b) statement as ordered, counsel’s non-record conduct complied with instructions conveyed by the PCRA court’s “chambers” in a series of <em>ex parte </em>contacts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> More specifically, appellant asserts that (1) <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>her counsel, acting off-the-record and without notice to the Commonwealth, provided the PCRA court with two documents that set forth the issues to be complained of on appeal; and (2) the PCRA court’s “chambers” informed her counsel, also off-the-record, that these documents gave it sufficient notification of such issues.

First, in <em>Lord, </em>we considered whether an appellate court was authorized to deem an issue waived under Rule 1925(b), for not being raised in a Rule 1925(b) statement, in light of changes made to post-sentence motion practice. At the time <em>Lord </em>was decided, the lower courts had apparently-concluded that certain amendments made to Pa.R.Crim.P. 1410, governing post-sentencing motions, had relieved appellants in criminal cases of the obligation to set forth all of their appellate issues in Rule 1925(b) statements, when so ordered, as long as the issues not raised could be effectively reviewed from the record. This Court, however, determined otherwise, concluding that the requirements of Rule 1925(b) are mandatory and that changes to Criminal Rule 1410 had in no way modified Appellate Rule 1925(b)’s operation. Recognizing the uncertainty arising from Rule 1410, we made our clear waiver holding prospective: “[F]rom this date forward, in order to preserve their claims for appellate review, Appellants must comply whenever the trial court orders them to file a Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal pursuant to Rule 1925.

The Commonwealth’s request is premised on the remand procedure added to Rule 1925 in 2007, specifically the procedure now set forth in subsection (c)(3) of the Rule, as amended. But, as noted, amended Rule 1925 does not apply in this appeal; it is the 1988 version of Rule 1925(b) that controls. The 1988 version of Rule 1925 does not include the remand procedure the Commonwealth cites.

The notes of testimony were made available, but no Rule 1925(b) statement was ever filed. The trial court issued a Rule 1925(a) opinion, noting that it had not been made aware of any appellate issues, and then adding that the evidence was sufficient to support the first-degree murder verdict and that no errors of law had occurred at trial to justify the grant of a new trial.

The first challenged the sufficiency of the evidence for first-degree murder and the second comprised the Defender Association’s self-accusation of ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>i.e., </em>the Association alleged that it was ineffective for failing to file a final Rule 1925(b) statement.</p>

        <em>Paragraph (c)(3) </em>This paragraph allows an appellate court to remand in criminal cases only when the appellant has completely failed to respond to an order to file a Statement. It is thus narrower than (c)(2),- above. Prior to these amendments of this rule, the appeal was quashed if no timely Statement was filed or served; however, because the failure to file and serve a timely Statement is a failure to perfect the appeal, it is presumptively prejudicial and “clear” ineffectiveness. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Halley, </em><a href="/pa/582/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="582 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="650294" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0164-01">582 Pa. 164</a>, 172, <a href="/pa/582/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="870 A.2d 795" data-case-ids="650294,9019354" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0164-01,/a2d/870/0795-01">870 A.2d 795</a>, 801 (2005); <em>Commonwealth v.

Direct appeal rights have typically been restored through a post-conviction relief process, but when the ineffectiveness is apparent and per se, the court in <em>West </em>recognized that the more effective way to resolve such per se ineffectiveness is to remand for the filing of a Statement and opinion. <em>See West, </em><a href="/a2d/883/0654-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="883 A.2d 654" data-case-ids="8910086" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0654-01">883 A.2d at 657</a>. The procedure set forth in <em>West </em>is codified in paragraph (c)(3). As the <em>West </em>court recognized, this rationale does not apply when waiver occurs due to the improper filing of a Statement. In such circumstances, relief may occur only through the post-conviction relief process and only upon demonstration by the appellant that, but for the deficiency of counsel, it was reasonably probable that the appeal would have been successful. An appellant must be able to identify per se ineffectiveness to secure a remand under this section, and any appellant who is able to demonstrate per se ineffectiveness is entitled to a remand. Accordingly, this paragraph does not raise the concerns addressed in <em>Johnson v. Mississippi, </em><a href="/us/486/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="486 U.S. 578" data-case-ids="6221342" data-case-paths="/us/486/0578-01">486 U.S. 578</a>, 588-89, <a href="/us/486/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="486 U.S. 578" data-case-ids="6221342" data-case-paths="/us/486/0578-01">108 S.Ct. 1981</a>, <a href="/us/486/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="486 U.S. 578" data-case-ids="6221342" data-case-paths="/us/486/0578-01">100 L.Ed.2d 575</a> (1988) (observing that where a rule has not been consistently or regularly applied, it is not — under federal law — an adequate and independent state ground for affirming petitioner's conviction.)</blockquote>
