Specifically, we consider whether the lower courts erred in determining that the discovery rule exception did not toll the limitations period. Because, under the specific factual scenario presented here, a jury question existed as to whether the exercise of reasonable diligence could have permitted Appellants to discover their injury and its cause, we determine that summary judgment was improperly granted and, accordingly, we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.6",399,[149,1131,1152,962]]]'>This case concerns so-called “toxic mold” contamination. In 1993, a public sewer system was constructed in Moosic, Pennsylvania, by the Borough of Moosic (“the Borough”), pursuant to a written contract it executed with a construction company, M.F. Ronca &amp; Sons (“Ronca”) and an engineering firm, Michael J. Pasonick, Jr. &amp; Associates (“Pasonick”) (collectively “Appellees”). Construction of the sewer system required the demolition and rebuilding of Gleason Drive in Moosic, including that portion of the roadway adjacent to the home of Appellants, David and Leslie Gleason, and their children, Laura, Derek, and Lacie. Shortly after the roadway had been rebuilt, during a one-week period of repeated, heavy rains, Appellants’ basement flooded three times. David Gleason believed the flooding occurred because the pitch of the rebuilt roadway drained excessive rainwater onto Appellants’ property. He contacted the Borough, which installed a corrective swale that diverted most rainwater runoff away from Appellants’ residence, and the incidents of flooding ceased.</p>

She moved out in 1996 or 1997 for undisclosed reasons. In the late summer of 1997, David and Derek Gleason began to renovate <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>the basement with the intention of creating a single, open recreation room for the family. During this process, they removed all interior walls and all carpeting. Upon doing so, they noticed water-stained and moldy sheetrock along the exterior walls, discolored insulation and building studs, and black, green, and white discoloration on the underside of the wall-to-wall carpeting. Shortly after the removal of the interi- or walls and carpeting, David Gleason fell ill, and the renovation project was never completed.</p>
    <p id="b400-4" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[260,819,1153,782]]]'>Beginning in the fall of 1997, and over the course of the next several years, all members of the Gleason household were repeatedly stricken with a variety of physical ailments. Mr. Gleason experienced a chronic, hacking cough, shortness of breath, repeated vomiting, burning eyes, and fatigue. Mrs. Gleason developed uterine polyps, migraine headaches, and fungal infections on her fingernails and toenails. Derek Gleason experienced frequent, recurrent cold symptoms, and developed acne on his chest, face, and back, as well as sinus polyps that required surgical removal. Laura Gleason suffered recurrent nosebleeds and boils on her skin, and Lacie Gleason had frequent bouts of bronchitis and developed scaly, itchy skin. Each family member was treated by various physicians for their ailments during the years from 1997 to 2000.</p>

Thereafter, suspecting that their home might be contaminated with mold, Appellants retained counsel, who engaged Indoor Air Solutions, Inc. (“IAS”) to test the air quality in Appellants’ home. The test was conducted in March 2000, and IAS prepared a report, dated April 10, 2000, detailing the results. The report showed that the air throughout the home, particularly the air in the basement, was populated by fungal and bacterial organisms in counts that vastly exceeded recommended safe levels. <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>Moreover, the report noted that several of the species of organisms discovered were highly pathogenic and potentially life-threatening, and that immediate corrective action was required.

Among other things, the complaint alleged that the negligent construction of the roadway and corrective swale had caused rainwater runoff to accumulate, which had resulted in permanent moisture around the foundation of Appellants’ home that caused the formation of toxic mold. On November 27, 2007, after the pleadings had been closed and discovery was complete, the Borough filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging the following grounds for relief: 1) the Borough had no direct or vicarious liability because the roadway had been constructed by Ronca, and inspected by Pasonick, and both entities were independent contractors, not employees of the Borough; 2) the Borough had immunity under the Political Subdivisions Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8541, <em>et seq., </em>and Appellants had not shown that any exceptions to immunity applied; and 3) Appellants’ lawsuit was barred by the statute of limitations applicable to negligence actions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

On February 11, 2008, Appellants filed an answer to Ronca’s cross-motion for summary judgment, claiming that the discovery rule tolled the statute of limitations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[263,823,1149,514]]]'>On April 23, 2008, the trial court granted Appellees’ respective motions for summary judgment. The court determined that Appellants’ cause of action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations applicable to negligence actions. Appellants appealed to the Superior Court and asserted that the entry of summary judgment was improper because they had been unable, through reasonable diligence, to discover their injury and its cause until early 2000, and therefore, the applicable statute of limitations had been tolled until that time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The majority credited, and appeared to adopt, the trial court’s reasoning that Appellants knew the basement initially had flooded in 1993, and should have known of their injury and its cause by 1997, when they saw mold and discoloration and began to experience symptoms of illness during and after the aborted basement renovation. Thus, the Superior Court majority reasoned that the two-year statute of limitations applicable to tort claims required Appellants to have filed their action no later than 1999.</p>

He noted that following the initial flooding, a corrective swale had been installed and the flooding had ceased. Judge Colville also noted that David Gleason had testified that he believed the problem had been <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>solved when the swale had been installed, and that it was only-after a more recent investigation that he had learned that the swale continued to permit excess rainwater to accumulate around the foundation of the home. Judge Colville additionally noted that Appellants saw various physicians between 1997 and 2000, and Appellants were not informed by any physicians that their symptoms were or even could have been caused by, or related to, exposure to mold. In his view, summary judgment was not warranted because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Appellants, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have ascertained that the allegedly negligent construction had caused mold to form in their home and that the mold was making them ill.</p>

    <blockquote id="b407-6" data-blocks='[["BL_407.6",407,[193,1360,1109,566]]]'>The record in this case does not establish any facts that would warrant a finding on summary judgment that the Gleasons should have thought they had a basis for legal action until the toxic mold program Mr. Gleason saw on television in the year 2000. The members of the Gleason family made no connection between the 1993 basement flooding and their various health problems; nor did they make any connection between the 1997 basement renovations and their health problems. Nothing ... suggests] that the Gleasons should have been awakened to inquire sooner [than 2000].</blockquote>

Questions of fact in this regard must be submitted to the jury.</blockquote>

The factual record here included Mr. Gleason’s testimony that, unbeknownst to him, although the corrective swale installed by the Borough resolved the initial flooding, it did not prevent excess rainwater runoff from continuously seeping into the foundation of the residence. Thus, the evidence of record, viewed in the proper light, shows that Appellants were unaware that the swale permitted the foundation of their home to be exposed to permanent moisture. Whether Appellants should have acted with greater diligence to investigate the efficacy of the swale more thoroughly can only be seen as an issue of fact.</p>
    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[258,1137,1151,781]]]'>Further, although Appellants’ testimony established that they recognized moldy sheetrock, water stains and discoloration during the 1997 basement renovation, there is no evidence that any medical professional asked them if there was any mold in their environment, or suggested to them that their symptoms and ailments might be caused by or related to mold exposure. Moreover, Appellants’ testimony established that prior to the year 2000, they did not know what “toxic mold” was, nor did they suspect that the air in their house might be filled with it. Whether Appellants should have acted with greater diligence to investigate whether the physical irregularities they observed in their basement in 1997 might take microbial wing and contaminate the air throughout their home, and might be connected to their various ailments prior to 2000, must be considered an issue of fact.</p>

If no two reasonable minds could differ that the answer is yes, the discovery rule exception to the statute of limitations is not applicable, and the entry of summary judgment is appropriate. If, however, reasonable minds could differ regarding whether <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>the injury was ascertainable through the exercise of reasonable diligence during the limitations period, the entry of summary judgment based on expiration of the limitations period is inappropriate.</p>
    <p id="b409-4" data-blocks='[["BL_409.4",409,[149,562,1154,1177]]]'>Here, in a non-unanimous, 2-1 memorandum opinion, the Superior Court determined that summary judgment was appropriate because reasonable minds could not differ that Appellants’ injury and its cause had been ascertainable in 1997, and the statute of limitations had begun to run at that point. We disagree, as did Judge Colville in his dissenting memorandum opinion. Our jurisprudence has recognized that the point at which the complaining party should be reasonably aware that he or she has suffered an injury and should have identified its cause is ordinarily an issue of fact to be determined by the jury due to the fact intensive nature of the inquiry. In answer to the question accepted for appeal, it is only where the facts are so clear that reasonable minds cannot differ, that the court may determine the point at which a party should have been reasonably aware of his or her injury and its cause and thereby fix the commencement date of the limitations period as a matter of law. Here, given the disputed and somewhat complex factual scenario presented, we conclude that a jury should determine the point at which Appellants should have reasonably been aware of their injury and its cause. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Opinion.</p>
