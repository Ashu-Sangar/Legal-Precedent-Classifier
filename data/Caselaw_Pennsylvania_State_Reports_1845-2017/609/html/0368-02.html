Board’s Adjudication, dated 5/8/09, at 30-32. The Board noted that the definition of a resort, as contained in a leading trade publication, is “a hotel, usually in a suburban or isolated rural location, with special recreational amenities.” The Board found that the Valley Forge Convention Center is adjacent to Valley Forge National Park and that it has been under the control of the same ownership interests since 1994. <em>Id. </em>at 39. The Board explicitly determined that a facility featuring the specific complement of amenities set forth above, that has been in existence for at least 15 years under the same ownership, is a well-established resort hotel.</p>
    <p id="b419-3" data-blocks='[["BL_419.3",419,[146,327,1154,1205]]]'>
      <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>We cannot conclude that the Board committed legal error or acted arbitrarily in capricious disregard of the evidence simply because the applicant has historically marketed itself more as a “convention center” than as a “resort hotel.” That the Valley Forge Convention Center focused its self-promotion on its convention center attributes and did not market its resort amenities as heavily does not mean that the two aspects are mutually exclusive. They are not. Further, the long-standing existence of the Valley Forge Convention Center is not subject to question, and it cannot be gainsaid that Valley Forge Partners presented competent evidence that the Convention Center provides a complement of amenities characteristic of a resort hotel. Thus, the Board’s conclusion that the Valley Forge Convention Center is a well-established resort hotel is not arbitrary. Moreover, the record demonstrates that the Board did not capriciously disregard Greenwood’s evidence. Instead, the record shows that the Board appropriately weighed competing evidence and found in favor of the applicant. That the applicant’s marketplace branding strategy does not employ the word “resort” is not determinative of the legality or reasonableness of the Board’s decision to award it a Category 3 slot machine license, and we thus determine that Greenwood’s first issue does not merit relief.</p>
    <p id="b419-4" data-blocks='[["BL_419.4",419,[142,1572,1155,625]]]'>Greenwood’s second and third issues challenge the Board’s determination that Valley Forge Partners is the owner of the Convention Center. At the time of application, the owner of the Convention Center was Valley Forge Colonial, L.P. (“Colonial”). Valley Forge Partners subsequently arranged a merger of Colonial into Valley Forge Partners, and signed an agreement of sale to purchase the Convention Center from Colonial. These transactions occurred because some of the limited partners in Colonial did not want to be part of the slot machine venture. The principal partner in control of both entities (Valley Forge Partners and Colonial) was the same person, Ira Lubert.</p>

At the insistence of <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>the Board, however, the parties to the agreement of sale waived this condition. The Board concluded that even though title to the Convention Center had not passed to Valley Forge Partners by the time the license was approved, Valley Forge Partners was the owner of the Convention Center under the doctrine of equitable conversion, which provides that an unconditional agreement of sale vests equitable ownership in the purchaser. Additionally, the Board determined that, “consistent with its past practice of allowing applicants in this nascent industry in the Commonwealth to amend their application when deficiencies, including eligibility deficiencies, are noted,” Valley Forge Partners’ equitable ownership was retroactive to its application date of June 27, 2007. Board’s Adjudication at 36.</p>
    <p id="b420-4" data-blocks='[["BL_420.4",420,[257,1089,1153,1277]]]'>Pennsylvania jurisprudence has long recognized that during the interval between the execution of a real estate sales agreement and the conveyance of title, the purchaser of the real estate is considered the equitable owner of the real estate. <em>Allardice v. McCain, </em><a href="/pa/375/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="375 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="1244359" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0528-01">375 Pa. 528</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20385" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="101 A.2d 385">101 A.2d 385</a>, 389 (1953). Greenwood takes no serious issue with the law of equitable ownership. Instead, it argues that where satisfaction of a condition precedent to performance under an agreement of sale is under the control of a third party, equitable ownership cannot vest. Appellant’s Brief at 18. Specifically, it contends that Valley Forge Partners is not the owner of the Convention Center because, despite its waiver of the license condition, the record shows that, in fact, the agreement of sale and the merger agreement are contingent upon license approval by the Board. The gravamen of Greenwood’s argument is that even though Valley Forge Partners expressly waived license approval as a condition precedent to closing under Article 6 of the agreement (Conditions) and under Article 10.22 of the agreement (Purchaser’s Approvals Contingency), no express waiver was included in Article 7 of the agreement (Closing). Thus, Greenwood argues the condition precedent remains in place, and that the Board committed an error of law in concluding Valley Forge Partners is the owner of the Valley Forge Convention Center.</p>

      <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>Article 7 of the sales agreement chiefly addresses the timing of closing. Article 7.1(a) states that “[t]he closing shall occur on a date agreed to by Seller and Purchaser which date shall be promptly after Purchaser’s receipt of the Approvals.” Agreement, Article 7.1(a). Article 7.1(b) requires that closing was to occur by December 31, 2010, and if it did not, the Seller has the right to terminate the agreement whether or not the Purchaser has obtained all of the approvals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Moreover, the agreement of sale provides for a penalty of $1,375,000 that Valley Forge Partners must pay to Colonial should Colonial terminate the agreement if closing did not occur by the specified date. In view of this deadline and the significant penalty for failing to close, the Board stated, “it can hardly be said that closure of the transaction after awarding a Category 3 license is a <em>defacto </em>condition precedent.” Board’s Adjudication at 35.</p>
    <p id="b421-4" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[141,1208,1152,635]]]'>We agree with the Board’s determination that license approval was not a condition precedent here. Rather, license approval was expressly waived by the parties to the sales agreement, and the provision that Greenwood characterizes as a condition precedent is actually an expression that the transaction must close by a date certain, with or without a Category 3 slot machine license. The Board committed no error of law in determining that equitable ownership of the Convention Center was in Valley Forge Partners as purchasers under an unconditional agreement of sale, and that Valley Forge Partners’ equitable ownership was retroactive to the date of the Category 3 slot machine license application.</p>

It is more than suitable for many things and with many features justifying its obvious success — indeed, until very recently, our Court’s Bar Examiners held the bar exam at the Convention Center. It is many things, but it simply is not a resort. It is enclosed by the turnpike and major arteries, surrounded by apartment complexes, office parks, and sprawling shopping malls. The area is overrun with traffic, and the center is populated by conventioneers with nametags meeting in the commodious rooms built for the purpose of conventioneering. It is a wonderful and centrally located convention center and attracts visitors by the busload. I do not know why the statute created a license issuable only to a well-established resort instead of a convention center, but it did, <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>and we should not perpetuate the deceit of calling this facility something it is not.</p>

You can point to its size, its aquatic lifestyle and its diet, its bill and its cry, its feathery wings and its webbed feet. There are similarities to be sure, but at the end of the day, it is still a duck. No matter what the Board here tried to shoehorn into the term, we know a duck when we see one, and for better or worse, the Convention Center is a duck, not a goose.</p>

First, a newly-created partnership, Valley Forge Convention Center Partners, L.P., is actually the one seeking license approval, not the previous 15-year owner. <em>See </em>Majority Op., at 377, 15 A.3d at 889. Further, the sales agreement between Valley Forge Convention Center Partners, L.P. and the former owner, Colonial, contained a condition precedent that the sale would not be consummated if Valley Forge Convention Center Partners, L.P. did not receive license approval. However, at the Board’s insistence, the parties waived this condition. This further evidences Valley Forge Convention Center Partners, L.P. was the owner of the Convention Center merely from the date of its license application, and not for 15 years, as the Board and majority surmise. <em>See id., </em>at 376-79, 15 A.3d at 889-90 (citing Board's Adjudication, at 36 (Valley Forge Convention Center Partners, L.P.’s "equitable ownership through <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>equitable conversion should be applied retroactive to the ... application date ... ”)).</p>
