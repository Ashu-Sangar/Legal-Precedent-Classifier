The issue, as stated by Petitioner, is:\nDid the Superior Court abuse its discretion when it upheld Petitioner\u2019s adjudication of delinquency for having violated 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4914\u2019s ban on lying to police officers about identity, notwithstanding the lack of proof that the plainclothes police officers identified themselves as police and announced that they were conducting an official investigation, based on the conclusion that the proof of either element was unnecessary when the detainee knows he is dealing with the police and that they are conducting an official investigation?\nMadame Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.",
