        "text": "OPINION IN SUPPORT OF PER CURIAM ORDER\njustice McCaffery.\nIn 2008, Appellee, Lawrence Farnese, Jr., then a candidate for state senator, filed a nomination petition to be on the Democratic Party\u2019s primary election ballot. Pursuant to 25 P.S. \u00a7 2872.1(13), a nomination petition for that office must contain at least 500 signatures, and Appellee\u2019s petition contained 1778 signatures. When the validity of the signatures was challenged on a number of grounds in the Commonwealth Court, Appellee withdrew 934 signatures on the advice of counsel, who agreed that the withdrawn signatures were invalid because they had not been procured in the actual presence of the circulators of the signature pages. During the course of litigation, Appellee stipulated that an additional 143 signatures were invalid. Ultimately, the Commonwealth Court denied the petition of objectors, Appellants Keith 01-kowski and Theresa A. Paylor, to set aside Appellee\u2019s nomination petition, and they appealed to this Court.\nOn April 8, 2008, we entered a per curiam order on an expedited basis permitting Appellee to remain on the primary election ballot. In re Nomination Petition of Farnese, 605 Pa. 375, 989 A.2d 1274 (2008) (Farnese I). We entered the order despite our concerns that Appellee had submitted and then withdrawn or stipulated to the invalidity of the majority of the signatures contained in his nomination petition. In our per curiam order, we stated that an opinion would follow, and this opinion now addresses Appellants\u2019 issues on appeal, and expresses our concern that a candidate for office should not be permitted to submit a nomination petition that contains mostly illegitimate signatures without doubt being cast upon the propriety of the candidate\u2019s entire signature procurement process.\nAs a matter of election law procedure, each circulator of a signature page contained in a candidate\u2019s nomination petition must attach a separate affidavit declaring, among other things, that the signers thereto actually personally signed the petition with full knowledge of the contents of the petition. This Court has held that in order to verify this information, the circulator needs to be present when each signer agrees to sign the petition. In re Nomination Petition of Flaherty, 564 Pa. 671, 770 A.2d 327, 336 (2001).\nIn this matter, Appellants sought to establish pervasive fraud in the circulators\u2019 procurement of signatures on the nomination petition for Appellee. At the hearing on their petition to set aside the nomination petition, Appellants sought to admit into evidence a report prepared by a private detective that contained affidavits from persons whose signatures had been procured or purportedly procured by the persons circulating the signature pages. Some of the signers affirmed that the circulator of the petition had indicated to them that the petition was to upgrade a neighborhood playground. Other signers affirmed that the circulator had indicated to them that the candidate was an African American, and that the circulator had shown them a photo of an African American male who was supposedly that person. Other purported signers affirmed that the signature contained on the signature page was not their signature. Other signers affirmed that the circulator had told them it was permissible to sign the names of others in their household who were not home at the time, and that the signers did, in fact, sign for those absent household members based on that representation. The court ruled that the report of the detective was inadmissible because \u201callegations of a pattern of fraud are immaterial in a case involving objections to nomination papers and that such allegations will be disregarded.\u201d In re Nomination of Farnese, 945 A.2d 274, 278 n. 10 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008) (Farnese II).\nAdditionally, Appellee filed a motion in limine to preclude Appellants from presenting any evidence relating to the twenty-two signature pages that Appellee had withdrawn. Conversely, Appellants sought to present evidence of the withdrawn pages in support of their claims of fraud, because the circulators of many of the withdrawn pages were also the circulators of the non-withdrawn pages to which individual signature challenges were being raised. Indeed, Appellants raised a \u201cglobal\u201d challenge and asked the court to dismiss all remaining pages of signatures procured by any circulator of a withdrawn page. In support of this request, Appellants sought to call the circulators as witnesses to probe their awareness of, and adherence to, the elements of Section 909 of the Election Code as affirmed in their circulator affidavits attached to the pages of signatures. The court disallowed this proposed area of inquiry, and ultimately ruled that any evidence relating to the withdrawn pages would have been irrelevant to whether the circulator affidavits or signatures on the non-withdrawn pages were valid. Farnese II, supra at 278.\nIn the end, Appellants conceded they could not prevail if the court rejected their \u201cglobal\u201d challenge, i.e., Appellants conceded that if the court would not invalidate the remaining non-withdrawn signature pages that had been procured by the same circulators who had procured the withdrawn pages, Appellee would then have had 539 presumptively valid individual signatures. To state it another way, Appellants conceded that even if they won each of their remaining challenges unrelated to the propriety of the circulator affidavits attached to the signature pages, Appellee would still have had a sufficient number of presumptively valid signatures to remain on the ballot.\nIn this appeal, Appellants raise the following questions that we have paraphrased for the sake of brevity and clarity, and will address together:\n1. Did the Commonwealth Court err in ruling that evidence of an alleged pattern of fraud was irrelevant to the proceedings to set aside the nomination petition?\n2. Did the Commonwealth Court err in ruling that evidence regarding the circulators\u2019 procurement of the withdrawn signatures could not be used to invalidate the non-withdrawn signatures procured by them?\nFirst, and foremost, we must disagree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s assessment here that allegations of a pattern of fraud are immaterial in a case involving objections to a nomination petition. Significantly, in In re Nomination Petition of Nader, 865 A.2d 8 (Pa.Cmwlth.2004), on remand from this Court, a number of judges of the Commonwealth Court, sitting as fact-finders, conducted an extraordinary review of more than 50,000 signatures contained in the nomination petition of a candidate for President of the United States who sought to appear on the Pennsylvania ballot. The Commonwealth Court judges not only considered allegations of fraud, but actually found widespread fraud, and set aside the petition upon determining that it contained an insufficient number of legitimate signatures. Id. at 19. In that case, testimonial evidence was presented that showed how the circulators of the signature pages fraudulently procured, falsified, forged, and failed to authenticate signatures. Id. at 16. Among many other things, the court specifically found \u201cthat the campaign had knowledge that false signatures were submitted on the nomination papers.\u201d Id. at 14. Given the gross irregularities in the procurement of signatures, the court felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to offer the following observation:\n... this signature gathering process was the most deceitful and fraudulent exercise ever perpetrated upon this Court. The conduct of the Candidates, through their representatives (not their attorneys), shocks the conscience of the Court. In reviewing signatures, it became apparent that in addition to signing names such as \u201cMickey Mouse,\u201d \u201cFred Flintstone,\u201d \u201cJohn Kerry,\u201d and the ubiquitous \u201cRalph Nader,\u201d there were thousands of names that were created at random and then randomly assigned either existent or nonexistent addresses by the circulators.\nId. at 19 (aff'd, In re Nomination Paper of Nader, 580 Pa. 134, 860 A.2d 1 (2004), cert. denied, Nader v. Serody, 543 U.S. 1052, 125 S.Ct. 884, 160 L.Ed.2d 773 (2005)).\nWhere, as here, a candidate for office has agreed that 60.5 % of the signatures contained in his nomination petition are invalid, and the objectors to the petition have asserted fraud in the signature procurement process and are prepared to support those allegations with evidence, we cannot say, in light of Nader, supra, that the evidence would be immaterial to the disposition of the petition. Significantly, there is precedent from this Court to support the proposition that evidence regarding the procurement process is a legitimate factual inquiry, and that the existence of a large number of signature irregularities on a signature page may raise a reasonable inference that the circulator\u2019s affidavit attesting to the legitimacy of the signatures is false. Citizen\u2019s Com. to Recall Rizzo v. Bd. of Elections, et al, 470 Pa. 1, 367 A.2d 232, 241 (1976). The form of nominating petitions and their accompanying affidavits are not mere technicalities, but are necessary measures to prevent fraud and to preserve the integrity of the election process. In re Nomination Petition of Cianfrani, 467 Pa. 491, 359 A.2d 383, 384 (1976). The policy of liberally reading the Election Code cannot be distorted to emasculate the requirements of providing legitimate sworn affidavits. Id. Any falsity in an affidavit casts doubt on the accuracy of the entire affidavit, and, thus, the authenticity of the petition. Citizen\u2019s Com. to Recall Rizzo, supra at 241.\nWhile prudent candidates for office routinely procure more signatures on their nomination petitions than the number of signatures required by the Election Code, a candidate\u2019s agreement that 60.5 % of the signatures that he or she procured are invalid should raise red flags for any court evaluating the process by which any and all of the signatures were procured. Our observation of this troubling circumstance in the instant matter leads to the truly dispositive question here: whether the Commonwealth Court properly denied Appellants\u2019 request to invalidate the signatures that Appellee had not withdrawn on the basis that the signature petitions on which they appeared had been circulated by the same persons who circulated the petitions that Appellee had withdrawn.\nOn April 18, 2008, ten days after we entered the per curiam order in this case, we also entered a plurality per curiam order in a case that presented similar facts. In In re Payton, 596 Pa. 469, 945 A.2d 162 (2008), this Court, sitting with six members, entered a per curiam order stating that a court cannot presumptively invalidate nomination signatures based on nothing more than the invalidity of other signatures obtained by the same circulator. Justice Saylor filed a Concurring Statement, joined by Justice Todd and this writer, that began as follows: \u201cThe majority appears to interpret Section 976 of the Election Code, 25 P.S. \u00a7 2936, as establishing a broad-based principle foreclosing judicial inquiries into allegations of pervasive fraud in the submission of a nomination petition beyond a signature-by-signature review.\u201d Justice Saylor, Justice Todd and this writer disagreed with that interpretation, and observed that this Court has accepted the notion that the inclusion of intentionally false information in a candidate\u2019s affidavit is grounds for invalidating a nomination petition. Id. (Saylor, J. concurring) (citing In re Driscoll, 577 Pa. 501, 847 A.2d 44, 51 (2004)). Justice Saylor further observed that in his opinion, \u201cthe collection by the candidate himself of a substantial number of fraudulent signatures, as has been alleged here, including those of deceased individuals, would be strong circumstantial evidence of willful non-compliance with election law and false certification.\u201d Id. Justice Todd and I agreed with Justice Saylor.\nJustice Saylor, with whom Justice Todd and this writer agreed, went on to state his disagreement with the utilization of \u201ca brief per curiam Order to signal this Court\u2019s intention to undermine the viability of election challenges entailing allegations of pervasive fraud claimed to have been known to the candidate.\u201d Id. Justices Saylor and Todd and this writer ultimately joined the disposition, but only in light of the fact that a specific challenge to the candidate\u2019s affidavit and allegations of knowledge of fraud on his part, were not initially raised in the objectors\u2019 petition to set aside, and in view of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s credibility determination concerning the candidate\u2019s testimony. Id.\nHere, although Appellants\u2019 brief to this Court includes numerous allegations that the tactics of the circulators to procure the allegedly illegitimate signatures were known to the candidate and the campaign manager, Appellants did not make this specific objection in their petition to set aside the nomination petition. Although the candidate himself was the circulator of six separate signature pages, none of those pages was withdrawn, and none of the signatures on those pages was stipulated to as invalid. Additionally, the rationale proposed by Appellants for the striking of signatures contained on the non-withdrawn pages procured by the circulators of the withdrawn pages conceded that a number of valid signatures would be stricken for the sake of punishing the fraud committed by the circulators. The Commonwealth Court found this proposed remedy troubling, and opined, \u201cHere, if we would have adopted Objectors\u2019 position, we would have stricken admittedly valid signatures on one page based on a defective Circulator Affidavit on another page.\u201d Farnese II, supra at 278 (emphasis omitted).\nSignificantly, the case law of this Commonwealth that can be read to support the proposition that a false affidavit contained in a nomination petition may be egregious enough to void the petition altogether and remove the candidate from the ballot, applies to intentional and knowing falsehoods affirmed by the candidate personally that are designed to deceive the electorate. See In re Nomination of Driscoll, 577 Pa. 501, 847 A.2d 44, 51 (2004) (stating \u201cbefore an affidavit may be declared void and invalid because it contains false information, there must be evidence that the candidate knowingly falsified the affidavit with an intent to deceive the electorate.\u201d) (emphasis added). Accordingly, we now hold that allegations and evidence of fraud may be material to the determination of the validity of a nomination petition. Nevertheless, we reject Appellants\u2019 second issue on appeal, as there was no specific allegation made, or evidence proffered, that the candidate himself affirmed in his petition any intentional and knowing falsehoods designed to deceive the electorate. The denial of Appellants\u2019 petition to set aside the nomination petition of Appellee is affirmed.\nJustice GREENSPAN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustice TODD joins the Opinion in Support of Per Curiam Order.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion in which Justice BAER joins.\n. Our order affirmed the Commonwealth Court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 petition to set aside Appellee\u2019s nomination petition, without prejudice to Appellants\u2019 right to seek review of any future final order imposing costs. We remanded with directions for the Commonwealth Court to explain its rationale if it chose to impose costs. On remand, the court imposed costs and Appellants filed an appeal from the imposition of costs at No. 13 EAP 2008. We reversed on the basis that the facts did not support a finding that an award of costs was just. In re Nomination Petition of Farnese, 17 A.3d. 357 (Pa.2010) (Farnese III).\n. Section 909 of the Election Code requires that each signature sheet shall have appended thereto the affidavit of the circulator of each sheet, and this Court has recognized that the language in Section 909, 25 P.S. \u00a7 2869, unambiguously requires that the circulator affirming the petition be aware of five criteria about each individual signer: (1) the signer signed the petition with full knowledge of its contents; (2) the signer\u2019s address is correct; (3) the signer resides in the county in the affidavit; (4) the signer signed the petition on the date set forth; and (5) to the best of the circulator's knowledge and belief, the signer was a qualified elector and a member of the party claimed on the petition. In re Nomination Petition of Flaherty, 564 Pa. 671, 770 A.2d 327, 336 (2001).\n. Although the report was not admitted as substantive evidence, it is of record. The court admitted the report \"to make the record ... because we have not had testimony in certain areas, [so] that the Supreme Court knows that [Appellants have] not waived those issues and that they\u2019re preserved for that purpose and that purpose alone.\u201d Notes of Testimony (\"N.T.\u201d), Hearing, 3/7/08, at 67-68.\n. Appellants maintained that 324 of the 701 signatures remaining after Appellee\u2019s stipulations and withdrawals (1778 - 934 - 143 = 701) were invalid, and that 162 of those 324 signatures were invalid for reasons other than that the circulator of the signature page had also circulated a signature page that had been withdrawn. Thus, given the court's ruling, even if Appellants had prevailed on each of those unrelated challenges, Appellee still would have had a requisite number of signatures (701 - 162 = 539). We note that the Commonwealth Court calculated the total number of remaining presumptively valid signatures using a different formula and arrived at the number of 532. The difference is immaterial, as both resulting totals are greater than the amount necessary to support the petition, and Appellants conceded they could not prevail under the circumstances.\n. Although the main holding in the case, that the recall provisions in the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter are unconstitutional, represented a plurality of the Court, the proposition cited here commanded a majority view.\n. Counsel for Appellants argued at the hearing \"I just want to note that part of our argument [is] the broad public policy ... that this kind of conduct has got to stop, and the only way I know how to stop it is a court ruling penalizing circulators who provide bad affidavits from then being rewarded with other petitions where arguably they are good.\u201d N.T., supra at 33 (emphasis added).\n. The Chief Justice states in his concurring opinion that we stray significantly from the parties' arguments, and suggests that the objectors here presented a \"single narrow theory.\u201d (Castille, C.J., concurring, Op. at 592-93, 17 A.3d at 387). The \u201cnarrow\" question posed, as we see it, is whether the non-withdrawn pages could be invalidated on a broader \"false-in-one-false-in-aH\u201d theory. Appellants had hoped to support their \"false-in-one-false-in-all\" theory by presenting evidence of a pervasive pattern of fraud on the part of the circulators. On the basis that any and all allegations of fraud are irrelevant in determining the propriety of nomination petitions, the trial court did not permit this evidence, or any evidence regarding the circulators' conduct or knowledge of the Election Code, and one of the central allegations on appeal is that the court erred in this ruling. In our discussion of the issues, we do not make any presumption of fraudulent conduct with respect to the withdrawn signatures. Instead, among other things, we point out that at the time the trial court made its ruling, Pennsylvania law clearly supported the proposition that a candidate's fraudulent conduct may nullify a nomination petition, a proposition reiterated by the concurring Opinion in In Re Payton, which was decided by an evenly divided Court ten days after our per curiam order in the present matter. There were serious allegations in this matter concerning the alleged improper conduct of the circulators in procuring signatures for the candidate's nomination petition. The point we make is that had the allegations been more squarely tied to facts tending to show the candidate\u2019s awareness and acceptance of these irregularities, the evidence would have been relevant to the important question of whether the electorate had been deceived and whether the candidate should be on the ballot.",

        "text": "Chief Justice CASTILLE,\nconcurring.\nThis case was decided on April 8, 2008, by per curiam order, with a notation that an opinion would follow. I write separately primarily to explain my own reasons for supporting our prior order because they differ from the expression and focus of the Opinion in Support of Per Curiam Order (\u201cOIS\u201d); and I write because I respectfully disagree with several aspects of Mr. Justice McCaffery\u2019s expression.\nI.\nWe issue \u201copinion to follow\u201d mandates very rarely, generally in matters where an immediate decision is required, where there is insufficient time to fashion a precedential expression, and where the issue is important enough, or difficult enough, that the Court realizes that an explanation of the original mandate is a wise course. Election appeals, and other emergency filings where swift action is required, are the most common situations where this practice is employed. I have previously addressed some of the difficulties that are unique to the expedited decisions that issue in election appeals, and have encouraged efficiencies in the courts below to ensure a better prospect for reasoned, timely decisions. See In re Fitzpatrick, 573 Pa. 514, 827 A.2d 375, 377-84 (2003) (Castille, J., dissenting, joined by Nigro and Eakin, JJ.). Accord In re Stevenson, 12 A.3d 273 (Pa.2010) (per curiam).\nThere are inherent complications in the \u201copinion to follow\u201d scenario. First, Justices may agree on the decisional mandate but for different reasons, making it more difficult to fashion a later majority expression in support of the already-rendered order. See, e.g., In re Paulmier, 594 Pa. 433, 937 A.2d 364, 377 (2007) (Saylor, J., concurring) (noting that Justice Saylor\u2019s joinder in per curiam order in Paulmier case, which preceded explanatory opinion, was premised on different grounds than outlined in majority opinion and was consistent with reasoned expression in concurrence). Second, further research, intervening cases, and the give and take inherent in the fashioning of a precedential expression may reveal or uncover complications not fully perceived at the time the per curiam mandate issued. Indeed, it is fair to say that the Paulmier opinion reflects an instance where the Court\u2019s deliberation following the per curiam mandate led us in a direction that was not fully perceived when the mandate issued. And finally, in election cases where the ruling below allows the candidate to remain on the ballot and the issue is novel or difficult, there is a natural imperative favoring the least disruptive mandate, which is affirmance in direct appeals or inaction in discretionary appeals. See Fitzpatrick, 827 A.2d at 384 (Castille, J., dissenting, joined by Nigro and Eakin, JJ.). See also id. at 375-77 (Lamb, J., concurring).\nWith these realities borne of experience in mind, I respectfully cannot join Justice McCaffery\u2019s present explanation of our April 2008 mandate. As noted, I write first to explain the distinct reasons why I supported and continue to support affirmance of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision in this case, and second, to address briefly specific concerns regarding the OIS reasoning.\nII.\nOn February 11, 2008, objectors Keith Olkowski and Theresa A. Paylor filed an action in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court to set aside candidate Lawrence M. Farnese, Jr.\u2019s nomination petition pursuant to Section 977 of the Election Code, 25 P.S. \u00a7 2937. The objectors claimed \u201cat most 278\u201d of the 1,778 signatures submitted by the candidate were valid and, as a result, the candidate failed to meet the statutory requirement of 500 valid signatures for appearing on the ballot. 25 P.S. \u00a7 2872.1(13). According to the objectors, (1) individual signatures had to be stricken because they were invalid on various grounds; (2) pages of signatures had to be stricken because they contained false or invalid circulator affidavits and notarization; and (3) other pages of signatures not suffering from the first two defects had to be stricken because they were gathered by circulators who had submitted invalid affidavits on other pages, or were notarized by a notary who had falsely notarized other pages. The third argument was premised on the trial court accepting a novel \u201cpattern of fraud\u201d or \u201cfalse-in-one, false-in-all\u201d theory. Finally, in the alternative, the objectors suggested that the entire nomination petition had to be stricken on the ground of \u201cpervasive fraud.\u201d\nAfter receiving the objectors\u2019 petition, the Commonwealth Court, per the Honorable Rochelle S. Friedman, issued an expedited case management order and set a deadline extended to March 5, 2008, for submitting stipulations, expert reports, and witness lists. On March 5 and 6, 2008, the parties informed the court that the candidate had withdrawn twenty-two signature pages (for a total of 934 signatures) and that the objectors had abandoned two full-page challenges. Via the same filings, the parties stipulated to the validity or invalidity of additional signatures. At the same time, the objectors purported to \u201creserve the right to use\u201d the withdrawn pages as evidence to challenge other individual pages and the entire nomination petition.\nTo explain the purported reservation of right, the objectors essentially made a \u201cpattern of fraud\u201d or \u201cfalse-in-one, false-in-all\u201d argument and asked the court to strike as invalid every signature page submitted by any circulator who had a page voluntarily withdrawn by the candidate. Similarly, the objectors argued that all the signature pages notarized by Jonathan J. Oriole had to be stricken because Mr. Oriole had falsely notarized a withdrawn page (page 33). Finally, the objectors expressed their intention to call circulators of withdrawn pages as witnesses at the March 7, 2008, hearing. According to the objectors, the circulators would be examined to reveal whether they \u201clied under oath\u201d and also regarding \u201ctheir understanding of the basic criteria of their oath and obligations as a circulator as defined by [Section] 909 of the Election Code[, 25 P.S. \u00a7 2869].\u201d The objectors argued that if the circulator did not understand or follow the legal criteria, s/he lied under oath and all of that circulator\u2019s affidavits (and signature pages) had to be stricken as invalid. In response, the candidate filed motions in limine to preclude the objectors from introducing any withdrawn signature pages into evidence, and from calling individual circulators as witnesses to impeach their credibility regarding the circulator affidavit oaths on non-withdrawn signature pages.\nDuring the hearing, the objectors conceded that the success of their challenge to the candidate\u2019s nomination petition depended solely on a favorable ruling by Judge Friedman regarding the candidate\u2019s motions in limine and, implicitly, her acceptance of the objectors\u2019 \u201cpattern of fraud\u201d or \u201cfalse-in-one, false-in-all\u201d theory. The objectors relied on their pattern of fraud challenge to strike the candidate\u2019s name from the ballot, as they otherwise lacked sufficient individual signature objections. Judge Friedman entertained argument on the objectors\u2019 theory and then granted the candidate\u2019s motions in limine, thus precluding evidence or questioning relating to the withdrawn pages, whether offered as direct proof or for impeachment purposes. According to the court\u2019s later opinion, the objectors\u2019 evidence relating to the withdrawn pages was \u201cirrelevant to whether the [cjirculator [affidavits or signatures on the non-withdrawn pages were valid\u201d and was, for that reason, inadmissible to prove that the candidate lacked sufficient valid signatures. In re Nomination Petition of Farnese, 945 A.2d 274, 277-79 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008).\nThe court\u2019s explanation of its ruling was solidly grounded in existing law. The court explained that it rejected the objectors\u2019 evidence proffer because the underlying theory on which it was based \u2014 the \u201cpattern of fraud\u201d or \u201cfalse-in-one, false-in-all\u201d argument \u2014 had no support in the Election Code or case-law. Indeed, the court noted that the Election Code required each signature page to be considered individually, while case-law suggested that a circulator affidavit could at the same time be false with respect to one or even a significant percentage (e.g., 20%) of signatures but true with respect to the remaining signatures on the same page. Thus, the court reasoned, \u201cadmittedly valid signatures on one page\u201d could not be stricken \u201cbased on a defective [circulator [affidavit on another page.\u201d Id. (citing 25 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2936, 2869, In re Pittsburgh Home Rule Charter, 694 A.2d 1128 (Pa.Cmwlth.1997), and In re Nomination Petition of Flaherty, 564 Pa. 671, 770 A.2d 327 (2001)). In a brief footnote, the court also offered that \u201c[t]o the extent [o]bjectors argue that the circulators of the withdrawn pages appear to have engaged in fraud,\u201d the law is well-established that \u201callegations of a pattern of fraud\u201d are immaterial in the consideration of whether to strike the candidate\u2019s nomination papers. Farnese, 945 A.2d at 278 n. 10 (citing In re Nomination Paper of Rogers, 908 A.2d 942, 947 (Pa.Cmwlth.2006), in which the court concluded that \u201c[mjere allegations of patterns of fraud are insufficient to strike a nomination paper\u201d and \u201c[tjo the extent that the [ojbjectors allege patterns of fraud in the collection of signatures, these allegations are immaterial\u201d).\nFurther, the court explained that it rejected the objectors\u2019 request to use the withdrawn pages for impeaching the credibility of potential witnesses, i.e., circulators of both withdrawn and non-withdrawn pages, because, inter alia, \u201cit would have been improper for [ojbjectors to use a witness\u2019s alleged bad act with respect to a withdrawn page to prove that the witness acted in the same manner with respect to a non-withdrawn page.\u201d Id. at 278 (citing, inter alia, Pa.R.E. 404(b)(1) (evidence of bad acts is not admissible to prove character of person in order to show action in conformity with those bad acts)). Ultimately, the court denied the petition to set aside the candidate\u2019s nomination petition on the basis of the objectors\u2019 concession that they could not prevail without a favorable ruling by the court on the \u201cfalse-in-one, false-in-aU\u201d theory and the admissibility of evidence regarding the withdrawn pages in support of that theory. Id. at 278-79.\nOn appeal to this Court, the objectors posed two questions:\n1. Did Judge Friedman err in not dismissing all Nominating Petition [sic] of circulators and striking the Nomination Petition of Mr. Farnese from the primary election ballot when the circulators had submitted many Nominating Petitions with false and fraudulent Circulators\u2019 Affidavits and false signatures, which when challenged were withdrawn? Did Judge Friedman err in not allowing [objectors\u2019 lawyer] to present any evidence demonstrating a serious pattern of fraud and false Affidavits by the same circulators and not strike all the Nominating Petitions? Should all of the Nominating Petitions have been stricken due to the false notary, the extensive pattern of fraud and the false Affidavits, particularly when done with the knowledge and consent of the candidate and campaign manager?\n2. Did Judge Friedman err in not allowing [objectors\u2019 lawyer] to present and question all the circulators on the false and withdrawn Nominating Petitions and further question them on their knowledge of the criteria and requirements of a Circulator\u2019s circulation and Affidavit?\nAlthough the questions are argumentative and conflated, they are essentially restatements of the objectors\u2019 position below: ie., the objectors challenge the Commonwealth Court\u2019s specific evidentiary rulings and its rejection of the \u201cpattern of fraud\u201d or \u201cfalse-in-one, false-in-all\u201d theory upon which their evidentiary proffer was made.\nIn my view, the objectors\u2019 claims properly failed for several reasons. First, when this appeal was decided, this Court had not embraced any form of the objectors\u2019 \u201cpattern of fraud\u201d or \u201cfalse-in-one, false-in-all\u201d theory of challenge to nomination petitions. Moreover, the lower court\u2019s decision was supported by existing caselaw and the Election Code, and the objectors\u2019 briefing in this Court was conclusory and largely unresponsive to the lower court\u2019s explanation of the reasons for its decision. Objectors\u2019 argument was long on theory, but short on authority, and marshaled nothing that suggested error in the decision below. Acceptance of the objectors\u2019 evidentiary arguments would have represented a significant departure from existing authority in this area of law, without a sufficiently convincing argument to support that departure.\nSecond, adoption and retroactive application of the objectors\u2019 novel \u201cpattern of fraud\u201d or \u201cfalse-in-one, false-in-all\u201d theory to this case would have been extremely disruptive and unfair. Assuming the objectors could make out their case upon remand, the consequence would have been to strike the candidate from the ballot. But, there was nothing in the governing statute or existing caselaw to put political candidates on notice that otherwise valid signatures, and an otherwise valid nomination petition, could be stricken, and the candidate removed from the ballot, premised on the objectors\u2019 extrapolation theory. Candidates for office in Pennsylvania commonly collect signatures well in excess of the minimum required, recognizing that some signatures may be invalid, precisely in the hope of avoiding challenges. See, e.g., In re Nomination Petition of Morrison-Wesley, 946 A.2d 789 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008) (candidate filed approximately 2,000 signatures where 1,000 were required); In re Petition to Set Aside Nomination of Fitzpatrick, 822 A.2d 867 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003) (candidate filed approximately 1,500 signatures where 750 were required). Those candidates had no reason to believe their protective action could prove fatal to their candidacies. Even if it is assumed that the objectors\u2019 theory had logical or equitable merit \u2014 as the objectors essentially claimed in the absence of authority \u2014 and warranted an adjustment to the existing decisional law, there was good reason to apply that new rule or construction prospectively; thus, the appropriate mandate still was affirmance here.\nFinally, our time for consideration was constrained, as in all election cases, and the governing presumption is in favor of ballot access. See Flaherty, 770 A.2d at 331 (\u201cWhere the court is not convinced that challenged signatures are other than genuine, the challenge is to be resolved in favor of the candidate.\u201d); Petition of Cioppa, 533 Pa. 564, 626 A.2d 146, 148 (1993) (Election Code \u201cliberally construed so as not to deprive a candidate of the right to run for office or the voters of their right to elect a candidate of their choice.\u201d). In view of all these factors, the objectors\u2019 theory, however creative and novel, did not make a strong case for overturning the decision below, and indeed, our affirmance was unanimous.\nIII.\nThe OIS goes much farther than the analysis above, appearing to approve a form of the objectors\u2019 \u201cpattern of fraud\u201d theory, but as described in Mr. Justice Saylor\u2019s Concurring Statement in In re Payton, 596 Pa. 469, 945 A.2d 162 (2008), a case decided after our per curiam mandate issued in the case sub judice. According to the OIS, a nomination petition may be stricken if it contains a sufficiently egregious false affidavit, and if the candidate personally affirmed intentional and knowing falsehoods designed to deceive the electorate. But, in the OIS, Justice McCaffery ultimately concludes that the theory it describes is of no avail to the objectors here because Payton is distinguishable and the objectors failed to forward the same allegations and offer the same evidence as described in the Payton concurrence.\nThe excursion into this area is unnecessary. First, the Payton concurrence did not exist when we decided this case, and we did not affirm because we believed we were operating under, but distinguishing, the future and non-binding Payton concurrence. Second, as I further develop below, the parties did not argue this theory to us. And, third, since the OIS ultimately holds that the objectors waived the theory it outlines sua sponte, its excursion is pure obiter dictum. In short, rather than explaining the grounds for our decision in 2008, the OIS would fashion a prospective new rule.\nAs a jurisprudential matter, I have no fixed objection to the Court attempting to square this pre-Payton decision with the Payton concurrence, or with a more global view of the relevant issues, as the Court comes to a better understanding of their complexities. The value in such an effort is to provide broader guidance. Also, as I have outlined above, as a general matter a prospective rule can be less disruptive in the election arena. (Unfortunately, because the OIS ignores issues raised by the objectors in favor of drawing on the Payton concurrence, the OIS outlines a proposed prospective rule unrelated to the present appeal and through a waiver finding, which also raises the problem that the entire effort is dicta.) But, I believe our decisional explanation should and can be more closely tied to the arguments that were actually presented by the parties.\nIV.\nIn addition to explaining my own distinct reasons for supporting the Court\u2019s prior mandate, I also write briefly to note my disagreement with several aspects of the OIS expression. In my view, the OIS strays significantly from the parties\u2019 arguments, the factual record, and the law.\nFirst, the objectors here presented a single narrow theory: non-withdrawn pages of a certain circulator or notary must be stricken for fraud based solely on evidence that the candidate had withdrawn a page signed by the circulator or notary. The OIS does not pass in any clear fashion upon the validity of the objectors\u2019 theory. Instead, the OIS ventures into issues of candidate impropriety, which was not a basis for the objectors\u2019 appeal to this Court.\nSecond, the objectors argued their extrapolation theory on the assumption that the withdrawn pages were part of a \u201cpattern of fraud,\u201d that is, they were fraudulent. The OIS fails to correct this assumption, apparently conflating withdrawn signatures with invalid signatures and then making the leap to fraud. But, withdrawn signatures are not of-record. Deeming merely withdrawn signatures to be invalid, as the OIS does, is contrary to the Election Code\u2019s presumption of signature validity and effectively \u2014 and impermissibly \u2014 shifts the burden of proof from the objectors to the candidate. See 25 P.S. \u00a7 2937. Also, the policy of deeming withdrawn signatures invalid will likely have the undesirable effect of discouraging evidentiary stipulations and other efficiencies in election disputes. Election contests take place within narrow time-frames; withdrawing unneeded signatures by stipulation or otherwise, so as to narrow contested issues, is a salutary practice that considerably eases the burden on candidates, objectors, and the courts. See, e.g., In re Nader, 865 A.2d 8, 12-14 (Pa.Cmwlth.2004), aff'd, 580 Pa. 134, 860 A.2d 1 (2004) (per curiam) (describing Commonwealth Court\u2019s administrative difficulties in screening candidate\u2019s individual signatures absent stipulations).\nBut, even assuming that merely withdrawn signatures can be deemed defective, there is no support in the record for concluding that the withdrawn signatures in this case were fraudulent. See OIS at 9 (\u201cwe now hold that allegations and evidence of fraud may be material to the determination of the validity of a nomination petition\u201d) (emphasis added). The Commonwealth Court made no finding of fact to that effect and, at most, the objectors conceded that the withdrawn signatures were technically defective under a strict application of Flaherty. See Flaherty, 770 A.2d at 386-37 (signature invalid if circulator who affirmed page was not present when elector signed). The sort of technical defect noted in Flaherty, on its own, would not warrant a characterization as \u201cfraud.\u201d Further, it is speculative to assume that the cumulative effect of technically defective signatures equates to fraud with respect to the entire nomination petition. The OIS, nonetheless, accepts the objectors\u2019 description of the withdrawn signatures as fraudulent, with the result of distorting the factual record.\nFinally, I respectfully disagree with the OIS that Nader, Payton, and Citizens Committee to Recall Rizzo v. Bd. of Elections, 470 Pa. 1, 367 A.2d 232, 241 (1976) are particularly helpful in explaining our decision of the narrow evidentiary issue that was decided in this case.\n. This case, which involved election for a state office, is before the Court on direct appeal from a single-judge order of the Commonwealth Court. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 723(a) (Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from final orders entered by Commonwealth Court in matters commenced in original jurisdiction of that court); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 764 (Commonwealth Court has exclusive original jurisdiction of all election matters related to \"[s]tatewide office\u201d); In re Vidmer, 65 Pa.Cmwlth. 562, 442 A.2d 1203, 1204 (1982), aff'd, 497 Pa. 642, 444 A.2d 100 (1982) (statewide office includes state senators).\n. Although the objectors repeatedly suggested striking the entire nomination petition in the interest of maintaining \"the probity and integrity\u201d of the electoral process, they failed to develop any relevant issues of law on this point. Instead, the objectors focused primarily on the pattern of fraud claim with respect to the candidate's circulators and notary.\n. The objectors also raised a third question concerning an award of costs, which is not relevant to this appeal.\n. In a separate concurrence, Mr. Justice Eakin questions the necessity of the exchange between the authors of the different expressions in this case, suggesting that it is for the General Assembly to legitimize the \"false-in-one, false-in-all\u201d theory as a ground for striking the nomination petitions of electoral candidates. But, as posed, the objectors\u2019 claim is a theory of evidence fully within this Court\u2019s bailiwick. In my view, a proper explanation for our decision requires close attention to the parties\u2019 actual arguments and the evidentiary theory as posed.\n. It is unclear whether this prospective rule fashioned by the OIS means that \"allegations and evidence of fraud,\u201d presumably with respect to the withdrawn signatures, alone prove that otherwise unchallenged signatures are fraudulent, as the objectors claim. If, indeed, that is the prospective rule that the OIS would adopt, I note that it deeply discounts the value of those otherwise unchallenged signatures and of those respective \"voters' right to elect the candidate of their choice.\u201d In re Nomination Petition of Driscoll, 577 Pa. 501, 847 A.2d 44, 49 (2004); In re Nomination Petition of Flaherty, 564 Pa. 671, 770 A.2d 327, 331 (2001); see also Lubin v. Panish, 415 U.S. 709, 715-16, 94 S.Ct. 1315, 39 L.Ed.2d 702 (1974).",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\nconcurring.\nI agree with the central propositions advanced by the Opinion in Support of Per Curiam Order (\u201cOIS\u201d), that evidence of widespread fraud in the collection of signatures may be relevant in an election challenge, see In re Payton, 596 Pa. 469, 470-72, 945 A.2d 162, 163-64 (2008) (Saylor, J., concurring), but that, as a general matter, an objector cannot prevail in a \u201cglobal\u201d challenge on the basis of such evidence without pleading and proving that the candidate, or possibly his campaign, was aware of or condoned the fraud. I also agree with Mr. Chief Justice Castille, that Appellants\u2019 novel false-in-one-false-in-all theory, as presented to the Commonwealth Court, was appropriately rejected by that court, and further, that any present expression by this Court beyond an affirmance of that ruling represents dicta. See, e.g., In re Farnese, 945 A.2d 274, 276, 277 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008) (single-judge opinion by Friedman, J.) (reciting Appellants\u2019 concession that their challenge depends upon acceptance of their false-in-one-false-in-all theory). I write separately, moreover, because I believe the OIS\u2019s reliance on the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision in In re Nomination Paper of Nader, 865 A.2d 8 (Pa.Cmwlth.), aff'd, 580 Pa. 134, 860 A.2d 1 (2004) (per curiam), is misplaced, for several reasons.\nFirst, it should be noted that, in the Nader matter, after the Commonwealth Court completed its review, it determined that the candidate lacked sufficient signatures to obtain ballot access. See Nader, 865 A.2d at 18. It was on that basis that the Commonwealth Court adjudicated the case, and this Court elected not to express any opinion concerning the court\u2019s reasoning. Accordingly, no legal issue was presented, either before the Commonwealth Court, or before this Court, concerning whether evidence of fraud imputable to the candidate was germane to a challenge of circulator petitions that might otherwise be deemed valid.\nAdditionally, there is no indication in Nader that the candidate agreed that a substantial percentage of signatures were not obtained in accordance with law. Accordingly, I cannot agree that Nader supports the principle that, where a candidate agrees that a large percentage of the signatures are invalid, evidence of fraud in the signature-gathering process is relevant beyond the actual signatures being challenged as fraudulent. See OIS, slip op. at 6 (\u201cWhere, as here, a candidate for office has agreed that 60.5% of the signatures contained in his nomination petition are invalid, and the objectors to the petition have asserted fraud in the signature procurement process and are prepared to support those allegations with evidence, we cannot say, in light of Nader, ... that the evidence would be immaterial to the disposition of the petition.\u201d). In short, I believe that Nader has little relevance to the present case.\nTo me, the primary issue in Nader pertained to whether the term \u201cqualified elector\u201d subsumed a voter registration requirement, because if no such requirement existed, then the candidate would have had enough signatures for ballot access. See Nader, 580 Pa. at 146, 860 A.2d at 8 (Saylor, J., dissenting). As noted, since the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order was affirmed without an opinion, this Court did not issue a holding on that question. Moreover, review of the tabulated information provided by the Commonwealth Court demonstrates that only a little over one percent of the more than 50,000 signatures obtained were forged. As I stated then:\nIn the consolidated findings, opinion and order, the Commonwealth Court also indicated that the signatures under review were primarily the result of widespread, systemic fraudulent conduct on the part the individuals gathering them. See [Nader, 865 A.2d at 18] (stating that \u201cthis signature gathering process was the most deceitful and fraudulent exercise ever perpetrated upon this Court\u201d). A review of the tables and exhibits attached to the order, however, suggest that the problem was of a more limited scale (for example, 687 signatures out of 51,273 reviewed\u2014 or approximately 1.3% of the signatures \u2014 were rejected on the basis of having been forged). Moreover, the Commonwealth Court cited no evidence that the candidates were specifically aware of fraud or misrepresentation at the time of their submissions, and the candidates note \u2014 and the objectors do not dispute \u2014 that when they became aware of any fraudulent conduct connected with specific signatures, they voluntarily withdrew those signatures from consideration.\nId. at 146-47 n. 13, 860 A.2d at 8 n. 13. In summary, I do not support the continued collateral commentary on the Nader case, particularly where, as here, it is immaterial.",

        "text": "Justice EAKIN,\nconcurring.\nMy colleagues agree that more than 500 signatures remained unaffected by appellants\u2019 challenge. Farnese, therefore, was properly retained on the ballot. I agree. Beyond that, I refrain from engaging in any discussion concerning the objectors\u2019 extrapolation theory.\nThe principles on which this matter turns are not unique to election law \u2014 the case turns on principles of evidence and not on recitation of electoral law distinctions. Appellants contend there was so much fraud in the withdrawn and disallowed signatures that one must conclude there was fraud in the remaining ones. The court below deemed fraud irrelevant, which is reasonable if one merely counts the signatures not assailed individually, to see if they total 500.\nFraud, however, is relevant, though not in the \u201cglobal sense\u201d appellants would have. When one circulator is found to have committed significant fraud, this may affect the finder of fact\u2019s assessment of the credibility of other acts or affidavits by the same circulator in the same election. Conversely, there may be reasons not to disregard or reject such other acts or affidavits. It is largely a question of fact, which in the end is not for this Court to second guess, so long as the record and reasoning below support the finding. See In re Nomination of Flaherty, 564 Pa. 671, 770 A.2d 327, 331 (2001) (standard of review is whether findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, whether there was an abuse of discretion, or whether errors of law were committed).\nFurthermore, I continue to agree that a \u201cfalse in one, false in all\u201d principle should be rejected in these cases, see, e.g., In re Payton, 596 Pa. 469, 945 A.2d 162, 163 (2008) (plurality); if that is to be the law, it is for the legislature to accomplish. Short of that, a fact-finder should not be made to artificially ignore significant fraud when assessing the credibility of any witness, circulator, or signator; fraud should not be a presumptive total disqualification, but a permissible consideration.\nI therefore concur in the result.\nJustice BAER joins this concurring opinion.",
