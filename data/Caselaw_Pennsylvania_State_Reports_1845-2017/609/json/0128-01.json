        "text": "OPINION\nChief Justice CASTILLE.\nIn these consolidated capital post-conviction cross-appeals, the Commonwealth challenges the August 7, 2006 order of the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas awarding John C. Lesko a new trial and penalty hearing under the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. In his protective cross-appeal, Lesko challenges the portions of the PCRA court\u2019s ruling which denied certain claims for relief. The appeals of the PCRA court\u2019s order are directly reviewable by this Court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9546(d). For the reasons that follow, we reverse the order of the PCRA court granting Lesko a new trial and a new penalty hearing, and we dismiss the petition for PCRA relief.\nThe guilt phase of the trial established that Lesko participated in the murder of Apollo Police Officer Leonard Miller. See Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 502 Pa. 474, 467 A.2d 288 (1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1256, 104 S.Ct. 3547, 82 L.Ed.2d 850 (1984). Specifically, the facts demonstrate that in the early morning hours of January 3, 1980, Officer Miller was on duty when a silver-colored Lancia sports car containing three men \u2014 Lesko, Michael Travaglia, and Richard Rutherford\u2014 sped past his position at the Apollo Stop-and-Go convenience store several times. Officer Miller radioed for assistance, then pursued and stopped the sports car. When back-up officers arrived, they found Officer Miller lying on the highway, dead from two bullets from a .38 caliber handgun. His service revolver was drawn and all six rounds were fired. Police subsequently located the sports car, which had been abandoned. The windows were shattered and the car had bullet holes in it. It was determined that the car was registered to a William Nicholls of Pittsburgh, who had recently disappeared.\nPrior to Officer Miller\u2019s murder, the Pennsylvania State Police had received information indicating that Travaglia may have been involved in a number of armed robberies and killings in Pittsburgh and surrounding counties. While conducting their investigation, the State Police found a vehicle owned by a homicide victim. The vehicle had been abandoned near a motel where Travaglia and Daniel Keith Montgomery had stayed.\nPittsburgh police located Montgomery and discovered a .38 caliber handgun on his person. Montgomery told the police that Travaglia had given him the weapon and that Travaglia and Lesko talked about killing a police officer. Montgomery then told the police that Lesko and Travaglia were staying in a room at the Edison Hotel in Pittsburgh. The police proceeded to the Edison Hotel where they arrested Lesko and Travaglia. After being given Miranda warnings, Lesko and Travaglia were individually interrogated. Both gave statements implicating themselves in the killing of Officer Miller, as well as in the killings of William Nicholls, Peter Levato, and Marlene Sue Newcomer.\nFollowing various delays caused by two changes of venue and a mistrial, a joint trial of Lesko and Travaglia commenced in the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas on January 21, 1981, before Judge Gilfert Mihalich and a jury which had been selected in Berks County. The jury convicted both men of first-degree murder and conspiracy for the killing of Officer Miller. Subsequently, the jury returned a sentence of death for each defendant. On their joint direct appeal, this Court affirmed the convictions and sentences. See Travaglia, supra. Thereafter this Court affirmed the denial of Lesko\u2019s petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (\u201cPCHA\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9541 et seq. (the predecessor to the PCRA). See Commonwealth v. Lesko, 509 Pa. 67, 501 A.2d 200 (1985), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1101, 107 S.Ct. 1328, 94 L.Ed.2d 179 (1987).\nLesko filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. Ultimately, on federal appeal in 1991, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit granted sentencing phase relief, concluding that the prosecutor made improper comments during the penalty phase of the trial that tainted the jury\u2019s sentencing decision. See Lesko v. Lehman, 925 F.2d 1527 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 898, 112 S.Ct. 273, 116 L.Ed.2d 226 (1991). Following a second sentencing proceeding before the Honorable Gary P. Caruso of the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas in 1995, a jury found four aggravating factors and four mitigating factors. The jury concluded that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors and returned a sentence of death pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(1)(iv).\nOn direct appeal from his new death sentence, Lesko raised a number of issues related to his resentencing proceeding and second imposition of the death penalty. This Court again affirmed Lesko\u2019s sentence of death, Commonwealth v. Lesko, 553 Pa. 233, 719 A.2d 217 (1998), and, on January 19, 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Lesko\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, 525 U.S. 1108, 119 S.Ct. 878, 142 L.Ed.2d 778 (1999). On January 25,1999, then-Governor Thomas R. Ridge signed a warrant scheduling Lesko\u2019s execution for March 18, 1999. On February 10, 1999, Lesko filed a pro se petition for relief under the PCRA, attempting to challenge both his conviction and sentence, and moving for a stay of execution. On February 24, 1999, the PCRA court entered an order granting a stay of execution and appointing Robert Brett Dunham, Esquire, to represent Lesko in filing an amended PCRA petition. Lesko had previously been represented at all times by Rabe F. Marsh, III, Esquire, who was appointed to represent Lesko shortly after his arrest in 1980. At various times during his representation of Lesko, Attorney Marsh was assisted by other attorneys. Attorney Marsh was granted permission to withdraw as counsel upon Attorney Dunham\u2019s entry of appearance. On May 24, 1999, Attorney Dunham filed an amended PCRA petition and a petition for habeas corpus relief on behalf of Lesko, which were followed by subsequent addendums and supplements. The PCRA proceedings were assigned to the Honorable Richard E. McCormick, Jr., of the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas.\nOn December 14, 15, and 16, 1999, the PCRA court held evidentiary hearings at which Lesko presented the testimony of Attorney Marsh, Attorney Marsh\u2019s co-counsel, Brian O\u2019Leary, and Dr. Herbert E. Levit, a psychologist who had evaluated Lesko for the second penalty hearing. Additional evidentiary hearings were held on March 21 and 22, 2001, and on April 25 and 26, 2002. Following these evidentiary hearings, and at the direction of the PCRA court, the parties filed a number of post-hearing pleadings. On August 7, 2006, by opinion and order, the PCRA court held that Lesko, for a variety of reasons discussed in detail below, was entitled to a new trial and a third penalty hearing.\nThe Commonwealth appealed the PCRA court\u2019s order granting relief with regard to both the guilt and the penalty phase and Lesko filed a protective cross-appeal raising issues on which he did not obtain relief.\nOur standard of review in an appeal from the grant or denial of PCRA relief requires us to determine whether the ruling of the PCRA court is supported by the record and is free from legal error. See Commonwealth v. Washington, 592 Pa. 698, 927 A.2d 586, 593 (2007).\nI. JURISDICTION OVER GUILT STAGE CLAIMS\nBefore turning to the specific claims on which the PCRA court ruled, the Commonwealth raises a controlling preliminary question regarding whether the PCRA court erred in entertaining any of Lesko\u2019s claims related to his 1981 conviction (the \u201cguilt phase claims\u201d) because those claims are time-barred.\nIn his PCRA petition, Lesko asserted a number of claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel related to the guilt phase of his 1981 trial. The PCRA court awarded Lesko a new guilt phase on its finding that trial counsel interfered with Lesko\u2019s right to testify at trial. The PCRA court also found that Lesko was entitled to a new trial based on his Brady claims and derivative trial counsel ineffectiveness claims related thereto, which will be discussed separately. Specifically, the PCRA court determined that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to produce relevant impeachment evidence cumulatively prejudiced Lesko, and that Lesko\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain certain impeachment evidence and impeach certain witnesses. The Commonwealth contends that the PCRA court erred in addressing these claims because they were untimely.\nAccording to the Commonwealth, under the time requirements of the PCRA, Lesko had to raise any claims relating to his original trial by January 16, 1997, the date on or before which a first PCRA petition would be deemed timely in a case, like the one sub judice, where the judgment of sentence became final before the effective date of the 1995 amendments to the PCRA. As Lesko first raised the claims in February 1999, the Commonwealth argues that the claims are time-barred and the PCRA court did not have jurisdiction to entertain them. The Commonwealth further asserts that Lesko failed to plead or prove any of the exceptions to the PCRA\u2019s time requirements, and that Lesko\u2019s efforts to couch his claims in terms of ineffectiveness of counsel cannot save his otherwise untimely petition.\nLesko, in contrast, maintains that his 1999 PCRA petition was, in fact, timely, and, therefore, that the PCRA court had jurisdiction to consider the guilt phase ineffectiveness claims raised therein. He points out that his second death penalty sentence, imposed in 1995, did not become final until January 19, 1999, after the Supreme Court of the United States denied his petition for certiorari. Thus, Lesko argues that his PCRA petition, filed February 10, 1999, was filed within one year of the date his judgment of sentence became final.\nLesko further suggests that the only issue implicating the PCRA court\u2019s ability to review his claims of guilt phase ineffective assistance of counsel is whether his claims were waived because they were not raised in a prior PCRA petition. On the issue of waiver, Lesko contends, and the PCRA court agreed, that because Lesko was represented by trial counsel at all times prior to filing his 1999 PCRA petition, the 1999 petition represented his first opportunity to present claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and, therefore, the ineffectiveness claims were not waived. See Commonwealth v. Bennett, 593 Pa. 382, 930 A.2d 1264, 1274 (2007) (recognizing general rule that counsel cannot raise his own ineffectiveness); Commonwealth v. Hughes, 581 Pa. 274, 865 A.2d 761, 775 n. 7 (2004) (where appellant was represented by same counsel at trial and on direct appeal, PCRA proceeding is deemed first opportunity to challenge stewardship of prior counsel).\nThe PCRA court reasoned that it had jurisdiction over the guilt phase ineffectiveness claims because the PCRA proceedings were the first time that an independent attorney had reviewed Lesko\u2019s case and, thus, presented the first opportunity Lesko had to challenge trial counsel\u2019s conduct during the guilt phase. The PCRA court also pointed out the well-established tenets that counsel generally is not permitted to raise his own ineffectiveness; PCRA review is the appropriate avenue to raise ineffectiveness claims for a defendant who was represented by the same counsel at trial and on direct appeal; and issues of ineffectiveness must be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings at which the counsel whose effectiveness is being challenged no longer represents the defendant. Accordingly, the court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the guilt phase claims.\nHaving considered the competing arguments as well as the PCRA court\u2019s reasoning, we agree with the Commonwealth that Lesko is not entitled to PCRA review of his guilt phase claims to the extent he seeks to challenge anything but the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to disclose allegedly material evidence, because his petition is time-barred as to those claims; and because he has not argued or demonstrated any exceptions to the jurisdictional time requirements as set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). We conclude that this result is commanded by the terms and purpose of the PCRA, by the terms and purpose of the federal habeas order which led to Lesko\u2019s resentencing proceeding, and by an appreciation of the very limited role played by the lower federal habeas courts in \u201creviewing\u201d final state criminal judgments.\nThe novel question presented here may be phrased as: when a federal habeas corpus court sitting in civil collateral review of a final Pennsylvania judgment directs coercive, limited relief in the form of ordering Pennsylvania authorities to offer a convicted capital defendant a new penalty hearing, but does not purport to affect the underlying conviction or final judgment in any other manner, does the federal order operate to reopen the untouched Pennsylvania judgment concerning the verdict of guilt to serial collateral attack in state court. Lesko believes he is entitled to a fourth round of review of his guilt phase as of right under the PCRA, as a consequence of the federal habeas order. Lesko\u2019s theory, which the PCRA court appears to have adopted, depends on his assertion that the 1981 judgment of sentence did not become final until the conclusion of this Court\u2019s direct review of his second penalty hearing, which followed the federal collateral proceedings. Such a theory rests, in part, upon a view that collateral federal proceedings are but another step in the appellate review process; but that view fails to consider the actual and much more limited nature of such proceedings and their effect on state court final judgments.\nThe terms of the PCRA do not specifically address the scenario presented here. By enacting the PCRA, the Legislature has prescribed the route that all collateral review of criminal convictions and sentences in Pennsylvania must follow. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9542 (\u201cThe action established in this subchapter shall be the sole means of obtaining collateral relief and encompasses all other common law and statutory remedies ..., including habeas corpus and coram nobis.\u201d). The PCRA is not a part of the direct criminal proceeding. See Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551, 556-57, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987). The PCRA has a commensurately limited purpose as it provides only \u201cfor an action by which persons convicted of crimes they did not commit and persons serving illegal sentences may obtain collateral relief.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9542. The types of claims deemed cognizable under the PCRA likewise are not limitless. Instead, the PCRA petitioner must plead and prove \u201c[t]hat the conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the following [enumerated errors] ...,\u201d including, inter alia, a violation of the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions or ineffective assistance of counsel. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2). Furthermore, a petitioner does not have an absolute right to collateral review and is not afforded review of claims previously litigated or waived. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3) & (a)(4); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(a) & (b); Commonwealth v. Basemore, 560 Pa. 258, 744 A.2d 717, 726 (2000).\nIn addition to detailing the types of claims that are cognizable under the PCRA, the PCRA further limits collateral review by utilizing jurisdictional time limitations. These limits provide that a PCRA petition must be filed within one year of the date the judgment became final. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). Furthermore, any petition filed outside of the one-year jurisdictional time bar is unreviewable unless it meets certain listed exceptions and is filed within sixty days of the date the claim first could have been presented. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii) & (b)(2). The 1995 amendments to the Act, which adopted the time-bar, also provide that if the judgment of sentence became final before the January 16, 1996 effective date of the amendments, a PCRA petition will be considered timely if it is filed within one year of that date, or by January 16, 1997. But this grace period only applies to first post-conviction petitions filed as of right, not serial petitions. As this Court explained in Commonwealth v. Fahy, \u201cwhere the judgment becomes final on or before the [PCRA\u2019s 1995] amendments\u2019 effective date, a petition will be deemed timely if the petitioner\u2019s first petition is filed within one year of the effective date of the amendments.\u201d 558 Pa. 313, 737 A.2d 214, 218 (1999) (emphasis original).\nThe Legislature, however, did not speak to whether there is a fight to supplemental state collateral review following a federal habeas mandate, which results in a new penalty hearing. It could be argued that the PCRA\u2019s silence on this issue indicates that a defendant who receives a new sentencing proceeding as a result of a federal habeas order cannot invoke the PCRA even as to his new sentence. Therefore, the foundational question, properly framed, is whether the PCRA allows any new and additional collateral attack following a resentencing occasioned by a grant of federal habeas relief.\nThe parties and the PCRA court assumed the answer to this statutory question was \u201cyes\u201d with limited reasoning. We agree, but not because the PCRA by its terms plainly requires such review. Instead, we find the answer in the fact that this Court has construed the PCRA broadly to encompass those types of claims that would have been available for review under common law habeas corpus principles, in order to effectuate the PCRA\u2019s explicit role as the repository for claims which would otherwise have been available under state habeas corpus. See Commonwealth v. Bennett 930 A.2d at 1276-77 (Saylor, J., dissenting) (outlining history). The new sentencing proceeding and its result are the cause of the defendant\u2019s continuing restraint; and that proceeding is sufficiently distinct from the initial sentencing proceeding that collateral review of issues specific to the resentencing is consistent with the plain intent and purpose of the PCRA. But, the calculus is entirely different when the defendant seeks to invoke the new sentencing judgment as a basis to pursue, as of right, issues that do not arise from the resentencing proceeding. And, as explained below, the nature of federal habeas review, and the limited role played by the lower federal courts in \u201creviewing\u201d final state criminal judgments, corroborates that a limited grant of federal habeas sentencing relief does not give rise to a \u201cright\u201d to full-blown serial PCRA review of a trial whose result (conviction) has long been final.\nIn order to understand the role of the federal courts and the purpose of federal collateral review of state convictions, some background is in order. The U.S. Constitution does not mandate any federal habeas corpus review of a prisoner\u2019s confinement following a final state judgment of conviction: the availability and scope of the writ in that circumstance is Congress\u2019s prerogative, see, e.g., Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 662-63, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996), though the Court might step in if Congress failed to resolve the question. Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U.S. 314, 116 S.Ct. 1293, 134 L.Ed.2d 440 (1996). The first Congress did not make the writ available to state prisoners; it was not until 1867 that Congress created a general power for collateral review; \u201c[a]nd it was not until well into [the 20th] century that [the U.S. Supreme] Court interpreted [the legislation] to allow a final judgment of conviction in a state court to be collaterally attacked on habeas.\u201d Felker, supra. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s expansion of the civil writ to permit inquiry into federal issues other than the jurisdiction of the state court is an even later development. See Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277, 112 S.Ct. 2482, 120 L.Ed.2d 225 (1992) (plurality opinion by Thomas, J., and concurring opinion by O\u2019Connor, J., debate precise beginnings of expanded use of writ). The Court\u2019s expansion of the writ authorized the lower federal courts to reexamine the merits of a state prisoner\u2019s federal claims, even if those claims had been fully and fairly litigated in state court, and without any deference to the state court\u2019s determination. See Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953). As a result, lower federal court judges were permitted to upset state court criminal judgments anytime they disagreed with the state court\u2019s resolution of a federal claim, effectively giving the lower federal courts control over the state courts\u2019 findings, including those of the highest court of a state, notwithstanding that state courts are coequal to the lower federal courts on questions of federal law.\nA growing sensitivity to concerns of federalism and comity eventually led to a corrective adjustment of this federal habeas review scheme, and it was the U.S. Supreme Court itself that initiated those corrective measures, beginning in the 1970s. \u201cThese retractions were policy-based limitations on the availability of the habeas remedy. That is, the Supreme Court established by case law various rules under which the habeas court would refrain from granting relief, even though it had the jurisdiction to do so.\u201d Scheidegger, supra, at 933 (discussing retractions); see Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 554-55, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998) (given \u201cthe profound societal costs that attend the exercise of habeas jurisdiction\u201d over state convictions, \u201cwe have found it necessary to impose significant limits on the discretion of federal courts to grant habeas relief\u2019) (citations omitted) (listing examples of retractions). One of the key retractions was the nonretroactivity principle that derived from Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (plurality opinion). The Teague restriction, which has since been repeatedly embraced by the U.S. Supreme Court as a majority rule, e.g., Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S. 407, 415, 110 S.Ct. 1212, 108 L.Ed.2d 347 (1990), generally \u201cprevents a federal court from granting habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner based on a rule announced after his conviction and sentence became final.\u201d Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S. 383, 389, 114 S.Ct. 948, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994). By preventing federal habeas courts from upsetting state court judgments that were correct under the federal constitutional rules in existence at the time of trial, the Teague rule restored a measure of respect for the sovereign state courts, and placed some limits on the lower federal court\u2019s power to overturn reasonable state court determinations of federal questions. \u201cThe \u2018new rule\u2019 principle ... validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts, ... and thus effectuates the States\u2019 interests in the finality of criminal convictions and fosters comity between federal and state courts.\u201d Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 U.S. 333, 340, 113 S.Ct. 2112, 124 L.Ed.2d 306 (1993). By the same token, the Teague rule recognized that habeas relief should be available only where the legitimate purpose of habeas review would be served, i.e., as an \u201cadditional incentive for trial and appellate courts throughout the land to conduct their proceedings in a manner consistent with established constitutional standards.\u201d Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 488, 110 S.Ct. 1257, 108 L.Ed.2d 415 (1990), quoting Teague, 489 U.S. at 306, 109 S.Ct. 1060, quoting Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 262-63, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting).\nIn the wake of Teague and its progeny, the U.S. Congress went even farther in restoring respect for the sovereignty of the states in the realm of federal habeas review of state convictions. Thus, in 1996, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), which included a new and deferential federal habeas standard of review. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may be granted to a state prisoner only if the state court\u2019s review of a claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts----\u201d Under AEDPA, the federal court is no longer free to grant a state prisoner habeas relief simply because the court disagrees with a state court determination of a federal question. Moreover, a state court judgment can be said to be unreasonable under federal constitutional law only when it is measured against settled precedent from the highest court in the land.\nIn contrast to the substantive standards governing federal habeas review of state convictions, the nature of the habeas remedy has remained comparatively constant. In Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), the U.S. Supreme Court, per Justice Brennan, addressed the habeas remedy, noting that when a federal court determines that the right of personal liberty has been denied by the state and a person confined as a result, \u201cthe federal court has the power to release him ... it has no other power; it cannot revise the state court judgment; it can act only on the body of the petitioner.\u201d Id. at 430-31, 83 S.Ct. 822 (emphasis added). Indeed, federal habeas corpus proceedings are civil in nature because they exist \u201cfor the enforcement of a right to personal liberty, rather than as a stage of the state criminal proceedings or as an appeal therefrom....\u201d Id. at 423-24, 83 S.Ct. 822. Thus, a proper grant of federal habeas relief to a state prisoner does not purport to revise or interfere with the state court\u2019s criminal judgment. Fay, supra; Henderson v. Frank, 155 F.3d 159, 168 (3d Cir.1998). Indeed, any attempt to so interfere is patent error. See, e.g., Dickerson v. Vaughn, 90 F.3d 87, 92 (3d Cir.1996) (district court should not directly order state court to grant defendant an appeal); Smith v. Lucas, 9 F.3d 359, 367 (5th Cir.1993) (district court\u2019s directive to Mississippi state courts to impose sentence of life imprisonment did not comply with federal law); Duhamel v. Collins, 955 F.2d 962, 968 (5th Cir.1992) (federal court does not have authority to commute death sentence to sentence of life imprisonment); Magwood v. Smith, 791 F.2d 1438, 1450 (11th Cir.1986) (federal district court and court of appeals have no appellate authority over state court and, hence, have no authority to \u201cremand\u201d case to state court).\nInstead, federal habeas directives to state authorities are designed to be coercive. Thus, the federal courts issue a \u201cconditional\u201d grant of the writ, which delays implementing the writ, ie., the release of the prisoner, to allow the state the opportunity to correct the perceived constitutional violation. Henderson, 155 F.3d at 168 (\u201cIt would seem that federal habeas power is limited, first, to a determination of whether there has been an improper detention by virtue of the state court judgment; and second, if [the federal court] find[s] such an illegal detention, to ordering the immediate release of the prisoner, conditioned on the state\u2019s opportunity to correct constitutional errors that [it] concluded] occurred in the initial' proceeding.\u201d); see also Smith, 9 F.3d at 367; Duhamel, 955 F.2d at 968. Such indirect orders not only pay heed to the historical use of the writ and the interests of the habeas plaintiff, but also recognize the significant state interests at stake. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 393, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), \u201ca state defendant should have the opportunity to have all issues\u201d tried in a state court \u201cunder appropriate state procedures.\u201d But the \u201cState, too, has a weighty interest in having valid federal constitutional criteria applied in the administration of its criminal law by its own courts and juries.\u201d Id. The federal remedy should be narrowly designed to enable the state court to fulfill its constitutional obligation. Dickerson, 90 F.3d at 92; see also Henderson, 155 F.3d at 168 (noting \u201cfederal courts have most often granted the relief in habeas cases that has required the least intervention into the state criminal process.\u201d). Furthermore, once the state court or other authority timely acts to address the perceived violation forming the basis for the issuance of the conditional writ, the final writ will not issue.\nHaving set forth our understanding of the terms and nature of the PCRA, the nature of federal habeas review of state court convictions, and the limited role played by the lower federal courts in reviewing final state court judgments, the answer to whether the federal civil collateral order entered in this case operates to reopen the final Pennsylvania judgment concerning the verdict of guilt is clear. It does not.\nLesko\u2019s federal habeas petition raised claims attacking both his conviction and his penalty. His guilt phase claims were specifically rejected; the relief he received was confined to the penalty proceeding. Thus, the Third Circuit\u2019s order authorizing conditional issuance of a writ of habeas corpus provided:\nFor the reasons stated in this opinion, we will reverse the judgment under review [i.e., the judgment of the federal district court] to the extent that it sustains the imposition of the death penalty. We will remand to the district court for the holding of an evidentiary hearing on [Lesko]\u2019s claim that his Indiana County guilty plea was not voluntary and for the subsequent issuance of the writ insofar as the death penalty is concerned.\nWe will direct the district court to issue the writ subject to the holding of a state court resentencing proceeding within a reasonable period of time to be set by the district court. If the district court determines, on the basis of the evidentiary hearing described in the last paragraph, that [Lesko]\u2019s Indiana County guilty plea was not voluntary, the writ shall be issued subject to the additional requirement that evidence of the guilty plea not be introduced at the resentencing proceeding.\nWe will affirm the judgment under review to the extent that it sustains the determination of [Leskoj\u2019s guilt.\nLesko v. Lehman, 925 F.2d at 1555.\nOn remand from the Third Circuit, the federal district court deemed the guilty plea related to the Indiana County murder to be involuntary \u201cby the representation that it would not be introduced during the Westmoreland penalty phase hearing.\u201d The district court\u2019s order conditionally granting habeas relief respecting the penalty phase specified that evidence related to the \u201cvoid plea cannot be introduced at the resentencing proceeding in the Westmoreland County case.\u201d Lesko v. Lehman, 1992 WL 717815 (W.D.Pa.1992). The Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas then conducted a second penalty hearing \u2014 not a trial on guilt or innocence \u2014 after which a jury of Lesko\u2019s peers again sentenced him to death. Lesko was denied relief from the resentencing proceeding on direct review to this Court and this state collateral appeal is now before us under, and subject to the terms of, the PCRA.\nIn light of the nature of PCRA review, the limited effect of collateral federal proceedings on a final state criminal judgment, and the nature of federal habeas relief, we conclude that Lesko\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to first petition PCRA review is necessarily confined to that part of the final Pennsylvania judgment that was disturbed by the federal habeas proceedings. All other aspects of the original judgment remain as before \u2014 final. The federal habeas court, far from purporting to upset the verdict of guilt, explicitly \u201caffirmed\u201d the district court judgment \u201csustaining\u201d that aspect of the trial. The resentencing that occurred as a result of the coercive federal habeas mandate did not purport to revive the claims that expired once the 1981 verdict of guilt became final. The finality of the judgment must be analyzed in light of the context in which the subsequent proceedings occurred, including the intervening habeas proceedings. Thus, we hold that the 1981 Pennsylvania judgment of sentence is final for all purposes except for that part of the final judgment that was disturbed by the federal habeas proceedings, i.e., Lesko\u2019s penalty phase proceeding.\nLesko\u2019s judgment of sentence in terms of his conviction for first-degree murder became final in 1984, after his certiorari petition in the U.S. Supreme Court was denied. Lesko subsequently filed a timely PCHA petition, but was denied relief in 1985. Thus, Lesko did not qualify for the one-year tolling provision in the 1995 amendments as the instant filing represented a serial petition. See Fay, supra. (The Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that Lesko had until January 16, 1997 to file a timely PCRA petition raising claims of ineffectiveness of trial counsel at his 1981 guilt trial is incorrect.) Rather, Lesko had until January 16, 1996 \u2014 the date the 1995 amendments to the PCRA took effect, eliminating the ability to file serial PCRA petitions as of right \u2014 to file a timely second or subsequent PCRA petition raising claims arising from his 1981 guilt trial. To allow Lesko to pursue a PCRA petition as of right to raise new guilt phase claims more than 25 years later, after a direct appeal, an of-right PCHA petition, and completed federal habeas corpus proceedings, would render the time limitations of the PCRA meaningless.\nLesko emphasizes that because he was represented by the same counsel until the filing of his amended PCRA petition in 1999, the 1999 petition represented his first opportunity to challenge counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness at his original trial in 1981. But, it is well established that the fact that a petitioner\u2019s claims are couched in terms of ineffectiveness will not save an otherwise untimely petition from the application of the time restrictions of the PCRA. Commonwealth v. Breakiron, 566 Pa. 323, 781 A.2d 94, 97 (2001).\nLesko further maintains that this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Chambers, 570 Pa. 3, 807 A.2d 872 (2002), \u201cunequivocally establishes the correctness of the PCRA court\u2019s ruling that the guilt-stage issues from the initial trial in 1981 are substantively appropriate for PCRA review.\u201d Brief of Appellee Lesko at 9. In Chambers, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to death in 1987. On direct appeal, this Court affirmed his conviction, but remanded for a new penalty trial. After Chambers was sentenced to death a second time in 1994, he filed a direct appeal and that judgment of sentence was affirmed. Chambers was represented by the same counsel from the time of trial through his appeal of his second penalty trial. Subsequently, represented by new counsel, Chambers filed a timely PCRA petition challenging his 1994 judgment of sentence. This Court addressed Chambers\u2019 layered claims of ineffectiveness of trial counsel related to his conviction, despite the fact that the claims were raised in a PCRA petition that was filed more than one year after Chambers\u2019 original conviction became final.\nChambers, however, is distinguishable from the instant case for several reasons. First, the Commonwealth in Chambers did not challenge the propriety of Chambers raising guilt phase claims and this Court did not raise such an inquiry sua sponte; in this case, the Commonwealth does recognize and pursue the jurisdictional issue. Second, the collateral proceedings following the new penalty phase in Chambers were state-court proceedings. Finally, Chambers\u2019 PCRA petition was his first petition for collateral relief and not a serial petition following federal habeas review. Accordingly, we hold that the PCRA court did not have jurisdiction over Lesko\u2019s claims related to guilt-phase errors and we reverse that portion of the PCRA court\u2019s order.\nII. BRADY CLAIMS\nAs discussed previously, the PCRA court granted both guilt and penalty phase relief as a result of Lesko\u2019s Brady claims. Respecting the guilt phase, we note that a colorable Brady claim raised on serial collateral attack may qualify for review as an exception to the PCRA time-bar, depending upon the timing of the discovery of the alleged failure of the Commonwealth to disclose evidence, and whether the defendant diligently pursues the claim. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i) and (ii); Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 884 A.2d 848, 852 (2005). Given this fact, and the fact that the same alleged Brady violations formed the basis for the PCRA court\u2019s grant of relief respecting both the guilt phase and the penalty phase, we will address the claims together, assessing the guilt phase under the PCRA\u2019s serial petition restrictions, and the penalty phase under the PCRA provisions governing first petitions.\nIn his PCRA petition, Lesko raised three claims alleging that the Commonwealth violated Brady by failing to disclose material evidence. Specifically, Lesko contended that he should have been given a statement made by Daniel Keith Montgomery to Pennsylvania State Trooper Michael K. Steffee (the \u201cSteffee report\u201d); that he should have been provided with a copy of the written agreement between the Commonwealth and Montgomery whereby the Commonwealth agreed not to prosecute Montgomery for certain property crimes he allegedly committed with Travaglia; and that the Commonwealth failed to disclose the juvenile records of Commonwealth witness Richard Rutherford, revealing that Rutherford was given special treatment, including two four-hour furloughs from prison, prior to his testimony at trial. In addition to testifying at the 1981 trial, Rutherford and Montgomery testified at Lesko\u2019s 1995 resentencing hearing.\nThe PCRA court agreed with Lesko, concluding that these three separate pieces of information should have been disclosed to the defense. The PCRA court explained that the Steffee report would have impeached Montgomery\u2019s testimony at the first trial and at the resentencing when he testified that Travaglia said, \u201cGoddamn, or Jesus Christ, I shot a cop,\u201d and Lesko replied, \u201cI wanted to,\u201d and then laughed. In an earlier statement to Trooper Steffee, however, Montgomery had stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the cop getting shot,\u201d and said nothing about any remarks made by Lesko.\nThe PCRA. court concluded that Lesko was unaware of this police statement until present PCRA counsel subpoenaed Pennsylvania State Police records from Harrisburg for the purpose of preparing for the PCRA proceeding. The court based this conclusion on the fact that at the PCRA hearing, both trial counsel and counsel for Travaglia testified that they had never seen the police report. Both counsel opined that the prior statement contained within the Steffee report provided important impeachment evidence, calling into question Montgomery\u2019s implication that Lesko evidenced his intent to kill the officer when he said, \u201cI wanted to.\u201d Additionally, the PCRA court noted that the Commonwealth did not deny that it did not provide the report to the defense. The PCRA court also noted that the Commonwealth\u2019s Brady obligation extended to exculpatory evidence contained in the files of the police agencies of the same government bringing the prosecution, citing to Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 438, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) and Commonwealth v. Burke, 566 Pa. 402, 781 A.2d 1136, 1141 (2001) (applying holding in Kyles). For these reasons, the PCRA court concluded that \u201c[t]he Steffee report is a document that should have been provided to the defense, but for some unexplained reason, was not.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 43-44 (record citations omitted).\nThe second piece of Brady evidence was the Montgomery agreement, which consisted of the Commonwealth\u2019s written agreement not to prosecute Montgomery for robberies that he had committed with Travaglia. The PCRA court explained that although, prior to trial, counsel had requested all evidence \u201cfavorable to the accused which is material either to guilt or to punishment in the possession or direct control of the attorney of the Commonwealth,\u201d the written agreement was never provided to counsel and counsel never questioned Montgomery during cross-examination regarding whether the Commonwealth had agreed not to prosecute him in exchange for his testimony.\nSimilarly, related to the final piece of evidence, the PCRA court observed that Rutherford\u2019s juvenile record contained entries that indicated that he had received favorable treatment in anticipation of his testimony at trial. Again, the PCRA court suggested that this information was not provided to the defense.\nAlternatively, the PCRA court implied that trial counsel may have known of these latter two pieces of evidence, but failed to demand them. Considering the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s conduct, the court concluded that the evidence would have provided useful impeachment evidence and that counsel offered no strategic reasons for failing to request such information. Specifically, the PCRA court observed that trial counsel \u201cmade no attempt to impeach the credibility of Montgomery on cross-examination and made a fleeting reference to an \u2018agreement\u2019 in his cross-examination of Rutherford, without any specific reference to the contents, substance or consequences of the agreement.\u201d Id. at 45^46. The PCRA court indicated that these two sources of impeachment would have called into question the testimony of Rutherford and Montgomery, who provided the basis for the jury to find that Lesko \u201cintended\u201d to kill Officer Miller. Additionally the PCRA court concluded that their testimony was not \u201cinconsequential as it went directly to the most essential, and the only contested, element of the crime of murder of the first degree \u2014 intent.\u201d Id. at 44-45. The court went on to suggest that it was the cumulative prejudice from the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to reveal multiple pieces of exculpatory evidence, combined with counsel\u2019s failure to interview witnesses and gather relevant impeachment evidence, which undermined the fairness of the proceedings. For these reasons, the court concluded that Lesko was entitled to a \u201cnew guilt-stage trial and a new sentencing hearing.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth argues that the PCRA court erred in concluding that Lesko is entitled to a new guilt trial under Brady. According to the Commonwealth, the PCRA court erred in holding that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to provide Lesko with the Steffee report prejudiced him, because it \u201cfail[ed] to account for other substantive evidence of motive and participation on the part of Lesko in the murder of Officer Miller,\u201d and, therefore, even if Lesko\u2019s statement \u201cI wanted to\u201d had been omitted from the trial, the jury\u2019s verdict would not have been different. Brief of Appellant Commonwealth at 27. The Commonwealth points out that there was other very damning evidence of Lesko\u2019s participation in the crimes, which overwhelmingly demonstrated Lesko\u2019s specific intent to kill. The Commonwealth contends that Lesko\u2019s own words \u201chit him again,\u201d as related by Rutherford at trial, speak most loudly \u201cof Lesko\u2019s full and active participation in the crime.\u201d Id. at 31.\nWith respect to the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to disclose the juvenile records of Rutherford showing that he was granted two four-hour furloughs (at Thanksgiving and at Christmas), that he had a psychological condition, and that the Commonwealth thought it was \u201ctoo risky\u201d to try him before trying Lesko and Travaglia, the Commonwealth asserts that this evidence likewise would not have changed the outcome of the trial. The Commonwealth notes that Rutherford had given an incriminating statement prior to being granted a furlough, and even if the furloughs could be offered as proof of a quid pro quo for Rutherford\u2019s trial testimony, the effect of impeaching Rutherford would have made little impact in light of his testimony as an eyewitness and co-conspirator in the killing of Nicholls. The Commonwealth further maintains that it would not have been in Lesko\u2019s self-interest to impeach Rutherford since Rutherford\u2019s testimony \u201cprovided critical evidence concerning Travaglia\u2019s drug abuse which would have inured to the benefit of Lesko as well,\u201d id. at 38, presumably by offering the prospect of lessening Lesko\u2019s culpability as an accomplice.\nFinally, regarding the alleged failure by the Commonwealth to provide Lesko with a copy of its agreement not to prosecute Montgomery for certain property crimes \u2014 namely, robberies \u2014 he allegedly committed with Travaglia, the Commonwealth argues that \u201cLesko has not established he was not given the agreement or the equivalent of the agreement in the March 26, 1980 statement [within which counsel for Montgomery refers to the agreement as relating to crimes against property but not as to crimes against people].\u201d Id. at 33. The Commonwealth further argues that the agreement would not have been useful for impeaching Montgomery because Montgomery had denied committing the crimes at the 1981 trial, and, furthermore, that such impeachment would have necessarily implicated Travaglia, which might have reflected poorly on Lesko.\nIn Brady, the U.S. Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d Id. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. The duty to disclose may encompass impeachment evidence as well as directly exculpatory evidence. Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 884 A.2d 848, 854 (2005). Furthermore, in Burke, we applied the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s later decision in Kyles, concluding that the prosecution\u2019s duty when faced with a Brady request extends to exculpatory evidence in the flies of police agencies of the same government prosecuting the case. With regard to the issue of materiality, evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the trial would have been different. Lambert, supra; see also Commonwealth v. Collins, 585 Pa. 45, 888 A.2d 564, 577-78 (2005) (to establish Brady violation, defendant \u201cmust establish that there has been a suppression by the prosecution of either exculpatory or impeachment evidence that was favorable to the accused, and that the omission of such evidence prejudiced the defendant\u201d). However, \u201c[t]he mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish materiality in the constitutional sense.\u201d Chambers, 807 A.2d at 887.\nLesko\u2019s Brady claims pertain to alleged impeachment evidence which he contends would have been useful in challenging at trial and at the resentencing hearing witness testimony that provided the basis for a finding that Lesko \u201cintended\u201d to kill Officer Miller, which was necessary to prove guilt for first-degree murder.\nWe will first consider the Brady claims as they relate to the guilt phase. With regard to the Montgomery written agreement and Rutherford\u2019s juvenile records, we conclude that the claims are time-barred. Lesko proceeded below upon a theory that he was entitled to pursue his guilt-related claims in an of-right PCRA petition, and he made no effort to invoke or satisfy any of the PCRA\u2019s time-bar exceptions. Thus, Lesko never stated when this information became available to him, nor did he claim that he raised the issues within sixty days of the date they first could have been presented under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2).\nFurthermore, it is apparent from the existing record that these two claims are time-barred. Lesko\u2019s own averments and the findings of the PCRA court (which incorporated an ineffectiveness of counsel aspect regarding these two averments as discussed above) indicate that trial counsel had knowledge of the Montgomery agreement prior to the 1981 trial and, as discussed below, trial counsel clearly had knowledge that Rutherford had an agreement with the Commonwealth at Lesko\u2019s 1995 resentencing. Accordingly, given our conclusion that any errors related to the 1981 conviction are subject to the serial petition restrictions of the PCRA, and the fact that these Brady claims, are unavailable under the PCRA\u2019s time-bar exceptions, we conclude that the PCRA court lacked jurisdiction to consider these two claims as they relate to the guilt phase.\nThe analysis regarding the Steffee report is different as it does not appear that Lesko received this report until after the second penalty hearing, after the PCRA petition was filed, and before the PCRA hearing. The PCRA court specifically determined that Lesko\u2019s present counsel first learned of the contents of the report when he subpoenaed the records of the Pennsylvania State Police in preparation for the PCRA hearing and noted that the Commonwealth raised no objection on this point. Thus, unlike the prior two pieces of information, we have jurisdiction to review this claim as it relates to Lesko\u2019s guilt phase. Nevertheless, the PCRA court\u2019s reasoning underlying its grant of relief on this claim was erroneous as a matter of law.\nPreliminarily, we note that, in finding that the Commonwealth violated Brady, the PCRA court relied upon the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kyles, a case that was decided many years after Lesko\u2019s trial. Kyles extended Brady to encompass evidence contained within the control of the relevant government and not just material possessed by the prosecutor. Neither the U.S. Supreme Court nor this Court has specifically answered the question whether the Kyles rule applies retroactively to pre-Kyles trials. See Commonwealth v. Gibson, 597 Pa. 402, 951 A.2d 1110, 1127 n. 14 (2008) (noting that prior to Burke this Court maintained that district attorneys were not required to provide defense with evidence it did not possess and of which it was unaware, such as evidence exclusively within police custody). We need not answer the question here because, we hold, Lesko cannot establish materiality in the constitutional sense. See Commonwealth v. Pagan, 597 Pa. 69, 950 A.2d 270, 291-92 (2008) (explaining competing positions for applying Kyles to pre-Kyles trial, but assuming for purposes of decision alone that Kyles applies since, in any event, appellant could not establish that evidence was exculpatory).\nIn order to prevail on a Brady claim, the defendant must establish that the evidence requested and allegedly withheld was material. Evidence is material \u201cif there is reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Lambert, 884 A.2d at 854. Although the Steffee report contained a statement by Montgomery denying any knowledge (i.e., he didn\u2019t \u201cknow anything about the cop getting shot\u201d), which could have been used to impeach Montgomery\u2019s testimony at trial that Lesko stated he \u201cwanted to\u201d shoot a police officer, we cannot agree with Lesko and the PCRA court that there was a reasonable probability that this information, had it been disclosed and employed as impeachment at trial, would have led to a different result.\nThe issue of Lesko\u2019s intent was hotly contested at trial. The evidence showed that Travaglia was the triggerman and both men forwarded a defense that the murder of Officer Miller was not premeditated. Faced with such a defense, the Commonwealth did not limit its proof of Lesko\u2019s intent to the testimony of Montgomery, but also presented evidence that Lesko and Travaglia jointly embarked on a crime spree on the night of Officer Miller\u2019s murder, which began with the kidnapping and carjacking of William Nicholls. At the time they goaded Officer Miller into stopping Nicholls\u2019 car, the confederates had already murdered Nicholls and possessed damning evidence of their involvement in that murder. The evidence also showed that Lesko participated in the theft of Travaglia\u2019s father\u2019s gun \u2014 the gun that was used to kill Officer Miller \u2014 and that Lesko and Travaglia intended to rob an Apollo Stop N\u2019 Go store. That intention was thwarted by Officer Miller, who was parked directly across from the store. N.T., Volume I, 1981, at 358-60, 368-70, 373, 615-18. The account in the Steffee report would have been useful as impeachment by omission, of course. But, Montgomery\u2019s earlier non-cooperation with police would not have made his in-court testimony disappear, nor would it have altered the overall volume of abundant, independent evidence offered at the 1981 trial establishing Lesko\u2019s course of conduct and intent. Lesko has not shown a reasonable probability that the result of the guilt phase would have been different if only trial counsel had been able to use the omission in the Steffee report to impeach Montgomery\u2019s in-court testimony.\nTurning to the Brady claims as they relate to Lesko\u2019s second penalty hearing, both Montgomery and Rutherford testified at this proceeding and, again, none of this information was used to impeach their testimony. Significantly, in addressing the Brady claims, the PCRA court did not conclude that evidence of the Steffee report, the Commonwealth\u2019s agreement with Montgomery, or the juvenile files of Rutherford, if such had been provided to the defense, independently would have resulted in a different outcome. Rather, the PCRA court determined that it was the cumulative prejudice from the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to produce relevant impeachment evidence, combined -with the prejudice arising from counsel\u2019s failure to interview witnesses and gather relevant impeachment information, which resulted in a reasonable probability that \u201cthe outcome of the proceedings \u2014 that the jury found the Petitioner to have the requisite intent \u2014 would have been different, but for these errors.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 46.\nThe PCRA court\u2019s guilt-phase reasoning on this issue, however, does not readily translate to the resentencing. The PCRA court focused on the fact that this testimony was used to establish the intent to kill necessary for first-degree murder. Intent to kill, however, was not an issue at the resentencing. At the resentencing, the testimony was offered merely as background to establish the circumstances of the crime giving rise to the jury\u2019s penalty phase duty. This background was not used to prove the existence of any aggravating circumstances, but was merely used to put the case in context for the jury. Thus, the PCRA court\u2019s reasoning in support of its grant of guilt phase relief is not relevant or persuasive in the task of assessing Brady prejudice at the resentencing.\nIn any event, at the resentencing, trial counsel elicited testimony from Montgomery that he had committed robberies with Travaglia prior to the murder of Officer Miller, N.T., 2/14/95, at 487; and trial counsel similarly elicited testimony from Rutherford that he had a deal with the Commonwealth that he would be tried as a juvenile for the Nicholls murder and that the charges against him were ultimately dismissed, N.T., 2/13/1995, at 454. Indeed, trial counsel requested and the jury was given a corrupt source instruction regarding Rutherford\u2019s testimony. N.T., 2/17/95, at 19. For these reasons, we conclude that the PCRA court erred in holding that the result of the resentencing proceeding would have been different if counsel had impeached Montgomery and Rutherford with the Brady information.\nIII. PENALTY PHASE CLAIMS\nThe remaining claims allege ineffective assistance of resentencing counsel. In order to obtain relief based on a claim of ineffectiveness, a PCRA petitioner must satisfy the performance and prejudice test set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In Pennsylvania, we have applied the Strickland test by looking to three elements. Thus, in order to succeed on a claim of ineffectiveness, the petitioner must establish that: (1) the underlying claim has arguable merit; (2) no reasonable basis existed for counsel\u2019s actions or failure to act; and (3) petitioner suffered prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s error such that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different absent such error. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973, 975 (1987). Additionally, we note, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is recognized \u201cnot for its own sake,\u201d but because of the effect it has on the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial. See Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 369, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993); see also Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201cMoreover, the purpose of the effective assistance guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is not to improve the quality of legal representation.... The purpose is simply to ensure that criminal defendants receive a fair trial.\u201d). For these reasons, counsel is presumed to have rendered effective assistance. Both the U.S. Supreme Court and this Court have made clear that a court is not required to analyze the elements of an ineffectiveness claim in any particular order of priority; instead, if a claim fails under any necessary element of the Strickland, test, the court may proceed to that element first. Strickland, supra; Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 554 Pa. 31, 720 A.2d 693, 701 (1998).\nIn granting Lesko penalty phase relief, the PCRA court found merit to Lesko\u2019s claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to retain an appropriate mental health expert to examine Lesko, failing to provide relevant information to the mental health expert who was retained, and failing to adequately develop and present mitigation evidence. The PCRA court denied relief on the remaining claims Lesko raised related to the second penalty hearing and he has filed a protective cross-appeal raising the claims on which he was denied relief.\nWe first note that, in contrast to Lesko\u2019s claims relating to his 1981 guilt trial, Lesko\u2019s claims of error with respect to his second sentencing proceeding, including his ineffectiveness of counsel claims, are timely. As discussed previously, in 1995 Lesko was resentenced to death following a sentencing proceeding compelled by the federal court\u2019s conditional grant of habeas relief. His new sentence became final after this Court affirmed the judgment on direct appeal in 1998 and the U.S. Supreme Court denied his petition for certiorari on January 19,1999. Lesko filed his PCRA petition on February 10, 1999, which was within one year of the date his new judgment of sentence became final, and the PCRA court thus had jurisdiction to address Lesko\u2019s collateral challenges related to his 1995 resentencing proceeding.\nA. Application of Pa.R.Crim.P. 801\nThe Commonwealth asserts that the PCRA court erroneously applied present-day attorney competency standards, namely, Rule 801 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, to determine the competency of counsel at Lesko\u2019s second sentencing in 1995. Rule 801, which became effective in 2004, sets forth the qualifications for defense counsel in capital cases. In its opinion and order, the PCRA court set forth the language of Rule 801, and opined that the new standards enumerated the elements for adequate capital case representation. Nevertheless, the PCRA court specifically noted that \u201cthis rule was not effective or binding upon Mr. Marsh during the time he represented [Lesko],\u201d and stated that it was merely recognizing \u201cthe heightened standard of representation that our highest court now demands of attorneys who are involved in capital cases.... \u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 8-9.\nFrom the PCRA court\u2019s statement, the Commonwealth argues that \u201c[i]t is clear that the lower court improperly framed its analysis of the issues relating to ineffectiveness.\u201d Brief of Appellant Commonwealth at 19. The Commonwealth overlooks, however, that the PCRA court specifically acknowledged that it would not apply the Rule 801 standards to Lesko\u2019s trial counsel. Furthermore, the Commonwealth fails to identify any particular instance where the PCRA court analyzed a specific ineffectiveness claim under improper standards. Accordingly, the Commonwealth\u2019s generalized Rule 801 complaint is without merit.\nB. Capital Resentencing\nBefore turning to the penalty phase claims upon which Lesko was granted relief, we will first address Lesko\u2019s claim that a death sentence should not have been deemed available at all following the federal habeas court\u2019s order. Lesko contends that resentencing counsel was ineffective for failing to argue, after the conditional grant of habeas corpus sentencing relief in 1991, that \u201cany capital resentencing would violate his life and liberty interest in the imposition of a life sentence following the reversal of his prior death sentence.\u201d Brief of Appellant Lesko at 15. Lesko acknowledges that on the direct appeal of his resentencing, this Court rejected his argument that subjecting him to resentencing under the 1988 amendment to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(4) constituted an ex post facto application of the law and a violation of due process. See Lesko, 719 A.2d at 220. But, Lesko asserts that his current theory of objection to capital eligibility \u201cis materially distinct\u201d from the claim raised on that appeal. Specifically, Lesko argues that if this Court had correctly granted him relief on his original direct appeal in 1983, he would have received a life sentence on remand by operation of law since at that time Section 9711(h) \u201cvested in a capital defendant the right to a life sentence if his death sentence was overturned upon appeal.\u201d Brief of Appellant Lesko at 15. He further argues that trial counsel had no reasonable basis for \u201cfailing to raise the life and liberty interest argument\u201d following the federal \u201creversal\u201d of his first death sentence, and that counsel\u2019s failure to do so prejudiced him. Id. at 17.\nThe PCRA court rejected this claim on the basis that it was previously litigated. PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 65-66.\nLesko is seeking to obtain relief on a previously rejected claim by casting it in terms of ineffectiveness, and faulting counsel for failing to forward a different theory. This Court has recognized that a Sixth Amendment claim of ineffectiveness raises a distinct ground for relief and thus this manner of presenting new theories on collateral attack is not per se precluded by the PCRA\u2019s previous litigation restriction. Collins, 888 A.2d at 571. Nevertheless, we conclude that his attack on appeal counsel based on his new theory fails on the merits for the reasons expressed on direct appeal.\nIn rejecting Lesko\u2019s claim on his resentencing appeal, this Court acknowledged that under the prior capital sentencing statute, if this Court found an error in the penalty phase, a remand for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment would have been required. We then explained that the statute was amended in 1988 to provide that a new sentencing hearing must be conducted whenever a sentence of death is vacated, except where it is vacated for disproportionality or lack of evidence of aggravating factors. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(4). Finally, we noted that we had already rejected, in other cases, the same argument as that made by Lesko and had concluded that the revised sentencing provision could be applied to cases that were pending in the appellate process at the time of the amendment. Lesko, 719 A.2d at 219-20 (case citations omitted).\nLesko does not explain how his current ineffectiveness claim can survive the reasoning of this Court in his direct appeal. He fails to provide any argument as to how counsel fell short in his presentation of this claim on direct appeal except to assert that counsel should have presented a \u201clife and liberty\u201d argument in support of the same claim. Such an argument does not change the jurisprudential nature of the claim that counsel presented on direct appeal. Furthermore, Lesko\u2019s new claim, as stated, is meritless since he speaks of a \u201clife and liberty\u201d interest that supposedly matured following the federal court\u2019s \u201creversal\u201d of his prior death sentence. But, as we have pointed out at some length above, a conditional grant of coercive, collateral federal habeas corpus relief is not a \u201creversal\u201d of a state court judgment. Nor does a lower federal court\u2019s conditional habeas order prove that this Court\u2019s affirmance of the initial death sentence was \u201cincorrect.\u201d\nIn any event, the interest of which Lesko speaks, if it existed at all, was a function and part of Pennsylvania\u2019s direct review scheme, and Lesko\u2019s success on collateral review in federal court is simply not the same thing as success on direct review in this Court. Lesko went to federal court, seeking the civil relief available in federal habeas proceedings; and Pennsylvania afforded him precisely the conditional relief that was ordered. He was entitled to no more. Finally, even if this Court were to agree that counsel\u2019s presentation of this claim was lacking on direct appeal, we note that this Court has repeatedly rejected the argument that \u201cretroactive\u201d application of \u00a7 9711(h)(4) offends a defendant\u2019s due process and equal protection rights, see Commonwealth v. Chambers, 546 Pa. 370, 685 A.2d 96, 101 (1996), and has held that application of \u00a7 9711(h)(4) is constitutionally permissible. Commonwealth v. Young, 536 Pa. 57, 66, 637 A.2d 1313, 1317 (1993) (rejecting appellant\u2019s argument that retroactive application of \u00a7 9711(h) \u201cdeprived him of the right to have his death sentence automatically modified to life imprisonment and the right not to face the possibility of a death sentence\u201d). Lesko\u2019s \u201clife and liberty\u201d theory is of no discernible, qualitative difference. Accordingly, Lesko\u2019s underlying argument is -without merit, counsel was not ineffective, and the death penalty was an available sentence at the time of his second sentencing proceeding. We now turn to a consideration of trial counsel\u2019s performance during that proceeding.\nC. Failure to Present Additional. Mitigating Evidence\nThe PCRA court granted penalty phase relief on two different bases related to trial counsel\u2019s failure to present additional mitigating evidence. The first basis related to expert testimony that Lesko contends should have been presented and the second basis related to additional mitigating .evidence that Lesko avers should have been discovered and presented. As these bases provided distinct grounds for relief in the PCRA court\u2019s opinion, they will be discussed separately herein. We find that Lesko has not established that counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient. Alternatively, we conclude that Lesko has not established Strickland prejudice. In that alternative assessment of prejudice, we will examine whether both grounds considered by the PCRA court, when considered together, would command a finding of prejudice. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Johnson, 600 Pa. 329, 966 A.2d 523, 532 (2009) (\u201c[I]f multiple instances of deficient performance are found, the assessment of prejudice properly may be premised on cumulation.\u201d).\nRespecting the expert testimony claim, the Commonwealth argues that the PCRA court erred in granting Lesko a new penalty phase based on his claims that trial counsel was ineffective for, inter alia, (1) failing to retain an expert, namely, a neuropsychologist, who could have provided a reliable evaluation of Lesko\u2019s mental health and/or organic brain damage; and (2) retaining a clinical psychologist under circumstances, ie., insufficient preparation time and lack of material collateral information, which precluded the expert from conducting an appropriate evaluation and reaching a reliable diagnosis.\nIn addressing Lesko\u2019s claims, the PCRA court was persuaded by the fact that three years before the 1995 resentencing, trial counsel consulted University of Pittsburgh law professor Welsh White, Esquire, who provided counsel with literature linking child abuse to organic brain damage. Professor White also provided counsel with a sample motion to obtain psychological and neuropsychological testing of Lesko. Counsel agreed that this information would have been important to present to the jury. The PCRA court found that it was significant that counsel did not consult a neuropsychologist, but instead retained a clinical psychologist, Herbert Levit, Ph.D., on February 6, 1995, and did so only after jury selection had already begun for the resentencing and only three days before the resentencing trial commenced. Furthermore, the PCRA court noted that trial counsel did not specifically advise Dr. Levit that he knew of the link between abuse and organic brain damage, and that it may provide an area of relevant inquiry. As a result, the PCRA court determined that Dr. Levit conducted a standard mental status examination, which was not designed to detect either cognitive or organic brain dysfunction. PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 11.\nIn granting a new penalty hearing, the PCRA court also considered the information that Dr. Levit did not review, which included any prior psychological or psychiatric evaluations, trial transcripts or any of the discovery materials from the first proceeding, or any of the information in the Children and Youth Services (hereafter \u201cCYS\u201d) records that contained information concerning Lesko\u2019s life history. The PCRA court determined that Dr. Levit\u2019s expert opinion was based upon limited information.\nIn contrast, at the PCRA hearing, Lesko presented the testimony of Dr. Barry Crown, a neuropsychologist, who testified that both the institutional records and Dr. Levit\u2019s evaluation contained indicia of brain damage that would have been revealed with neuropsychological testing tools and a properly qualified and competent evaluator. Dr. Crown detailed at length his opinion of which records would be red flags to one trained to find organic brain damage. On further examination by the PCRA court, Dr. Crown opined that he would have expected Dr. Levit to have responded to the red flags and suggested neuropsychological testing as the \u201cprudent thing to do.\u201d In Dr. Crown\u2019s view, such red flags included Lesko\u2019s unusual gait, exhibiting some form of psycho-motor difficulty at an early age; Lesko\u2019s experience in uninhabitable and deplorable housing conditions; the general and continuous neglect of Lesko\u2019s and his siblings\u2019 health; and the fact that he was set on fire by boys in the neighborhood, which resulted in a one-month stay in the hospital. Dr. Crown explained that these childhood circumstances were significant because the combination of \u201cgeneral neglect\u201d and \u201ca young child under stress, we know ... produces difficulties at critical stages in brain development.\u201d N.T., 3/22/01, at 403, 404, 407, and 412, 448-49.\nDr. Crown also enumerated significant facts that he said were contained in the records: e.g., Lesko suffered from childhood insomnia, hyperactivity and headaches; he was described as having \u201cepisodic dyscontrol,\u201d a form of organically impaired impulse control; he chronically suffered from inadequate nutrition; his mother was a chronic drinker, indicating that Lesko may have been subject to fetal alcohol involvement; a long and continuing history of high fevers and ear problems; and multiple indications of head trauma. The records also contained references to a long history of voluntary drug and alcohol abuse and exposure to environmental toxins. Furthermore, Dr. Crown noted that the records disclosed a history of blackouts, which would also indicate alcohol-related brain cell damage. According to Dr. Crown, this information should have alerted Dr. Levit that neuropsychological testing was warranted.\nDr. Crown also offered his opinion of the information provided by Dr. Levit, opining that the results of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (\u201cWAIS\u201d) intelligence test that was administered by Dr. Levit revealed neuropsychologically significant evidence of brain damage. According to Dr. Crown, not only did the test scoring suggest the need for further testing, but it was itself \u201ca pathognomic sign[, m]eaning that it represents the very strong possibility and likelihood of a pathology, of an impairment, of a deficit\u201d and \u201cwould be an extremely strong indicator of ... the strong likelihood of organic brain damage.\u201d N.T., 3/22/01, at 383. Similarly, the results of Dr. Levit\u2019s administration of the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test and the House-Tree-Person Test provided data that Dr. Crown believed suggested the need for further neuropsychological testing. Dr. Crown also testified that Dr. Levit\u2019s diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder raised important issues relating to the possibility of brain damage, since the symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder substantially overlap the behavioral manifestations of organic brain damage. Accordingly, in Dr. Crown\u2019s opinion, Dr. Levit\u2019s diagnosis, although limited, was yet another sign that Lesko was suffering from organic brain damage.\nIn its opinion, the PCRA court also noted that the CYS records (that were not provided to the defense until the April 2002 PCRA hearing) contained substantial evidence to support a conclusion that further neuropsychological testing was indicated. Among the indicators were the results of intelligence tests by school psychologists that were significantly similar to the most recent test results, and evidence that Lesko\u2019s siblings also suffered from brain damage, dysfunction and mental retardation.\nFinally, the PCRA court noted that Dr. Crown had administered a complete neuropsychological test battery to Lesko. As a result of those tests, Dr. Crown concluded to a reasonable degree of neuropsychological certainty that Lesko was brain damaged, and was brain damaged at the time of this murder. Dr. Crown offered an opinion that the type of brain damage he detected supported two mitigating circumstances-that Lesko suffered from an extreme emotional disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(2), and that he had a significant impairment in his ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(3). The PCRA court further noted that the Commonwealth did not offer any expert testimony in opposition to Dr. Crown\u2019s diagnosis and was unable to discredit Dr. Crown\u2019s methodology or conclusions on cross-examination.\nBased on the foregoing, the PCRA court concluded that, \u201cthe testimony of a neuropsychologist at the sentencing hearing with regard to [Lesko\u2019s] organic brain damage would have added significant additional and relevant information for the jury to consider as it weighed mitigating factors against the aggravating factors.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 16. The court then framed the question relating to counsel\u2019s strategy and performance as whether counsel had any reasonable basis for having retained a clinical psychologist rather than a neuropsychologist to develop the mental health mitigation. Concluding that trial counsel had offered no reason for failing to hire a neuropsychologist, despite Professor White\u2019s guidance, the court concluded that trial counsel did not act \u201cresponsibly\u201d. See id. at 20. Finally, the PCRA court concluded that trial counsel presented a \u201cpaltry\u201d amount of mitigating evidence, when measured against the overwhelming amount of evidence that counsel could have presented, and then awarded Lesko a new penalty hearing.\nTurning to the appellate arguments presented by the Commonwealth, the first assertion is directed at the reasonableness of trial counsel\u2019s conduct. The Commonwealth suggests that counsel purposely waited until the last minute to secure Dr. Levit so that Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony that Lesko suffered from polysubstance abuse, a borderline personality disorder, and a poor upbringing could be \u201csprung\u201d on the Commonwealth, which would then be denied the opportunity to retain its own expert to evaluate Lesko in an attempt to rebut Dr. Levit\u2019s medical opinion.\nWith respect to the PCRA court\u2019s determination that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to retain the services of a neuropsychologist to present evidence that Lesko suffered from organic brain damage, the Commonwealth points out that Lesko was examined by mental health professionals in Indiana County and Westmoreland County, and neither offered any indication that Lesko was brain damaged. The Commonwealth further contends that any fault in failing to raise the issue of organic brain damage \u201cshould be at the feet of Dr. Levit who was the retained expert. If Dr. Levit had insufficient information, that fact should have been made known to [counsel] who would have taken appropriate action.\u201d With respect to Lesko\u2019s claim that counsel failed to recognize the relationship between child neglect and child abuse and brain damage, and thereby failed to direct Dr. Levit to undertake such an inquiry, the Commonwealth responds \u201cit is not the function of trial counsel to play mental health expert and direct the expert. Rather, the precise point of hiring an expert is to permit him to investigate and evaluate the case as the expert sees fit.\u201d Brief of the Commonwealth, at 54-55, 57.\nThe Commonwealth also disputes the PCRA court\u2019s finding that Lesko was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to present a neuropsychologist at Lesko\u2019s resentencing, asserting that Lesko failed to show that testimony such as that proffered by Dr. Crown would have offered \u201ca potential for success substantially greater than the course actually pursued.\u201d Id. at 54 (emphasis omitted). In support of its position, the Commonwealth notes that Dr. Levit causally related Lesko\u2019s disorder to genetics and the extremely dysfunctional nature of his upbringing. According to the Commonwealth, Dr. Crown\u2019s opinion that Lesko suffers from brain damage \u201cis merely to take the same facts and attach an additional label to them.\u201d Id. at 51.\nThe PCRA court\u2019s opinion is detailed and thoughtful in almost all regards on the instant issue and, indeed, on most of the issues it addressed. Nevertheless, we find multiple errors in the PCRA court\u2019s analysis of this question, since it placed the burden of an expert\u2019s knowledge on counsel\u2019s shoulders and framed the reasonable strategy question narrowly without considering the course actually pursued by counsel at the resentencing.\nWhen evaluating ineffectiveness claims, \u201cjudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Indeed, few tenets are better settled than the presumption that counsel is effective. Commonwealth v. Daniels, 600 Pa. 1, 963 A.2d 409, 427 (2009). This presumption arises from the recognition that it is all too easy for the defendant or the court to second-guess a strategy that has proven unsuccessful. Rather, a reviewing court must make every effort \u201cto eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cGenerally, where matters of strategy and tactics are concerned, counsel\u2019s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective if he chose a particular course that had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests.\u201d Commonwealth v. Puksar, 597 Pa. 240, 951 A.2d 267, 277 (2008) (quoting Commonwealth v. Miller, 572 Pa. 623, 819 A.2d 504, 517 (2002)). The U.S. Supreme Court explained a reviewing court\u2019s role in making this determination when it stated:\n[t]he court should keep in mind that counsel\u2019s function, as elaborated in prevailing professional norms, is to make the adversarial testing process work in a particular case. At the same time, the court should recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052.\nBut, it is also well-settled under the Sixth Amendment that capital counsel has an obligation to conduct a reasonably thorough investigation for mitigating evidence or to make reasonable decisions that make further investigation unnecessary. Commonwealth v. Sattazahn, 597 Pa. 648, 952 A.2d 640, 655 (2008). In evaluating a claim of constitutional deficiency in investigating and presenting mitigation evidence, we consider a number of factors, including the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s investigation, the mitigation evidence that was actually presented, and the additional or different mitigation evidence that could have been presented. Collins, 888 A.2d at 580. None of these factors is, by itself, dispositive, because even if the investigation conducted by counsel was unreasonable, this fact alone will not result in relief if the defendant cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s conduct. Id.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court recently clarified the interaction between the performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland in instances where there was a finding that counsel\u2019s investigation was unreasonable. See Sears v. Upton, \u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3259, 177 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2010). In Sears, trial counsel employed a mitigation strategy of showing that Sears was from a stable, middle class family, who were shocked and dismayed by his actions and who would be devastated by the imposition of a death sentence. On collateral review, evidence emerged showing that Sears came from an abusive home life, had behavior problems from a very young age, and suffered from \u201csignificant frontal lobe abnormalities.\u201d Id. at 3262. None of this evidence, however, was known to trial counsel, and the state post-conviction court determined that counsel\u2019s investigation was inadequate. The state post-conviction court, however, did not grant relief because counsel had presented a mitigation theory with evidence to support it. Thus, the court concluded that Sears had \u201cfailed to meet his burden of proving that there is a reasonable likelihood that the outcome at trial would have been different if a different mitigation theory had been advanced.\u201d Id. at 3264-65 (citing state post-conviction court opinion).\nIn vacating the state court, the High Court explained that if the reviewing court determines that counsel\u2019s investigation was unreasonable, a \u201cmore probing prejudice\u201d inquiry may be necessary, because a finding that counsel had conducted a constitutionally deficient investigation should call into question the reasonableness of the theory or theories that counsel pursued in mitigation. See id. at 3265. Explaining this point further, the Court indicated that pursuing a theory that might be reasonable in the abstract, \u201cdoes not obviate the need to analyze whether counsel\u2019s failure to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation before arriving at whether this particular theory prejudiced [the appellant].....Sears might be prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failures, whether his haphazard choice was reasonable or not.\u201d Id. In light of these teachings, we first concern ourselves with counsel\u2019s performance, i.e., whether counsel conducted an adequate mitigation investigation.\nWe begin by noting that this is not an instance where counsel failed to conduct any investigation and presented limited mitigating evidence, see Commonwealth v. Malloy, 579 Pa. 425, 856 A.2d 767, 787-88 (2004); nor is it a case where counsel conducted minimal investigation and failed to uncover evidence that was immediately available to him. Instead, it is a case where counsel undertook a reasonable investigation and presented a compelling and partly successful case in mitigation, albeit the defense case did not ultimately carry the day.\nCounsel presented the testimony of Dr. Levit, a clinical and forensic psychologist, at the resentencing hearing. Counsel established that Dr. Levit had been qualified as an expert witness in \u201cseveral hundred\u201d court proceedings and had \u201ctestified in many dozens of battered women homicides, have [sic] seen other types of homicide cases.\u201d Dr. Levit testified that he interviewed Lesko and his family members, reviewed the available social history, and conducted psychological testing of Lesko. He also stated that one of the tests administered was sensitive to neurological impairment and was used to determine whether or not there was any organic brain damage. Dr. Levit opined that Lesko\u2019s mental deficiencies were a combination of perhaps some genetic problems and his distressing home life. Additionally, he diagnosed Lesko with a borderline personality disorder resulting in extremely erratic and explosive behavior. Dr. Levit also opined that at the time the murders occurred, Lesko was suffering from voluntary polysubstance abuse, which included the use of illicit drugs and the excessive use of alcohol. As a direct result of Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony, the jury found as a mitigating circumstance that Lesko was under the influence of extreme emotional or mental disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(2). N.T., 2/15/1995, at 681, 685-86, 694, 701, 703-04.\nTrial counsel also presented extensive social history through the testimony of a forensic social worker, Lois Nardone, and this information was given to Dr. Levit for purposes of diagnosis. Ms. Nardone, like Dr. Levit, testified that she conducted a number of interviews with Lesko and his family members as well as other persons involved in Lesko\u2019s life. Significantly, Ms. Nardone testified that Lesko was abused by his grandfather every day; his mother was extremely promiscuous and had sex with strange men in front of her children; his mother left the children unattended for days at a time; his housing conditions were \u201cdeplorable;\u201d at the age of five Lesko was set on fire by another child and was hospitalized for thirty-three days; at age six Lesko was sexually molested by a man; and Lesko and his siblings were frequently left unfed, dirty, and not properly clothed. N.T., 2/14/1995, at 582, 585-88. This small sampling of Ms. Nardone\u2019s testimony gives a sense of what led to the jury\u2019s determination that Lesko had a horrible childhood under the statutory catchall mitigator, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8). Contrary to the PCRA court\u2019s legal findings, and mindful of the deference due to counsel, we believe that the record shows that trial counsel undertook a reasonable investigation, presenting an extensive psychological and social history in support of specific statutory mitigators, which made \u201cthe adversarial testing process work in [this] particular case;\u201d in short, counsel \u201cchose a particular course that had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests.\u201d Strickland, supra; Puksar, supra.\nTo the extent that the PCRA court specifically faulted trial counsel for failing to consult with a neuropsychologist, we caution that, in applying Strickland, courts must be careful not to conflate the roles and professional obligations of experts and lawyers. In this regard, it is telling that Dr. Crown\u2019s testimony at the PCRA hearing was directed at the examination conducted by Dr. Levit and not the strategy of counsel; thus, Dr. Crown opined that the results of some of the testing conducted by Dr. Levit raised \u201cred flags,\u201d which indicated that neuropsychological testing should be conducted. Certainly, these psychological \u201cred flags\u201d could not be directed at counsel, who was unschooled in mental health matters, but were directed at Dr. Levit. In fact, by the neuropsychologist\u2019s own testimony, the diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder\u2014 a diagnosis made by Dr. Levit, not trial counsel \u2014 should have raised a question relating to the possibility of brain damage. Again, such opinions, if valid, may call into question Dr. Levit\u2019s professional performance, but that is not the same thing as providing a basis to fault trial counsel\u2019s legal performance.\nThe CO/DO posits that trial counsel should have provided Dr. Levit with additional documents of Lesko\u2019s childhood abuse and neglect and such documents may have resulted in new or additional diagnoses of Lesko, including probable brain damage and substantial impairment in the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct. The record shows, however, that Dr. Levit possessed information related to Lesko\u2019s childhood abuse and neglect and that he used that information in forming his opinion. See id. at 685-86, 701-04. Additionally, Dr. Levit testified that Lesko was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, opining that Lesko\u2019s \u201ccapacity to formulate good judgmental decisions\u201d was highly questionable and that his ability to conform to the requirements of the law \u201cwas justly impaired.\u201d Id. at 705-06. Accordingly, and again mindful of the deference to counsel that Strickland commands, we find that Lesko has failed to sustain his burden of proving the performance prong of Strickland. We note also that this case is distinct from the situation the High Court addressed in its recent Sears opinion because we find that counsel\u2019s mitigation investigation and performance were reasonable under the Sixth Amendment.\nFurthermore, even if we were to accept the PCRA court\u2019s conclusion that counsel\u2019s investigation was unreasonable and constitutionally deficient, and that there was some basis in law to say that lawyers are obliged to consult neuropsychologists, rather than clinical psychologists, in circumstances like these, we do not agree with the PCRA court that Lesko established that he was prejudiced under Strickland.\nThe Strickland test for prejudice requires the defendant to prove actual prejudice, that is, a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s lapse, the result of the penalty proceeding would have been different. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cIn making this determination, a court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury---Moreover, a verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\u201d Id. at 695-96, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (emphasis added). Ultimately, a reviewing court must question the reliability of the proceedings and ask whether \u201cthe result of the particular proceeding [was] unreliable because of a breakdown in the adversarial process that our system counts on to produce just results.\u201d Id. at 696, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Notably, in applying these concepts to the case before it, the Strickland Court ultimately determined that additional evidence of \u201cnumerous people\u201d who thought the defendant Washington was a good person and the fact that a psychiatrist and a psychologist believed he was under considerable emotional stress did not establish a reasonable probability that the outcome of the penalty proceeding would have been different, given the overwhelming aggravating factors presented. Id. at 700, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In our view, Lesko has not established that the resentencing proceeding was rendered unreliable by counsel\u2019s alleged lapse. This was a jury that found four mitigating factors, relating to two distinct statutory mitigating circumstances. Thus, the jury was engaged in a balancing of aggravators and mitigators, yet voted for death (just as Lesko\u2019s first sentencing jury had). To find Strickland prejudice arising from the failure alleged herein, we must conclude that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, absent counsel\u2019s failure to present the mitigation evidence he currently proffers, [Lesko] would have been able to prove at least one [more] mitigating circumstance by a preponderance of the evidence and that at least one jury member would have concluded that the mitigating circumstance(s) outweighed the aggravating circumstance(s).\u201d Commonwealth v. Brown, 582 Pa. 461, 872 A.2d 1139, 1150-51 (2005) (citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)).\nThe U.S. Supreme Court recently applied the. Strickland prejudice test in a context involving a defendant who, like Lesko, had committed multiple, heinous crimes. See Smith v. Spisak, \u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 676, 175 L.Ed.2d 595 (2010). In analyzing Spisak\u2019s claim that his trial counsel\u2019s closing argument was constitutionally inadequate, the Court reiterated the Strickland standard discussed herein and presumed, for \u201cpresent purposes,\u201d that counsel\u2019s performance was inadequate. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that there was not a reasonable probability that a better closing argument would have made a significant difference in the outcome. In reaching this conclusion, the Court considered the context of the case, which included Spisak\u2019s admission and supporting testimony that he committed three murders and attempted to commit two others. The Court stressed that at the time of the sentencing the jurors had fresh in their minds the government\u2019s evidence regarding the killings as well as Spisak\u2019s \u201cboastful and unrepentant confessions and his threats to commit further acts of violence.\u201d The Court also noted that the defense experts\u2019 testimony, which was offered to show that Spisak suffered from a mental infirmity, was fresh in the jurors\u2019 minds; and, the Court did not \u201csee how it could have made a significant difference had counsel gone beyond his actual argument \u2014 which emphasized mental illness as a mitigating factor and referred the jury to the experts\u2019 testimony\u2014 by repeating the facts or connections that the experts had just described.\u201d Id. at 687-88. Notably, even the concurrence by Justice Stevens, which stressed \u201chow thoroughly egregious counsel\u2019s closing argument was,\u201d ultimately concluded that Spisak was not entitled to relief in light of Spisak\u2019s testimony and his \u201cmonstrous\u201d crimes. Id. at 693.\nThe case sub judice obviously is not on all fours with the situation in Spisak. Most importantly, in this case we consider a claim of an allegedly incomplete mitigation presentation, and not a deficient jury argument. But, the opinion is instructive as to how this Court should address the question of prejudice under Strickland. The Spisak Court made clear that the prejudice analysis must be viewed in the context of the case; and in this case, the developed penalty-related facts were grim indeed.\nPrior to his resentencing, Lesko was convicted of two other murders committed the same week as this murder. These circumstances were unique and distinguished Lesko from the majority of other first-degree murderers. These murders provided the bases for the jury\u2019s finding of the (d)(9) (significant history of violent felony convictions) and (d)(10) (multiple murder) aggravators. As if this unique criminal history was not weighty enough, in this case, Lesko was convicted for his participation in the first-degree murder of an unsuspecting on-duty policeman who did nothing more than pull over the car in which Lesko was driving. This fact provided the jury with a third, powerful aggravating circumstance \u2014 that the victim was a police officer killed in the performance of his duties, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(1).\nFurthermore, based on counsel\u2019s presentation, the jury had found that Lesko was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, \u00a7 9711(e)(2), and it is entirely speculative how much more weight the testimony of a neuropsychologist such as Dr. Crown would have lent to this mitigator already found. Of course, it is possible that opinion testimony on brain damage from a neuropsychologist might persuade a juror that Lesko was unable to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law under Section 9711(e)(3). But, Lesko must also show that there is a reasonable probability that, in the overall evaluation, at least one jury member would have concluded that the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating circumstances.\nFaced with the aggravating circumstances where the defendant has been found guilty of multiple murders occurring within a one-week period, including the cold-blooded murder of an on-duty police officer, and the case in mitigation already successfully presented, we simply cannot conclude that Strickland relief can be premised upon the additional mitigation evidence the PCRA court found would have carried the day. The PCRA court failed to consider the full context of the case in rendering its finding as to Strickland prejudice. We do not believe there is a reasonable probability that further expert opinion evidence, including evidence of Lesko\u2019s \u201corganic brain damage\u201d would have resulted in a different weighing and different penalty verdict when the aggravating circumstances were so patently grave, and the jury already found substantial mitigating factors, only to return with a verdict of death. This was not an instance where the sentence of death was \u201conly weakly supported by the record.\u201d Instead, it was a situation where the sentence was imposed with \u201coverwhelming record support.\u201d See Strickland, supra. Accordingly, Lesko has not proven that the outcome of the proceedings would have differed, but for counsel\u2019s supposed failure.\nThe other mitigating evidence basis cited by the PCRA court, even when considered in tandem with the evidence of organic brain damage, likewise fails to provide a basis for Strickland relief. At the PCRA hearing, Lesko proffered the evidence contained in the CYS records and argued that counsel should have presented a number of live witnesses to relate that evidence. This information included details regarding the deplorable housing conditions in which Lesko and his siblings lived as children, and also detailed abuse and neglect at the hand of their mother. This abuse and neglect led to Lesko and his brother being placed in a shelter and later at the Holy-Family Institute. At the PCRA hearing, Lesko offered samplings of this live testimony, producing witnesses that he alleges resentencing counsel should have presented.\nA similar argument was recently rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in its per curiam order in Bobby v. Van Hook, \u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 13, 175 L.Ed.2d 255 (2009). The petitioner in Bobby, like Lesko, alleged that there was additional mitigating evidence that trial counsel should have uncovered. Specifically, the petitioner alleged that trial counsel should have interviewed other family members as well as a psychiatrist who treated his mother, all of whom could have \u201chave helped his counsel narrate the true story of [the petitioner\u2019s] childhood experiences.\u201d In rejecting the claim, the Court returned to the standard announced in Strickland, explaining:\nThis is not a case in which the defendant\u2019s attorneys failed to act while potentially powerful mitigating evidence stared them in the face, or would have been apparent from documents any reasonable attorney would have obtained. It is instead a case, like Strickland itself, in which defense counsel\u2019s \u201cdecision not to seek more\u201d mitigating evidence from the defendant\u2019s background \u201cthan was already in hand\u201d fell \u201cwell within the range of professionally reasonable judgments.\u201d\nBobby, 130 S.Ct. at 19 (citations omitted). Like the High Court in Bobby, we find that Lesko cannot establish that counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable.\nAgain, however, even if it is assumed that counsel\u2019s performance fell below the Strickland threshold, any assessment of prejudice must recognize that much of this childhood information was already admitted through the testimony of Ms. Nardone, discussed previously. Indeed, the jury found that evidence of Lesko\u2019s \u201chorrible\u201d childhood was a mitigating factor. Notably, under similar circumstances, the Strickland court did not find prejudice where the \u201cproposed evidence would barely have altered the sentencing profile presented to the sentencing judge.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 699-700, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In our judgment, there is not a reasonable probability that a life sentence would have been returned if only the mitigation evidence presented at trial had been supplemented by the mitigation evidence presented at the PCRA hearing, particularly given the strength of the aggravating circumstances detailed above. ' Accordingly, we conclude that the PCRA court erred in granting a new penalty hearing.\nWe now turn to the remaining penalty phase contentions Lesko raises on cross-appeal, which the PCRA court dismissed after considering them in its opinion.\nD. Failure to \u201cFully Litigate\u201d Claim that Prosecutor Improperly Commented on Lesko\u2019s Silence\nThe first alternative issue on which Lesko claims penalty phase relief is due relates to the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Lesko at the resentencing and the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments related to the same testimony. Lesko contends that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination and comments violated his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and prejudicially undercut the testimony given by both Lesko and Dr. Levit at the resentencing. According to Lesko, the Third Circuit granted him a new sentencing hearing on a similar claim implicating his right to remain silent. Additionally, at the resentencing \u201cthe prosecutor flouted [the Third Circuit\u2019s] ruling, improperly commenting on and questioning [Lesko] about his right to remain silent, employing in this violation testimony from the 1981 proceedings that had been reversed [sic] on these very grounds.\u201d Brief of Appellant Lesko at 33. Lesko acknowledges that counsel objected to the cross-examination and moved for a mistrial and also recognizes that counsel renewed the claim on direct appeal, but asserts that counsel had no strategic basis for \u201cnot fully litigating this claim\u201d by failing to explain the \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s improper comment on his right to remain silent. Id. at 86.\nBefore turning to the legal issue presented, some background is in order. Lesko did not testify at the guilt phase of his 1981 trial, but did testify at the penalty phase, limiting his testimony to matters concerning his personal background. During his habeas proceedings, Lesko forwarded a claim that the prosecutor\u2019s penalty phase closing argument violated the Fifth Amendment when he commented on Lesko\u2019s mitigating evidence as follows:\nGood character and record. All of the character witnesses limited their testimony to a certain period of time. We heard about John Lesko up to a certain point.\nAuid I want you to consider that. John Lesko took the witness stand, and you\u2019ve got to consider his arrogance. He told you how rough it was, how he lived in hell, and he didn\u2019t even have the common decency to say I\u2019m sorry for what I did. I don\u2019t want you to put me to death, but I\u2019m not even going to say that I\u2019m sorry.\nLesko v. Lehman, 925 F.2d at 1540. Lesko argued to the Third Circuit that the prosecutor\u2019s statement about his failure to express remorse violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination.\nThe Third Circuit agreed. The Third Circuit rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were an appropriate comment on Lesko\u2019s demeanor at trial, after examining the substance of Lesko\u2019s testimony. The federal court explained that Lesko had testified only to his deprived childhood and family background, but did not testify concerning the merits of the charges against him. According to the court, the \u201cnatural and necessary interpretation\u201d of the prosecutor\u2019s comments was that Lesko had a moral and legal obligation to address the charges against him and apologize for the crime. Thus, the comments amounted to a condemnation of Lesko\u2019s failure to testify about his role in the events surrounding the murder; yet, such testimony could have been self-incriminating. Therefore, the Third Circuit determined that the comments violated due process as they penalized Lesko\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Lesko v. Lehman, 925 F.2d at 1544-45.\nLesko uses the Third Circuit\u2019s analysis as a springboard for his instant claim, urging this Court to view the circumstances at the resentencing in the same manner as the circumstances discussed above. But the circumstances at the resentencing were very different. Lesko testified at the resentencing hearing, claiming that he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol at the time of the murder. Dr. Levit indirectly corroborated this testimony with his opinion that Lesko was a polysubstance abuser during the relevant period. On cross-examination of Lesko, the prosecutor attempted to undermine Lesko\u2019s credibility by pointing out that, at the 1981 penalty phase hearing, Lesko had testified but had said nothing about being under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time Travaglia and he murdered Officer Miller. Trial counsel initially objected when the prosecutor pursued this impeachment, but was overruled by the trial court, and counsel failed to renew the objection when the prosecutor continued this line of questioning. The prosecutor returned to this subject during his closing argument when he asserted that it was telling that Lesko had not testified to his drug and alcohol abuse during the 1981 sentencing proceeding, by stating:\nDon\u2019t you think that would be important when you committed these homicides ... to tell the jury that I was drunk, that I had drugs and didn\u2019t know what I was doing, don\u2019t you think that would be something you would remember? ... After 15 years, he\u2019s remembered that detail.- He remembers all of his drug and alcohol abuse ... but in 1981, he didn\u2019t mention a word to the jury about that, a word. What other defense is there? He forgot this defense.\nN.T., 2/16/1995, at 173. Trial counsel objected and moved for a mistrial after the prosecutor completed the closing argument, but the motion for a mistrial was denied.\nAccording to Lesko, the error at the resentencing was the same error on which the Third Circuit granted conditional penalty phase relief, since the prosecutor again improperly commented on his right to remain silent at his 1981 trial when the prosecutor asked him about his failure to testify as to his drug and alcohol use at those proceedings.\nThe PCRA court concluded that this issue was previously-litigated on direct appeal when Lesko presented the argument that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument amounted to an impermissible comment on his right to remain silent. 719 A.2d at 221-222. Lesko, however, has presented this collateral claim in terms of ineffective assistance of direct appeal counsel, which requires a more precise examination. See Collins, supra.\nNevertheless, Lesko has failed to demonstrate that direct appeal counsel\u2019s performance concerning this issue was deficient for the same reasons the Fifth Amendment claim was rejected on direct appeal. Namely, on direct appeal following resentencing, this Court properly focused on the fact that the circumstances addressed by the Third Circuit and those raised at resentencing were distinct. This Court noted that Lesko\u2019s testimony on his supposed voluntary intoxication was offered to establish a mitigating circumstance. See Lesko, 719 A.2d at 222. Furthermore, we specifically acknowledged that the Third Circuit had granted Lesko conditional penalty phase relief from his first sentence of death premised on a perceived due process violation due to the prosecutor\u2019s comment on silence as to remorse. Nonetheless, we pointed out that the Third Circuit\u2019s relief was based on the limited nature of Lesko\u2019s penalty phase testimony at the 1981 trial, during which he did not discuss the nature of the charges against him. At the resentencing, however, the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination and commentary addressed only the credibility of the testimony that Lesko actually provided at that proceeding; and the Third Circuit itself had specifically noted that Lesko could not \u201cclaim a Fifth Amendment privilege against cross-examination or prosecutorial comment on matters reasonably related to his credibility or the subject matter of his testimony.\u201d Lesko, 719 A.2d at 222 (quoting Lesko v. Lehman, 925 F.2d at 1542). Thus, we held that the Commonwealth\u2019s cross-examination and closing argument were proper because they were directed at testing the veracity of the testimony that Lesko had actually presented respecting his voluntary intoxication. Id.\nHaving failed in his direct appeal challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s impeachment, Lesko now forwards a derivative ineffectiveness claim based upon the very same circumstances. Lesko faults counsel for failing to object on the ground that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning and comments improperly undermined the credibility of Lesko and his expert, Dr. Levit. This derivative argument, although sounding in the Sixth Amendment, adds nothing to the substance of the underlying Fifth Amendment claim that was addressed and rejected on the merits on the resentencing direct appeal. Lesko does not aver that this Court\u2019s reasoning on direct appeal was flawed or that counsel did not set forth the correct legal argument in support of his Fifth Amendment claim. Indeed, Lesko does not acknowledge or address this Court\u2019s reasoning on the resentencing appeal. Instead, he simply declares, without explanation, that counsel did not fully develop the \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s comments, without even accounting for counsel\u2019s argument.\nThe current focus of Lesko\u2019s claim does not establish arguable merit for a claim of ineffectiveness deriving from an underlying claim previously rejected on the merits. The fact remains that Lesko opened the door to the voluntary intoxication impeachment at resentencing, and there is nothing improper in a party attempting to undermine the credibility of testimony through impeachment by noting a failure to forward a claim or defense during prior testimony on the same subject. Cf. Harrison v. U.S., 392 U.S. 219, 222, 88 S.Ct. 2008, 20 L.Ed.2d 1047 (1968) (\u201cA defendant who chooses to testify waives his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination with respect to the testimony he gives.... \u201d). Furthermore, the fact that properly admitted evidence is \u201cprejudicial\u201d is no basis for its exclusion. Accordingly, Lesko has not demonstrated that counsel was ineffective in failing to \u201cfully\u201d argue this issue on direct appeal.\nE. Failure to Object to Commentary on Lack of Remorse\nLesko next argues that the prosecutor objectionably elicited evidence of, and then commented on, his lack of remorse at the time of arrest and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to properly preserve an objection and pursue the issue on direct appeal. This argument involves Commonwealth witness Detective Frank Amity, who testified at the resentencing that Lesko gave police a statement after his arrest for the murder of Peter Levato, and after he had been given Miranda warnings. After Detective Amity read Lesko\u2019s statement into the record, the prosecutor asked the detective what Lesko\u2019s \u201cdemeanor\u201d was at the time of this interview. Detective Amity responded, \u201cI couldn\u2019t see where he had any remorse over what he did.\u201d N.T., 2/10/1995, at 62. Trial counsel objected, and the trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury \u201cto disregard the statement.\u201d Id. at 62-63. The prosecutor then cautioned the detective not to offer a conclusion, and rephrased his question, not in terms of demeanor, but in terms of what Lesko expressed during the interview: \u201c[w]as there any remorse expressed by him at this interview?\u201d Detective Amity responded, \u201cno.\u201d Id. at 63. This time, counsel did not object. Thereafter, however, counsel requested a mistrial, asserting that the prosecutor \u201csnuck in\u201d the testimony of absence of remorse. The prosecutor responded he did not \u201cprompt Detective Amity in any way in terms of telling him to say there was no remorse\u201d and also stated that it was not prejudicial because the issue was made relevant by the defense argument that Lesko had shown remorse. The trial court denied the motion for a mistrial. The prosecutor referred to the exchange in closing, asserting that Lesko\u2019s \u201cattitude\u201d had not changed while he was in prison.\nAccording to Lesko, this line of inquiry and comment improperly introduced a non-statutory aggravating circumstance (absence of remorse) for the jury\u2019s consideration. Lesko avers that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the second exchange was \u201cinexplicable\u201d and then he declares that counsel could have had no reasonable strategy for failing to object and for failing to pursue the claim on appeal.\nThe Commonwealth responds that the evidence and commentary it produced on Lesko\u2019s lack of remorse was a fair and proper response to the defense penalty phase opening, and Lesko\u2019s subsequent testimony, that Lesko felt remorse for his crimes. The PCRA court likewise concluded that the underlying issue was without merit because Lesko had put his remorse at issue.\nIn a brief, final paragraph of his argument Lesko responds that the PCRA court erred in holding that he opened the door to rebuttal evidence on remorse because it was \u201csimply impermissible\u201d for the Commonwealth to rebut his remorse mitigation evidence with evidence concerning his silence at the time of his arrest. Brief of Appellant Lesko, at 38-39. In support of this argument, Lesko cites to Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.S. 348, 354, 116 S.Ct. 1373, 134 L.Ed.2d 498 (1996), for the boilerplate proposition that the right to remain silent \u201cwithout penalty for doing so\u201d is a fundamental trial right.\nLesko\u2019s primary underlying argument, i.e., that rebuttal evidence about his lack of remorse violated his constitutional rights by introducing a non-statutory aggravating circumstance, is meritless. In general, the credibility of a witness may be impeached by any evidence relevant to the issue, except as provided by statute or rule. See Pa.R.E. 607(b). Relevant evidence is defined as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact ... more probable or less probable....\u201d Pa.R.E. 401. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has indicated that a defendant cannot claim a Fifth Amendment privilege against cross-examination or prosecutorial comment on matters reasonably related to his credibility or the subject matter of his testimony. See Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231, 235-36, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 65 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980); Harrison, supra.\nIn this case, Lesko produced affirmative evidence of his remorse as a mitigating circumstance, and counsel argued the point in both opening and closing to the jury. The Commonwealth obviously was entitled to challenge the sincerity of the late expression, no less than it was entitled to rebut his testimony of voluntary intoxication by noting the failure to forward that claim when he testified at the first sentencing proceeding. See Lesko, 719 A.2d at 222. Rebuttal of mitigation evidence does not introduce a non-statutory, additional aggravating circumstance; hence, Lesko\u2019s claim of counsel ineffectiveness fails.\nOf course, the question of whether the particular manner of rebuttal here was proper, a point which Lesko adds in the final paragraph of his argument, is different and distinct. As noted, Lesko argues that rebutting his claim of remorse with evidence of his failure to express remorse at the time of his arrest was improper because admitting such evidence is \u201csimply impermissible.\u201d Lesko does not develop this absolutist argument any further, and it was not addressed by the Commonwealth or the PCRA court.\nThe PCRA court\u2019s failure to address this sub-argument no doubt resulted from the confusing and prolix nature of Lesko\u2019s filings below. Lesko did not raise this sub-issue in his initial PCRA petition; instead, his complaint tracked his primary theory that the Commonwealth injected an improper aggravating circumstance by rebutting his expression of remorse. In his second supplement to the petition, Lesko did include a one-paragraph argument stating that comments on a defendant\u2019s failure to express remorse violate the Fifth Amendment. Notably for present purposes, however, Lesko did not specifically tie the argument to the right to remain silent at the time of arrest, as he does now. Rather, Lesko simply declared that, \u201chad [he] expressed remorse for the killing, the Commonwealth would have presented that as evidence of guilt at trial. Eliciting the absence of such a confession violates the Fifth Amendment and Article 1, Section 9 (a defendant \u2018cannot be compelled to give evidence against himself) as much at the guilt-stage as it does at sentence.\u201d Second Supplement at 32-33, \u00b6 610. Lesko then appended a general ineffectiveness paragraph to the entire claim two paragraphs later. It is not clear that the one-paragraph theory appended to Lesko\u2019s primary argument on appeal is the same as the one belatedly identified below; hence, the claim arguably is waived. See Pa.R.A.P. 302.\nIn any event, whether waived or not, the claim does not warrant a grant of relief. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a defendant\u2019s silence following Miranda warnings is \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d and thus cannot be used at trial for impeachment purposes. See Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). However, the High Court has also explained that if the defendant waives his right to be silent and talks to the police, as Lesko did here, then Doyle\u2019s prohibition does not apply to cross-examination that inquires into the prior statements. \u201cSuch questioning makes no unfair use of silence because a defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving Miranda warnings has not been induced to remain silent. As to the subject matter of his statements, the defendant has not remained silent at all.\u201d Anderson v. Charles, 447 U.S. 404, 408, 100 S.Ct. 2180, 65 L.Ed.2d 222 (per curiam) (1980). The Court has not clarified whether the Fifth Amendment prohibits using a defendant\u2019s failure to volunteer his remorse as a basis upon which to infer a lack of remorse. See, e.g., Mitchell v. United States, 526 U.S. 314, 330, 119 S.Ct. 1307, 143 L.Ed.2d 424 (1999) (\u201cWhether silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in \u00a7 3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question. It is not before us, and we express no view on it.\u201d). Lesko\u2019s absolutist argument fails to address these complexities.\nThe Fourth Circuit recently discussed the remorse question in United States v. Caro, 597 F.3d 608, 629 (4th Cir.2010), pointing out that there was a split of authority among the federal courts as to whether the Fifth Amendment prohibits using silence to show lack of remorse. Notably, the Caro court cited the Third Circuit Lesko decision as an example of a case opining that a defendant\u2019s failure to apologize, i.e., his silence as to remorse may not be considered as lack of remorse, consistently with the Fifth Amendment. But, the Caro court also noted that other circuits had concluded that silence may be considered as indicating a lack of remorse without violating the Fifth Amendment because lack of remorse speaks to other penological interests, such as a failure to accept responsibility for the crime, rehabilitation and deterrence. Thus, at the very least, the Fifth Amendment basis for objection posed by Lesko is not so easily determined as he would have it.\nFurther complicating any assessment of trial counsel\u2019s stewardship in failing to forward a Fifth Amendment-based objection to the reference to Lesko\u2019s failure to volunteer remorse when he spoke to the police is the state of the law in Pennsylvania at the time of resentencing. At that point, this Court had repeatedly held that a defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination had no application in the penalty phase of a capital trial. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Edmiston, 535 Pa. 210, 634 A.2d 1078 (1993); Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 502 Pa. 474, 467 A.2d 288 (1983). Indeed, we continued to follow this principle until Commonwealth v. Freeman, 573 Pa. 532, 827 A.2d 385 (2003), when we recognized that the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in 1981 that the Fifth Amendment privilege in fact applies to the penalty phase of capital trials:\nNotwithstanding the line of authority from this Court relied upon by the Commonwealth, it appears that the United States Supreme Court \u2014 the ultimate authority on Fifth Amendment questions \u2014 has indicated that the constitutional privilege does apply to the penalty phase of capital trials. See Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454, 462-63, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981) (\u201cWe can discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of [a] capital murder trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned.\u201d); see also Mitchell v. United States, 526 U.S. 314, 325, 119 S.Ct. 1307, 143 L.Ed.2d 424 (1999) (\u201cWhere a sentence has yet to be imposed ... this Court has already rejected the proposition that \u2018incrimination is complete once guilt has been adjudicated\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Estelle, 451 U.S. at 462,101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359).\n827 A.2d at 410. In posing his absolutist Fifth Amendment theory, and then claiming counsel was ineffective for not pursuing that theory, Lesko does not account for the complicating factor of the extant precedent of this Court in 1995.\nConsistently with Strickland, this Court has been wary of holding counsel ineffective for failing to object when the governing law was unsettled. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 604 Pa. 493, 986 A.2d 759, 801 (2009) (counsel not ineffective when his conduct was predicated on established law or when he failed to predict change in law). On the other hand, Estelle was the controlling U.S. Supreme Court authority on the question of the applicability of the Fifth Amendment privilege at capital penalty proceedings, and it was in existence at the time of resentencing. Of equal relevance, counsel had available to him the federal habeas opinion in this very case that he argued in the Third Circuit, where the court had parted ways with this Court\u2019s conclusion that Fifth Amendment violations were not cognizable in penalty phase proceedings, citing to Estelle. Moreover, although federal law was not clear then (nor is it now) respecting whether the Fifth Amendment prohibits the type of impeachment at issue in this case \u2014 where Lesko waived his Miranda rights and gave a police statement, but where the no remorse inference was being drawn from a failure to volunteer remorse \u2014 counsel again had to have been aware of the Third Circuit\u2019s holding in the habeas appeal in this case. Whether right or wrong, as discussed in our resolution of the prior issue, the Third Circuit held that the Commonwealth\u2019s argument at the first penalty phase that Lesko had failed to express remorse when he testified was an improper comment on his right against self-incrimination at trial. The panel viewed the commentary on remorse to be a matter going to the merits of the charges against Lesko, as to which he had a right to remain silent, and concluded that Lesko did not broach that subject merely because he had testified to his abusive childhood and family circumstances as mitigation evidence, while remaining silent concerning remorse.\nUnder these circumstances, and solely for purposes of decision, we will assume that counsel could have forwarded a Fifth Amendment-based objection to the form of the Commonwealth\u2019s manner of rebutting Lesko\u2019s expression of remorse, and we will assume further that such an objection might have been sustained because of the Third Circuit\u2019s conclusion in the habeas proceedings. Lesko\u2019s ineffectiveness claim nevertheless fails because he has not proven Strickland prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that the outcome of the resentencing proceeding would have been different but for this rebuttal.\nAs discussed previously, Lesko himself was permitted to testify as to his changed character and his remorse for his crimes, as a mitigating circumstance. Defense counsel also presented the testimony of Graterford Prison Chaplain Hamid Abdul, who supported Lesko\u2019s testimony by testifying as to Lesko\u2019s service to others during his incarceration on death row, the fact that he had found faith, and that Lesko was repentant. N.T., 2/14/1995, at 647-657. Lesko\u2019s expression of remorse was in the present tense, and was part of a larger claim that he was a changed person after being imprisoned on death row for fifteen years. Defense counsel\u2019s closing argument highlighted the theory when he stated, \u201c[w]e know that something has happened in the life of John Lesko in the prison in Graterford. We know that something happened.\u201d Counsel argued that there was \u201csomething vital happening\u201d in Lesko\u2019s life, noting that Chaplain Abdul had testified that Lesko had been affected by his life in prison in a positive manner. N.T., 2/16/1995, 187, 193. Concluding this line of argument, defense counsel stated:\nDo we see any of that in the life of John Lesko before say 1984, 1985? No. We see drugs. We see molestation. We see sex. Wee [sic] see despair. We see hopelessness. We see anger. We see rage, quiet rage, the worst kind of rage, internalized rage, quiet rage, the most deadly rage. Not once in the story presented to you did you hear of John Lesko doing good work and what\u2019s happened in that cell in Graterford Prison.... John has helped bring sanity to hell. That\u2019s the some [sic] and substance of the Chaplain\u2019s words.\nId. at 194-95.\nLesko never intimated that he had felt remorse at the time of this murder or his other crimes. But, the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal was backward-looking, as it was limited to Lesko\u2019s failure to express remorse at the time of his arrest. The Commonwealth\u2019s rebuttal did not address Lesko\u2019s overarching \u201cI\u2019m a changed man\u201d theme. Notably, and presumably as a result of Lesko\u2019s remorse and reformation testimony and the corroborating testimony of Chaplain Abdul, at least one juror found as a mitigating circumstance Lesko\u2019s change in character over the last fifteen years of his confinement under the catchall mitigator, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8). Thus, it appears that Detective Amity\u2019s statement regarding Lesko\u2019s failure to express remorse at arrest was unsuccessful at blunting the point in mitigation that Lesko sought to make. On this record, and particularly in light of the strength of the aggravating circumstances (as we have addressed at length above), we conclude that Lesko has not proven Strickland prejudice.\nF. Deficient Cross-Examination of Detective Amity\nLesko\u2019s next argument is again directed at the testimony of Detective Amity, but this time he faults trial counsel for failing to adequately cross-examine the detective on his testimony that Lesko had drawn a gun on him when the detectives entered the hotel room to arrest him and his co-defendant. According to Lesko, he told his trial counsel that the detective\u2019s account was untrue: in fact, he did not draw a gun. Moreover, Lesko argues that the detective\u2019s account is incredible because he believes that, if he had drawn a gun on Detective Amity, the officer surely would have shot him. Lesko also asserts that trial counsel should have cross-examined Detective Amity with two police reports on the same subject, one of which reported that Lesko raised a gun under the sheets while he was in bed and the other of which reported that Lesko stood up and took a gun out of his belt. According to Lesko, these inconsistent details of how he drew his gun would have challenged Detective Amity\u2019s credibility concerning whether he drew a gun.\nThe PCRA court reasoned that Lesko\u2019s argument regarding what Detective Amity would have done had he drawn a gun on him relied purely on speculation and was unfounded. Furthermore, the PCRA court pointed out that the two reports cited by Lesko did not help him, since in both versions, Lesko clearly possessed a gun. Accordingly, the court failed to see how the \u201cslightly different versions of the manner in which [Lesko] produced the gun makes a difference or creates an issue.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/2006, at 47.\nThe PCRA court\u2019s opinion on this issue is well-reasoned. Lesko\u2019s unsubstantiated belief that criminals never pull guns on police without getting shot is rank speculation, contradicted by common sense and experience. Lesko\u2019s alternative argument, concerning the detective\u2019s prior statements, ignores the fact that the extant police reports corroborated Detective Amity\u2019s central testimony that Lesko possessed a gun at the time of his arrest. Of course, Lesko himself was free to testify and directly contradict the detective, and have the jury decide who was telling the truth. But, the fact that Lesko would dispute the account does not mean that the detective\u2019s account was rendered inherently implausible. Additional cross-examination by counsel would have accomplished little, since the reports all supported the core of Detective Amity\u2019s testimony. Counsel is not obliged to pursue unpromising avenues of impeachment.\nG. Jury Instructions\nLesko\u2019s next argument focuses on the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury regarding the procedural history of the case. Lesko avers that the jury should have been instructed that the resentencing was a result of prosecutorial misconduct. In a series of speculations, Lesko contends that, in the absence of such an explanation, the jury was left to speculate why the resentencing was occurring years after the original trial; the jury could have hypothesized that the resentencing was based on a mere technicality; and, if that happened, arbitrary, capricious, and unreliable factors may have infected the jury\u2019s sentencing determination. According to Lesko, the U.S. Supreme Court requires accurate instructions on procedure in order to guarantee constitutional safeguards, citing to Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985), and California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992, 103 S.Ct. 3446, 77 L.Ed.2d 1171 (1983). Lesko acknowledges that counsel requested such an instruction at the resentencing hearing, which the trial court denied, but he argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue the preserved issue on direct appeal.\nThe PCRA court reasoned that Lesko\u2019s argument was vague as he had not and could not define what factors the jury supposedly considered by virtue of its ignorance respecting why a new proceeding was ordered. Furthermore, the PCRA court pointed out that the focus of the resentencing hearing was to determine the existence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and, if it came to it, to consider whether the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. Thus, in the PCRA court\u2019s opinion, the reason for the resentencing was of no moment for the jury. The PCRA court is correct.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court cases relied on by Lesko lend no support to his position. In Ramos, the Court held that a jury instruction that informed the jury that a life sentence could be commuted was not constitutionally infirm because, once the proceedings reach the penalty phase, \u201cthe jury then is free to consider a myriad of factors to determine whether death is the appropriate punishment. In this sense, the jury\u2019s choice between life and death must be individualized. \u2018But the Constitution does not require the jury to ignore other possible ... factors in the process of selecting ... those defendants who will actually be sentenced to death.\u2019 \u201d Ramos, 463 U.S. at 1008, 103 S.Ct. 3446 (citation omitted).\nFollowing on the heels of Ramos, in Caldwell, the state of Mississippi asserted that a prosecutor\u2019s comments that downplayed the jury\u2019s responsibility for its capital sentencing decision by calling its attention to the appellate review process did not violate the U.S. Constitution because Ramos made clear that each state must determine the extent to which a jury should be informed of post-sentencing procedures. The U.S. Supreme Court was not persuaded by Mississippi\u2019s argument, because the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not relevant to the jury\u2019s sentencing decision. Instead, in the Court\u2019s opinion, the prosecutor\u2019s statements improperly urged the jury to view its decision as only a preliminary step in the sentencing process, thereby creating in the minds of the jury a belief that it was not ultimately responsible for the sentence imposed. \u201cCreating this image in the minds of the capital sentencers is not a valid state goal, and Ramos is not to the contrary. Indeed, Ramos itself never questioned the indispensability of sentencers who \u2018appreciate] ... the gravity of their choice and ... the moral responsibility reposed in them as sentencers.\u2019 \u201d Caldwell, 472 U.S. at 336, 105 S.Ct. 2633 (citation omitted).\nAs a question of appellate counsel ineffectiveness, Lesko\u2019s claim is a non-starter. Lesko cites no case or other authority that counsel could have invoked on direct appeal in support of a claim that the jury was required to be informed of the reason for the resentencing. Counsel\u2019s task on appeal would have been to show error in the trial court\u2019s discretionary ruling on his novel request; counsel had no relevant ammunition to pursue that argument.\nMoreover, Lesko\u2019s current formulation of what the jury should have been told, as the reason for resentencing, is inaccurate and argumentative. As discussed previously, and contrary to Lesko\u2019s argument, the Third Circuit panel\u2019s opinion that constitutional error occurred in the initial sentencing proceeding did not establish that \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d required a new trial. Instead, the panel concluded that the prosecutor made \u201cimproper comments\u201d that infected the trial with unfairness, rendering the sentence proceeding tainted by a denial of due process. See 925 F.2d at 1546. That opinion is no ground to gratuitously tell the jury that the Commonwealth committed \u201cmisconduct.\u201d Moreover, even if the Third Circuit had found prosecutorial misconduct, such a finding would not represent some objectively accurate assessment of the proceedings: at most, it would represent the view of the federal panel which, in point of fact, was not the view shared by the Pennsylvania judges, including this Court, who reviewed the same sentencing proceeding. See Lesko, 467 A.2d at 300-01. A full and accurate explanation of the mechanics of that reality would be far more complex than Lesko poses, implicating the vagaries and uncertainties of a non-deferential habeas corpus review system that no longer exists. And, for purposes of completeness, explaining the reason for the resentencing presumably would require informing the jury that Lesko was denied relief in state court, which might very well suggest to the jury that the federally-ordered resentencing was indeed the product of a \u201ctechnicality.\u201d\nEqually fundamentally, even if it assumed that an easy, fair and accurate description of the operation of the grant of federal habeas relief were possible, we agree with the PCRA court that here, as in Caldwell, the topic was irrelevant to the resentencing jury\u2019s task, which involved passing upon aggravating and mitigating circumstances and weighing them. As the PCRA court aptly observed, the purpose of the procedures set forth in Section 9711 are directed at establishing whether the jury shall fix the sentence at death or life in prison. The jury\u2019s knowledge of the reason for the resentencing would not further this goal. Accordingly, Lesko has not established that appellate counsel\u2019s performance was deficient for failing to purse this issue.\nLesko next challenges the trial court\u2019s instruction regarding the credibility of witnesses which, Lesko alleges, improperly singled him out. The resentencing court issued general instructions regarding witness credibility, which included, inter alia, an instruction to consider whether the witness had an interest in the outcome of the case and whether the witness had some friendship with or animosity towards the accused. Thereafter, the trial court issued additional, specific instructions. First, the court noted the testimony of Michael Lesko, Lesko\u2019s brother, who was offered as a character witness, but who had been convicted of the prior crimes of robbery and burglary; the court then stated that \u201c[t]he only purpose for which you may consider this evidence of a prior conviction is in deciding whether or not to believe all or part of [his] testimony____\u201d N.T., 2/17/1995, at 18. Next, the court noted the testimony of Richard Rutherford and, given evidence of his possible participation and interest here, issued a corrupt source charge. See id. at 19.\nThe court then turned to Lesko\u2019s testimony, adverting to its general charge by first stating that in \u201cconsidering the defendant\u2019s testimony, you are to follow the general instructions I have given you for judging the credibility of any witness.\u201d The court followed this statement with the following instruction, which forms the basis for the instant ineffectiveness challenge:\nYou should not disbelieve [Lesko\u2019s] testimony merely because he is the defendant. In weighing his testimony, however, you may consider the fact that he has a vital interest in the outcome of the case and you may take [Lesko\u2019s] interest into account along with all other facts and circumstances bearing on credibility in deciding what weight his testimony deserves.\nId. at 19-20.\nLesko acknowledges that this instruction directed the jury not to simply disbelieve Lesko because he was the defendant, but he complains that it allowed the jury to consider his testimony \u201csuspect, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d Brief of Appellant Lesko, at 43. Furthermore, Lesko points to the non-binding 1980 Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Jury Instructions recommending language that the defendant\u2019s interest should be considered \u201cjust like the interests of any other witness,\u201d and argues that the trial court should have included this language when instructing the jury. Lesko also avers that many of the witnesses had an interest in the outcome of the proceedings and it was unfair to single his testimony out; he then speculates that the court\u2019s charge could have caused the jury to view his testimony as particularly \u201csuspect.\u201d Lesko argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the instruction on this ground and failing to raise the issue on direct appeal.\nThe PCRA court considered the challenged instruction as a whole and concluded that it was not inflammatory or accusatory. Rather, \u201cthe charge cautioned the jury that it should not disbelieve [Lesko] simply because he was the accused.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/2006, at 64. Accordingly, the court determined that there was no error in the charge and found Lesko\u2019s derivative ineffectiveness argument to be without merit. We agree.\nIt is well settled that in reviewing a challenge to a jury instruction the charge, as a whole, must be considered. Furthermore, the trial court has broad discretion in phrasing the instructions, so long as the directions given \u201cclearly, adequately, and accurately\u201d reflect the law. See Commonwealth v. Gibson, 597 Pa. 402, 951 A.2d 1110, 1142 (2008).\nViewing the instruction as a whole, the absence of language such as \u201cjust like the interests of any other witness\u201d did not unfairly single out Lesko\u2019s testimony, or suggest that it was \u201csuspect.\u201d In fact, the introductory sentence to the challenged charge clearly, adequately, and accurately instructed the jury that it was to apply the general credibility instructions to Lesko\u2019s testimony just as it would to any other witness. Moreover, contrary to the assertions of Lesko, the charge did not tell the jury to consider his testimony to be \u201csuspect;\u201d it just told the jury that it could \u201cconsider\u201d his obvious interest in the outcome in weighing his testimony. This is a benign charge. Furthermore, Lesko\u2019s testimony was not the only testimony that was \u201csingled out\u201d for additional comment by the trial court. Instructions to the jury are to be fair and accurate; they are not required to embody points that a party more properly should make in argument. Accordingly, we agree with the PCRA court that this claim of counsel ineffectiveness lacks arguable merit.\nH. Trial Court\u2019s Discretionary Rulings\nLesko\u2019s next claim relates to the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit him to introduce evidence that co-defendant Travaglia had also received a sentence of death for the murder of Officer Miller. Lesko contends that such information would have been invaluable, since the evidence showed that he was not the triggerman, the Commonwealth prosecuted him on an accomplice liability theory, and his trial counsel argued to the jury that he was a minor participant in the crime. According to Lesko, the law requires that capital sentencing juries be given all information relative to a defendant\u2019s mitigating circumstances and sentences received by more culpable criminal confederates, in his view, may prove a mitigating circumstance. Lesko cites Parker v. Dugger, 498 U.S. 308, 111 S.Ct. 731, 112 L.Ed.2d 812 (1991), in support of his claim, arguing that Parker stands for the proposition that sentences received by more culpable confederates are relevant in determining whether the defendant\u2019s lesser participation in the crime warrants a sentence other than death.\nIn his PCRA petition, Lesko posed this claim as one sounding in counsel ineffectiveness, albeit he devoted the bulk of his pleading to explaining why he believed the trial court \u201cerred\u201d in refusing to admit such evidence, and then merely appended a one-sentence allegation as to prior counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. (The argument in the petition was typical of the manner in which Lesko has presented his ineffectiveness claims.) Lesko\u2019s complaint as presented in his appellate brief, however, alleges only trial court error. Any claim of trial court error is obviously waived, as Lesko could have raised it at trial and on direct appeal, but he did not.\nThe PCRA court evaluated the underlying, defaulted claim and deemed it to lack merit, without speaking specifically to the cognizable claim of counsel ineffectiveness. The court reasoned that Lesko and his co-defendant were sentenced by different juries and each jury was to assess the individual mitigating and aggravating circumstances as they related to each participant. The task for Lesko\u2019s jury was to weigh the circumstances as they related to Lesko; his co-defendant\u2019s penalty was irrelevant to that consideration. Furthermore, the PCRA court explained that Lesko\u2019s challenge failed as it was simply a dressed-up challenge to the proportionality of his sentence. The Commonwealth echoes the PCRA court\u2019s analysis, and likewise does not address the overarching, cognizable claim of counsel ineffectiveness.\nAs noted, Lesko poses his claim solely as a claim of trial court error, and has not argued a derivative claim of ineffectiveness on this appeal, even though he couched the claim in terms of prior counsel ineffectiveness below. The PCRA provides that a claim is waived when it could have been raised before trial, at trial, or on appeal. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b). As Lesko\u2019s current and exclusive claim of trial court error could have been raised on direct appeal and as it is no longer raised in terms of prior counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, it is waived.\nEven presuming that the claim was not waived, we agree with the PCRA court that Lesko\u2019s underlying claim lacks merit.\nThis Court has had the opportunity to consider this same question on prior occasions, in arguably more compelling circumstances, i.e., in circumstances where co-defendants received lesser sentences. In Commonwealth v. Haag, 522 Pa. 388, 562 A.2d 289 (1989), the appellant argued that his death sentence was arbitrary and capricious in light of the fact that the other participants in the crime did not receive death sentences. The appellant also contendfed that the trial court erred in refusing to apprise the jury of these lesser sentences. In resolving these questions, we explained that sentencing is a highly individualized matter and the aggravating and mitigating circumstances applicable to any one defendant are variable as well. Id. at 299. We also clarified that the disposition of the matters against the accomplices had no bearing on the appellant\u2019s sentence. Id. at 298. Accordingly, we rejected the appellant\u2019s argument. Id.; see also Commonwealth v. Williams, 586 Pa. 553, 896 A.2d 523, 547 (2006); Commonwealth v. Lopez, 578 Pa. 545, 854 A.2d 465, 471 (2004).\nLesko\u2019s theory is nearly identical to the one pursued by Haag and rejected by this Court. While evidence that a capital defendant played a lesser role in the murder than a confederate may be relevant evidence in mitigation, the sentence received by a criminal confederate is not, especially given the individualized nature of sentencing. The sentences received by confederates are not probative of specific statutory mitigators, nor are they relevant evidence respecting the defendant\u2019s character or record or the circumstances of the offense itself, which states must permit. See Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 4, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (capital sentencer cannot be precluded from considering, as mitigating factor, aspects of defendant\u2019s character or record and circumstances of offense proffered as basis for sentence less than death); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e) (outlining statutory mitigators, including character/record/circumstances catchall mitigator at subsection (e)(8), which \u201cobviously mirrors the requirements of Skipper.\u201d Commonwealth v. Harris, 572 Pa. 489, 817 A.2d 1033, 1054 (2002)). Lesko fails to acknowledge this governing authority much less does he attempt to distinguish it.\nMoreover, the decision in Parker has no application here. Parker involved the High Court\u2019s review of the process the Florida state courts followed in imposing and reviewing a sentence of death under the Florida statutory scheme. Lesko does not raise a similar challenge here.\nSpecifically, in Parker, the U.S. Supreme Court reiterated that the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits the arbitrary or irrational imposition of a sentence of death. In that case, the High Court was called upon to review the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision affirming a sentence of death. The broad question presented was whether the sentence of death met federal constitutional requirements. In answering the question, the Court needed to determine the effect the trial court and the Florida appellate court gave to evidence of non-statutory mitigators. The U.S. Supreme Court concluded that before imposing the sentence of death, the trial court must first have considered the non-statutory mitigating evidence including, inter alia, the fact that none of the accomplices had received a sentence of death for the murders. The Court then concluded that the Florida Supreme Court also needed to consider the non-statutory mitigating evidence in reviewing the sentence of death. The state appellate court, however, did not do so. Instead, the state court struck two (out of six) aggravating circumstances relied upon by the trial court but neither conducted an independent weighing of the remaining evidence (including consideration of the non-statutory mitigating evidence) nor a harmless error analysis. The U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the state appellate court\u2019s approach did not amount to meaningful appellate review of the death sentence, and, therefore, violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against the arbitrary or irrational imposition of a sentence of death.\nLesko\u2019s reliance on Parker is misplaced. Parker nowhere imposes a constitutional requirement that the sentence received by a co-conspirator be admitted as mitigating evidence. The mere fact that the Florida trial court permitted such evidence to be introduced during the sentencing phase of the proceedings, and that this was part of the factual scenario the U.S. Supreme Court was given, does not elevate it to a constitutional requirement. Rather, Parker stands for the proposition that an appellate court cannot ignore such evidence upon appellate review when that evidence is in the record and the appellate task, under the state review system in place, requires consideration of the whole record. In this case, there was no such evidence placed in the record. As stated previously, this Court has repeatedly concluded that evidence of the sentences received by co-defendants is not required to be included at sentencing. Further, the U.S. Supreme Court has not held, or even indicated, to the contrary. Accordingly, even if not waived, Lesko\u2019s claim fails.\nLesko next argues that the trial court erroneously permitted evidence of his prior bad acts to be admitted, and that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek an appropriate limiting instruction and for not pursuing the issue on direct appeal. Lesko points to the specific evidence that was admitted regarding the Levato, Newcomer, and Nicholls murders and contends that such evidence was unnecessary to prove any aggravating circumstances. Lesko also contends that evidence of the robberies that he allegedly committed with his co-defendant should not have been admitted as they were crimes for which he was not convicted. Furthermore, according to Lesko, this evidence, once admitted, should have been accompanied by an appropriate jury instruction to the effect that the evidence was not proffered to show his bad character or criminal propensity, but was only admitted for the limited purpose of establishing the history of the case.\nThe PCRA court addressed only the admissibility of the evidence, and noted that this claim was previously litigated on direct appeal. Lesko acknowledges that the underlying claim concerning admissibility was litigated on direct appeal, but insists that his current claim is reviewable to the extent it is based on counsel\u2019s failure to seek a cautionary instruction, an issue that was not raised or addressed on direct appeal. We will consider the distinct, but limited Sixth Amendment aspect of the claim. Collins, supra.\nOn the direct appeal from his resentencing, Lesko argued that the Commonwealth should not have been permitted to present evidence regarding his prior bad acts, including specific evidence surrounding the nature and circumstances of the other three murders. In rejecting Lesko\u2019s claim, this Court held that the nature and circumstances were relevant to the jury\u2019s consideration of Lesko\u2019s character and record. \u201cThe nature of the offense, as ascertained, through examination of the circumstances concomitant to its commission, has much bearing upon the character of a defendant, and indeed, without reference to those facts and circumstances, consideration of \u2018convictions\u2019 would be a hollow process, yielding far less information about a defendant\u2019s character than is relevant.\u201d Lesko, 719 A.2d at 224-25 (quoting Commonwealth v. Beasley, 505 Pa. 279, 479 A.2d 460, 465 (1984)). Thus, we concluded that \u201csince there has been no showing of undue prejudice, this was a relevant and proper factor in the jury\u2019s consideration of the sentence which should be imposed.\u201d Lesko, 719 A.2d at 225.\nRecognizing that the question of admissibility and direct review prejudice has already been determined, we pass to the question of whether trial counsel was obliged to request a specific instruction from the trial court regarding the jury\u2019s consideration of this same evidence. Of course, there was nothing to prevent trial counsel from requesting a cautionary charge, but Lesko has not established that his trial counsel did not have a reasonable trial strategy for failing to request such an instruction.\nThe Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that the argument section of the appellate briefs must direct the court\u2019s attention to the relevant section of the record necessary to assess a claim. See Pa.R.A.P. 2119 and 2132. This is not a case where the PCRA claim was summarily dismissed; rather, there was a hearing below. Lesko does not point to the part of the PCRA hearing record which shows that trial counsel was asked and explained why he did not request a cautionary instruction. Furthermore, while PCRA counsel inquired into this area generally in his examination of prior counsel, our independent review of the record indicates that trial counsel was never asked his reasons for failing to request a cautionary charge; and yet that distinct point is the entire basis for Lesko\u2019s current ineffectiveness claim, which is limited in scope given that the admissibility question was already litigated against him. See N.T., 12/16/1999, at 433-36. It is well settled that the decision whether to seek a jury instruction implicates a matter of trial strategy. See Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 586 Pa. 366, 894 A.2d 716, 730 (2006); Commonwealth v. Garcia, 585 Pa. 160, 888 A.2d 633, 638 (2005); Commonwealth v. Sullivan, 450 Pa. 273, 299 A.2d 608, 610 (1973). Accordingly, based on the record before us, and because Lesko has not established any ground for deeming counsel per se ineffective, Lesko has not sustained his burden of showing that trial counsel did not have a reasonable trial strategy for failing to request a cautionary instruction. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Puksar, 597 Pa. 240, 951 A.2d 267, 277-78 (2008).\nI. Duplicative Use of Aggravating Circumstances\nLesko next argues that the prosecution\u2019s alleged \u201cduplicative\u201d use of the same facts to establish separate aggravating circumstances violated the Eighth Amendment. This is yet another claim where Lesko takes an issue actually litigated at resentencing and on appeal and claims that prior counsel was incompetent for failing to pose the issue properly. The underlying complaint here, as before, focuses on the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on the murders of Peter Levato and Marlene Sue Newcomer to establish the aggravating circumstances enumerated in both Section 9711(d)(9) (significant history of prior felony convictions) and Section 9711(d)(10) (defendant was convicted of another federal or state offense for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable) of the capital sentencing statute. Lesko acknowledges that trial counsel raised the same complaint at resentencing and on direct appeal, but he asserts that he was ineffective to the extent his argument failed to incorporate a constitutional component. The constitutional angle that Lesko now asserts is that the Eighth Amendment supposedly \u201cdoes not permit\u201d the jury to consider the same evidence multiple times in the weighing process. As support for his claim concerning what the Eighth Amendment allegedly prohibits categorically, Lesko cites to no binding authority, but instead cites to a federal capital case arising from Oklahoma the year after his resentencing proceeding, United States v. McCullah, 76 F.3d 1087 (10th Cir.1996), involving the distinct federal capital punishment scheme.\nThe PCRA court concluded that this claim was previously litigated and decided it adversely to Lesko on that ground. Lesko argues that the PCRA court\u2019s finding gives insufficient consideration to his current Sixth Amendment claim of ineffectiveness or recognition that the claim raised on direct appeal was a claim of statutory construction, not of constitutional law. Lesko notes that, on direct appeal, counsel asserted only that it was error for the Commonwealth to introduce evidence of three aggravating circumstances arising out of the two murder convictions under the capital sentencing statute, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711. We will proceed to the merits of the Sixth Amendment complaint, which is resolvable on the record.\nThe substance of Lesko\u2019s claim is that counsel should have argued that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the duplicative use of evidence to establish multiple aggravating circumstances in the penalty phase. But this argument is thoroughly disingenuous: the single Tenth Circuit authority Lesko cites (which did not exist at the time of the sentencing) does not support his absolutist proposition; his argument fails to account for subsequent caselaw from that Circuit; and he ignores existing guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court, which, of course, is the pre-eminent, binding judicial source for what the Eighth Amendment could be said to prohibit.\nIn McCullah, the jury was presented with two statutory aggravating circumstances that the court concluded substantially overlapped. The first aggravating circumstance was that the defendant intentionally engaged in conduct which he knew created a grave risk of death and that such death resulted. The second aggravating circumstance was conduct intending that the victim be killed. The panel noted that, while the two circumstances were not identical per se, they \u201csubstantially overlapped\u201d; and, indeed, the second circumstance \u201cnecessarily subsume[d]\u201d the first one. The panel then summarily concluded that, \u201c[s]uch double counting of aggravating factors, especially under a weighing scheme, has a tendency to skew the weighing process and creates the risk that the death sentence will be imposed arbitrarily and thus, unconstitutionally.\u201d McCullah, 76 F.3d at 1111. Lesko selects only the latter, generalized quote, while ignoring that the court\u2019s holding was premised upon one factor necessarily subsuming another. He then poses his selective account as if it defines Tenth Circuit law on the Eighth Amendment which, we are supposed to accept, also establishes the absolute parameters of the Eighth Amendment.\nIn addition to misrepresenting the McCullah case, Lesko\u2019s argument fails to disclose to this Court that McCullah is not even the Tenth Circuit\u2019s last word on the subject. Two years later, in Cooks v. Ward, 165 F.3d 1283 (10th Cir.1998), the court squarely rejected the very argument that Lesko now poses as if it were settled Eighth Amendment law. Pointing to the \u201csubstantially overlapping\u201d analysis in McCullah, Cooks noted that McCullah did not \u201cstand for the proposition that any time evidence supports more than one aggravating circumstance, those circumstances impermissibly overlap, per se. The test we apply is not whether certain evidence is relevant to both aggravators, but rather, whether one aggravating circumstance \u2018necessarily subsumes\u2019 the other.\u201d Id. at 1289. Lesko\u2019s misleading argument concerning McCullah, thus, is patently meritless.\nFurthermore, and also unacknowledged by Lesko\u2019s federal counsel is the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court has had the opportunity to address the McCullah court\u2019s reasoning in Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999). The High Court avoided directly addressing McCullah\u2019s \u201cdouble counting theory\u201d because it ultimately concluded that the aggravating circumstances at issue were not duplicative. The decision in Jones was a plurality on this issue, as Justice Scalia did not join this part of the opinion. But what is significant is that the plurality opinion introduced this issue by stating, \u201c[w]e have never before held that aggravating factors could be duplicative so as to render them constitutionally invalid____\u201d Jones, 527 U.S. at 399, 119 S.Ct. 2090. No member of the Court disputed this fact. The plurality opinion is further instructive because it squared with the Cooks opinion when it later concluded that, \u201cthe factors as a whole were not duplicative \u2014 at best, certain evidence was relevant to two different aggravating factors.\u201d Id.\nGiven this background, prior counsel obviously cannot be found ineffective for failing to formulate the Eighth Amendment issue Lesko has erroneously posed as a proposition certain, premised upon a misleading and incomplete account of the cases. In the case sub judice, there is no question that the challenged aggravating circumstances do not substantially overlap, much less does one \u201cnecessarily subsume\u201d the other. Rather, by Lesko\u2019s own assertions, this is an instance where the same evidence was introduced in support of two different, and distinct, statutory aggravating factors. Such a circumstance does not implicate the constitutional concern he faults counsel for failing to invoke. See Cooks, supra; cf. Jones, supra. Accordingly, Lesko has not established that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\nJ. Presumption of Life\nLesko\u2019s next argument derives from the resentencing court\u2019s jury instructions respecting the verdict slip. Specifically, Lesko contends that the verdict slip instructions erroneously shifted the burden of persuasion to the defense, and \u201cviolated the presumption of life\u201d by repeatedly telling the jury that it had to \u201creject a sentence of death\u201d before it could \u201cchoose life.\u201d Lesko also appears to urge this Court to conclude, on collateral review, that an explicit instruction on the \u201cpresumption of life\u201d is necessary in all capital cases to comport with constitutional concerns. Lesko contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court\u2019s instruction on these bases, and thereafter was ineffective for failing to raise the issue on direct appeal.\nThe PCRA court concluded that while the language of the sentencing court in explaining how to record its verdict on the slip was inartful, upon its review of the relevant charge as a whole, there was no error. In reaching this conclusion, the PCRA court considered that the portion of the charge that referred to recording the reasons for rejecting the death penalty appeared only in conjunction with the court noting that such an explanation was only required if the jury was recording a verdict of life imprisonment. PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/2006, at 57, citing N.T., 2/17/95, at 33 (\u201cIf your sentence is life imprisonment, you should check the findings in C \u2014 1 or C-2 [on the verdict slip] which explain why your jury rejects the death penalty and imposes a life sentence.\u201d). The PCRA court also looked to the remainder of the charge, focusing on the fact that the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the burdens of proof attendant to each. Thus, the PCRA court did not find arguable merit in Lesko\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness in failing to object to the court\u2019s jury instructions concerning how to record the verdict. We agree with the reasoning given by the lower court.\nPreliminarily, we note that this Court has specifically rejected a claim that a capital defendant is entitled to a presumption of life charge. Commonwealth v. Eichinger, 591 Pa. 1, 915 A.2d 1122, 1138 (2007). Instead, we have held that jury instructions adequately convey the default in favor of life when the jury is instructed as to \u201cthe deliberately disparate treatment of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances under the applicable standards of proof\u2019 and the fact that \u201clife in prison is the sentence unless the Commonwealth meets its high burden....\u201d Id. Moreover, when this Court has spoken of the \u201cpresumption of life\u201d reflected in the penalty phase schemata, we were describing its practical operation (burdens of proof; levels of proof, relative weighing), consistently with restrictions dictated by the U.S. Supreme Court and the statute, which slant the inquiry in favor of life imprisonment. A synopsis of the practical operation of the capital penalty determination in an appellate opinion does not give rise to an entitlement to have what would amount to both a duplicative, and an argumentative, instruction concerning the jury\u2019s duty. Indeed, by definition, since the \u201cpresumption\u201d arises as a result of the manner in which the jury\u2019s consideration is cabined, an accurate description of the process the jury must follow adequately conveys whatever \u201cpresumption\u201d is operable.\nLesko\u2019s claim mischaracterizes the trial court\u2019s charge, both by ignoring its context, and by ignoring that the portion of the charge that is the basis for this claim concerned the mechanics of recording the verdict reached, and not the deliberations themselves. In point of fact, the trial court accurately explained the nature of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the differing burdens of proof. Indeed, the trial court stressed that the different burdens of proof protected against \u201cunjust death sentences.\u201d N.T., 2/17/1995, at 27. Additionally, the trial court emphasized that the jury could only impose a sentence of death if it could unanimously agree on one of two findings by stating:\nAs I told you earlier, you must agree unanimously on one of two general findings before you can sentence the defendant to death. They are a finding that there is at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances or a finding that there are one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances____If all of you agree on either one of these two general findings, then you can and must sentence the defendant to death. When voting on the general findings, you are to regard a particular aggravating circumstance as present only if all of you agree that it is present. On the other hand, each of you is free to regard a particular mitigating circumstance as present despite what other jurors may believe.\nId.\nMoreover, as the PCRA court found, the language regarding \u201crejecting\u201d the death penalty was confined to a specific context when the trial court was directing the jury as to how it was to record, on the verdict slip, the verdict it had reached. It must be remembered that the verdict slip merely records the result of the jury\u2019s deliberation; it is not the deliberation itself, and the court\u2019s explanation of how to execute the slip is similarly discrete. The court first explained that in Part 1 of the.verdict slip the jury was to enumerate the aggravating circumstances that the jurors had found that the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the mitigating circumstances as found by any one of them by a preponderance of the evidence. Then, when explaining Part 2 of the verdict slip (relating to recording the jury\u2019s decision to impose a sentence of death), the trial court reiterated that the jury must unanimously agree that there was one or more aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances or one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances \u201cbefore [it] could sentence the defendant to death.\u201d Id. at 30 (emphasis added). It was only following these accurate instructions that the allegedly objectionable language arose when the trial court was explaining how the jury should fill out the verdict slip if the jury had reached a sentencing verdict of life in prison. The court explained that if the decision already so reached was a sentence of life in prison then it should check certain findings on the verdict slip. It then followed this instruction by stating, \u201c[the findings] explain why you are rejecting as a jury the death penalty in imposing a life sentence.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court employed the phrase, \u201crejecting the death penalty\u201d numerous times in the context of explaining this particular aspect of executing the verdict slip. Id. at 30, 31, and 33.\nBased upon our review of the charge as a whole, we find no error in the PCRA court\u2019s decision. The trial court clearly, accurately, and properly instructed the jury regarding the respective burdens of proof related to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. See Eiehinger, supra. Furthermore, even if the repeated use of the phrase \u201crejecting the death penalty\u201d in describing how to record the verdict already reached on the verdict slip was inartful, it was not erroneous when considered in context. As the PCRA court astutely observed, this phrase was only invoked when explaining to the jury how to use the verdict slip if it returned a verdict of life in prison. Accordingly, we agree that there is no arguable merit to this claim and Lesko has failed to establish that his counsel was ineffective.\nK. Simmons Charge\nLesko\u2019s next argument centers on trial counsel\u2019s failure to request that the jury be instructed that if he was sentenced to life in prison he would not be eligible for parole (a so-called \u201clife means life\u201d instruction, deriving from the plurality opinion in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994)). Lesko\u2019s argument before this Court does not attempt to account for the state of the law at the time counsel acted, but instead begins with a complaint that the PCRA court did not specifically address a list of bullet \u201csubarguments\u201d he now provides. Lesko\u2019s list consists of boilerplate, conclusory statements of supposed constitutional law, accompanied by unexplained string citations, with no attempt to tie the propositions to this case or to Strickland. Following this indiscernible, \u201cbriefing by brainstorming\u201d argument, Lesko also requests that this Court revisit our prior case law concerning one aspect of Simmons, which holds that evidence in support of the significant history aggravator does not place future dangerousness at issue. In a particularly tortuous bit of reasoning, Lesko cites a 2002 case from the U.S. Supreme Court, Kelly v. South Carolina, 534 U.S. 246, 122 S.Ct. 726, 151 L.Ed.2d 670 (2002), in support of his request that we alter our interpretation of Simmons and use that recalibration to find counsel ineffective in 1995.\nThe PCRA court concluded that it was bound by this Court\u2019s interpretation of Simmons, and therefore such an instruction is only warranted when the future dangerousness of the defendant is actually placed in issue. PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 48. The PCRA court reasoned that the future dangerousness of Lesko was not an aggravating circumstance placed before the jury; thus, the Simmons instruction was not required and counsel could not be ineffective for failing to make such a request.\nThe PCRA court\u2019s opinion speaks too narrowly on this issue, as future dangerousness can be injected into the proceedings in circumstances other than as a specifically proposed aggravating factor. Indeed, in Simmons the prosecutor raised the \u201cspecter\u201d of \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d in closing arguments. Simmons, 512 U.S. at 157, 165, 114 S.Ct. 2187. On the other hand, Lesko\u2019s arguments, requesting a broadening of our current law governing circumstances when a life means life instruction is required, and requiring that we fault counsel for failing to measure up to a new interpretation, are also without merit.\nThis Court has considered this issue on multiple occasions and in various forms. Yet, in assessing counsel\u2019s performance, we always come back to the same rule of law represented by Simmons, which was accurately set forth by the PCRA court and is that a life means life instruction is only required in those instances when the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness is placed at issue. See Commonwealth v. Housman, 604 Pa. 596, 986 A.2d 822, 837-38 (2009); Commonwealth v. Wright, 599 Pa. 270, 961 A.2d 119, 146-47 (2008); Commonwealth v. Spotz, 587 Pa. 1, 896 A.2d 1191, 1243 (2006); Commonwealth v. Rompilla, 554 Pa. 378, 721 A.2d 786, 795 (1998). We have also rejected the alternative argument that Lesko makes regarding whether admitting evidence to prove the significant history aggravator automatically injects future dangerousness into the sentencing proceedings. Even if we were inclined to revisit those decisions, the fact would remain that counsel\u2019s stewardship, in failing to ask for a Simmons charge (the year after the Simmons plurality decision was announced), cannot reasonably be questioned premised upon that changed view of the governing law. Accordingly, as Lesko\u2019s future dangerousness was not placed in issue by the mere fact that the significant history aggravator was argued and proved by the Commonwealth and as he does not point to any other evidence that injected future dangerousness into the proceedings, the PCRA court correctly concluded that counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to request a Simmons charge.\nL. Jury Instructions on Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances\nLesko\u2019s next three arguments concern the jury instructions regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances. First, Lesko points to language in the trial court\u2019s instruction which directed the jury to consider whether the aggravating or mitigating circumstances made the first-degree murder of Officer Miller \u201cmore terrible\u201d or \u201cless terrible.\u201d According to Lesko, the federal constitution micromanages what courts can say on this score as well. Thus, Lesko argues that such instructions unconstitutionally required the jury to find a nexus between the mitigating circumstances and the crime committed, when the U.S. Constitution requires the jury to consider any evidence that warrants a sentence less than death. Lesko does not address the fact that counsel failed to object to the charge at trial; nor does he argue in his brief that trial counsel was ineffective, under the state of the law extant in 1995, in connection with this claim. Like the claim related to the trial court\u2019s failure to permit him to introduce evidence of his co-defendant\u2019s sentence, although Lesko raised this issue in terms of trial counsel ineffectiveness in his PCRA petition, he has failed to present this claim in terms of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in his brief before this Court. Accordingly, this claim of trial court error is waived. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b).\nLesko\u2019s next argument concerns the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury regarding what he calls \u201cthe mitigating features of age.\u201d More specifically, he points to his supposed \u201cemotional or psychological\u201d age at the time of the offense and avers that the jury should specifically have been informed of these \u201cmitigating features\u201d in support of the age mitigating circumstance under Section 9711(e)(4). At the time of the murder, Lesko was 21. The trial court instructed the jury that Lesko\u2019s age could be considered as a mitigating circumstance, see N.T., 2/17/95, at 26. The trial court, however, refused Lesko\u2019s request to instruct the jury that in considering his age, the jury should consider his psychological and emotional age and level of maturity. Lesko acknowledges that his counsel requested such a charge, but asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue this issue on appeal.\nThe PCRA court acknowledged that U.S. Supreme Court case law indicates that \u201cthe background and mental and emotional development of a youthful defendant [must] be duly considered in sentencing,\u201d but reasoned that the \u201cemotional and psychological\u201d consideration was encompassed by the court\u2019s general instruction to the jury to consider all other mitigating circumstances pursuant to Section 9711(e)(8). According to the PCRA court, \u201c[t]he fact that \u2018age\u2019 means \u2018emotional age\u2019 in addition to \u2018chronological age\u2019 is a matter that can be testified to by an appropriate expert witness, but is not an absolute instruction that should be given by the court.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 61.\nThe PCRA court\u2019s reasoning is sound. Lesko\u2019s claim here repeats his usual pattern when it comes to jury instructions: he proceeds from an assumption that the evidence and arguments he would proffer in support of a relevant consideration must also be converted into a binding jury instruction. But, instructions are designed to guide the jury\u2019s consideration of relevant evidence, not to reaffirm or approve of either party\u2019s slant on that evidence. Consistently with the death penalty statute, the jury here was instructed to consider Lesko\u2019s age at the time of the crime as potential mitigation. Lesko has not shown any basis in law for an entitlement to a more specific instruction that in considering his age (the relevant factor), the jury was obliged to specifically consider his theory concerning his supposed \u201cemotional or psychological\u201d age. Furthermore, as noted by the PCRA court, Lesko\u2019s supposed \u201cemotional or psychological\u201d age may well have been a circumstance that was considered and accepted by the jury when assessing Lesko\u2019s background and in finding that he acted under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance. Thus, Lesko has not demonstrated that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue this issue on appeal.\nLesko\u2019s final argument regarding the trial court\u2019s instructions on aggravating and mitigating circumstances focuses on the trial court\u2019s instruction directing the jury not to be \u201cswayed\u201d by sympathy, sentiment or other emotion. Counsel did not object. Lesko speculates that the word \u201cswayed\u201d conveyed to the jury that it could not give effect to feelings of sympathy or emotion when arriving at its sentence. Furthermore, according to Lesko, such an instruction negated and created an impermissible barrier to the role of sympathy as a mechanism by which to give effect to the actual mitigating evidence presented. Lesko also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to share his speculations and objecting to the word \u201cswayed.\u201d\nThe PCRA court reasoned that a jury is not permitted to avoid imposing a sentence of death based on unbridled discretion or sympathy. Furthermore, the court pointed out that the trial court\u2019s instruction was substantially similar to the instruction found in the Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Criminal Jury Instructions. Accordingly, it deemed Lesko\u2019s underlying claim to be meritless. We agree.\nLesko\u2019s view of the role of \u201csympathy\u201d in the jury\u2019s penalty deliberations fails to account for decisional law. Claims along this line have previously been considered and rejected by this Court on more than one occasion. Simply stated, \u201c[a]s it is well established that a jury instruction not to allow feelings of sympathy to influence the sentencing consideration is constitutionally proper, counsel in this case were not ineffective in failing to object to such instruction.\u201d See Natividad, 938 A.2d at 340 (quoting Commonwealth v. Rios, 591 Pa. 583, 920 A.2d 790, 818 (2007)). Lesko fails to acknowledge controlling law, and does not attempt to distinguish that law. We are not swayed by his claim.\nM. Voir Dire\nLesko\u2019s next four claims center on the absence of the resentencing voir dire transcripts from the record on his resentencing direct appeal. Lesko alternately faults his trial counsel for failing to secure those notes, and the resentencing court for failing to sua sponte see to it that the notes were transcribed. Lesko first claims entitlement to a \u201crestoration\u201d of his appeal rights nunc pro tunc so that he can pursue the voir dire issues that counsel failed to raise on direct appeal, asserting that the absence of the transcript \u201ceffectively denied\u201d him the ability to raise such issues on direct appeal. In addition he alleges that the absence of the jury selection notes supposedly rendered this Court unable to conduct its statutorily required review of the sentence for passion, prejudice or arbitrary factors as mandated by 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3)(i). Lesko contends that he had a constitutional right to have the penalty phase jury selection notes transcribed for purposes of his appeal from resentencing and the failure to provide these transcripts resulted in the complete denial of his right to counsel under United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984). Alternatively, with regard to his first point, Lesko avers that he can demonstrate that the result of the direct appeal would have been different as he can establish that relief was due because of the specific voir dire errors that will be enumerated and discussed below.\nThe PCRA court reasoned that the statute and rules of court governing capital appeals required that the complete record be transcribed, including voir dire notes. See PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/2006, at 49-50. It also concluded that counsel had no reason for failing to make such a request, since he admitted during the PCRA hearings that he \u201cjust assumed it would be transcribed for [this Court] and they would review it.\u201d The court disagreed, however, that Lesko\u2019s direct appeal rights should be reinstated nunc pro tunc as the relevant portion of the record was transcribed for PCRA counsel, PCRA counsel had the opportunity to review the transcripts, and counsel had identified alleged errors on collateral attack. Thus, the PCRA court addressed the specific claims identified by current counsel on the merits.\nFor reasons we will explain below, the PCRA court erred to the extent it accepted Lesko\u2019s argument that 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(2) and Pa.R.A.P. 2189 themselves imposed a stand-alone obligation on the part of the trial court to produce the \u201ccomplete\u201d record, including voir dire notes of testimony, for direct appeal. We also reject Lesko\u2019s argument that this Court should grant him a nunc pro tunc appeal, or that we should presume that he was prejudiced per se by the mere failure to have the voir dire proceeding transcribed.\nPreliminarily, we note that, although Lesko faults the trial court for the absence of the jury selection notes, and suggests that there is some obligation to \u201cprovide\u201d a \u201ccomplete\u201d record in the abstract, that obviously is not the case. Rather, the appellant has a duty to frame what is needed. Thus, Rule 1911(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that \u201c[t]he appellant shall request any transcript required under this chapter in the manner and make any necessary payment or deposit therefor in the amount and within the time prescribed by Rules 5000.1 et seq. of the Pennsylvania Rules of Judicial Administration (court reporters).\u201d Of course, if a party is indigent, and is entitled to taxpayer-provided transcripts or portions of the record, he will not be assessed costs. But, that does not absolve the appellant and his lawyer of his obligation to identify and order that which he deems necessary to prosecute his appeal. The plain terms of the Rules contemplate that the parties, who are in the best position to know what they actually need for appeal, are responsible to take affirmative actions to secure transcripts and other parts of the record. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Steward, 775 A.2d 819, 833 (Pa.Super.2001) (noting that it was not the responsibility of the trial court to order the notes of transcript of defense counsel\u2019s closing as Rule 1911 \u201cmakes it abundantly plain that it is the responsibility of the Appellant to order all transcripts necessary to the disposition of his appeal.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Peifer, 730 A.2d 489, 492 n. 3 (Pa.Super.1999) (explaining that it is the responsibility of the appellant and not the court to provide a complete record for review, including any necessary transcripts). Lesko cannot fault the trial court for his own failures. Instead, it is only when an appellant can show that a request was made and erroneously denied, which is not the case herein, that such a claim would have merit. See Commonwealth v. Jones, 590 Pa. 202, 912 A.2d 268, 284-85 (2006). And that sort of claim ripens, and should be pursued upon, the very appeal that supposedly was impeded by a missing portion of the record, which is also not the case here.\nMoreover, even when notes of testimony are properly ordered, the absence of notes does not generate some instantaneous, meritorious claim for relief. Instead, if the initially missing notes matter, it becomes a circumstance the appellant or his counsel needs to respond to by, for example, ordering notes counsel failed to order earlier; or seeking an order of court to have ordered notes promptly transcribed, or otherwise made available; or, where notes cannot be secured, to take steps to have an equivalent picture of the proceeding generated. See Pa.R.A.P. 1911(a); Pa.R.A.P. 1923 (statement in the absence of transcript); Pa.R.A.P. 1924 (agreed upon statement of the record).\nThere may be circumstances when the absence of notes of testimony hampers this Court\u2019s statutorily mandated direct appeal review of death sentences under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3)\u00ae (mandating review of death sentence to determine whether it was result of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor). And, thus, on a direct appeal, if the facts warranted the assertion, an argument could be forwarded that a portion of the record was missing, through no fault of the appellant, which impeded statutory review; and the appellant could request some court action to secure that which was missing, or to direct creation of an equivalent picture. But, this is not the type of situation Lesko poses. Instead, Lesko\u2019s argument turns the shield of statutory review into a sword. He argues that the absence of voir dire notes should be deemed to have automatically impeded this Court\u2019s statutorily mandated review for passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor, and thereby created a collateral right to automatic relief \u2014 even if he never took measures to secure the notes, and never objected to their absence on direct appeal. In addition to ignoring the duty of an appellant to identify and request relevant portions of the record, Lesko\u2019s argument fails to recognize the very limited purpose of review pursuant to Section 9711(h)(3)\u00ae.\nGenerally, an action may be deemed arbitrary if it is not cabined by law or principle. Commonwealth v. Boczkowski, 577 Pa. 421, 846 A.2d 75, 102 (2004) (citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 100 (Seventh Ed.1999)). Similarly, the Legislature\u2019s use of the terms \u201cpassion and prejudice,\u201d suggests a review scheme whereby this Court ensures that the jury\u2019s sentencing decision was the result of law and principle and not some extraneous factor. Based upon this very limited review prescribed by Section 9711(h)(3)(i), it is not at all apparent how the absence of voir dire transcripts would hamper this Court\u2019s statutorily mandated review under Section 9711(h)(3), which exists merely to ensure that the jury\u2019s sentence of death was based upon law and principle. Cf. Commonwealth v. King, 554 Pa. 331, 721 A.2d 763, 777 (1998) (potentially improper statements made during voir dire are of \u201cless direct relevance to the jury\u2019s ultimate sentencing decision.\u201d). Instead, like most instances where a portion of the transcript was missing, \u201cto be entitled to relief due to the incompleteness of the trial record the defendant must make some potentially meritorious challenge which cannot be adequately reviewed due to the deficiency in the transcript.\u201d Commonwealth v. Marinelli, 589 Pa. 682, 910 A.2d 672, 688 (2006). And, in this case, as we have noted that any fault for the \u201cmissing\u201d transcripts fell squarely at counsel\u2019s feet, any such meritorious claim has to be raised as a claim of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, which requires Lesko to identify and develop the specific, defaulted voir dire-related issue he believes would have won the day on direct appeal.\nSimilarly meritless is Lesko\u2019s argument that this Court should review his claim under the \u201cpresumed prejudice\u201d standard announced by the High Court in Cronic. This Court has rejected an identical claim on a prior occasion. See Jones, 912 A.2d at 285. Briefly, Cronic stands for the proposition that a court will presume prejudice under certain limited circumstances if the defendant is denied counsel totally or at a critical stage of the proceedings. If Lesko could establish that the circumstances on direct appeal amounted to a total denial of counsel, warranting a presumption of prejudice, he would be entitled to nunc pro tunc relief. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Halley, 582 Pa. 164, 870 A.2d 795 (2005) (nunc pro tunc relief appropriate when counsel failed to filed 1925(b) statement, thereby waiving all issues); Commonwealth v. Lantzy, 558 Pa. 214, 736 A.2d 564 (1999) (nunc pro tunc relief appropriate when counsel failed to file requested direct appeal). But counsel\u2019s failure to request and secure the transcripts from voir dire did not amount to a constructive denial of counsel on appeal. This Court has held that the filing of an appellate brief, deficient in some aspect or another, which operates to default some claims, does not constitute a complete failure to function as a client\u2019s advocate so as to warrant a presumption of prejudice under Cronic. See Commonwealth v. Reed, 601 Pa. 257, 971 A.2d 1216, 1226 (2009). Yet, this is precisely the type of argument Lesko attempts to forward in this collateral appeal. This is not an instance where counsel failed to file a direct appeal at all, or filed an appeal that was doomed because all claims were later defaulted by counsel\u2019s lapse. Instead, counsel filed a direct appeal in which he forwarded numerous claims respecting the new sentence of death, which were decided on their merits. Whether counsel perceived no claims relating to voir dire, elected not to pursue such claims as he perceived, or simply failed to consider looking to voir dire for claims, the fact remains that Lesko had a fully counseled appeal. Whatever issue-specific complaints Lesko has respecting counsel\u2019s appellate performance sound in Strickland, not Cronic.\nIn summary, Lesko\u2019s only cognizable claim arising from the absence of voir dire notes on his direct appeal must sound in prior counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. We turn now to the individual claims respecting voir dire that Lesko, in the alternative, asserts counsel was ineffective for failing to discover and forward.\nFirst, Lesko challenges the \u201cmisstatements of law\u201d that, he believes, the trial court made during juror selection. Specifically, Lesko points to the trial court\u2019s language, which repeatedly described aggravating circumstances to the prospective jurors as circumstances that make the crime \u201cmore terrible\u201d and mitigating circumstances as circumstances that make the crime \u201cless terrible.\u201d Lesko links this supposed error to the previous allegation, addressed and rejected above, regarding the jury instructions issued before deliberations, and speculates that the combination of these errors produced a jury overly oriented to death. In a similar vein, Lesko asserts that the trial court failed to inform the first two empaneled jurors that mitigating circumstances could encompass any aspect of Lesko\u2019s background or character, even those not directly connected to the circumstances of the crime.\nThe PCRA court employed identical reasoning to that expressed when it reviewed Lesko\u2019s challenges to the jury instructions at the conclusion of the proceedings. The PCRA court found that, upon considering the charge in its entirety, the burden was not improperly shifted to Lesko. Accordingly, the court dismissed the underlying claim as meritless.\nIt is well-settled that the purpose of voir dire is to ensure the empanelling of a fair and impartial jury capable of following the instructions of the trial court. See Commonwealth v. Montalvo, 604 Pa. 386, 986 A.2d 84, 93 (2009). We agree that counsel was not obliged to object to the court\u2019s language which merely tried to give prospective jurors a sense of the roles of aggravators and mitigators in capital cases.\nAs we stated previously, the trial court\u2019s description of aggravating and mitigating circumstances as factors that made the crime \u201cmore terrible\u201d or \u201cless terrible\u201d was not an error. Moreover, contrary to Lesko\u2019s apparent view that his take on federal constitutional law provides a basis for micromanaging all utterances in a capital trial, nothing in the law obligated trial counsel, engaged in the process of jury selection, to parse the court\u2019s words and offer argumentative alternatives. The court\u2019s engagement with the jury in voir dire is not of the same magnitude as its role and interaction in describing to the selected jurors their actual obligations at the point where they retire to deliberate on the penalty verdict. Furthermore, any arguable omission regarding the broad character of mitigating circumstances during voir dire was later corrected by the trial court\u2019s proper instructions that told the jury that that it could consider \u201cany other mitigating matters concerning the character and record of the defendant or the circumstance or circumstances of his offense, including but not limited to, that the defendant is repentant----\u201d N.T., 2/17/1995, 26-27. Accordingly, this claim of ineffectiveness is meritless.\nLesko\u2019s next challenge arising from voir dire involves the trial court\u2019s decision not to grant the defense\u2019s challenge for cause regarding two prospective jurors. Lesko asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in this regard. He also points out that he exercised all of his peremptory challenges and asserts that the erroneous impairment of his right to use peremptory challenges is reversible error. At the end of his argument, Lesko adds a general averment that trial counsel was ineffective for not \u201cfully litigating\u201d this issue and for not pursuing it on appeal.\nGenerally speaking, this Court has indicated that a trial judge may properly refuse to excuse a juror for cause where the judge believes that the juror would be able to be fair and impartial. Commonwealth v. Marshall, 534 Pa. 488, 633 A.2d 1100, 1104 (1993). \u201cSuch a determination is to be made by the trial judge based on the juror\u2019s answers and demeanor, and will not be reversed absent a palpable abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. Expounding on the fair and impartial concept, this Court has given more specific guidance, explaining:\nThe test for determining whether a prospective juror should be disqualified is whether he is willing and able to eliminate the influence of any scruples and render a verdict according to the evidence, and this is to be determined on the basis of answers to questions and demeanor.... It must be determined whether any biases or prejudices can be put aside on proper instruction of the court.... A challenge for cause should be granted when the prospective juror has such a close relationship, familial, financial, or situational, with the parties, counsel, victims, or witnesses that the court \u25a0will presume a likelihood of prejudice or demonstrates a likelihood of prejudice by his or her conduct and answers to questions---- The decision on whether to disqualify is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed in the absence of a palpable abuse of discretion \u2014\nCommonwealth v. Wilson, 543 Pa. 429, 672 A.2d 293, 299 (1996) (quoting Commonwealth v. Colson, 507 Pa. 440, 490 A.2d 811, 818 (1985), abrogated on other grounds by Commonwealth v. Burke, 566 Pa. 402, 781 A.2d 1136 (2001)).\nThe first prospective juror that Lesko focuses on is Juror 52. The relevant portion of his voir dire testimony, according to Lesko, shows that Juror 52 \u201cwould be unable to consider\u201d any mitigating circumstances if the crime involved the killing of a police officer and was committed by a person who had committed other murders. Specifically, Lesko points to the following excerpt from Juror 52\u2019s testimony:\nQ. Do you believe that the death penalty is the only appropriate punishment for first degree murder of a police officer in the line of duty where the defendant has been convicted of other murders without regard to mitigating circumstances?\nA. Yes.\n[TRIAL COUNSEL]: That\u2019s all I have.\nTHE COURT: Did you understand that?\nA. Yes. In other words, for killing a police officer, I think it should be the death penalty. But you got to listen to everything first.\nN.T., Voir Dire, at 417. Lesko also cites to a further exchange with the trial court, on page 418, as further proof of the juror\u2019s supposed bias.\nThe PCRA court determined that after reading the entire transcript surrounding Juror 52\u2019s testimony (not just the select exchanges Lesko cites), the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the prospective juror could set aside his personal beliefs and follow the court\u2019s instructions.\nAlthough the select portion of the voir dire of Juror 52 quoted by Lesko might be troubling in isolation, as the PCRA court\u2019s opinion implicitly recognized, Lesko\u2019s argument fails to acknowledge what came after this exchange. The trial court\u2019s rather lengthy follow-up examination elicited that the prospective juror was confused by this line of questioning. When he was asked to put his understanding of the law in his own words, the juror stated, \u201cI would listen to both sides and think for myself what I would, you know, vote.\u201d Id. at 421. Furthermore, after trial counsel asked that the juror be excused for cause, the trial court brought the juror back for yet further questioning. During this follow-up examination, the juror appeared to understand the law and indicated unequivocally that he would not find that the potential aggravating circumstances at issue in this case automatically outweighed any mitigating evidence. Id. at 428. (Notably, the jury, of which this juror was a part, found four mitigating circumstances.) Lesko\u2019s argument, in short, is premised upon a misrepresented account of the juror\u2019s overall testimony. Accordingly, we agree with the PCRA court that Lesko has failed to prove that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue this discretionary claim on appeal.\nLesko\u2019s next-challenged prospective juror, Juror 146, was a self-identified \u201cnews bug,\u201d who had extensive familiarity with background information about the case from following it in the local news. Specifically, Juror 146 knew that Lesko had received the death penalty following the first trial, knew that Lesko (along with Travaglia) had committed three other murders and knew some of the details surrounding those murders, knew Judge Mihalich casually (it appears that they were neighbors at some point and may have graduated from high school together), and knew that Judge Mihalich had made statements to the press following Lesko\u2019s prior trial, but could not remember the substance of the statements. This particular juror also expressed some confusion about the law, stating that he believed the death penalty was automatic for any defendant convicted of killing a police officer and indicating that he could not \u201cunderstand why they had to retry [Lesko]. That always bothered me. But of course the law, there is so many loopholes----\u201d N.T., Voir Dire, 2/6/95, at 438-42. Lesko argues that a combination of this prospective juror\u2019s knowledge of inadmissible facts, specifically the fact that the death penalty was imposed following the first trial, and his misunderstanding of the law, demonstrated that Juror 146 was predisposed to impose a sentence of death. For these reasons, Lesko contends that the trial court should have granted trial counsel\u2019s challenge for cause, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to \u201cfully litigate\u201d the claim before the resentencing court and counsel should have pursued the issue on appeal.\nAgain, the PCRA considered the juror\u2019s testimony in its entirety, concluded that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying the challenge for cause, and thus rejected Lesko\u2019s underlying claim.\nAs was the case with the prior juror, there obviously were sufficient concerns with this prospective juror\u2019s initial testimony that trial counsel moved to excuse him for cause. But the motion having been denied in the trial court\u2019s discretion, we see no merit in Lesko\u2019s current claim that counsel was obliged to pursue the claim on appeal. The transcript is replete with testimony by Juror 146 that supported the trial court\u2019s discretionary decision. The juror made clear that he could follow the law. The juror repeatedly stated that he would be able to consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances before reaching a conclusion. See id., at 426, 427, 428, and 432. The juror also stated that he could put his prior knowledge of the case out of his mind in rendering a verdict. See id., at 433 and 442. The trial court was obviously better positioned than an appellate court, or a collateral review court, to assess the credibility of a prospective juror\u2019s assurances, a fact which correspondingly reduces the likelihood of success in an appellate challenge to such a discretionary decision. Accordingly, based on our review of the entirety of the testimony by Juror 146, we see no error in the conclusion of the PCRA court. For this reason, Lesko cannot demonstrate that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to \u201cfully litigate\u201d the issue or pursue the issue on direct appeal.\nLesko\u2019s next argument derives from what he alleges was the inconsistent and irreconcilable treatment of two different prospective jurors whose examinations revealed similar questions regarding their collateral knowledge of the law. Specifically, Lesko notes that the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s challenge for cause after a juror questioned whether life in prison meant there was no possibility for parole. On the other hand, Lesko complains, the trial court did not grant a defense challenge for cause after a prospective juror questioned whether there would be \u201canymore [sic] levels of appeal.\u201d Lesko points out that the second juror was the final juror empaneled and he avers that the trial court\u2019s inconsistent treatment of the two jurors violated due process, citing Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.S. 524, 526-27, 93 S.Ct. 848, 35 L.Ed.2d 46 (1973), as support. Lesko also acknowledges that trial counsel litigated the dismissal of the first juror for cause on direct appeal, but, to avoid the previous litigation bar, he avers that counsel did so ineffectively since he failed to juxtapose the trial court\u2019s handling of that juror with the court\u2019s allegedly inconsistent handling of the second juror for raising a similar question.\nIn resolving this question, the PCRA court concluded that Lesko was comparing \u201capples and oranges.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 53. The court acknowledged that if the trial court had acted inconsistently with regard to two jurors who had asked the same question, ie., about the possibility of parole for a life sentence, then it would find an inconsistency in the trial court\u2019s rulings. Here, however, the second juror asked a question about a different legal procedure and then specifically assured the court that her knowledge of the appeals process would not affect her verdict. Thus, the PCRA court concluded that there was no merit to Lesko\u2019s contention. We agree that Lesko has not shown that counsel was ineffective in the manner in which he litigated this claim on appeal.\nIn Ham, supra, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the trial court committed reversible error when it did not permit the defendant to question prospective jurors as to racial bias under the particular circumstances of that case. Ham does not stand for the broad proposition for which Lesko cites it. Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court has clarified that the decision in Ham was not of universal application. See Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U.S. 589, 96 S.Ct. 1017, 47 L.Ed.2d 258 (1976). Lesko does not cite the Ristaino case.\nIn any event, the situation presented here is different from that in Ham, as the question presented implicates the alleged inconsistent treatment of two prospective jurors. The record amply supports the PCRA court\u2019s finding that the inquiries by the two jurors were sufficiently distinct, in the circumstances, that there was no cognizable disparate treatment that counsel was constitutionally obliged to forward as part of his appellate claim. Additionally, as the PCRA court noted, it seems self-evident that prospective jurors will have a divergent range of knowledge and backgrounds and the linchpin in ruling upon challenges for cause must be whether the juror can be \u201cfair and impartial.\u201d See Marshall, supra. In this vein, the second juror indicated that her knowledge of the appeals process would not have any bearing on her decision. N.T., 2/8/1995, Excerpt of Jury Selection (Voir Dire), at 11. Accordingly, Lesko cannot prevail on his claim.\nN. General Challenges\nFinally, Lesko raises two summary claims. The first is a claim that the cumulative effect of all of the errors he has alleged warrants a finding of prejudice, such that a new trial and sentencing phase is warranted. We have deemed two claims to be arguably meritorious and disposed of them solely on grounds of lack of prejudice \u2014 the Brady claims and the ineffectiveness claim related to remorse, where we assumed arguable merit. The notion of \u201ccumulating\u201d prejudice does not easily flow from our disposition of such disparate claims. We note, however, that the measure of Brady materiality and Strickland prejudice are the same: a grant of relief depends upon finding a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different. Compare Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999) (\u201c[Brady ] evidence is material \u2018if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u2019 \u201d) with Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201cThe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d) Even cumulating the ineffectiveness/remorse claim and the Brady claims, all deemed insufficiently prejudicial on their own, we have no doubt that the outcome of the resentencing would have been the same, given the jury\u2019s specific findings, the strength of the aggravators, and common sense. Accordingly, this claim fails. Cf. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 600 Pa. 329, 966 A.2d 523, 532 (2009).\nFinally, Lesko avers that he was denied meaningful appellate review of his case when he was not given the opportunity to demonstrate a number of systemic defects in this Court\u2019s proportionality review database. Lesko avers that he should have been afforded an evidentiary hearing to establish his claim. Additionally, Lesko attacks his trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to participate in the proportionality review process. This Court has examined the issue attacking the method employed by this Court in conducting proportionality review on prior occasions and has concluded that our proportionality review met the requirements of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711 (h)(3)(iii). See Commonwealth v. Spotz, 587 Pa. 1, 896 A.2d 1191, 1249 (2006) (and cases cited therein). Accordingly, we will not consider this issue anew.\nFor the reasons stated herein, we reverse the order of the PCRA court, granting Lesko a new trial and a new penalty hearing, and we dismiss the petition for PCRA relief.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nJustices EAKIN, BAER, McCAFFERY and ORIE MELVIN join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\nJustice TODD files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nThis case was reassigned to this author.\n. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\n. The Third Circuit initially remanded the case to the federal district court, as will be discussed infra, to resolve an evidentiary issue relevant to resentencing, before the case proceeded to a second penalty hearing.\n. The four aggravating factors were: the victim was a police officer killed in the performance of his duties, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(1); the defendant had a significant history of felony convictions involving use or threat of violence to the person, \u00a7 9711(d)(9); and the defendant had been convicted of another federal or state offense for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable, namely, the murders of Peter Levato and Marlene Sue Newcomer, \u00a7 9711(d)(10) (one aggravator for each murder). The four mitigating factors were: the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, \u00a7 9711(e)(2); the defendant\u2019s service to others; the defendant's horrible childhood; and the defendant\u2019s change in character over the last fifteen years of his confinement, the last three mitigators falling under the catchall provision of Section 9711(e)(8).\n. Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\n. The Commonwealth does not dispute that Lesko's ineffective assistance of counsel claims regarding his second penalty trial are timely.\n. The PCRA court\u2019s iteration of the tenet relating to the timing of the presentation of ineffectiveness claims was consistent with Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687 (1977). The Hubbard rule was subsequently overruled in Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002). The instant petition was filed prior to the overruling of Hubbard.\n. For a full treatment on the historical availability of federal habeas review for convicted state prisoners, see Kent S. Scheidegger, Habeas Corpus, Relitigation, and the Legislative Power, 98 Colum.L.Rev. 888, 928-933 (May 1998).\n. A necessary consequence of this non-deferential review scheme was that lower federal courts often injected errors into otherwise valid state court proceedings. See, e.g., Wright v. West, supra (reversing circuit court that had erroneously granted habeas relief to state prisoner on sufficiency of evidence claim); Dunn v. Simmons, 877 F.2d 1275 (6th Cir.1989) (concluding that Kentucky\u2019s procedure for litigating validity of prior convictions violated federal standards, but Kentucky rule was later found to \u201ceasily pass[] constitutional muster\u201d by U.S. Supreme Court in Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 113 S.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992)).\n. A different part of Fay was overruled on other grounds in Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977) (procedural default constitutes independent and adequate state ground preventing federal habeas review).\n. The Fay Court further explained:\n[T]he writ of habeas corpus is a new suit brought by the petitioner to enforce a civil right, which he claims as against those who are holding him in custody. The proceeding is one instituted by himself for his liberty, and not by the government to punish for his crime. The judicial proceeding under it is not to inquire into the criminal act which is complained of, but into the right to liberty notwithstanding the act. It is not a proceeding in the original action.\nFay, 372 U.S. at 424 n. 34, 83 S.Ct. 822.\n. In using the terms \"reverse\" and \"affirm,\u201d the Third Circuit was not referring to the Pennsylvania judgment of sentence, but to the order of the federal district court.\n. Lesko argues that, because his direct appeal of his second death penalty sentence was pending with this Court when the PCRA was amended in 1995, he was unable to file a PCRA petition challenging trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness until that appeal concluded. In support of his argument, Lesko cites this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Lark, 560 Pa. 487, 493, 746 A.2d 585, 588 (2000), wherein we held that, \u201cwhen an appellant\u2019s PCRA appeal is pending before a court, a subsequent PCRA petition cannot be filed until the resolution of review of the pending PCRA petition by the highest state court in which review is sought, or upon the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d Lark is distinguishable because, in that case, the appellant had a pending PCRA petition, not a direct appeal from a resentencing proceeding, which was deemed to require a delay in filing a serial PCRA. In addition, Lark obviously did not constrain appellant's options and decisions in 1995, five years before Lark was decided. And finally, nothing in Lark purports to create an extra-PCRA right to pursue a second post-conviction attack as of right, outside the realm of the PCRA\u2019s serial petition and time-bar restrictions. Appellant\u2019s guilt phase claims are available only to the extent he can satisfy the terms of the PCRA.\n. The bulk of Lesko\u2019s non -Brady guilt phase claims sound in counsel ineffectiveness and are time-barred for the reasons discussed in the text above. Lesko also raises two questions arising from his prior conviction for the murder of William Nicholls, which he poses as direct appeal counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to raise them on direct appeal, following resentencing. First, he contends that the prosecution for the murder of Officer Miller should have been barred by 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 110 because of his guilty plea to the murder of Nicholls. According to Lesko, the two events were part of a single criminal episode. See Commonwealth v. McPhail, 547 Pa. 519, 692 A.2d 139 (1997) (plurality). Alternatively, Lesko argues that, if the two murders were not part of a single criminal episode, then evidence of the Nicholls murder should not have been admitted at trial or resentencing.\nAlthough posed as resentencing errors, it is clear that these are guilt phase claims, and thus they too are time-barred. To the extent Lesko challenges the admission of evidence surrounding the Nicholls murder for purposes of resentencing, that claim is fully discussed infra.\n. This Court previously summarized Rutherford\u2019s trial testimony as follows:\nRutherford\u2019s testimony consisted of an account of how he had accompanied Lesko and Travaglia from the Edison Hotel in downtown Pittsburgh, where the Appellants had abducted one William Nicholls in his automobile; how Travaglia had shot Nicholls in the arm and then forced him to drive them out of town; how both Appellants had abused Nicholls along the way; how they had driven to a lake and, after Rutherford helped them find a large rock, how Appellants had taken Nicholls down to the lake and returned to the car without him. Rutherford testified that the trio then went to Travaglia's father\u2019s house where they stole a .38 caliber pistol, and returned to the house and forced Rutherford to enter the garage to get other ammunition after they found the gun contained the wrong type. Rutherford then testified to their speeding past Officer Miller several times, and to the subsequent shooting of Miller by Travaglia.\nTravaglia, 467 A.2d at 296-97.\n. We note also that the Commonwealth\u2019s Brady obligations can be cabined by the nature of the discovery request. In this pre-Kyles case, Lesko\u2019s counsel requested all evidence \"favorable to the accused which is material either to guilt or to punishment in the possession or direct control of the attorney of the Commonwealth.\u201d Lesko did not ask for information in the control of the police or of the prosecuting authority generally.\n. Notably, Lesko has not suggested what Montgomery would have said if confronted with his earlier claim that he knew nothing of the shooting.\n. The Supreme Court of Georgia summarily denied review of the claim.\n. The focus of the CO/DO, like the PCRA court, is on what counsel did not do and allegedly should have done, including his failure to alert Dr. Levit as to the possibility of organic brain damage. This focus gives little notice to the course actually pursued by counsel. As discussed herein, in considering the reasonableness of penalty phase counsel's strategy, the course actually pursued by counsel must be one of the factors to consider. Additionally, as detailed infra, much of Dr. Crown's testimony at the PCRA hearing suggested that there were signs that neuropsychological testing was indicated based on the results of the tests Dr. Levit actually administered. Dr. Levit\u2019s alleged incompetence is a centerpiece of Lesko\u2019s claim; but, to place the expert's alleged error at counsel's feet unmoors the analysis from Strickland.\n. Although appellant was involved in three murders prior to the murder of Officer Miller, at the resentencing here, the jury was permitted to consider the evidence related to only two of the murders for purposes of determining aggravating circumstances. This restriction was a product of the grant of federal habeas relief. See, supra, Section I (discussing federal district court's ruling on Indiana County guilty plea).\n. We note that the PCRA court did not preside over the resentencing trial, and thus, is no better positioned than this Court to assess the effect the evidence at the PCRA hearing would have had on the resentencing jury.\n. The specific line of questioning was as follows:\nQ: You were also called as a witness in your previous trial; isn\u2019t that correct?\nA: During the sentencing phase, sir. Yes, sir.\nQ: Did you think at that point it might be important to tell that jury that you were intoxicated and under the influence of drugs back between December 27th and January 3rd?\nN.T., 2/16/1995, at 68. Thereafter, defense counsel objected, the trial court overruled the objection, and the prosecutor continued the line of questioning, asking Lesko why he \"said nothing about being under the influence of alcohol at the time of the Miller killing....\u201d Id. at 73. In response, Lesko confirmed that he said nothing along those lines during the prior penalty phase hearing.\n. Lesko generally testified about what he had learned since being in prison and being exposed to religious beliefs and literature. Defense counsel then asked, \"how do you feel about these crimes for which you have been convicted,\" and the following occurred:\nA: I feel bad about them, sir.\nQ: How is that?\nA: I\u2019m sorry that I did them. I\u2019m sorry that I got involved in them. I wish it was humanly possible that I could change that, but I can see no way I can do that, sir.\nN.T., 2/16/1995, at 66-67.\n. We emphasize the narrowness of Lesko\u2019s current underlying argument. Lesko does not argue that his failure to express remorse when interviewed after his arrest for the murder of Levato was not relevant proof that he actually lacked remorse for his crimes, or that failure to volunteer remorse does not fairly raise an inference of lack of remorse. Rather, his claim is confined to a broad argument that no reference can be made to silence at the time of arrest.\n. The Commonwealth does not dispute that Lesko's evidence in this regard was properly relevant mitigation evidence.\n. The claim of ineffectiveness could only sound in direct appeal counsel\u2019s failure to forward the issue on appeal from the resentencing, as trial counsel asked that the evidence of Travaglia's death sentence be admitted at trial, but the Commonwealth objected. The trial court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection. N.T., 2/16/1995, at 21.\n. This presumption was based on the fact that the jury had recommended a sentence of life in prison. The Court reasoned that the jury could have made such a recommendation only because it found mitigating evidence, including non-statutory mitigating evidence, that outweighed aggravating evidence. In Florida, the trial court was bound to accept the jury's recommendation unless there were such \"clear and convincing\u201d facts to the contrary \u201cthat virtually no reasonable person could differ.\u201d 498 U.S. at 313, 111 S.Ct. 731. Furthermore, the trial court was required by law to consider any mitigating evidence, which necessarily included the non-statutory mitigating evidence presented to the jury. Id. at 314, 111 S.Ct. 731.\n. In any event, Lesko has not shown a reasonable probability that the outcome of the sentencing proceeding would have differed if only the charge had been issued. Lesko's one-sentence argument that the jury may have viewed the evidence for a different purpose and considered it as an additional aggravator is purely speculative and unsupported by the record. Indeed, there is nothing to suggest, other than Lesko\u2019s bald allegations, that the jury considered aggravating circumstances beyond those found by it and enumerated on the verdict slip. In any event, as discussed previously, there was overwhelming evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict of death. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Cox, 603 Pa. 223, 983 A.2d 666, 689-90 (2009) (finding no prejudice from counsel\u2019s failure to request cautionary instruction where there was overwhelming evidence of guilt).\n. In a footnote, Lesko also declares that \"multiple weighing as aggravation of the same conduct\u201d has been condemned by \"many state courts\u201d on various grounds. Brief of Appellant Lesko, at 50 n. 30, citing, e.g., Parsons v. Barnes, 871 P.2d 516 (Utah 1994); State v. Scott, 177 Ariz. 131, 865 P.2d 792, 805 (1993) (opinion and cases relied on therein merely state, without explanation, that one fact cannot be weighed twice); State v. Gay, 334 N.C. 467, 434 S.E.2d 840 (1993) (opinion and cases cited therein rely on statutory construction and not on federal constitutional analysis); Willie v. State, 585 So.2d 660, 681 (Miss. 1991) (court simply announced that \"a jury cannot be allowed the opportunity to doubly weigh the commission of the underlying felony and the motive behind the underlying felony as separate aggravators,\u201d followed by string cite); People v. Bigelow, 37 Cal.3d 731, 209 Cal.Rptr. 328, 691 P.2d 994, 1006 (1985) (no independent analysis other than cite to prior cases from other states such as Cook v. State, 369 So.2d 1251, 1256 (Ala. 1978), State v. Rust, 197 Neb. 528, 250 N.W.2d 867, 874 (1977), and Provence v. State, 337 So.2d 783 (Fla.1976)). As Lesko provides no further elaboration on this point, we will confine our review to his single discernible argument, directed only to the Tenth Circuit McCullah case decided after his resentencing.\n. Ignoring that his claim is cognizable only as a claim of ineffective assistance, Lesko simply declares, inter alia, that the failure to issue a Simmons charge: violated the Eighth Amendment requirement that a capital jury consider all relevant mitigating evidence; violated the Eighth Amendment's protection against arbitrary and capricious sentences as the jury was not informed of all sentencing choices; offended \"evolving standards of decency\u201d in violation of the Eighth Amendment; violated due process as the sentence was imposed based on inaccurate information; violated a supposed due process right to force the jury to choose between death and \"life without possibility of parole;\u201d and skewed the jury\u2019s weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in violation of the right to a fair and impartial jury.\n. The PCRA court cited Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 116-117, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), for this proposition.\n. It is worth noting that, in cases involving age as a disqualifying constitutional factor both for capital eligibility and eligibility for sentences of life imprisonment without possibility of parole, the U.S. Supreme Court has chosen strictly chronological, hard lines, even though the animating principle involved the same vicissitudes of youth that Lesko cites. See Graham v. Florida,-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010) (Eighth Amendment prohibits sentence of life without parole for juveniles (defined as individuals under 18) who did not commit homicide); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (Eighth Amendment prohibits imposition of capital punishment for offenders committing their crimes prior to age 18) Those over eighteen get no benefit from these constitutional decisions, irrespective of their subjective \"psychological and emotional age and level of maturity.\u201d\n. The statements by Judge Mihalich referred to in the text are statements that he made to the press following the PCHA hearing. Notably, the statements were later cited as the basis for an appellate issue raised by co-defendant Travaglia, who argued that Judge Mihalich should have recused himself from the PCHA proceedings. See Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 541 Pa. 108, 661 A.2d 352, 369-70 (1995). This Court concluded that the PCHA court did not abuse its discretion in denying Travaglia\u2019s motion for recusal.\n. Lesko links this argument with the prior argument, asserting that the trial court\u2019s prior failures to grant meritorious challenges for cause violated due process by denying Lesko his full Rules-based complement of peremptory challenges. Related to this issue, Lesko points to trial counsel's testimony at the PCRA hearing where he stated that he would have struck this particular juror if he had any peremptory challenge remaining. We need not consider these additional arguments as we have concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defense counsel's challenges for cause.\n. The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court is directed to transmit a complete record of this case to the Governor in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 971 1(i).",

However, I agree with the majority\u2019s holding concerning prejudice. See Majority Opinion, at 193-98, 15 A.3d at 383-87.\nIn this regard, I find this case to be very different from the Sattazahn decision, which I authored, and which is cited in the concurring and dissenting opinion. See Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, at 261-63, 15 A.3d at 424-26. In particular, the penalty-phase presentation in Sattazahn was truly paltry. Moreover, the little evidence that was presented there was of the humanizing type, see Sattazahn, 597 Pa. at 676 n. 8, 952 A.2d at 656 n. 8, as opposed to explanatory-type mitigation, which was presented in the Lesko resentencing proceedings at considerable length, see Majority Opinion, at 190-91, 15 A.3d at 381-82. See generally Commonwealth v. Brown, 582 Pa. 461, 521, 872 A.2d 1139, 1174 (2005) (Saylor, J., dissenting) (discussing the differences between humanizing- and explanatory-type mitigation, as well as one court\u2019s observation that \u201c[w]e have rarely granted habeas relief based solely upon humanizing, rather than explanatory mitigation evidence in the face of extensive aggravating circumstances\u201d (citation omitted)).\nIndeed, the present circumstances seem to me to be much closer to the scenario in Commonwealth v. Miller, 605 Pa. 1, 987 A.2d 638 (2009), in which the Court recently affirmed a denial of post-conviction relief. See id. at 40-54, 987 A.2d at 662-69. My reasoning in the present case is also similar to that supporting my concurrence in the denial of post-conviction relief in Commonwealth v. Cox, 603 Pa. 223, 290-91, 983 A.2d 666, 707 (2009) (Saylor, J., concurring), Commonwealth v. Clayton, 572 Pa. 395, 407, 816 A.2d 217, 223-24 (2002) (Saylor, J., concurring), and Commonwealth v. Bond, 572 Pa. 588, 622, 819 A.2d 33, 53 (2002) (Saylor, J., concurring).\n. In particular, I agree with the PCRA court that trial counsel's eleventh-hour preparation in a capital case exemplifies the deficient stewardship. While the majority shifts the responsibility for any lapses from counsel to the mental-health expert, Dr. Levit, see Majority Opinion, at 190-92, 15 A.3d at 382-83, Dr. Levit appears to have been put in a very difficult situation, as he was contacted after the trial voir dire process already was underway. See, e.g., N.T., Dec. 15, 1999, at 183 (reflecting Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony that he did not have time to elicit extensive information from family members, \"nor was there time between the time I was contacted and the time of the trial to go into any depth\u201d); accord Commonwealth v. Lesko, No. 681 C 1980, slip op. at 11 (C.P. Westmoreland Aug. 7, 2006) (\"The inadequacy of Dr. Levit's evaluation was further exacerbated by the fact that he was hired at the last minute.\u201d).\n. In terms of quantity alone, the defense evidentiary presentation in Sattazahn spanned eight pages of the penalty-hearing transcript, see Commonwealth v. Sattazahn, 597 Pa. 648, 674, 952 A.2d 640, 655 (2008); whereas, the defense presentation on resentencing in Lesko spans three volumes of the transcripts.\n. In Miller, for my part, I also differed with the majority finding of a reasonable strategy relative to a truncated mitigation investigation, but I did not reach the prejudice issue in Miller as I felt additional development was required in the post-conviction court. See Miller, 605 Pa. at 67-72, 987 A.2d at 678-80 (Saylor, J., dissenting).",

        "text": "Justice TODD,\nconcurring and dissenting.\nI. GUILT PHASE\nWith respect to the disposition regarding the guilt phase, I join the Majority Opinion in reversing the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d) court\u2019s order granting Appellant John Lesko a new trial.\nII. PENALTY PHASE\nWith respect to the disposition regarding the penalty phase, I respectfully dissent from the Majority Opinion insofar as it reverses the PCRA court\u2019s order granting Lesko a new penalty hearing. For the following reasons, I would affirm the PCRA court in that regard.\nThe PCRA court granted Lesko a new penalty trial based on his claims that Attorney Marsh was ineffective for, inter alia, (1) failing to retain a neuropsychologist for the purpose of providing a reliable evaluation of Lesko\u2019s mental health and/or organic brain damage; and (2) retaining a clinical psychologist, but neglecting to provide sufficient preparation time or material collateral information to allow the psychologist to conduct an appropriate evaluation and reach a reliable diagnosis. In doing so, the PCRA court stated:\nThree years before the 1995 sentencing, and in anticipation thereof, trial counsel, Mr. Marsh[,] consulted University of Pittsburgh law professor Welsh White with regard to the relationship between child abuse and brain damage. In October 1992, Professor White provided Mr. Marsh with literature on the topic and a sample motion to obtain psychological and neurological testing of the Petitioner. Mr. Marsh recognized that child abuse and neglect were significant factors in the Petitioner\u2019s argument that a life sentence should be imposed, rather than death, and he agreed that evidence of brain damage would be a \u201cvery important matter to bring to the attention of the jury.\u201d\nNonetheless, and despite having been advised otherwise, Mr. Marsh retained a clinical psychologist, Herbert Levit, Ph.D., on February 6, 1995, after jury selection had already begun for the second sentencing trial and only three days before the trial commenced. In counsel\u2019s own words, he hired Dr. Levit \u201con the eve of trial.\u201d\nDr. Levit is not a neuropsychologist, and as a consequence, was incapable of conducting a neuropsychological assessment of the Petitioner\u2019s cognitive functioning. Furthermore, Mr. Marsh did not specifically advise Dr. Levit that he had been apprized [sic] of the link between abuse and organic brain damage, and that that may be an area of relevant inquiry. As a result, Dr. Levit conducted a standard mental status examination, which was not designed to detect either cognitive or organic dysfunction.\nThe inadequacy of Dr. Levit\u2019s evaluation was further exacerbated by the fact that he was hired at the last minute. Within the week prior to the examination, he reviewed a summary report that had been prepared by the investigative firm, Alfonso Associates, and he had telephone conversations with two family members. He did not review any prior psychological or psychiatric evaluations, although he was aware that the records existed. He did not review any of the trial transcripts or any of the discovery materials. He did not review or consider any of the voluminous collateral information in the Children and Youth Services records that contained detailed information concerning the Petitioner\u2019s life history. As a result, based upon limited information, he made an assessment of the Petitioner\u2019s personality, and concluded that the Petitioner suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder and Polysubstance Abuse.\nDuring the PCRA proceedings, the Petitioner presented the testimony of Dr. Barry Crown, a neuropsychologist who testified that both the institutional records and Dr. Levit\u2019s evaluation contained indicia of brain damage that would have been revealed with neuropsychological testing tools and a properly qualified and competent evaluator.\nDr. Crown painstakingly went through the institutional records and noted those entries that would be red flags to anyone who was trained to diagnose the presence of organic brain damage: the Petitioner had an unusual gait, exhibiting some form of psychomotor difficulty at an early age; uninhabitable and deplorable housing conditions (inoperable windows, broken doors, floors falling apart, lead-based paint, absence of hot and cold running water, animal and human feces on surfaces in the home, decaying food on the counters and in the refrigerator, and an infestation of insects and flies); general and continuous neglect of the Petitioner\u2019s and his siblings\u2019 health; the Petitioner played with dead rats; and the Petitioner was set on fire by boys in the neighborhood, which resulted in a one-month stay in the hospital. He explained that these facts have neuropsychological significance because the combination of \u201cgeneral neglect\u201d and \u201ca young child under stress, we know ... produces difficulties at critical stages in brain development.\u201d Growing up in deplorable conditions is neuropsychologically significant and constitutes an indicator of brain damage that should be further explored.\nThe records contained relevant information concerning the Petitioner\u2019s physical well-being and his behavior as a child that were significant to Dr. Crown\u2019s neuropsychological investigation. The Petitioner suffered from childhood insomnia, hyperactivity and headaches; he was described as having \u201cepisodic dyscontrol,\u201d a form of organically impaired impulse control; he chronically suffered from inadequate nutrition; his mother was a chronic drinker, indicating the possibility that the Petitioner was subject to fetal alcohol involvement; a long and continuing history of high fevers and ear problems; and multiple indications of head trauma (assaulted by other children and punished aggressively at home).\nThe records also contained significant references to a long history of drug and alcohol abuse and exposure to environmental toxins. At an early age \u2014 as early as 8 years old\u2014 the Petitioner started drinking alcohol, huffing over-the-counter toxic substances, experimenting with illegal drugs, and eating paint chips. Dr. Crown explained how damaging it is to the brain to ingest alcohol and other toxins at a young age, when the brain is still developing. Furthermore, he noted that the records disclosed a history of blackouts, which would also indicate a history of alcohol-related brain cell damage.\nAll of the above references in the records were indicators that neuropsychological assessment for brain damage was needed.\nIn addition to the institutional records, there were numerous red flags in Dr. Levit\u2019s report that indicated that neuropsychological testing should be conducted. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (\u201cWAIS\u201d) intelligence test that was administered by Dr. Levit revealed significant differences among the test scores both between the Verbal and Performance categories and the inter-test scatter. According to Dr. Crown, both sets of test scatter provided neuropsychologically significant evidence of brain damage. Not only did the test scoring suggest the need for further testing to ascertain the presence of brain damage, but is itself \u201ca pathognomic sign[, mjeaning that it represents the very strong possibility and likelihood of a pathology, of an impairment, of a deficit\u201d and \u201cwould be an extremely strong indicator of ... the strong likelihood of organic brain damage.\u201d\nLikewise, the results of Dr. Levit\u2019s administration of the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test and the House-Tree-Person Test provided data that suggested the need for further neuropsychological testing.\nIn addition to the psychological test results, Dr. Crown noted that Dr. Levit\u2019s diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder raised important issues relating to the possibility of brain damage \u2014 the symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder substantially overlap the behavior manifestations of organic brain damage. Accordingly, Dr. Levit\u2019s diagnosis, although limited, was yet another sign that the Petitioner may be suffering from organic brain damage.\nIn corroboration of Dr. Crown\u2019s suspicions, the Allegheny County Children and Youth Services records that were not provided to the defense until the April 2002 PCRA hearing, also contained substantial evidence to support a conclusion that further neuropsychological testing of the Petitioner was indicated. Among the indicators were the results of intelligence tests by school psychologists that were significantly similar to the most recent test results, and evidence that the Petitioner\u2019s siblings, as well, suffered from brain damage, dysfunction and mental retardation.\nOn October 28, 1999, Dr. Crown administered a complete neuropsychological test battery to the Petitioner. As a result of the Petitioner\u2019s performance on those tests, Dr. Crown concluded to a reasonable degree of neuropsychological certainty that the Petitioner is brain damaged and was brain damaged at the time of the offense. The Commonwealth did not offer any expert testimony in opposition to Dr. Crown\u2019s diagnosis and was unable to discredit Dr. Crown\u2019s methodology or conclusions on cross-examination. As a consequence of his findings, Dr. Crown determined that, at all relevant times, the type of brain damage from which the Petitioner suffered, and continues to suffer, constitutes an extreme and emotional disturbance (42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(2) mitigating circumstance) and a significant impairment in his ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of law (42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(3) mitigating circumstance).\nOnly after Dr. Levit had an opportunity to review the institutional records, as a consequence of the filing of the PCRA petition and the preparation of the case by new counsel, was he able to recognize the deficiencies in his original evaluation, and recommend neuropsychological testing to confirm the likelihood of brain damage. His new diagnoses and findings included post-traumatic stress disorder; failure to thrive syndrome; substantial impairment in Petitioner\u2019s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct and conform his conduct to the requirements of the law; probable brain damage; and the failure of social services to rescue Petitioner and his siblings from the abject environment in which they were raised.\nPCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 10-15 (record citations and footnotes omitted).\nBased on the foregoing, the PCRA court concluded: \u201cthe testimony of a neuropsychologist at the sentencing hearing with regard to [Lesko\u2019s] organic brain damage would have added significant additional and relevant information for the jury to consider as it weighed mitigating factors against the aggravating factors;\u201d there was no reasonable basis for Attorney Marsh\u2019s failure to present such testimony; and there was a reasonable probability that, but for Attorney Marsh\u2019s ineffectiveness, the results of the penalty proceeding would have been different. PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 16. The PCRA court also concluded that Attorney Marsh was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence, including evidence of extraordinary abuse and neglect that Lesko endured as a child. Based on these findings, the PCRA court determined Lesko was entitled to a new penalty hearing.\nWith respect to the PCRA court\u2019s determination that Attorney Marsh was ineffective for failing to retain the services of a neuropsychologist to present evidence that Lesko suffered from organic brain damage, the Majority finds error in the PCRA court\u2019s analysis because \u201cit placed the burden of an expert\u2019s knowledge on counsel\u2019s shoulders and framed the reasonable strategy question narrowly without considering the course actually pursued by counsel at the resentencing.\u201d Majority Opinion at 186, 15 A.3d at 379-80. The Majority further \u201ccaution[s] that, in applying Strickland, courts must be careful not to conflate the roles and professional obligations of experts and lawyers,\u201d noting:\nit is telling that Dr. Crown\u2019s testimony at the PCRA hearing was directed at the examination conducted by Dr. Levit and not the strategy of counsel; thus, Dr. Crown opined that the results of some of the testing conducted by Dr. Levit raised \u201cred flags,\u201d which indicated that neuropsychological testing should be conducted. Certainly, these psychological \u201cred flags\u201d could not be directed at counsel, who was unschooled in mental health matters, but were directed at Dr. Levit. In fact, by the neuropsychologist\u2019s own testimony, the diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder \u2014 a diagnosis made by Dr. Levit, not trial counsel \u2014 should have raised a question relating to the possibility of brain damage. Again, such opinions, if valid, may call into question Dr. Levit\u2019s professional performance, but that is not the same thing as providing a basis to fault trial counsel\u2019s legal performance.\nId. at 190, 15 A.3d at 382. I respectfully disagree with the Majority\u2019s determination in this regard.\nAs the PCRA court recognized, Attorney Marsh became aware of the link between child abuse and brain damage after consulting -with Professor White in 1992. Attorney Marsh also was aware that Lesko had been severely abused and neglected as a child, and testified that he knew that evidence of brain damage would be a \u201cvery important matter to bring to the attention of the jury.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 12/14/99, at 134. Notwithstanding this knowledge, and despite the fact that Professor White provided Attorney Marsh with a sample motion to obtain psychological and neurological testing of Lesko, on the eve of trial Attorney Marsh retained a clinical psychologist \u2014 Dr. Levit \u2014 as opposed to a neuropsychologist to evaluate Lesko.\nMoreover, despite the information counsel obtained from Professor White regarding the link between child abuse and brain damage, and despite his knowledge of Lesko\u2019s abusive childhood, Attorney Marsh failed to either alert Dr. Levit of the link between abuse and organic brain damage or suggest that Dr. Levit investigate the possibility of organic brain damage in Lesko. Attorney Marsh also failed to provide Dr. Levit with numerous documents, including records from Children and Youth Services, which, according to Dr. Levit\u2019s own testimony at the PCRA hearing, would have resulted in new or additional diagnoses of Lesko, including probable brain damage and substantial impairment in the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 12/15/99, at 239-42.\nWhile it is true that counsel cannot be expected to be a mental health expert, and although Attorney Marsh may have been officially \u201cunschooled in mental health matters,\u201d Majority Opinion at 190-91, 15 A.3d at 382, the evidence shows in the instant case that Attorney Marsh was aware of the severe abuse and neglect Lesko suffered during his childhood. Attorney Marsh also had knowledge of the link between child abuse and brain damage, and, by his own testimony, understood the importance of presenting evidence of Lesko\u2019s brain damage to the jury in an effort to avoid a death penalty verdict. Indeed, Attorney Marsh had been given related literature, and even a sample motion to obtain neurological testing of Lesko, yet he failed to act. Under such circumstances, I can conceive of no reasonable basis for counsel\u2019s failure to further investigate the matter, including obtaining the appropriate expert and providing that expert with the information known to him. Accordingly, I believe the PCRA court properly concluded that Attorney Marsh had no reasonable basis for failing to retain a neuropsychologist to evaluate Lesko and present testimony regarding organic brain damage.\nNext, the Majority indicates that, even if it agreed with the PCRA court that Attorney Marsh\u2019s investigation \u201cwas unreasonable and constitutionally deficient, and that there was some basis in law to say that lawyers are obliged to consult neuropsychologists, rather than clinical psychologists,\u201d id. at 388, it does not agree with the PCRA court\u2019s determination that Lesko established he suffered actual prejudice, as required under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). I likewise disagree with the Majority\u2019s conclusion with respect to this issue.\nThe Majority opines:\nLesko has not established that the resentencing proceeding was rendered unreliable by counsel\u2019s alleged lapse. This was a jury that found four mitigating factors, relating to two distinct statutory mitigating circumstances. Thus, the jury was engaged in a balancing of aggravators and mitigators, yet voted for death (just as Lesko\u2019s first sentencing jury had). To find Strickland prejudice arising from the failure alleged herein, we must conclude that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, absent counsel\u2019s failure to present the mitigation evidence he currently proffers, [Lesko] would have been able to prove at least one [more] mitigating circumstance by a preponderance of the evidence and that at least one jury member would have concluded that the mitigating circumstance(s) outweighed the aggravating circumstance(s).\u201d\nMajority Opinion at 192-93, 15 A.3d at 383 (citation omitted).\nThe Majority further reasons:\n[B]ased on counsel\u2019s presentation, the jury had found that Lesko was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, \u00a7 9711(e)(2), and it is entirely speculative how much more weight the testimony of a neuropsychologist such as Dr. Crown would have lent to this mitigator already found. Of course, it is possible that opinion testimony on brain damage from a neuropsychologist might persuade a juror that Lesko was unable to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law under Section 9711(e)(3). But, Lesko must also show that there is a reasonable probability that, in the overall evaluation, at least one jury member would have concluded that the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating circumstances.\nFaced with the aggravating circumstances where the defendant has been found guilty of multiple murders occurring within a one-week period, including the cold-blooded murder of an on-duty police officer, and the case in mitigation already successfully presented, we simply cannot conclude that Strickland relief can be premised upon the additional mitigation evidence the PCRA court found would have carried the day. The PCRA court failed to consider the full context of the case in rendering its finding as to Strickland prejudice. We do not believe there is a reasonable probability that further expert opinion evidence, including evidence of Lesko\u2019s \u201corganic brain damage\u201d would have resulted in a different weighing and different penalty verdict when the aggravating circumstances were so patently grave, and the jury already found substantial mitigating factors, only to return with a verdict of death.\nId. at 195,15 A.3d at 384-85 (footnote omitted).\nIn support of its holding, the Majority cites the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in Smith v. Spisak, -U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 676, 175 L.Ed.2d 595 (2010), wherein the Court held that, even presuming the closing argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel at trial was constitutionally inadequate, there was no reasonable probability that a better closing argument would have made a significant difference in the outcome. The Majority explains that the Spisak Court, in reaching its conclusion:\nconsidered the context of the case, which included Spisak\u2019s admission and supporting testimony that he committed three murders and attempted to commit two others. The Court stressed that at the time of the sentencing the jurors had fresh in their minds the government\u2019s evidence regarding the killings as well as Spisak\u2019s \u201cboastful and unrepentant confessions and his threats to commit further acts of violence.\u201d The Court also noted that the defense experts\u2019 testimony, which was offered to show that Spisak suffered from a mental infirmity, was fresh in the jurors\u2019 minds; and, the Court did not \u201csee how it could have made a significant difference had counsel gone beyond his actual argument \u2014 which emphasized mental illness as a mitigating factor and referred the jury to the experts\u2019 testimony \u2014 by repeating the facts or connections that the experts had just described.\u201d Id. at 687-88. Notably, even the concurrence by Justice Stevens, which stressed \u201chow thoroughly egregious counsel\u2019s closing argument was,\u201d ultimately concluded that Spisak was not entitled to relief in light of Spisak\u2019s testimony and his \u201cmonstrous\u201d crimes. Id. at 693.\nThe case sub judice obviously is not on all fours with the situation in Spisak. Most importantly, in this case we consider a claim of an allegedly incomplete mitigation presentation, and not a deficient jury argument. But the opinion is instructive as to how this Court should address the question of prejudice under Strickland. The Spisak Court made clear that the prejudice analysis must be viewed in the context of the case; and in this case, the developed penalty-related facts were grim indeed.\nMajority Opinion at 193-94,15 A.3d at 384.\nTo say that the instant case \u201cobviously is not on all fours\u201d with Spisak is, to my mind, an understatement. In Spisak, the evidence suggesting Spisak suffered from a mental infirmity, which the Court determined had been summarized in a deficient closing argument, had been fully developed and presented to the jury. In the instant case, testimony that Lesko suffered from organic brain damage was never presented to the jury, and, thus, the jury did not have the opportunity to consider whether Lesko lacked the ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. In short, Spisak concerned a poor closing argument, whereas the instant case involves a failure to present relevant evidence.\nWith regard to the Majority\u2019s ultimate conclusion that, in light of the gravity of the crimes, there is no reasonable probability that additional expert testimony, including evidence of Lesko\u2019s organic brain damage, \u201cwould have resulted in a different weighing and different penalty verdict,\u201d Majority Opinion at 195, 15 A.3d at 385, as this Court explained in Commonwealth v. Sattazahn,\nin terms of prejudice, we recognize that the substantial aggravation advanced by the Commonwealth encompassed Appellee\u2019s commission of the present killing in the perpetration of a robbery, as well as his history of violent offenses including two murders. Nevertheless, the presentation at trial of the credited post-conviction evidence would have provided support for the finding of several statutory mitigators, which also bore upon the degree of Appellee\u2019s culpability in terms of selecting between capital punishment and a life sentence. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 319,109 S.Ct. 2934, 2947,106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989) (explaining that \u201cevidence about the defendant\u2019s background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background, or to emotional and mental problems, may be less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse\u201d (quoting California v. Brown, 479 U.S. 538, 545, 107 S.Ct. 837, 841, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring))). The absence, due to an inadequate investigation, of substantial, relevant, mitigating evidence diminishes confidence in the outcome of the sentencing proceeding, particularly given the appropriate single-juror frame of reference. See Wiggins [v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 537, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) ] (articulating the prevailing standard for assessing prejudice from deficient stewardship in the presentation of mitigation evidence in terms of whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance\u201d).\n597 Pa. 648, 676-77, 952 A.2d 640, 656-57 (2008) (footnote omitted).\nIn the instant case, the jury found four mitigating factors, relating to two separate mitigating circumstances, namely, that Lesko was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, \u00a7 9711(e)(2); and the catch-all provision of Section 9711(e)(8). Testimony that Lesko suffered from organic brain damage would have implicated an additional mitigating circumstance \u2014 the inability of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law under Section 9711(e)(3) \u2014 that had not already been found by the jury. Furthermore, as the PCRA court recognized, because the jury is instructed to engage in a qualitative rather than a quantitative weighing of mitigating and aggravating circumstances, there is a reasonable probability that uncontroverted testimony such as Dr. Crown\u2019s regarding Lesko\u2019s organic brain damage would have resulted in the jury giving greater weight to the Section 9711(e)(2) mitigator in favor of a life sentence. PCRA Court Opinion, 8/7/06, at 22. Accordingly, I cannot agree with the Majority\u2019s conclusion that, even if the jury had been presented with evidence of an additional mitigating circumstance under Section 9711(e)(3), Lesko failed to show there was a reasonable probability that at least one jury member would have concluded that the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating circumstances.\nFor the reasons discussed above, I find no error in the PCRA court\u2019s conclusion that trial counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to retain a neuropsychologist for the purpose of evaluating Lesko and presenting testimony on organic brain damage. Furthermore, I agree with the PCRA court\u2019s determination that, but for counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in this regard, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the penalty proceeding would have been different. Accordingly, I believe the PCRA court properly held that Lesko is entitled to a new penalty hearing, and I would affirm the PCRA court\u2019s grant of a new penalty hearing on the basis that Lesko was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel. Hence, I dissent from the Majority Opinion to the extent it reverses the PCRA court\u2019s order granting Lesko a new penalty hearing.",
