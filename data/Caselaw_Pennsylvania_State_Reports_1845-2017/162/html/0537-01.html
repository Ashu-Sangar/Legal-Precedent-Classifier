The height of the embankment was variously estimated at from two and one half to four feet. ■ The night of the accident was in the dark of the moon but the stars were shining. Plaintiff in describing the accident testified : “ The wheel just seemed to me as if it was going in a deep rut on the left hand side. . . . When I first got in, it seemed as if I was in a deep rut; when I got a little piece on, if I had pulled the right line there I could have stayed on the pike.” Several witnesses testified that the road was dangerous at the point where the accident occurred. Plaintiff was not familiar with the road.</p>

All that it requires of him is to do as a prudent man would do under the circumstances. Did this man in endeavoring to extricate himself from this danger do as a careful, prudent man should have done under the circumstances ? This is for your consideration and for you to say. You or I might not have done as he did. It is hard to tell what a prudent man in his situation would have done. The presumption is that the injured party did do what a prudent man would have done under the circumstances in which he found himself placed; and in those courts which do not require plaintiffs to prove by affirmative evidence as part of his case, that he was free from fault, the absence of negligence on his part may be inferred from the love of life or the instincts of self-preservation and the known disposition of men to avoid injury to themselves.] ” [8]</p>
