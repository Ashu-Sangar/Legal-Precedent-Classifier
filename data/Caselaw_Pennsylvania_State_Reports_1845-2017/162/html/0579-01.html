There is no devise of the residuary estate, and in the event of this bequest being held invalid the amount will be distributable to the next of kin of the testatrix.

The British statutes of mortmain were never in force here, and though the statute of 43d Elizabeth has not been re-enacted, yet its spirit has been fully recognized in judicial decision. No better illustration is needed of the extent to which the law of Pennsylvania has gone in sustaining charitable bequests than is found in the language of this court in Witman v. Lex, 17 S. &amp; B. 93, where it was said “ it is immaterial whether the person to take is in esse or not, or whether the legatee was, at the time of making the bequest, a corporation capable of taking or not, or how uncertain the objects may be, provided there be a discretionary power Vested anywhere over the application of the testator’s bounty to those objects, or whether their corporate designation has been mistaken. If the intention sufficiently appears on the bequest, it <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>would be held valid.” By a rule peculiar to gifts of this nature the charitable purpose of the donor will be carried into effect, notwithstanding the indefiniteness of its immediate objects: 1 Jarman on Wills, 216.
