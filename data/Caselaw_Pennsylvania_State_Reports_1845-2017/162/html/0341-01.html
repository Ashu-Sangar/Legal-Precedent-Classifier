      <em>“ </em>Now the plaintiff contends that, Wanamaker having constructed that ditch or drain by which the water which accumulated on Marketstreet flowed over and across plaintiff’s premises into and upon that section of the Wanamaker lot which was purchased in 1872 by Scheible, she has the right to conduct this flow of water in the same way across her premises by that drain and discharge it upon this lot of defendant. There is nothing <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>in her deed which gives her this right. Nor is there anything in the deed to Seheible which subjects his property to that servitude. [But a servitude of this kind may be created in another way. I said Mr. Wanamaker had a right to subject his premises to a burden which resulted from a condition of things which he himself had created. Now when the property came to be subdivided, the party buying that section of the property, which is benefited by the servitude which the original owner impressed upon that property, would have a right to have it continued if, when he bought, the same was clearly defined upon the premises. But where it does not lie in grant and is notapparent, he can only enforce it against a subsequent purchaser of the property sought to be charged, by actual notice to the party that the property he is about to buy is subjected to such an easement. But where it is apparent on the face of things themselves that that servitude has been impressed upon the premises, then such subsequent purchaser is bound to take notice of it. If by the appearance of the property itself a party ought to see that the property has been so subjected, the law charges him with notice. He takes the property charged with that servitude just as though written in his deed.] [1] ....</p>

By surface water we mean water which accumulates upon one’s premises from rain or snow and runs off on the premises of another. The declaration does not charge that the defendant obstructed the flow of the surface from her premises alone, but water which came from Market street, through gutters, sewers and drains, and which had an established channel across the plaintiff’s lot and discharged itself upon the defendant’s premises, constantly or continuously.” [Just here I may say that the circumstance of these premises being within the borough limits is without significance in this controversy.

[If by recent grading of the public streets a greater volume of water than Wanamaker originally provided for has been thrown into this channel, more than it can carry off, the defendant would have the right to protect his premises against the increased flow, but he would not be warranted in shutting up this drain to protect himself against this increased flow, if by so doing he flooded the plaintiff’s premises or increased the flooding of the same to any extent.] [3] In a word, if you find for the plaintiff, then in assessing the damages you will have regard only to so much of the flooding of plaintiff’s premises as resulted from the defendant’s act, leaving out of consideration the flooding which resulted from increased drainage occasioned by change of grade in the streets or from other cause, if any there was.”</p>

W. H. Wanamaker owned a tract of some five acres of ground in what is now the borough of Chambersburg. The rain water which <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>fell on the higher ground in the vicinity and accumulated in the street upon which the lot fronted, flowed thence through an opening which was a well-defined surface water course, and spread over the land. In 1867 W. H. Wanamaker changed the opening from the street to a point a few feet distant and constructed a ditch by whi.u the water, which before had run upon and over his land, was conducted to a pond in the back part of his lot. His purpose in making the change was twofold ; to relieve the front of his lot from the flow of water so that he could improve it, and to collect the water in a pond at the rear where he could utilize it in manufacturing bricks. He ■erected a number of small dwelling houses on the front, one of-which he sold to the plaintiff in 1867; and in 1872 lie sold the whole of the back part to the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b369-3" data-blocks='[["BL_369.4",369,[185,1119,1184,711]]]'>When these sales were made the ditch was a well-defined ■surface water course two or three feet deep and as many wide, which conducted the rain water, which otherwise would have run over the surface, to the pond mentioned. By a recent grading of the street the flow of water in the ditch has been somewhat increased, and the defendant, to avoid injury therefrom, placed obstructions in the ditch at the point where it enters his land, causing the overflow which injured the property of the plaintiff. The case has been argued here upon the right of the owner of a lower lot of land to shut off the surface water flowing from a higher one. It was submitted to the jury upon the trial as involving only the question of servitude imposed upon the defendant’s land by the former owner of both properties.</p>

The grantor of both plaintiff and defendant while he was the owner of the whole property changed the natural channel to adapt the parts to the uses to which he intended to put them. This created an easement in favor of the land which he conveyed to the plaintiff, and imposed a servitude upon that which he afterwards conveyed to the defendant. Both parties bought with notice of this, and both are bound by it. The charge of the learned judge carefully guarded the defendant from a recovery for injuries caused by an increased flow of water resulting from a <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>change of grade of the streets by the borough authorities, and left him liable only for his own act in diverting the water which would have run upon his property before the change of grade.</p>
