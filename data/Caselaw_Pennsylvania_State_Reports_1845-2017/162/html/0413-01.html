In 1853, Seymour street was projected across the center of plaintiff’s lot, and placed on the city plan. The street was not opened, however, until December, 1890. In 1861 plaintiff sold to one Edward Royal all that portion of his lot lying south of the plotted street, and in making his deed of the land sold he referred to Seymour street as a boundary as follows: “ Beginning at a point on the southeasterly side of Seymour street” .... by a line running “to the southeast side of said Seymour street, thence .along the southeast side of Seymour street to the place of beginning.” In 1862 the plan was confirmed by the court of quarter sessions. In 1866 plaintiff sold to one Juliana Mintzer all that portion of his lot lying north of the plotted street, referring in his deed to the side of Seymour street as a boundary.</p>

In that case a man held a certain four lots on a street in Phcenixville, called Main street; lots 23, 24, 25 and 26. In 1887, an ordinance of the borough of Phcenixville was passed, laying out a certain street called Fourth avenue, running at right angles Avith Main street. Those lots were fifty feet Avide, and Fourth avenue, as laid out, occupied the Avhole of lot 23, and ten feet of lot 24.

Between 1887 and 1889, the owner of the property — the plaintiff in that case — divided the lots again into three lots instead of four. Originally he had four fifty-foot lots. He had taken from him by the borough fifty feet from lot 23 — the whole lot — and ten feet from lot 24; so he had left all of lots 25 and' 26, and forty feet of lot 24, making in all which he had left 140 feet. He divided that into three lots of 461 feet each, and he conveyed two of those lots away; that is to say, he conveyed part of lot 24, which was left him, and part of lot 25. He conveyed two of those lots away, and he described the property as being bounded bjr Fourth avenue, the new street, and all that he had left then was a part of lot 26.

[But taking those things into account you must not fix such a price upon this property that leaves out of it the inconveniences, situated as this property is, not through the act of the city, but through the act of the plaintiff himself in excluding himself from interfering with the use or enjoyment of this property by the owners of the adjoining property, which he conveyed to them, a part of which enjoyment was the access to this street.] [5] In their testimony as to the value of this property, from nothing on the part of the witnesses for the defendant — the city — who say that the property was worth nothing, up to considerably over two thousand dollars on the part of certain witnesses called by the plaintiff, one witness said it will be worth as much whether Tacoma street was there or not, and another one said that no matter whether this property had any access or not it was still just as valuable. That is a matter for you to say. You will say what you think land of that kind under such circumstances is worth.

The learned court below very carefully instructed the jury as to the right of the plaintiff to have damages under those decisions. Undoubtedly the plaintiff’s right as to the use of the ground lying in the bed of Seymour street, was affected by his conveyances to Mintzer and Royal. Certainly whenever Seymour street was opened the plaintiff could do nothing to obstruct the use of that street by his grantees. Beyond all question they had a right of free passage over the street, and it could not possibly be occupied by buildings, either as against the city or the plaintiff’s grantees. It was of no use to theorize about the value of the ground as building lots, since it could not lawfully be used for any such <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>purpose. The evidence on that subject was received, but it could not be permitted to constitute the basis of an inflated claim for damages upon a theory which had no lawful existence. The learned court did leave to the jury the question, what was the value of the land taken subject to the right of way of the plaintiff’s grantees, and also to the right of the city to open the street. On this subject there was considerable conflict of testimony, the defendant’s witnesses testifying that in such a situation the land had no value whatever, some of the plaintiff’s witnesses testifying that it was worth about two thousand dollars notwithstanding these restraints upon the plaintiff’s rights in the land, and others admitting that these restraints would impair its value materially. So far as Tacoma street is concerned the same consideration would be applicable, and therefore we do not think there was any error in the views expressed by the learned court below on that subject. The opening of these two streets occurred so nearly together that there could be no appreciable effect upon the measure of damages whether Tacoma street was opened a little before or a little after Seymour street was opened; and in any event we do not see how this piece of ground, which would not admit of any buildings being erected upon it, could have any additional value imparted to it by the opening of a street which simply led up to it. Had the ground of the plaintiff been capable of use for building lots, of course the case would have been different. But the court did leave to the jury to say what was the plaintiff’s land worth in view of all the circumstances, and the jury said it was worth nothing. The assignments of error are dismissed.</p>
