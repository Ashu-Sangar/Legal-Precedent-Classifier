It gives notice that the capital stock is to be raised to five mills, but no notice whatever that the personal property tax is to be raised to four mills, and especially no notice to corporations that, under the provisions of the act of 1885, they are to be responsible for the four mills tax on their bonded indebtedness.’</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b640-6" data-blocks='[["BL_640.6",640,[285,2102,1160,403]]]'>“ It will be seen that this title expressly declares that the act amends the 1st section of the act of June 1, 1889. But it was this first section which imposed the tax on loans at the rate of three mills on the dollar on their nominal value; therefore, when the title declared that this section was amended, it clearly gave notice that the rate of the tax on loans might be changed by the act. We are therefore unable to see that the constitutional provision above referred to has been violated.</p>

But the act of 1891 does not deal with the subject of the collection of the tax, and therefore there was no necessity for such reference. It simply fixes the rate of the tax on loans, leaving the method for its collection provided by the act of 1885 in full force. This method is that the treasurer of the corporation is required ‘ to assess the tax imposed and provided for state purposes upon the nominal value ’ of all the indebtedness of the corporation, due to and owned by residents of the state ; and it is ‘ his further duty to deduct three mills on every dollar of the interest paid,’ and ‘ return the same into the treasury.’</p>

This section was repealed and supplied by the 1st section of the act of 1889, which continued the tax at the same rate; but the 4th section of the act of 1885 was left in full force and unchanged, and the tax imposed by the 1st section of the act of 1889 was collected under it without question until this 1st section was repealed by the 1st section of the act of 1891, which changed the rate of taxation from three mills to four; and if this change had not been made we do not think it would have been questioned that the tax is still to be collected under the 4th section of the act of 1885. But it is now contended that the 4th section of the act of 1885 is repealed by this change of rate ; or that if not repealed, it does not require or authorize the treasurer of the corporation to assess, retain, and pay over to the state treasurer more than a three mills tax.</p>

And on well understood principles it cannot be repealed by implication unless the two acts are so inconsistent with each other that they cannot stand together. We fail to find any such inconsistency. The subject of the act of 1885 is the collection of the tax. But the act of 1891 does not touch this subject; therefore, as we view it, it does not affect the former act. It is true, there is an apparent inconsistency between the tax rate of four mills, in the ac.t of 1891, and the direction to retain and pay to the state treasurer three mills in the act of 1885. But <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>this is rather a discrepancy between different parts of a system of legislation on the general subject of taxation of corporations, than a conflict between different acts on the same specific subject; and it is to be dealt with as a matter for construction and reconciliation, rather than as a question of repeal.</p>

For it is to be noted that the words are: ‘It shall be his further duty to deduct three mills on every dollar of the interest paid.’ But the tax imposed by the first section was ‘ three mills on the dollar of the value ’ of the indebtedness, or in other words, three mills per cent on the principal, and not on the interest. Hence, if the words had been taken literally, they would not have authorized the retention of the tax imposed by the 1st section, and by the 1st clause of section 4 required to be assessed when interest was paid. But it was plain that the legislature intended that the same tax which was assessed should be retained and paid to the state, and therefore, in Del. Div. Canal Co. v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/123/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="123 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="967114" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0594-01">123 Pa. 594</a>, the court decided that the words must be so construed as to reach this result.</p>

Mr. Justice Clark?, adverting to the fact that deducting three mills on the dollar of interest paid would not collect the tax, said at page 625: ‘ The word of (on) in the 4th section was doubtless intended for off; this is a manifest blunder, and cannot be permitted to change the plain meaning of the legislature.’ But this reading would not correct the ‘manifest blunder,’ for three mills off every dollar of the interest paid would not realize a tax of three mills on the principal. Therefore, while this is given by the learned justice as the mode of reaching the decision that the spirit of this language and the ‘plain meaning of the legislature ’ was to authorize and require the treasurer <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>to deduct the three mills tax upon the principal, it was really reached by reading into the act that the treasurer was authorized and required to deduct ‘ the tax imposed by law; ’ and we need not read anything more into it now to make it apply to the tax imposed by the act of 1891. In other words, the letter of the law required the treasurer to deduct three mills on every dollar of interest paid; the tax imposed by law and required to be assessed was a tax of three mills on every dollar of the principal, and the court decided that the treasurer was bound to deduct the tax imposed. The principle of the decision is that he must deduct the amount of ‘ the tax imposed and provided for state purposes,’ which he is required in the same section to assess on the nominal value of each evidence of debt.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b644-5" data-blocks='[["BL_644.5",644,[257,1095,1166,1066]]]'>“We are therefore of the opinion that, while the act of 1891 changes the rate of taxation from three to four mills, it neither repeals nor supplies section 4 of the act of 1885, relative to the collection of the tax from the holders of corporation bonds within the state. The language of the section as to the amount of tax to be deducted on payment of interest by the treasurer, cannot be taken literally as applied to the act of 1891, but neither could it as applied to the act of 1885, or the subsequent act of 1889, and meeting this difficulty, under the act of 1885, the Supreme Court, in the case above cited, in effect decided that the spirit of the act was to require the treasurer to deduct the same amount which he was required to assess, which was and still is ‘ the tax imposed and provided for state purposes.’ The only change that has been made is that now, by the act of 1891, the tax so ‘imposed and provided’ is a tax of four mills instead of three, as it was by the'act of 1885 and the act of 1889; and we think the principle of this decision, as well as the necessity of preserving the symmetry of the taxing statutes, warrant us in holding that the act of 1885 authorizes and requires this tax to be assessed, retained from the interest, and paid to the state by defendant’s treasurer.</p>

A careful consideration of the record has satisfied us that there is no error therein of which the defendant has any just reason to complain. The court was clearly right in holding: (1) That the act of June 8, 1891, under which the commonwealth claims, is not unconstitutional because of alleged defects in its title, or for any other reason ; (2) That section 4 of the act of June 30,1885, is still in full force ; and (3) That, by virtue of said last mentioned section, it was the duty of defendant company’s treasurer to assess, retain and pay over to the commonwealth the tax imposed by the first section of the act of June 8,1891, on so much of its indebtedness as was held and owned by residents of Pennsylvania ; and, for his failure or neglect to do so, said company is liable.</p>
