Does the contractor stipulate by this first sentence quoted, he will file no lien for himself? As a final settlement of this kind of contention, we decided in Nice v.

In the most favorable interpretation of this clause for the appellee, it is ambiguous; it is not an express covenant against a contractor’s lien, nor does such covenant result from necessary implication. Under Nice v. Walker, <a href="/pa/153/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="153 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="840389" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0123-01">supra,</a> it must be one or the other. But that this stipulation was not intended by either party as a covenant against a lien by the contractor himself, is manifest from the extreme caution taken by the owner to otherwise protect itself from any and all claims of the principal contractor. The 11th and 12th clauses of the contract stipulate, that if he neglect at any time to employ skilled workmen, or provide proper material, the owner shall provide both, and deduct the cost from the contract price; that payment shall be made on fortnightly estimates of the architect in writing; that 20 per cent of the estimate shall be retained by the owner; that before each payment, if required, the contractor shall produce the official certificate of the proper officer, that no lien has been filed by which the owner can be held liable, and for which the contractor is chargeable; that if <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>any such lien be filed, and the amount payable to the contract- or is not sufficient to satisfy it, the contractor covenants to pay the same; that payments are to be made as stipulated by the owner, only in case all artisans and material men having claims against the building are fully paid and satisfied. From a perusal of the whole agreement, it is the “ action ” of the contractor with those he is, in the 12th clause, expressly authorized to employ, that is intended to be guarded against by this stipulation. The contractor is to be paid only 80 per cent of his fortnightly earnings for both work and material; he is not to be paid this if any liens are filed in the interval. There was no possible peril to any one under this contract, except to the principal contractor ; the owner never could be in any danger of paying a single dollar twice, that is, once to the contractor, and again to the subcontractor and material men. Therefore, as it was wholly unnecessary to stipulate against a lien by the contractor, the owner did not do so, and did not so intend.</p>

It is stated by Justice Green thus: “ The controlling question in this case is, can the subcontractor file a lien for the work and materials done and furnished by him, notwithstanding the stipulations of the principal contractor ? ” It was decided that he could not. That was a case by the subcontractor against the owner, and while the language of the agreement is assumed to be a covenant against liens, also, by the contractor himself, that was not the question before the court. So in Evans v. Grogan, <a href="/pa/153/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="153 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="840232" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0121-01">153 Pa. 121</a>, it was distinctly announced that what was decided in Schroeder v.

Walker was intended to “ finally settle the question involved.”</p>

Walker; but the interpretation put upon the words of the agreement in Schroeder v. Galland was acknowledged to have been more favorable to the owner than was warranted; that they' did not constitute an express covenant against liens, nor was such covenant a necessary implication.</p>
