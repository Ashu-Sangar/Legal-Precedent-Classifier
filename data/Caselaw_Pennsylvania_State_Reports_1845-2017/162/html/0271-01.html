He went to the public sale and bid upon the horses ; to him they were struck down; he signed the note with security given to the person who sold the horses; and all this was done without the wife in any way appearing in the transaction. The husband did not say to any one, or give any public notice, that he was representing his wife, or that he was acting as her agent; he did not sign the note as her agent, but appeared there as an individual, offered his own credit to the parties, in connection with the credit of his surety, and to him the property was knocked down. [In my opinion th&amp;t was a sale to him upon his own credit. And even if he is to be treated as her agent, — and we presume for the present that he was her agent, — nevertheless the case is still not within the particularly essential requisite that the credit must be given to her individual property.] [1] A married woman can purchase a property upon her separate estate, but it must distinctly be upon the credit of that separate estate. . . . That is the law. If a married woman attempted to buy upon credit, and it appeared that she had a separate estate, although she did have a <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>separate estate, yet if the credit was not given on that particular estate, her purchase would be invalid, and the property would be subject to levy and sale, by her husband’s creditors. Now, that is just this case. Assuming that the husband was acting as the agent of his wife, that at the sale he was there representing her, the case would stand just as if she herself had been there, and then the sale would be a sale upon her credit. But there is not a particle of evidence to show that any credit was given to the wife’s separate estate. [She was not at the sale, and was not represented at the sale. And there is nothing (to my mind) that would justify me in submitting this question to you, whether she bought this property upon the credit of her separate estate. Therefore, we have concluded to withdraw it from your consideration. And what applies to the first horse applies equally well to the second.] [2] ....</p>
