Cake, the money was furnished by J. A. Cake. That he was the real owner of the note, and therefore J. W. Cake was a competent witness; that afterward it was paid, in part at least, by defendant receipting on his assigned judgment for certain purchase money due from J. A.

Cake, but, when testifying as on cross-examination, he explains that this was a temporary loan to his wife who afterward repaid him. [The money therefor having been furnished by her, and the note on which judgment was entered having been, in fact, the property of Minnie E. Cake, and her rights therein having passed by will to J. A. Cake, who represents her upon the record, Joseph W. Cake, the other party, is incompetent to testify.] [2]</p>

Our examination of the record has led us to the conclusion that there is nothing in either of the specifications of error that would justify a reversal. The learned president of the common pleas rightly held that Minnie E. Cake, the payee in the note and original plaintiff in the judgment, being dead, the defendant Joseph W. Cake is not a competent witness, and without his testimony there is not sufficient evidence to justify the court in making the rule to show cause etc. absolute. There is nothing in the case that requires discussion.</p>
