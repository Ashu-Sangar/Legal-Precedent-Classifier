It is contended by the appellees <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>that, being an apportioned lien, it is good against all the houses for six months after the last house was finished, although the particular house in question may have been finished long before. The case of Wilson v. Forder, <a href="/pa/30/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="30 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="415595" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0129-01">30 Pa. 129</a>, decides against this proposition, and although counsel for the appellees treat that decision as if it were nugatory, we do not find that it has ever been overruled, and we are not referred to any ease in which the same question has been decided in opposition to it. We do not propose to decide that or any of the other questions discussed in the paper-books, upon a mere motion for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. It is highly necessary that the precise facts should be known and appear upon the record in order to intelligently decide upon the several questions arising, and for that purpose the case must be sent to a jury and regularly tried on all its merits.</p>
