Mr. Peirson then said that he and Mr. Duncan then discussed what skins he was to get and the price he was to give for them, and that it was there agreed between them that' the defendants were to furnish him one hundred and twenty dozens a week, and that the price paid for these was to be two dollars and fifty cents for one quality and three dollars and fifty cents for the higher quality; that he was to be furnished with the lower class as far as they would go, and if they could not make up the one hundred and twenty dozens by furnishing the two dollars and fifty cents skins they were allowed to make up the number by the three dollars and fifty cents skins, so that the whole amount he should get of one or the other of those was to be one hundred and twenty dozens a week; that in consequence of that for a certain length of time they went on and furnished him according to the contract.</p>

He does agree that he went to see Mr. John Peirson, and that at his office he signed this agreement with his brother, Charles Peirson, to take all those skins at three dollars; but he testifies positively that he made no arrangement at all after that. He says : ‘ Well, I made no arrangement with Mr. Peirson at all. They were made with his brother, C. C. Peirson. I made a contract with him for six months to pay him three dollars a dozen and one dollar and fifty cents a dozen for the common stock. I did not make aiyr arrangement with John Peirson at all. He came and told me that his brother’s pelts were for sale. Of course, I made arrangements with C. C. Peirson, and I signed the contract in John W. Peirson’s office.

But the plaintiff claimed that the defendants verbally promised to furnish him <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>one hundred and twenty dozen pelts each week from the 18th of July, 1891, to the first of January, 1892, and that in violation of their promise they refused to deliver pelts to him after September 4,1891. He also claimed that in consequence of their refusal to deliver the pelts he sustained damage equal in amount to the profit he would have made if they had complied with their promise, and this profit he estimated at one dollar and fifty-nine cents a dozen. The defendants positively denied the existence of any such agreement between them and the plaintiff as was testified to by him, and they introduced evidence to show that, at -the prices he paid for the pelts, it was not possible for him to make the profit upon them which he claimed as the measure of his damages for their default. While denying that they were bound to furnish pelts to the plaintiff in accordance with his claim, the defendants admitted that, from the 18th of July to the 4th of September inclusive, they sold to him seven hundred and nine dozens of them ; and they averred that they ceased to sell them to him solely because of his inability or unwillingness to pay for them on delivery. To this averment the plaintiff replied that he was not bound to pay for the pelts when they were delivered, but that, under a previous course of dealing between the parties and a custom of the trade, he was entitled to thirty days within which to pay for them after their delivery to him. It will be observed from this statement of the claims of the litigants that there were several issues of fact to be decided by the jury upon the evidence. Was there a contract between the parties, and if so what were its terms? Was the plaintiff to pay for the pelts on delivery or thirty days thereafter? Was the evidence in relation to prior dealings between the parties and a usage of the trade sufficient to overcome the presumption that the pelts were tobe paid for when delivered? Assuming that the defendants were bound to furnish pelts to the plaintiff in accordance with his claim, what damages, if any, did he sustain in consequence of their refusal to do so ? These were questions naturally arising from the evidence and to which the attention of the jury should have been directed in appropriate instructions. But the learned trial judge submitted the case without any reference to the legal principles applicable to it, and upon an inadequate and misleading statement of the claims of the con<a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>tending parties. He told the jury what the plaintiff claimed in regard to a contract with the defendants for the sale and delivery of pelts, and that the defendants denied having made any such contract with him. He also told them what the plaintiff claimed in respect to the damages sustained by the breach of the contract, but he did not refer to the testimony submitted by the defendants in answer to the claim for damages, nor furnish the jury any rule or standard by which the damages were to be measured. The omission of instructions in relation to damages left the jury without any guide whatever in the ascertainment of them, and iii this particular the charge was clearly inadequate. In its statement of the claims made by the parties it was misleading because, while the plaintiff’s claims were fully presented in it, the claims of the defendants were not so presented. The plaintiff’s claim in relation to damages rested solely upon his own oath, while the defendants’ answer was supported by the testimony of three disinterested and intelligent witnesses, and yet the learned judge brought the former to the attention of the jury and did not even allude to the latter. These witnesses were familiar with all the known processes or methods of tanning and were engaged in the same business as the plaintiff. They testified that in 1891 there was no profit in tanning pelts at the prices the plaintiff paid for them. This testimony, if brought to the attention of the jury and credited by them, would have defeated the plaintiff or reduced the verdict in his favor to a nominal sum. The plaintiff’s only answer to it was that he was the possessor of a tanning process of his own discovery which was known only to himself “ and to a man that he could trust,” and that by means of it he was able to make a profit in tanning pelts while other parties were losing money in the business. He did not call the “man that he could trust” to corroborate him in this statement.</p>
