L. 63, which declares that ‘ Companies incorporated under this act must be organized upon the joint stock or mutual plan, and the power to insure upon both plans shall not exist in the same corporation.’ . . . This argument was not much pressed, however, and we need only say in reply — as was said in Schimpf v. Insurance Company — ‘We must not confound a stock policy with a cash policy. They are essentially different. ■ The payment of a cash premium does not decide the character of a policy as to whether it is mutual or stock. A mutual company may insure for either note or cash, so may a stock company. The distinction between them rests bn different’ principles. A stock policy is issued solely upon the credit of the capital stock of the company to one who may be an entire stranger to the corporation, who acquires no right of membership by reason of his policy, no rig-ht to participate in its profits, and who subjects himself to no liability by reason of its losses. ’ . . . This is the ‘ joint stock plan ’ referred to by the act of 1876. ‘Mutual companies, on the other hand, are somewhat of the nature of a partnership ; the insured becomes a member of the incorporation by virtue of his policy, is entitled to a share of the profits, and is responsible for the losses to <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>the extent of his premium paid or agreed to be paid..’ This is the ‘ mutual plan ’ referred to by the act; and it seems to us quite clear that the section in question simply forbids the incorporation of a company to insure upon both plans at the same time, and is not concerned with the kinds of policies which a mutual company may issue. [This company, therefore, although organized upon the mutual plan, had the power to issue cash policies ; and it seems to follow that, if the defendant's policy was of this description, the mere fact of his membership did not necessarily imply a liability to assessment.] [3]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b665-4" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[167,889,1168,506]]]'>“ [If, then, we turn to the defendant’s contract, we find no language therein which either expresses or implies that assessment thereof is possible. Neither in the application, nor in the policy, nor in the ‘ conditions of insurance ’ indorsed upon the policy, nor in the notes given as part of the premium, is there the remotest allusion to the possibility of future assessment: but the whole contract is plainly based upon a distinctly specified cash premium, of which a part was paid when the policy was delivered, and the remainder was payable (and was after-wards paid) in two installments.] [4]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.6",665,[167,1403,1170,1016]],["BL_666.1",666,[250,374,1166,146]]]'>“ This is insurance upon the cash plan as explained in Schimpf v. Insurance Company, and there would be no ground at all for the plaintiff’s contention if it was not for the company’s seventh by-law, which provides as follows: ‘Each and every person insured shall thereby become a member of the company, and shall be liable to pay his or her proportion of all losses and expenses at such time or times as the directors for the time being may require, in proportion to the amount insured by such members.’ Even this language is ambiguous. It does not in terms speak of assessment, and while it may mean that future assessments are to be expected, the inference might also be drawn that the due ‘ proportion of all losses and expenses ’ chargeable to a cash policy was estimated in advance and charged against the policy; and especially might this inference seem reasonable, if it was observed that each note accompanying a cash policy was made for a definite proportion, namely, one per cent of the amount insured by such policy. And as this proportion was to be paid in any event, even if there were no losses or expenses to be met thereby, it might fairly be said that these notes were given for <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>assessments estimated in advance to cover contingent losses and expenses, and, therefore, that the obligation of the by-law was fully met when the notes were paid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b666-4" data-blocks='[["BL_666.5",666,[251,526,1169,916]]]'>“ But, assuming the by-law to refer only to future assessments, the question remains: Was the defendant bound by it? it certainly was not brought to his notice before the policy was issued. The company’s charter was never recorded; its bylaws were not printed upon its policies, and are in no way alluded to therein; the defendant did not know their contents, and they are not referred to in his contract, either directly or indirectly; and, therefore, the only knowledge with which the defendant can be fairly charged is such as he might derive from the fact that the corporation was called a ‘ mutual ’ company. But this word does not necessarily imply that every policy would be liable to assessment. [Mutual companies may issue cash policies as well as policies subject to assessment, and therefore the defendant was not bound to suppose that, when the company offered him a policy which upon its face was for cash alone, nevertheless there might be a by-law which contradicted the face of the policy and turned it into a contract liable to assessment.] [5]</p>

Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/51/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="51 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="999762" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0402-01">51 Pa. 402</a>, and Burger v. Ins.

The proposition is not denied, but it does not now apply. In the cases cited the point decided was that, after the insured had become a member, he was bound to learn the rules of the company, and to be governed by them as to his future conduct; for example, as to selling the property insured, or as to obtaining additional insurance thereon. But this does not affect the present question, which has to do solely with the relations between the company and an applicant for insurance before he becomes a member. Upon this question there is an early case (Ins. Co. v. Perrine, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20351" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 351">7 W. &amp; S. 351</a>), which held the applicant to be bound by a regulation of which he did not have actual knowledge ; the decision being put upon the ground that, as the applicant was bound to know from the act'of incorporation (P. L. of 1839, page 124) that he whs about to become a member, <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>the court would presume that he had made himself acquainted with the company’s regulations. This ruling may still be valid upon the precise point then involved; but it has several times been distinguished, and as a general proposition can certainly not'be sustained. The modern cases do not presume that the applicant knows what common experience has taught us that he does not know, but they treat him as a stranger to the company until the contract is made and until membership is thus acquired (Ins. Co. v. Woodworth, <a href="/pa/83/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="83 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1050820" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0223-01">83 Pa. 223</a>; Eilenberger v. Ins.

Co. v. Staats, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Pennyp.%20319" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Pennyp. 319">4 Penny. 319</a>.

      <em>“ </em>[In the case before us the company had the lawful power to make two kinds of contracts ; one assessable, and the other non-assessable.

It is not a case stated, however, but is a mere agreement concerning the evidence which was intended to bring certain facts to our attention during the trial, but which left us free to draw, or to notice, any proper inferences therefrom. It is quite true that no direct evidence in the case affirms that the defendant was ignorant of the by-laws at the time the contract was made, but in our opinion there is a presumption or an inference of fact that he had no knowledge of the by-laws, which continues until such knowledge is established by satisfactory evidence.</p>

    <p id="b669-5" data-blocks='[["BL_669.9",669,[176,1481,1167,658]]]'>Our examination of this record discloses no substantial error in the court’s findings of fact or conclusions of law. In the latter, it is virtually held, inter alia, that the policy executed by the company and accepted by the defendant was non-assessable and defendant having paid all that was required by the terms of his contract, neither the company nor the receiver had any further claim on him. This conclusion, we think, was fully warranted, and is of itself conclusive of defendant’s right to judgment. These and other questions presented by the specifications of error have been so fully considered by the learned trial judge that little, if anything, can be added to what has been so well said in his opinion, and, for reasons there given at length, we think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>
